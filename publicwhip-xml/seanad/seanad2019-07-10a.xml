In that time, I was involved in any amount of housing grant applications.  Although one did not always get the desired outcome, I never came up against a case as unfair and inexplicable as this one.  I do not say that lightly and, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, neither am I in the habit of tabling Commencement matters on individual issues such as this.  The Minister of State's office has been advised of the particular and unique circumstances surrounding the application.  It is my hope that he will see how shabbily the lady in question and her loving and supporting family have been treated and that he will, even at this belated stage, intervene.</p> <p>The Government and everyone else in these Houses know full well that we are in a crisis as far as public housing is concerned.  The programme for Government sets as a high priority people who make a genuine attempt to house themselves, and rightly so.  Far too many go for the easy option of putting their names on a housing list and waiting until someone comes along and hands them the keys.  Many will refuse the first or second houses on offer for any variety of reasons until they get exactly what they want.  Their houses will be fully furnished and equipped and, for the rest of their days, they will be will be maintained to the highest possible standard and the people to whom I refer will never be burdened with worries about mortgage.  In the meantime while they wait, the State will assist them with all necessary supports, including rent allowance and income supplements.  We all know what a burden that is placing on the Exchequer and how it perpetuates an unending cycle where demand will always exceed supply.</p> <p>The lady in question chose another route - a more difficult and unselfish route.  With tremendous support, financial and otherwise, from her devoted parents and siblings, she went about housing herself.  She was fortunate enough to secure a suitable house adjacent to her family home.  For reasons that I will not put on the record but that are known to the Department, this was crucial, because her personal circumstances made proximity to her parents essential to her being able to achieve independent, stress-free living.  The house was purchased through a combination of family support and borrowing.  It is a wonderful listed building and she has restored it to its former beauty completely in line with Kerry County Council's regulations, which were stringent.  Prior to that, the building had become an eyesore in a lovely town that, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows, was this year's overall TidyTowns winner.</p> <p>The story of this application for State funding makes for sad and disappointing reading.  What was sought was recognition for her efforts and the fact that, instead of being a lifelong burden on the State, she just got on with the job of housing herself.  She would have been a very high priority for local authority housing at God knows what cost in perpetuity, but no.  She received a grant from Kerry County Council that would be deemed meagre under any circumstances, never mind in the context of her particular life history.  I have been involved in facilitating grants for housing renovations paid out to some of the State's wealthiest citizens, people for whom the grant was just a welcome bonus and not a necessity.  They were entitled to it and they got it, but that is not the point.  I have worked with the officials and staff of Kerry County Council my whole life.  No one admires them more.  They are helpful and diligent at all times, but in this case something seems to have gone radically wrong.  This has given rise to disappointment on my part in our local government system, with which I have been involved all my life.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State set an example?  He has reply that was prepared by civil servants but it is time that people in his position stand up and reward those who, like this young woman, want to help themselves.  He should find a way to address her case and afford her and her family some much-needed financial relief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#B01000"><p>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for raising this case.  I also thank him for his honest appraisal of the housing situation and how, despite being potentially complicated, it can work in many cases and help people who choose a different route and try to help themselves.  There are systems and processes in place and it is important that we try to work within them.  That works two ways, of course, and everyone on both sides must play his or her part.  The Senator has given an honest description of the complications encountered in trying to house people.  While there is still a major housing shortage, a great deal of progress has been made in every county, including Kerry, where the county council is meeting its targets, delivering many new houses, buying and refurbishing many more and bringing others back into use.  There are many solutions.  In every debate on housing in this and the Lower House, I stress that there is more than one solution and approach to the question of social housing, for example, purchasing, new builds, Part V, leasing, voids being repaired and brought back into use, the repair and leasing scheme, and the buy and renew scheme.  There are many schemes, and I am glad that the majority of councils are beginning to avail of them.  That is what we want to do, but it means that we will have to adapt our ways as we see different and better solutions.  If they accommodate people, we will attempt them.</p> <p>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for raising this case and giving me the opportunity to provide an update insofar as my Department is concerned.  A representation regarding the case was received from the Senator and acknowledged by our Department in February.  There has been ongoing consultation since then between departmental officials and Kerry County Council on this and many other cases.  Where it makes sense and represents good value, every local authority is encouraged to acquire houses.  Sometimes, people approach me about other issues, but I wanted to be clear on that point.</p> <p>It is important that I indicate for the record that the detailed administration of the housing adaptation grants, including the assessment, approval and payment of individual grants to applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  While officials at my Department oversee the national budget for this programme - we have increased the budget in recent years, including for this year - and work with our local authorities to ensure all funding is spent effectively and the grants are implemented fairly and consistently, it is logical that the local authorities make decisions locally, based on the guidelines set nationally, and use their local knowledge of individual applicants and their personal circumstances.  As a former councillor, Senator O'Sullivan will have tried to intervene down the years and bridge the information gap so that decision makers were not missing facts about cases.</p> <p>In this particular case, Kerry County Council assessed the proposal as a derelict cottage in need of significant reconstruction and funding of &euro;13,775 was awarded in October 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The approach the council took in this case is in accordance with the guidelines.  However, the Department always emphasises to local authorities that they should make the best judgment in each case commensurate with the level of need and the circumstances of the applicant within the guidelines.</p><p>My Department raised this case with Kerry County Council, which agreed to revisit the application to consider other possible approaches to assessing the grant application concerned while remaining within the guidelines.  There is some challenge and complexity to the case.  The Senator referred to the purchase of a property, which can complicate application for certain grants because there are processes to be followed.  Everyone had the best of intentions in respect of the case, but matters can sometimes become a little complicated.  In the circumstances and based on the discussions between the council and my Department, I can assure the Senator that council officials will contact the applicant shortly to look at an alternative way to assess the housing adaptation grant application and see if there is a way to achieve a higher level of support.</p><p>The Senator outlined the details of the case and the amount of funding required.  He will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the precise outcome, given that decisions on applications of this kind are a matter for the local authority and not my responsibility.  I am not allowed to intervene on any particular case and do not have the power to so do.  I assure him that the objective is to bring about the fairest possible outcome for the applicant and recognise the reality of the situation.  I trust that the prospect of a better outcome will satisfy the Senator for now, while allowing time for the council to re-examine the application.  I recognise his work on this matter in recent months.  I trust also that the follow-up by the council directly with the applicant will take place shortly such that the matter can be brought to a more satisfactory conclusion.  There are many solutions to housing.  Houses often need to be adapted because the residents may be of various ages and abilities.  We try to facilitate that as we want to make the best use of our housing stock.</p><p>I know Listowel quite well.  The Senator referred to it as a lovely town and clarified that the house in question is a listed building.  The town was recognised at the national Tidy Towns awards and I am aware of the work done there early in the morning and late into the night by its Tidy Towns committee and many others.  The preservation of houses and restoration of buildings within the town boundaries is to be encouraged.  We try to facilitate such works through the many grants that are available.  The grant in this instance is very often used to fund the adaptation of a house and is not essentially designed to be used for restoration.  However, we try to encourage the usage of grants for various purposes.  They are there to help people.  We will continue to increase the number of adaption grants made available in the years ahead.</p></speech>

The latter is a town in north County Dublin with a population of approximately 8,000.  I am one of the people who live there.  Donabate is expanding rapidly, with a significant amount of construction taking place.  There is planning permission for 900 homes, with many hundreds more to come.</p> <p>Last year, the Government announced plans for a new 16-classroom primary school for Donabate to open in September 2020.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, previously confirmed that the patronage of the school will be decided through a patronage process in consultation with patronage bodies and parents living in Donabate.  This will allow the parents of the area to give their preference on school patronage.  The three excellent primary schools in the town are an Educate Together school, a girls' Catholic school and a boys' Catholic school.  There is significant demand for a new school, given the level of construction and the growing and very young population in the area.</p> <p>The Minister previously confirmed that the patronage process would begin well in advance of the school year.  September is rapidly approaching, as is the beginning of the school year.  It is very important that the patronage process begin immediately because parents need time to plan and see what are the choices in the area in order to decide on their preferred schools.  It can be difficult to decide what is best for one's child and family.  In addition, parents need to prepare children for entering primary school.  It is a significant milestone.  As the mother of a child who is starting primary school in September, I know that one needs to prepare oneself and one's child for that significant transition.  The child needs to know where he or she is going to school and what will happen there.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to confirm when the patronage process for the new primary school in Donabate is due to start.</p></speech>

I will respond on behalf of the Minister who cannot be present.  It gives me the opportunity to set out for the Seanad the position with regard to the patronage process for the new primary school in Donabate, County Dublin.  As the Senator may be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, namely, 2019 to 2022, including a new 16-classroom primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Donabate school planning area.  The announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  The four-year horizon enables increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p> <p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, on the basis of a demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  The preferences of parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in respect of the outcome of the process.  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the new schools establishment group, NSEG.  Following its consideration of the Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to the Minister for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  An online patronage process system, OPPS, has been developed by the Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.  Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.</p> <p>The patronage process for the new schools to be established in 2020, including the new primary school to serve the Donabate school planning area, will commence later in 2019.  The Minister asked me to highlight that the patronage process for the remainder of the new schools will be run at a later date which will be significantly ahead of their due opening.  Updates on further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website and the Department&rsquo;s website.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The patronage process for the new schools to be established in 2020, including the new primary school to serve the Donabate school planning area, will commence later in 2019.

We need adequate school provision but also choice within that provision.

There were scheduling difficulties in the last couple of weeks in arranging for that.</p> <p>The Minister will be well aware of the motivation for tabling this Commencement matter.  The Irish Coast Guard does extremely valuable work.  The more than 700 volunteers who operate in the various Coast Guard stations around the country do vital work in supporting the emergency services.  They are available and on call 24-7, but they are not paid for doing the work as they are volunteers.  However, these people could find themselves on a search and recovery mission for days, at which point they must take leave from work.  They are using up their annual leave and in some cases are taking unpaid leave.</p> <p>Not all the 700 people are necessarily happy with the manner in which the Coast Guard does its business.  All of them are very dedicated and proud of the work they do, and the connectivity they have with the sea and with helping people is extremely admirable.  On many occasions they take their lives into their hands when they go out on both search and rescue and search and recovery missions.  My reason for tabling this matter is that every organisation has grievance mechanisms to deal with grievances and when the mechanisms in the organisations do not work there is usually an independent process as a last recourse.  People who are not satisfied they are getting a fair hearing within the structures that are available can appeal to the independent body.  Most people who are in employment are able to appeal to outside bodies.</p> <p>I am asking for a structure to be established under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport whereby the few volunteers in the Coast Guard who have grievances and who are not satisfied with the manner in which their grievances have been dealt with can appeal to an independent body overseen by the Department.  I recommend that this be established and that it be headed by a retired High Court or Circuit Court judge.  The body would also be tasked with recommending improved practices in the Coast Guard.  I also recommend that this body should look at cases which have concluded where volunteers are not satisfied with the manner in which they have been dealt with.  There has already been a case where a volunteer ended up going to court and being reinstated by the court.  We do not wish to see that type of thing.  It was reported in the media recently.</p> <p>Essentially, I wish to enhance and improve the Coast Guard and to provide a mechanism within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in which volunteers in the Coast Guard can feel confident that their grievances will be properly investigated and adjudicated.  As I said, these people are volunteers and are not paid.  That is a separate issue and I believe the country must examine that.  In this case, however, it is only reasonable that there would be an independent structure to which they could appeal, and that this independent structure would look at previous cases as well.  It is something that must happen and I urge the Minister to make it happen.</p></speech>

He is second to none in his respect and advocacy for the Coast Guard.  I salute the Coast Guard and the work it does.  We both want to see any grievances in the Coast Guard resolved in a way that is satisfactory, independent and fair.  We have met on many occasions to discuss this issue with the Irish Coast Guard.  On at least one occasion we met Bernard Lucas, the widower of Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas who died in a tragedy.  That was a particularly moving meeting and I hope the response I give today will be well received by him as well.</p> <p>Senator Conway has raised the concerns of a number of Coast Guard volunteers that existing procedures for handling grievances need to be improved.  The proposal to establish an independent body to deal with such grievances has been raised by the Senator.  To be clear, the number of grievance cases currently stands at three.  This represents less than 0.5% of the total volunteer cadre.  That is not to demean them in any way but just to point out that any response should be proportionate.  It is not in any way to denigrate the grievances or to make a judgment on them.  I wish to look closer at the manner in which grievances are currently managed in the Coast Guard.  The relevant key documents involving volunteers are the Irish Coast Guard code and the grievance and complaints procedures.</p> <p>Last year, the Coast Guard completed a review of the code.  It includes sections on performance management, disciplinary procedure and a positive volunteering environment.  This review was conducted with independent expert input from a human resources consultancy to ensure that the Coast Guard's processes were fair and fit for purpose for an organisation of its type.  The review also involved a consultation process with the volunteers which was managed through the coastal unit advisory group.  This group is a representative structure for the volunteers made up of six members elected by the units independently of full-time staff in the Coast Guard.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The HR consultants recommended various modifications and a revised code was published late last year.  These independent experts confirmed that the code represented good practice, particularly given the voluntary nature of those involved. </p><p>In terms of grievances, all volunteers have access to a process to address issues about any aspect of their volunteer duties or how they are managed.  Volunteers who are unhappy in their role or have a grievance they wish to discuss may approach their designated line manager or where they do not wish to go that route, they can escalate their grievance to their coastal unit sectoral manager.  These are full-time staff in the Coast Guard.  The matter is dealt with in a private manner and in line with the Coast Guard's human resources standards.  Various checks are in place to ensure that where one or other party is not happy with how a grievance is being handled, he or she has recourse to independent mediation.</p><p>In terms of the independence of human resources processes within the Irish Coast Guard, the existing system has been enhanced over the past six months.  As mentioned, a human resources company has been procured to provide reassurance about the procedures and offer the aforementioned independent mediation, where requested.  This ensures a sufficient level of independence within the existing system proportionate to the level of grievances.  The Coast Guard management accepts that the new code will take time to bed down and, to this end, training is being organised at all levels throughout the organisation, including for volunteers.  The Coast Guard is also committed to reviewing its code on a regular basis.  In looking to further improve the system, the Coast Guard has recently created an additional external review process for volunteer grievance investigations, disciplinary and appeal processes.  This policy has been developed in the interests of ensuring that the principles of natural justice are upheld for volunteers involved in grievance investigations, disciplinary and-or appeal processes.  Under this new policy, the intention is to allow for a further external review of a case, whether grievance, disciplinary or appeal, to be conducted by a competent third party, most likely a HR company.  Its focus will be to determine whether procedures were followed correctly.  Such a review would be triggered where all other internal review options have been pursued.  A volunteer who requests such a review would, naturally, be informed of the outcome of the review and relevant findings.  Effectively, this new process will, hopefully, ensure a final independent arbitration relating to grievance and other processes or seen under the code.</p><p>The Coast Guard remains a vital component in our search and rescue service.  I reassure Senator Conway that its interests are at the core of the significant transformation that is taking place in the search and rescue system.</p></speech>

I may raise this matter again in September once I have engaged with volunteers to check if they are satisfied.  It is good that an external company or human resources expert has been retained to consider future grievances.  The fact that there are three formal grievance cases does not mean that other members of the Coast Guard who have not triggered formal complaints are happy and would not like to see the current system strengthened.  I request the Minister to instruct the Coast Guard to have the independent external body review all grievance cases closed in recent years to see if correct procedures were followed and make recommendations.  I welcome the use of an external body and it is a step in the right direction.  To be fair, however, the external body should be asked to review all grievances that have arisen in recent years.</p></speech>

The medicine is used to treat advanced Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 12,000 people in Ireland.  The uncertainty around the availability of this treatment option for people with advanced Parkinson's first arose in June 2018.  At that time, there was an expectation that certainty of supply would be achieved within three to four months.  In cases where patients were in critical need of this medicine it was made available through an access programme provided by AbbVie, the company that manufactures the medicine.  However, as of 30 April of this year, this route is no longer available to patients or treating consultant neurologists.  I understand that 81 patients were treated under this programme.  The 82nd patient and subsequent patients will be denied access to the treatment.  One such patient is a man from Cork who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the age of 30.  He is now married with young children and is still in his 30s.  He is significantly affected by his condition and urgently needs to be treated with Duodopa now, not in one month or two months, to ensure he does not miss the window of opportunity during which the treatment can have its maximum benefit for him, as a patient who is suffering unnecessarily.  </p> <p>Last week, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, stated on its website that the health technology assessment, HTA, for Duodopa had been completed, which is one year after the reimbursement ceased.  The issue needs immediate attention.  I ask the Minister of State and her ministerial colleagues to lend their support to ensuring this matter is expedited to ensure reimbursement for this medicine and equitable access to it.  People should not have to travel to the UK and beyond to access the deep brain stimulation, DBS, services as some people have been forced to do.  The Minister of State knows that Duodopa is a proven and tested product.  The positive impact it can have on patients and their carers is immeasurable.  Combining a  specialist nurse service with this treatment will keep patients out of hospital and, therefore, money is saved and space in hospitals is freed up. </p> <p>The costs of every other medicine for Parkinson's disease are covered.  Why is Duodopa not covered?  Patients do not opt for the treatment without first giving it great consideration and when it is not critically needed.  However, when it becomes necessary for patients to access this treatment, they must be able to do so.  The Minister of State will be aware of the procedure involved in taking this medicine.  The treatment requires the medicine to be administered through a patient's intestine and is unpleasant.  When there is no other option, however, this treatment becomes necessary.  We urgently need a timeline or date for when we can expect to see a long overdue decision on Duodopa.  There are a number of patients for whom this medicine provides a lifeline and constitutes their only sense of hope.  The matter is, therefore, urgent.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister for Health cannot be here, so I will take this opportunity to clarify his position on the availability of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel, LCIG, for patients with advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  As the Senator may know, the HSE has been given statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions by the Oireachtas, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  That Act specifies criteria for decisions on whether the State will reimburse medicines, a statutory process in which the Minister for Health has no role.  The HSE's decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments, HTAs, for the HSE, and then makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug&rsquo;s clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant moneys involved, it must ensure the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro ongoing investments.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p> <p>On 14 June 2019, the NCPE completed an HTA on LCIG for patients with advanced Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  The NCPE recommended that LCIG should not be considered for reimbursement, unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.  That recommendation is available on the NCPE website.  The HSE&rsquo;s final decision on reimbursement will take the statutory criteria in the 2013 Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act into consideration.  Under an interim agreement between the HSE and the manufacturer, dating back to 2014, the HSE has agreed to fund this drug for up to 81 patients.  The manufacturer agreed to fund the treatment of any new patients above that cap through a medical access programme.  This interim agreement was dependent on the manufacturer delivering two things, namely, additional clinical evidence and a new HTA dossier to enable the NCPE to complete a full HTA on this product.  However, the HSE has informed the Department that the manufacturer has unilaterally set aside this agreement.  Furthermore, the company announced that it would not be enrolling any new patients in the free of charge access programme after 30 April 2019, which the Senator has already mentioned.  The manufacturer stated that it would continue to provide the drug free of charge to patients already on the access programme, which is a total of 24 patients.  I want to make it clear to the Senator that the HSE has yet to make a final decision on this reimbursement application and the statutory process is still ongoing.  </p></speech>

I ask her to ask the Minister, or the HSE directly, to sit down with the manufacturer and negotiate on the price of the drug.  I understand the processes involved, the limited resources and everything else around it.  However, can the Minister of State imagine what it must be like to be patient No. 82 in this situation?  I cited the example of the 30 year old patient earlier.  We are not playing with numbers here, but with people's lives.  If the HSE sits down with the manufacturer and works out a price, then it can be agreed, as has happened in many other cases.</p> <p>The effectiveness of the drug treatment is borne out by the fact that it is approved in other countries.  It cannot be different for an Irish person living in London or somewhere else in the UK than it is for someone living here.  We cannot force patients to go abroad.  I am no friend of drug manufacturers, and they need to decrease their prices, but we cannot expect them to continue providing treatment free of charge indefinitely either.  There has to be some fairness there.  I ask the HSE to sit down with the drug company at the earliest possible moment and negotiate the price, within weeks rather than months.  I am concerned that we are now going into the holiday period.  Is there is any way this could be done before the end of July, so that the uncertainty will be removed for these patients going into August and September?</p></speech>

He appreciates that Parkinson's disease is a debilitating condition and that it is a worrying time for patients, families and carers.  While the Minister hopes this application will shortly come to a satisfactory conclusion for all concerned, it is important to note that the HSE is the decision-making body on the reimbursement of medicines, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Accordingly, the HSE alone will make the final decision on whether LCIG will be reimbursed.  However, I will bring Senator Conway-Walsh's question back to the Minister and will ask him to contact the HSE to see if the decision on this vital medication, that so many people badly need, can be made sooner rather than later.  I will bring that back to him.</p></speech>

The first relates to the amendments passed by Members of Parliament in Westminster yesterday.  They voted to extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland unless power-sharing is restored by 21 October.  They also overwhelmingly voted in favour of an amendment to liberalise abortion law in Northern Ireland.  While I very much welcome these amendments, their passage is bittersweet.  Although they represent social policies with which I agree, I still hope that the Stormont Assembly will get its act together and that the parties will come together because I would love to see these changes being implemented by the assembly in Northern Ireland.  The amendments yesterday are a significant first step in ensuring that these social changes are a priority for legislators in the Stormont Assembly.  If the assembly is not reconvened by October, these changes will be implemented in October.  It is bittersweet.  I very much welcome the changes but I would like to have seen them passed in Stormont.  I really hope that the parties, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, will come together in Stormont to debate these issues and implement these changes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The second issue relates to the HSE.  More than six months ago the HSE offered various jobs to people on its panels without issuing contracts of employment or start dates.  Some people have been left waiting for more than six months.  The people who have been recruited are calling it a recruitment freeze but the HSE is denying that.  The fact remains, however, that people were offered jobs but without contracts or start dates.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, must come to the House to explain the reason people on panels have been told they would have a job but have not been given a contract or start date.  That is very unfair.</p><p>The third issue relates to processing delays for social welfare payments by Bank of Ireland.  We learned that a technical issue has arisen with social welfare payments for people in receipt of a disability allowance and other allowances who have a Bank of Ireland account.  I ask that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection examine the cause of the glitch between the Department and the bank and that it be resolved as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Committee Stage is due to conclude today.  It has been a long journey of many hours.  I thank my colleagues who signed many of the amendments, and Senator Norris, for their contributions and time.  Despite all the allegations, complaints and suggestions of cronyism regarding the appointment of judges, to which I do not subscribe, this Administration has facilitated and supported the appointment of 48 eminent judges and capable persons.  The current system works.  We will discuss that later today.</p><p>I am prompted to make a point following commentary in <i>The Irish Times </i>today on the reappointment of Mr. Phil Hogan as European Commissioner.  The suggestion is that the decision was &quot;facilitated&quot; by the support of the Independent Alliance.  I do not know whether that is true.  However, I wish to make it very clear that under this Administration, of which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is a member of Cabinet, more than 48 eminent, qualified and suitable people have been appointed to the Judiciary.  This emphasises the point that despite all the threats by members of the Government that they might not support the appointments, all of the appointments were endorsed.  Those were the right decisions.  The persons appointed to the Judiciary are upstanding people of commitment.</p></speech>

In many cases, pensioners who only receive the State pension are still living in poverty.  I come across more and more pensioners who do not even get the State pension because of the many deductions and anomalies that apply.  I asked previously that the Minister come to the House to specifically speak about pensions because there is so much to discuss in that regard and a significant number of people who are living in poverty.  Different circumstances such as health, geographical location and carer's duties mean that the standard amount simply does not suffice for pensioners.  I previously gave the example of a pensioner who has to travel from Belmullet to Galway for a hospital appointment.  That is a six-hour round trip and it costs more than &euro;200 in a taxi.  There is no public transport.  That is the equivalent of a pension, and more than that amount, wiped out for one week.</p> <p>I am very pleased to hear that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, will consider the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill to establish a social welfare commission.  The Bill was introduced by the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for employment affairs and social protection, Deputy John Brady.  The commission would examine the minimum essential income standard for the various household types and recommend the necessary rate increases in pensions to the Minister ahead of the budget each year.  I hope we hear back from the Minister soon given that the budgetary process is well under way and that pensioner poverty is tackled once and for all.</p> <p>The Sinn F&eacute;in motion for D&aacute;il Private Members' business, which calls for a binding Oireachtas vote on the Mercosur deal, will be debated in the D&aacute;il tonight and the vote is likely to take place on Thursday afternoon.  I remind parties that this may be the only chance we have to register opposition to the deal and its detrimental impact on farming and farm families.  I remind Members who have referred to Commissioner Hogan and his new job, that he said two years ago that beef would not be on the menu for the Mercosur deal.  Beef is very firmly on the menu - 99,000 tonnes of it.  That will have a devastating impact on farming and rural communities.  The Commissioner has broken his promise to us on the issue, as has the Government.</p></speech>

It is significant because Jeff Dudgeon, for example, won a historic case - before I won mine - in the European Court of Human Rights.  The North was in advance of us at that stage and it is regrettable that this has been let lie.  Regarding abortion, 80% of the people in Northern Ireland approve of the regime that is being introduced, so there is no question of it being undemocratic.  They have had years to deal with this and they have not done so.  With regard to equal marriage, the gay pride march is enormously bigger than the Orange march in Belfast, so that tells us where people's hearts lie on this matter.</p> <p>I wish to return to something I said yesterday.  We were discussing the use of the Seanad Chamber.  I fully approve of Travellers and I have a track record in the area.  However, I do not approve of subsidiary sections dislodging the proper business of the Seanad.  The heckling from the Leader dislodged me from a point I was trying to make, namely, that one of the important points that was being debated at the time was the non-representation in the Oireachtas of the Traveller community.  I speak from experience; it took me ten years and six elections, including by-elections to get elected, because people were suspicious of me.  Travellers are a minority and, sadly, they are not universally popular.  It will take quite a while to get somebody from the Traveller community elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I strongly suggest that after the next election the Taoiseach of the day, whoever he or she is, make a deliberate decision to appoint somebody from that community as a first stage.  I have a candidate in mind, namely, Rosaleen McDonagh, who is not only a Traveller and a very effective spokeswoman for Travellers, but she is also handicapped.  She is in a wheelchair.  It would be good for this House to have somebody in a wheelchair.  We would have to listen very carefully to what that person said.  Ms McDonagh ran a number of times for a seat on the Trinity panel and she did quite well but she never got to the point where it was realistic for her to become a Senator.  She is somebody who deserves consideration to be nominated by the Taoiseach as a voice for the Traveller community in Ireland.</p></speech>

I was not in the House yesterday, but I welcome the independent report from Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill on abuse victims.  I know the former pupils of Creagh Lane as I have dealt with them for some time.  There was frustration at the length of time Mr. Justice O'Neill&rsquo;s review took but the outcome is the correct one.  It was always felt that the prior complaint condition was questionable, in that if someone was convicted of abuse in a criminal court, the prior complaint rule should not have applied under the redress board.  I welcome that such a decision has now been put in place.  I note from both what the Taoiseach said yesterday and what the Minister for Education and Skills said in the D&aacute;il today that the Minister is looking to expedite the reopening of the redress board.  I hope that will be done as quickly as possible and that the former pupils of Creagh Lane can get on with their lives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These were young pupils going to a school and what happened there should never have happened.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has apologised on behalf of the State.</p><p>The IFA had a briefing on Mercosur yesterday.  It is critical now that the standards applied to beef coming in from the Mercosur countries are the same as apply to beef being sold by Irish and other European producers.  We have 270,000 tonnes coming into the European markets from the Mercosur countries as we speak.  There is a need for a sit-down on how these standards are applied.  I understand it is based on random sampling.  It should be put back on the Mercosur producers to provide evidence that they have met the standards.  That should apply as quickly as possible.  The beef produced in Ireland in particular is of the highest standard and there cannot be any ambiguity around the fact that the quality of beef coming in from the Mercosur countries has to meet the same standards.  That is the way forward.</p></speech>

We are delighted to have them here today and I hope they have a lovely day.  Today I want to talk about the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which is a year old this month.  A most complex piece of legislation, the regulation was an attempt to unify existing legislation enacted after the 1995 directive across the European countries.  This regulation was designed to guide organisations across the EU on how to protect the personal data of each citizen.</p> <p>The Irish Data Protection Commissioner reported over 6,000 GDPR related complaints in this first year of legislation, of which approximately 90% were deemed valid.  There is massive confusion about the regulation.  There is a widespread lack of awareness, a shortage in skills across all sectors and quite a lot of enforcement of regulation without actually complying with it.  My colleagues have raised the matter previously but more and more people are coming into my clinics with issues about the regulation.  Clarity is needed going forward in order for the legislation to work for people.  The GDPR significantly strengthens the rights of individuals but it is important to know that it increases organisations' responsibility as to how they collect and use personal data.  For many organisations, there is unfamiliarity with the regulation, in some cases to a staggering degree.  People coming into my clinics are complaining that they have been denied access to their own information.  According to the regulation, everyone has the right to access to data which has been collected concerning him or her.  Others in my clinics and on social media have complained because they have received mobile phone text based direct marketing when they had not opted in to receive such texts.  There really is massive confusion.  Now that we are one year into it, I would like to see more effort being put in to making people more aware.  I appreciate that the several investigations by the data commissioner may raise such awareness but I would like to see more done in this regard.  This is huge.  It is one of the biggest issues to face Senators and Deputies.  We need to make sure people have proper information.</p></speech>

There is exceptional unrest in the beef industry.  In the last 18 months it has seen a dramatic deterioration in prices.  The proposed Mercosur deal will see an increased volume of beef coming into the European Union, which will also deflate prices.  The outlook for the beef industry for the next few months is very poor.  If we see the price decline that is predicted for the next few months, we are going to have a real, extended crisis in our industry.  The point about Mercosur is that it has come already.  The confidence is gone from the market and the suppliers.  Beef farmers who came to my clinics last week will not buy weanlings when it comes to the autumn and will not be investing in sheds or in their industry because they do not have the confidence to keep going.  That is going to become a serious issue for our suckler and beef industry.</p> <p>The Minister has been proactive in this space and has said it is a bad deal for the beef industry.  We need to start up the momentum of getting our European friends involved in the debate.  Our association with France in particular has to be built upon.  The Oireachtas, through friendship groups, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Seanad itself, has to build those connections to ensure we can win support in Europe to get this deal changed.  For this to happen, everyone here has to be involved.  The Seanad should send a delegation to France and should become a real catalyst of change to ensure we can get those doors opened.  We will not change it all by ourselves and it needs to be changed.  The confidence of our beef farmers is drained out of their veins in the last few months.  This has been the final kick.  We need to move into a different space, build alliances and get change.  With that, hopefully, we can get what the beef sector requires.  Nor is it just about beef.  The poultry sector will be decimated and will have no hope if the proposed margin of poultry product comes into the EU.  It is about fighting for this section of society and it is about an agricultural split.  Dairy will survive but the beef, pig and poultry industries need a change in this deal, otherwise they will be on a slippery slope, and confidence is at rock bottom at the moment.</p></speech>

It is the largest farm in the country.  This estate was purchased by Glenmore Estate in 2017 and earlier this year <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that it was estimated that hundreds of trees including ash, sycamore, birch, whitebeam and willow, had been destroyed and miles of hedgerows torn out on this farm.  The matter has been raised with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This massive estate borders an internationally renowned bird and wildlife sanctuary.  Right now it is subject to an ongoing  Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine investigation.  The wider community is outraged by the dramatic change to the landscape in a much loved area.</p><p>Recent developments have turned concern into absolute outrage.  The owners of this farm operate an anaerobic digester and one of the by-products of this is digestate, which is spread on the land.  Rural people who live in these areas are used to slurry spreading and farming practices going back as far as anybody can remember.  They are not people who would have any difficulty with that.  However, the smell of ammonia is just an assault on a large area of south Inishowen.  Apparently our current legislation is allowing this to happen.  We would expect the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and Donegal County Council to defend the interests of the community.  A confirmation day was totally ruined in the local hotel because the smell was utterly overwhelming and suffocating.  We had a situation recently where somebody was holding a wake for their loved one and the house was overcome.  Everybody's home is devastated by the smell.  There is need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to be made aware of the serious and profound problems that have arisen.  There is a need for legislative change.  The Ministers have to pull together with the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Donegal County Council to solve this problem on behalf of the local community and hold this business to account for what is an assault.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2321"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2321&amp;amp;pid=PadraigMacLochlainn&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It might be technically legal to do what they are doing but it is utterly unethical to do what they are doing right now and it has to stop.</p></speech>

No doubt we will see him get a big portfolio in the coming reshuffle of Commissioners.  We wish him well in that.  The better the portfolio, the better for Ireland.  Commissioner Hogan will have the interests of Ireland at heart.</p> <p>I wish to be associated with the comments that have been made in respect of the Mercosur deal.  I call for a debate on the issue either  today or tomorrow.  If we cannot have it on either day , I hope it can proceed when the House returns in September.  Many issues arise from the deal.  One is the original 275,000 tonnes of beef already coming into Europe.  How much of that is coming to Ireland?  Reference was made to the poultry industry.  As previous speakers indicated, the deal will have devastating effects on our beef and poultry sectors and on the pig industry as well.  It is important that we have a debate on the issue in early September at the latest.  There are many issues involved and many aspects to the Mercosur deal.  There are pros and cons.  I hope that we will have an early debate on the matter.</p> <p>I welcome the developments at Dublin Port and the proposed expansion and extension thereof.  I have raised this issue on several occasions.  Dublin Port is highly important to Ireland.  The port does not operate on a 24-hour basis and there are difficulties with that.  Maybe the expansion envisaged will help that.  A &euro;1 billion plan is envisaged for the port and a planning application has been lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I hope these plans will come to fruition in the not-too-distant future and that Dublin Port goes ahead with them.  It is vital that Dublin Port works efficiently and effectively.  Dublin Port has indicated that it will not take any cruise ships this year.  Cruise ships are important not only to the city of Dublin but also to the country as a whole.  The sector is not putting any pressure on bed nights in Dublin or anything like that because most of the people stay on board.  This would be a major loss to the State and the Exchequer.  I welcome the plans put forward by Dublin Port.  Perhaps the issue could be debated in the Chamber in the not-too-distant future as well.</p></speech>

Representatives from the association informed us how Irish farmers are terrified at the potential consequences for the future of farming here and, by extension, the future of rural Ireland.  Today, the Beef Plan movement is holding a protest outside the gates of Leinster House to highlight concerns relating to this deal, the consequences for the future of Irish farming and the future of rural Ireland as we know it.  They are saying to us that the deal is a complete disaster.  They say it is bad for Irish farming and for the environment.</p> <p>Those of us who live in the Border region already have enough on our plates.  I imagine the Leader would agree with me.  The dark cloud of Brexit hangs over and it is already affecting economic life around the Border counties as we know it.  There has been much talk about the extra 99,000 tonnes of beef that will come into the EU but less talk about the extra 180,000 tonnes of chicken or poultry that will come into the country as a result of this deal.  As the Leader will appreciate, this could have grave consequences for the Border community.  As Senators are aware, Monaghan and Cavan are home to the poultry industry.  If this deal is to go ahead as presented, it will have grave consequences indeed for the communities of Monaghan and Cavan.  Echoing the call of the Leader's colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, I request a debate on this matter as soon as possible.  I appeal to the Leader to pass on our grave concerns to Government.  This deal cannot and should not go ahead as presented.  Otherwise, it will wipe out farming and, by extension, rural Ireland as we know it.</p></speech>

Mr. McGinn secured an amendment to ensure that same-sex marriage would be introduced in Northern Ireland unless power sharing is restored in October.  He is a great friend of Ireland.  He is chair of the all&ndash;party parliamentary group on the Irish in Britain and he is involved in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  This is really positive and can help to restore power sharing in Stormont in Northern Ireland.  This is a major move.  I wish to thank all the MPs who voted for this.

This morning, as we speak, outside Leinster House a large demonstration is gathering to express fears and concerns from the farming industry about the uncertainty that the deal presents and the negative consequences that may result.</p><p>Yesterday, I listened to the Joint Committee on Agriculture Food and the Marine discuss the merits of afforestation and the replanting of trees in order to address climate change and meet some of our obligations.  It is with this in mind that I prefer to speak on a positive note rather than focus on negatives.  It is timely that we are having this discussion because only a few days ago a report was published in <i>Science </i>by Professor John Crowther, a professor in environmental systems science at Eidgen&ouml;ssische Technische Hochschule Z&uuml;rich in Switzerland.  At Queens University Belfast, we work with this university on a regular basis as partners in a European food project called EIT Food.  Professor Crowther states that planting billions of trees is our best chance of saving the planet.  He claims there is room on earth to plant 1.2 trillion extra trees and cut our carbon footprint by 66%.  I am of the view that the claims are valid.  Professor Crowther states, &quot;This new quantitative evaluation shows [forest] restoration isn't just one of our climate change solutions, it is overwhelmingly the top one&quot;.  The researchers believe that a worldwide programme could remove two thirds of all emissions pumped into the atmosphere by humans.  They have calculated that 1.7 billion ha of land on which trees are not currently growing could support trees naturally.  This equates to an area roughly the size of the US and China combined.  They took into account that different areas would support different densities of trees and they excluded urban areas and all fields currently used to grow crops.  Furthermore, grazing land was calculated as supporting a few trees, something that would actually be beneficial to cattle and sheep.</p><p>This works clearly demonstrates that people do not need to start believing in climate change or change their lifestyles.  It does not require major advances in science or technology.  It simply involves citizens engaging to support, donate, assist or facilitate the planting of trees.  Many world-renowned scientists support this theory, as well as the idea that national governments should have this as a primary component of any plans to deal with climate change.  Ren&eacute; Castro, assistant director general at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, as stated, &quot;We now have definitive evidence of the potential land area for re-growing forests, where they could exist and how much carbon they could store.&quot;  Initial estimates suggest that a global cost of $300 million would restore over 1 trillion trees.  This is by far the cheapest option yet proposed.</p><p>We need to consider how the men and women on the street today outside Leinster House can contribute and be rewarded for doing so.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ian Marshall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2486"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2486&amp;amp;pid=IanMarshall&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Telling a farmer to plant a forest is akin to telling people in Dublin to build a house in their garden that they cannot sell for 40 years.  It would not happen.  All of us need to acknowledge the difficulties and the sensitivities this would present.  However, agriforestry on grazing land, utilising corners of fields and strips of low production value land, could be an option.  I refer to forestry in harmony with grazing livestock.  All of us could identify such areas.</p><p>Sometimes the "keep it simple, stupid", KISS, theory works best.  That is the theory we probably need to examine.  I urge the Government, in conjunction with farmers in the agricultural industry, to consider some of these solutions to our problems, pursue mechanisms to meet targets, deliver on climate change and, ultimately, give farmers a viable, sustainable future, especially in light of an EU-Mercosur deal.</p></speech>

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Act 2015 established several new legal provisions to address issues of consent and capacity in the provision of healthcare treatments.  One such provision was the statutory right to develop and have respected, as practicable, advance healthcare directives where a person specified the action to be taken and the decisions to be made in the future while he or she had capacity.  All of us would agree that is an important human rights issue.  The difficulty, and what this Bill addresses, is the involuntary detention of patients where that is not recognised.  If one is involuntarily detained that does not mean one does not have capacity.</p> <p>I welcome representatives of Mental Health Reform, who are in the Gallery.  They worked closely on this Bill with the assistance of Deputy Pat Buckley.</p> <p>In terms of human rights, we have come a long way along the road to enlightenment from the time of the lunacy Act when everything was taken from people, not just their liberty but their ability to speak, make decisions and have capacity to do what they wanted to do.  This Bill will move us further along the road to enlightenment in that regard.  I would be delighted if the Leader would accept my amendment - nobody will create any hassle over it - and allow this Bill to progress through this House and become legislation.</p></speech>

It will highlight the plight of the salmon leaving the River Shannon and heading towards Greenland.  I raise this issue because it is a wonderful project which was done under an educational scheme.  People across the community - artists, educationalists and craftspeople - came together and showed each other the craft of making the boat by hand.</p><p>We had the <i>Asgard</i>project in the past, which was involved in sail training.  I sailed on the <i>Asgard</i>; I was a watch leader.  It is time we considered bringing back something like the <i>Asgard</i>, a sail training ship, because many youths across the country, both North and South, received very worthwhile training when they were on the <i>Asgard</i>.  I ask the Leader to bring this issue to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

The clean air strategy will come out later this year but clean air is not only an issue for Dublin.  Smoky coal is still used in towns and cities where it has not been banned.  We have been waiting a considerable period of time for that to be addressed.  We are aware of the health constraints, especially in respect of older people, and premature deaths due to polluted air.  Children in inner city communities are affected in terms of high rates of asthma from polluted air.  All these issues relate to dirty diesel, which is a real problem in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Diesel double decker buses will not come off our streets until 2030.  We need short-term as well as long-term action.  The clean air strategy is very much a long-term strategy.  I am looking for action to be taken now.  I am not talking about action being taken only in Dublin.  I want to see real-time air quality indicator visual maps in our most polluted cities and towns where the general public can see online the quality of the air within their cities and towns.  That, in itself, will put pressure on the Government to move quickly in respect of this issue.</p> <p>Senator Marshall spoke about tree planting.  That has a real effect but there is also an effect in respect of hedges.  In Birmingham, it has been proved that where hedges are planted close to roads it breaks up the pollutant at an early stage and stops the effects up to 30 m away.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to arrange for a constructive debate on this issue early in the autumn to discuss new ideas and how we can clear the air in our towns and cities by banning smoky coal and start removing diesel cars, buses and lorries in areas with a high concentration of older people and young children in particular.  I know the Leader will try to facilitate that request as soon as he can in the autumn.</p></speech>

I am aware of inner city flat complexes where morning, noon and night residents are plagued by rats and when they complain they are passed off between Dublin City Council and the Health Service Executive.  Yesterday, a lady explained that she left for work in her car and when she got there her engine had seized because rats had climbed up into the engine.  Her car was destroyed.  She will have to carry that cost, which will be very difficult.</p> <p>For people living in inner city homes, and I know Senator Devine has this issue also, this problem must be addressed.  We cannot ask families to live in rat-infested areas.  I know this issue is disturbing, and I am using the excuse of what happened in the House to raise it, but families are living in those circumstances in cities and towns.  We need a strategy because there has been a growth in the number of reports of rat infestation in cities and towns.</p></speech>

Those were the chilling words used by Ms Justice Nathalie Lieven in a British court recently justifying her decision to force a mentally disabled woman to abort her late-term child of 22 weeks in the womb in violation of her wishes and indeed the wishes of her mother, her legal advisers and a social worker.  Her mother was willing to care for the child.  Thankfully, that decision was overturned on appeal but Ms Justice Lieven, who had been an advocate for bodies supporting abortion prior to her life on the Bench, described the Northern Irish law, which protects mothers' lives and unborn children, as torture.  I would encourage Senator Ardagh, respectfully, in light of that very recent chilling example of what the British law can amount to, to think about whether it is a matter of sweetness that the British Parliament should threaten to impose an extreme abortion law on Northern Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is neither patriotic nor wise to be happy about the British Parliament imposing or threatening to impose any laws, especially on socially sensitive areas in a jurisdiction such as Northern Ireland.

I raised the case of the Hyde family recently.  They moved to Australia and their application for permanent residency was denied because their child had been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.  That incredible decision was thankfully reversed as a result of a last minute intervention by the immigration Minister in Australia and the family will be allowed to remain after all.  While that is a great outcome, certain concerns about the case remain.  One is the media blackout about this case in Ireland.  If Donald Trump's America had refused a visa to a child with cystic fibrosis, we would rightly be talking about it continually.  I am concerned about what I see as the hands-off position taken by the Government on this issue.  When I raised it as a Commencement matter, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said that it would not be possible for the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the visa procedures applied by other sovereign states.  That is a curious statement when we rightly, constantly, pass comment on American procedures and our Government rightly expends time, money and manpower on actively lobbying the Americans to change their visa procedures and laws.  If one was a cynic, one would conclude that the Irish lobby in the US is large, well-funded and regularly wines and dines the leadership of the largest political parties.  No such lobby exists in other countries.</p><p>I ask the Leader to agree that it is not acceptable for the State to take a hands-off approach to issues which affect its citizens, neither in ordinary situations nor <i>a fortiori</i>when there is a child with cystic fibrosis who, for a time, appeared to be at the receiving end of a harsh decision.  As a State, our policy should be to assist the best possible outcomes for Irish families so that they can live, prosper and contribute to whatever society they want to live in, all things being equal.  There should never be any discrimination on the grounds of a family member's disability of any kind.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in's National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017 continues to progress in the D&aacute;il.  I record my disappointment that Fine Gael opposes a legal right to tips for hospitality workers.  The issues in the hospitality sector go beyond that.  I refer to the Workplace Relations Commission's reports for the last three years.  Some 48% of the food and drink sector was rated non-compliant with basic employment law in 2016, with 58% non-compliance in 2017, and 67% non-compliance in 2018.  In other words, the majority of our restaurants and hotels are not compliant with basic law such as issuing a work contract, complying with the National Minimum Wage Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act and the Payment of Wages Act.  The standards in this sector are shocking.</p> <p>I refer specifically to Limerick.  Limerick City and County Council provides hundreds of thousands of euro each year to two hotels, the Strand Hotel and Savoy Hotel, neither of which recognise trade unions.  Is it not time that we as a country decide, when we are going to award taxpayers' money, that we at least insist on a level of decency?  We should call on those hotels to recognise the rights of their staff to join a trade union and be recognised as trade union members.  This has gone on for far too long and the Workplace Relations Commission's evidence shows that it gets worse each year.  A 67% rate of non-compliance with basic employment law is not good enough.  We need a debate on the matter and we need politicians across all parties to act on this issue.</p></speech>

I had a communication this morning from a member of the public who is concerned about the contributory old age pension.  Every year, the Minister announces increases in social welfare benefits.  Generally speaking, we hear that pensions were increased by &euro;5.  Since 2012, six streams have been introduced in the pension scheme based on the number of contributions that one has paid.  This member of the public has set out for me the pension rates in 2018, starting at &euro;243.30 and working down to &euro;97.20.  The Minister has announced a &euro;5 increase in the pension but it is <i>pro rata</i>for the contributory pension while it is not <i>pro rata</i>for the non-contributory pension.  The person on the bottom of the scale, with an average of ten to 14 contributions, would have got a pension of &euro;97.20 in 2018 and, following the 2019 budget, an increase to &euro;99.20, which is not an increase of &euro;5.  If nothing else, when the Minister addresses it in October, we should clarify the language that is used, since &euro;5 is not being given across the board, but a <i>pro rata</i>increase for people on a contributory pension.  A man has put together a very genuine case, which I will forward to the Leader's office today, and he might forward it to the Minister.  It causes him and many of his neighbours who are on contributory pensions a great deal of distress.  Some &euro;5 is a lot of money if one is trying to live on &euro;200 a week, and it is an awful lot if one is trying to live on &euro;97 and only gets a &euro;2 increase.  I will forward that information to the Leader and, if needs be, we can have a Commencement debate in the early part of the new session.</p></speech>

Staff in Moneypoint are currently engaging with management and their unions about job losses.  It is quite serious.  What will happen in the future to Moneypoint?  The ESB has committed to coal burning there until 2025 but much more importantly, what will happen post 2025?  The Minister will have eight or nine weeks over the summer to prepare for this debate and I encourage the Leader to facilitate it.</p> <p>I was at a briefing in Buswells, hosted by a former colleague, Averil Power, who is now CEO of the Irish Cancer Society.  If Members have not been there already, I encourage them to go there.  While we have achieved much related to cancer care, especially with the centres of excellence and the fact that so many people survive cancer, there are still many challenges.  Some of the requests the Irish Cancer Society has in its pre-budget submission are very reasonable.  One is a reduction to a &euro;100 limit for people under the drugs payment scheme.  It is looking for an upgrade to and moving forward of trials, the people covered and the funding available.  As we will all have experienced in our offices, it is critical that when people are diagnosed with cancer, a more lenient approach should be taken by the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, when allocating medical cards for treatment.  It is extremely traumatic and distressing for a person to have cancer and the last thing that he or she should be worried about is whether he or she will get a medical card.  In the upcoming budget in October, the Minister needs to do something to make it easier and more flexible for medical cards to be provided to people who are diagnosed with cancer.</p></speech>

That debate must include a discussion on procurement.  The Exchequer will spend some &euro;100 billion in the next five years on public procurement, of which SMEs will receive approximately 3% to 4% in value terms.  If we could double that allocation, it would make a huge difference to SMEs and to the whole economy.  The procurement process must be totally overhauled.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on that issue?  Ireland is 12th in Europe when it comes to SME share of Government contracts.  The contracts these companies do get are small, with none securing a project worth more than &euro;300,000.  The percentage of SMEs tendering in this country is much smaller than is the case in any other country in Europe, where they secure three times as many contracts as Irish SMEs do here.  It is an issue that requires serious examination.  We have great SMEs that are run by passionate people.  We need to give them a fair crack of the whip.  The last thing they want is an advantage or privilege, but they must have a fair chance.  I thank the Leader and the Cathaoirleach for all the support they have given me in my role as rapporteur for the report on the SME sector.</p></speech>

Senator Ardagh had every entitlement to come into the House today and give her view on this matter, as did Senator Mullen.  To be fair to Senator Ardagh, she has long been a champion of equality and women's reproductive rights.  Senator Mullen has a different viewpoint.  The UK Parliament has now taken a decision on these issues as they operate in the North, as did the Irish people in respect of this State.  There are people in the North today celebrating the granting of marriage equality, which was previously denied to them.  Ironically, this comes at a time when there is a lacuna of representation in Stormont.  We all recognise the need to have the Assembly back up and running as soon as possible.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh referred to jobs in the HSE.  I do not have the answers to her questions.  I do find commonality with her point that if a person is given a job and the relevant process is followed from A to Z, it should not take an inordinate amount of time to implement that appointment.  Every contract takes a period to be issued, but we need to look at the delays the Senator highlighted.  The HSE has been recruiting staff in the first quarter of this year and it is my understanding that there is no public sector freeze on recruitment.  If Senator Ardagh has an issue concerning a particular individual, she should take it up with the Minister, or I can convey her concerns to him.</p> <p>I agree with the Senator that the delays on the part of Bank of Ireland in processing social welfare payments are not acceptable.  They place a significant burden and strain on people waiting for those payments.</p> <p>Later today, after a further two hours of discussion, we will have completed 102 hours of debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  I will say no more on that other than to point Senators to what is proposed in the Order of Business.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh referred to poverty among pensioners.  To be fair, the Government has done more than its predecessors in respect of the restoration of social protection payments to elderly people.  Everybody qualifies for a pension, with means and circumstances deciding whether one is eligible for a non-contributory pension or a contributory pension.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, introduced the homemaker's scheme, which has afforded recompense to some women who look after children in the home.  The social welfare budget has increased every year under this Government.  I do not wish to be discordant but all of us in this House who are active in our constituencies understand the difficulties people are facing.  There is an issue in regard to how efforts to reduce energy consumption may impact on elderly people.  I will be happy to have that debate when we return in the autumn.</p> <p>Senator Norris raised an issue yesterday regarding the schedule, which he clarified today.  His proposal for the appointment of a member of the Traveller community to Seanad &Eacute;ireann is deserving of support.  The hearings of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee are an important part of our work in this House, giving us an opportunity to deal with issues that might not necessarily be debated in the normal course of business.  Our ability to have those hearings enables people to serve as rapporteurs and to present issues that might not otherwise be to the fore in our deliberations.</p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred to the report by Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill on victims of abuse.  I understand the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, is in the D&aacute;il later today and will address the report, which the Government has accepted.  We all look forward to that work being concluded.</p> <p>Senators Kieran O'Donnell, Lombard, Paddy Burke, Gallagher and Marshall raised issues concerning the EU-Mercosur deal.  I facilitated a discussion on this matter last week in the House, which was attended by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  It is important that we continue to have these discussions as there is a long way to go on the deal.  The briefing yesterday by the Irish Farmers Association gave a strong flavour of the view from the farming sector.  Others, such as Mr. Dan O'Brien, have a different view.  We need a running debate on the issues, which I am happy to accommodate in the new term.</p> <p>Senator Murnane O'Connor noted the one-year anniversary of the GDPR and pointed to several issues with the regulation.  Third-party compliance is challenging and we have seen some &euro;56 million in fines this year already.  However, compliance must be a prerequisite for everybody.  I am happy to have a debate on the matter.</p> <p>Senator Lombard's proposal that a delegation from the Seanad might travel to France to discuss the Mercosur deal with colleagues there is worth considering.  I hope we can have a discussion in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on how that might be facilitated.</p> <p>Senator Mac Lochlainn spoke eloquently about an important local issue in south Inishowen.  I do not have information on this particular matter, but I am happy to convey the Senator's concerns to the relevant Ministers.</p> <p>I join colleagues in congratulating Mr. Phil Hogan on his nomination for a second term as a European Commissioner.  He has done an extraordinarily good job, notwithstanding the comments around Mercosur.  I hope he will remain in his current position or receive an elevation.  We congratulate him on the very good job he has done.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke highlighted issues relating to Dublin Port.  The port's readiness for expansion and the other issues to which he referred are worthy of debate in the House.</p> <p>Senators Marshall and Humphreys referred to climate change.  We should all reflect on Senator Marshall's contribution, particularly his comments on afforestation, and Senator Humphreys's points about the EPA's report on air quality in Dublin.  The findings in the report underline the importance of implementing the recommendations in the climate change action plan regarding electric vehicles, cycling, park-and-ride facilities, public transport and the elimination of vehicles that run on fossil fuels by 2030.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why it is important that the Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Ross, will return to the House in the new term to discuss the matter raised.</p><p>If I am interpreting Senator Devine correctly, she is proposing an amendment to allow for a debate on her Private Members' Bill.</p></speech>

We wish a fair journey to those sailing it to Greenland and congratulate them.</p><p>Senator Humphreys discussed rodents, and not just in Leinster House, but across our capital city.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I hope that all those in the Houses, and particularly staff, are not discommoded after yesterday.  A workplace should be in pristine condition.  I hope that the issue will be resolved quickly.</p><p>Senator Mullen referred to the Hyde family.  I have spoken in the House previously in support of the family's application.  I do not want to use the word &quot;victory&quot;, but I congratulate the family on obtaining the right to stay in Australia.  The Irish Government plays a role in helping our citizens with visas, although I am not familiar with the level of involvement in this particular case.  The Senator had tabled a Commencement matter on the subject, but we now welcome the decision.  Thankfully, the issue has been resolved.  The Senator referred to there being various lobby groups, but the media had covered the story beforehand and afterwards.  To be fair, there is a strong Irish diaspora in Australia that is engaged with Irish civic life and the promotion of many issues.  We might consider setting up an Oireachtas subgroup to progress that further.  A child's disability should not be a barrier to remaining or entering any country.</p><p>I have not read the report of the WRC, but I concur with Senator Gavan that any breach of employment law is unacceptable.  We have employment law to ensure that there are rights and standards in the workplace.  I am not familiar with the issues that the Senator raised regarding the two hotels in Limerick, but I have a simple - perhaps too simple - view on this, that being, someone should be able to join a union.  I was a member of one, and I would encourage workers to enhance their rights collectively by becoming union members.  That is why we have employment law.  I would be happy to arrange for such a debate in the new term.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised an important issue concerning the budget.  I will take that information from him later.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, held a series of meetings on the budget in the past two weeks with various groups.  As with the summer economic statement, we will have that debate prior to the budget.</p><p>Senator Conway raised the important matter of Moneypoint.  I will reflect on that.  As he correctly stated, the jobs need to be preserved post 2025.  The transition must be planned for.  I take the Senator's point in that regard.  He also referred to the briefing given by the Irish Cancer Society.  I congratulate him and join him in his comments about the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, and the provision of medical cards to patients who have been diagnosed with cancer.  That they have this benefit is a necessity, not a luxury.  Dealing with cancer in itself is stressful and people should not have to worry about medical politics.</p><p>I concur with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh regarding public procurement and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  For SMEs that want to tender and be considered for contracts, the cost of tendering is a significant issue.  A former Minister of State, Mr. Brian Hayes, did some work on this question.  It is important that we debate the matter.  As the profile of the economy changes, we must update our tendering and procurement processes continually.  I would be happy to arrange for that debate in the new term.</p></speech>

Due to their highly technical nature, these amendments have been the subject of extensive consultations between my Department, the Courts Service, including the Taxing Master's office, and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1 proposes amendments to section 27 of the 1995 Act, which deals with additional powers of the Taxing Master of the High Court and of a county registrar exercising the powers of a taxing master.  The proposed new subsection (12) clarifies that section 27 shall not apply to the adjudication of legal costs under Part 10 of the 2015 Act.  That Part provides for the establishment of a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators, which will replace the Taxing Master's office.  Accordingly, section 27 will not apply to the new office, but it will continue to apply to county registrars in respect of matters of taxation.</p> <p>The proposed deletion of sections 27(6) and (7) is in line with the proposal to amend the 2015 Act to allow for a lodgement and tender process in the field of costs adjudication.  This will be set out in respect of the proposed amendment of section 154(10) of the 2015 Act, which I will address shortly.  The existing subsections (6) and (7) represent an impediment to the lodgement and tender process, as they fetter the allocation of liability of the parties for the costs of an adjudication or taxation of costs.  Accordingly, the deletion of the two subsections is proposed.</p> <p>Amendment No. 2 proposes a new section of the Bill providing for a number of amendments to four sections of the 2015 Act.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the Acting Chair agrees, I will address them individually.</p><p>Section 3(a) of amendment No. 2 provides for the insertion of a new subsection (6) into section 141 of the 2015 Act.  The section in question deals with county registrars in the context of Part 10 of the 2015 Act which addresses the matter of legal costs.  The purpose of this section of the amendment is to align the provision of reasons for legal cost determination by a county registrar with a similar obligation placed on a legal costs adjudicator under section 140(4) of the 2015 Act.  This arises in regard to the maintenance by the county registrar of a register of taxation or legal costs, being determinations under the Act.  Under section 140(4), costs adjudicators do not have to publish reasons for the determination where they are of the opinion that the adjudication concerned does not involve a matter of legal importance.  The proposed section 141 uses identical language to that in section 140(4) to provide for a similar exemption for county registrars.  The amendment is put forward in response to concerns raised by the Office of the Taxing Master and country registrars that an unqualified obligation to provide reasons for a determination as currently applies under section 141 would be unduly burdensome at a practical level and create a disparity in how the register of determinations is applied across the board.</p><p>Section 3(b) proposes amendment of section 154 of the Act, subsection (10) of which deals with matters relating to the work of the Office of Legal Cost Adjudicators which can be subject to rules of court.  The purpose of this section of the amendment is to provide for the introduction of a procedure to enable a party liable for payment of costs to make an offer to settle those costs or a particular item of costs which, if acceptable, would obviate the need for an adjudication or reduce the scope of adjudication.  This procedure is known as the lodgment and tender process.  To provide an incentive to a party seeking costs to engage with such procedure, it is necessary to provide that a party which unreasonably refuses to accept an offer to settle the amount claimed would be liable to bear the costs of the expense of the adjudication process from the point at which the offer is made.  The proposed additional provisions in subsection (10) would enable the making of court rules to facilitate such a procedure and set the respective liability of the parties for the cost of an adjudication where the amount offered is not exceeded by the amount of the costs determined to be paid.</p><p>Section 3(c) provides for the amendment of section 160 of the 2015 Act.  Its purpose is to correct an erroneous cross-reference.  The reference should be to section 163 which deals with the power of the legal costs adjudicator to specify forms in connection with the application for the adjudication of costs.  The cross-reference in section 160 should be to section 163 rather than to section 166 which deals with information, documents and records.</p><p>Section 3(d) provides for the amendment of section 172 of the 2015 Act and deals with the advisory committee on the grant of patents of precedence.  A grant of patents entitles a legal practitioner to whom it is granted to use the title of senior counsel.  The purpose of the amendment is to correct the omission of the President of the Court of Appeal from the membership of the advisory committee on the grant of patents of precedence.  The omission arose due to the fact that the Court of Appeal Act and the Legal Services Regulation Act crossed each other in time in coming to enactment.  Accordingly, the amendment includes the President of the Court of Appeal in the list of members of the advisory committee.  It also provides for a temporary alternative member of the advisory committee in the event of the death or retirement of the President of the Court of Appeal in a similar fashion to procedure in the cases of the Chief Justice and President of the High Court.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#P00600"><p>The amendment seeks to amend section 30 of the 1961 Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act which deals with the retirement age of a judge of the District Court.  The effect of the amendment is to increase from 65 to 70 years the age of retirement of a judge of the District Court.  The new retirement age will overtake the current practice of continuing a District Court judge in office from the age of 65 to 70 years by means of an annual warrant, which means that in each year the judge concerned must be extended in office.  Subsection (1) provides for the increase to 70 years, amending the 1961 Act in a straightforward manner through the substitution of 70 for 65.</p><p>Subsection (2) provides that the increase to 70 will apply to serving judges when the amendment is brought into operation.  In particular, it clarifies that the increase generally to 70 years applies to a judge who, having already reached 65 years, has been continuing in office by means of a subsisting annual warrant made under section 2 of the 1949 Courts of Justice (District Court) Act.</p><p>Subsection (3) further clarifies that an increase to 70 years applies in the case of an annual warrant made retrospectively under the 1949 Act in the circumstances provided for by section 1 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1988.  The circumstances referred to include where the omission to make a warrant is attributable to error or oversight.  I was in the House when that Bill was passed.  It arose in regard to a specific District Court judge who served in my district at the time, district No. 14.  I make that point to underline that <i>tempus fugit</i>.</p><p>I am proposing this straightforward amendment in response to pressing views expressed by the Courts Service and the Association of Judges of Ireland seeking implementation of this measure so as to standardise the retirement age of judges of the District Court with that of other judges and to do away with the system of annual extensions from the age of 65.  It will enhance court administration and the continuity of any District Court proceedings concerned.  The amendment is based on section 59 of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and which is currently before this House.  It is largely a technical amendment more appropriately suited to this Bill.</p></speech>

It is sensible to make this provision and to do so in this Bill rather than in the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill which we will shortly have the pleasure of debating again.  I did not get the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of this Bill.  I very much welcome it.  It is a brief and sensible Bill which seeks to extend the number of judges on the Court of Appeal, which has fulfilled an important and useful function and undoubtedly deserves support.</p></speech>

It is to be amended from the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) (Amendment) Act 2019 to the Courts Act 2019.  The amendment was recommended to the Government by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to reflect the content of the Bill on the basis of the amendments proposed by the Government.</p> <p>Amendment No. 5 amends the Long Title of the Bill.  The amendment was proposed to the Government on the recommendation of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It has the purpose of including in the Long Title reference to existing statutes which are now proposed to be amended by the Bill.  This reflects standard practice in the drafting of the Long Title of the Bill.  The Acts to be amended now include the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.</p></speech>

We have heard a great deal about merit, diversity and other things and about the absolute necessity for judges to be appointed on merit, on which we all agree.  Senator McDowell's amendment would give the procedures committee the capacity to examine what is meant by &quot;merit&quot; and how it is reflected in the appointment of judges.  It is very important that judges are appointed strictly on merit alone.  Merit includes knowledge of the law and a capacity to determine things.  It is a very important criterion, to which the Minister has paid adequate tribute throughout the debate.  I understand that Senator Boyhan will withdraw the amendment but that it will be reinstated on Report Stage by Senator McDowell.  It is a very important amendment that deals directly, clearly and cogently with merit and it is very significant.</p></speech>

The Labour Party brought forward a number of amendments, which I have withdrawn and which I reserve the right to reintroduce on Report Stage, relating to the issue of diversity among candidates for judicial appointment and, in particular, the need to ensure gender balance in the Judiciary.

We are following good parliamentary procedure in moving this amendment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not sure if the Minister is shaking his head because he cannot find the place in the Bill or whether-----</p></speech>

This is important for our democracy.  In other words, it is to ensure it does not just go to the Minister for his personal decision, but that both Houses of the Oireachtas will have the opportunity to discuss the matter in full.  What is the point in having a review if it is going to be confined to the Minister and not laid before these Houses, when it is normal practice to do so?  In my lengthy experience in this House the practice has been to put these reviews before the Oireachtas for a full debate.</p></speech>

It is important to have this element in the Bill, and for the commission to be able to range widely in its discussions and make reference to matters, which may not be in the public interest to be bruited abroad.  It insulates the records of the commission from orders for discovery in court proceedings, for example.  I am aware of the idea of discovery, which is an important element in the law, because I made some very important discoveries in a libel case I once took.  A woman published an interview she did with me in 2000 or 2001, and I wanted to take libel action against her but could not find a barrister prepared to take the case.  Subsequently, when I took the libel action, we won discovery of the tapes, which was significant because they differed substantially from the grotesque distortion of my views she had published.  I therefore accept that discovery is an important mechanism.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#U00700"><p>I move amendment No. 109e:</p><blockquote>In page 38, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:&ldquo;<b>57.</b>No cause of action shall exist against the Commission or any of its members arising out of the failure of the Commission to recommend any person or category of persons for appointment to judicial office under the terms of this Act and no cause of action shall exist against the State or the Government arising from any failure to advise the President to appoint to judicial office any person recommended for such appointment by the Commission.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>I would say this is fairly obvious.  In order to make an informed decision, the Government needs the widest possible information on the subject.  The amendment reinforces that, regardless of any recommendations made by the commission, the appointment of judges remains a power vested in the Government, and that is what the Constitution requires.  Any deviation would necessitate a referendum.  Further, or in the alternative, if a conflict arises between this Act and the Constitution, the Constitution is what is relied on.  This is a very important point.  Senator McDowell is raising constitutional issues.  He is reinforcing the fact that, regardless of recommendations made by the commission, the power of appointment of judges would remain solely a Government function.  It is vested, under the Constitution, exclusively in the hands of the Government.  There should be no attempt whatever to dilute or weaken this, and it should be implemented.</p></speech>

Regardless of the findings or deliberations of any commission or committee, at the end of the day, the Minister for Justice and Equality, advising the Government, can pick a candidate who has not come before this commission.  As Senator Norris has just said, it would require a referendum to change the law if we were to change the way judges are appointed.  I will withdraw the amendment while reserving the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage.  However, it is a question that we need to answer when the Minister comes back on Report Stage as to how exactly we can compel a Government to accept the nominees, which I do not believe we can do under the Constitution.  I will await the Minister's advice.</p></speech>

I note the Senator has withdrawn the amendment while at the same time reserving the right to re-enter it on Report Stage.  I merely want to flag a reason for my inability to accept the amendment, which I am sure will also be the case at a later stage when we are discussing the Bill.  I specifically sought the advice of the Attorney General on this matter.  There is an issue with the requirement in the amendment which would have the result of posing obvious legal issues by ousting completely the jurisdiction of the courts to deal with any legal or constitutional issue surrounding the process for a judicial appointment.  It is the belief of the Attorney General, which I share, that this would be liable to constitutional challenge.  I do not accept for one moment that Senator Craughwell wished to see that in the amendment.  Let both sides reflect further on it.  I am assuming the amendment will be re-entered in this or a similar form.  However, I ask the proposer of the amendment to bear in mind the advice of the Attorney General as given to me on the matter.</p></speech>

It is not the first time he has shown a willingness through what has been a fairly lengthy process.  I ask that, before we come back to Report Stage, we all sit around the table and have a look at that specific issue, given it is the one that has brought me into this debate the whole way through.  If we can resolve that and in some way find a solution to it, I would find myself far more comfortable with this Bill.</p></speech>

While I know it is not usual to make the Attorney General's advice available, I wonder if, in this instance, since we are dealing with a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the general outline of that can be made available.  This would be of great help to Senator McDowell in redrafting the amendment, if he so decides.</p></speech>

First, I will not be departing from the time-honoured principle and convention on the matter of the Attorney General's advice.  Second, I say to Senator Craughwell, who invites me to sit around the table, that this is precisely what we are doing.  We have been sitting around the table for 125 hours over 16 months.</p></speech>

In the normal course of events where there is a serious opposition within the Seanad or the D&aacute;il to a particular Bill or provisions of it, there would usually be recourse to some discussion - outside of the debate - between the officials, the Minister and the Senators who are opposing particular aspects of the Bill in an effort to reach a compromise.  I said this before, at some earlier point during Committee Stage debates.  There are numerous examples, such as the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Bill 2018, with which Senator Norris and I had issues.  Senator Norris will recall that we had meetings with officials and with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, in an attempt to reach a compromise position.  Similarly, with some of the Private Members' Bills I proposed that the Government adopted and amended we met a number of times over the course of preparation of amendments.  We achieved good legislation as a result; through this negotiation and compromise it is often more possible in meetings outside of the actual legislative debate.  While issues should, of course, be raised on the floor of the House during Committee Stage debates, quite frequently we have recourse to meetings outside of the debates to try to achieve compromise where there is real opposition to particular provisions in a Bill.  That has not happened in this case.  I have made that comment before.  It is a pity that it did not happen and it would have shortened things.</p></speech>

This amendment is to amend the Courts and Court Offices Act 1995 by the insertion after section 47A of the following section:<b>&ldquo;47B. </b>(1)Notwithstanding that a person has retired from or otherwise vacated an office to which this section applies&mdash;I presume this means a question of illness.  Supposing the judge has a heart attack or a stroke and is not able to fulfil the functions, in those places the amendment provides that:<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(a) he or she, with the consent of the President for the time being of the relevant court, may within a period of four months thereafter discharge the function of giving judgment and making an order on foot thereof and making any consequential or ancillary order in any case or matter which was begun and heard before him or her prior to he or she vacating or retiring from that office, and<br /><br />(b) for that purpose, and for the purpose of any proceeding arising out of such case or matter, he or she shall be treated as having been a holder of that office at the time of discharging the function mentioned in paragraph (a).</blockquote></blockquote>(2) Provided that nothing in this section applies in cases where such person was removed from office or imposes or increases any charge on the Central Fund or the public revenue.</blockquote></blockquote>I take it that this reference to the Central Exchequer and to funds and so on is to ensure that the Bill is protected against the qualification that Seanad &Eacute;ireann is prohibited as it currently stands - although we have some business on that to try to remove standing order section 41 - and it could be ruled out of order because it creates a charge on the Exchequer.  The amendment also provides that:<blockquote><blockquote>(3) In this section &lsquo;consequential or ancillary orders&rsquo; includes any certification or settling a case stated for the purpose of an appeal and the granting of any stay in respect of the order and any order dealing with the costs of any proceeding to which subsection (1) relates.<br /><br />(4) Nothing in this section precludes the President of any court from directing that any &ldquo;consequential or ancillary order&rdquo; in any proceeding to which subsection (1) has application may be made by another member of the court in cases where it would be just to do so.<br /><br />(5) Where the proceedings to which subsection (1) relates were proceedings before a division of a court consisting of three or more members, nothing in this section precludes the remaining members of that division of the court from delivering a reserved judgement or making an ancillary or consequential order, where the President for the time being of the court has consented and where the remaining members of the relevant division of the court are of opinion that no injustice would result.<br /><br />(6) In this section the term &lsquo;President&rsquo; includes the Chief Justice in relation to cases heard in the Supreme Court.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote>Once again we are following the precedent of our neighbouring island.  In so doing we are introducing a very practical element into the Bill.  I emphasise that this is not just something from Senator McDowell - I nearly said President McDowell - but that it is from the President of the Court of Appeal who had actually asked that this provision be introduced into the legislation.  This is a voice to which we must listen.  In addition, we hear a lot these days about delays in the courts system.  This would have the effect of speeding up the courts system and ameliorating these delays.<br /><br />The situation at the moment is that a judge stops being a judge completely and fully.  He or she is extinct from being a judge from the very day of retirement.  This means that judges are pretty well frozen for the last three months of their operation.  This is to make sure that judges are not sitting on cases that might not come to a conclusion-----</blockquote></speech>

This amendment mirrors the UK legislation and is a practical one.  It is something the President of the Court of Appeal has looked for and it would also reduce delays in the courts.  Currently, a judge must stop being a judge on the date of retirement, which means that judgments must be delivered by that date. The inevitable consequence of the reality of that is that judges are in effect benched for the last three months of their time as a judge, in order to ensure that they are not sitting on cases that may not finish and that all outstanding judgments are delivered.</p> <p>This is even more relevant for the appellate courts where more than one judge sits.  I will withdraw the amendment but reserve the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It is a really important issue and one I will certainly look at.  I am not sure if it is one that might be appropriate for Report Stage of this Bill, but it is one that is certainly deserving of favourable consideration in the context of a number of pieces of legislation on the civil law side currently going through either House or in the course of preparation.  </p> <p>I take the Senators' point and thank them for bringing it to my attention.  It is a point with which I agree fully but I would like to reflect, in conjunction with the Senators, on how best it might be reflected in law in terms of whether this is the appropriate vehicle.  I do not think it is but let us see if I have a better one over the next few months because I accept its importance and the points raised.</p></speech>

This amendment raises an important issue around what happens when a judge retires from office and there are outstanding judgments and so on.  It is very good to hear the Minister say he will reflect on this and come back on Report Stage.  This is the sort of compromise and negotiation that we could have engaged in far more productively far earlier.</p> <p>I refrained from speaking on section 57, in which it is provided that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, would be dissolved.  There was an obvious compromise, where we could have seen really effective reform of the judicial appointments system through reform of the existing JAAB, as proposed by, Jennifer Carroll MacNeilll, and other researchers who have looked at this.  That sort of compromise could have been achieved very effectively through negotiation and discussion outside of, and perhaps prior to, Committee Stage of this Bill.</p> <p>It is very welcome that the Minister has accepted some amendments offered by the Opposition and has indicated his willingness to look at others, including amendment No. 111.</p></speech>

I have been present in the Chamber for the vast majority of those, that is, 123 hours.  I have been very much impressed by the Minister's tenacity and commitment to continue this debate, which at times has been extremely frustrating.

I point out to the Minister that those of us who oppose the Bill have facilitated this.  We have taken this debate in a much more rapid fashion than any other debate that has taken place on this Bill.  It has been an example of good co-operation between the Minister and Senators and I am grateful to the Minister.  I forward to the Report Stage which will probably be taken in the autumn.</p></speech>

I was certainly in awe of his mastery of his brief in the Department of Justice and Equality, but in particular, of this legislation.</p> <p>I acknowledge that more than 48 judges have been appointed under this administration and all of them are exceptional people and were appointed on merit.  Let us not lose sight of that in this debate.  We have a very high calibre of men and women serving in the Judiciary and they have done an exceptionally good job.  The system to date has worked.  Despite all the arguments, complaints, and media coverage that people would veto, stop, or block the appointment of judges, a very impressive list of 48, if not more, judges have been appointed.  I wish all of them well and I am more than confident that it was the right thing to do.  They are all men and women of merit.  It proves the point that despite all the hours spent in debate, this House or the Government did not stop or impede an appointment to the Judiciary, which is an important point to make.</p></speech>

I thank Senators for their contributions.  It was something of a formidable and lengthy debate.  I was very pleased to be here for it.  I acknowledge what Senator Boyhan said, namely, this debate is a really important part of the essence of our democracy.  We have a bit of work to do over the summer months in reflecting on the status of the Bill.  We have made some amendments, and there are other areas on which I have indicated I would be happy to hear further, with a view towards amending at a later Stage.  I reiterate my support and that of my Government colleagues for the Bill and for the need to ensure that we modernise the manner in which we appoint our judges.  However, the Bill, as amended in committee in the Seanad, is far from perfect and requires further work.  I would be happy not only to acknowledge what Senator Bacik and others have said but to engage over the summer months in a way that may well give rise to a situation in which, working together, we have a Bill that is entirely fit for purpose.  This is important legislation but it needs a substantial amount of work.  I have listened for in excess of 100 hours to the points the Senators have made and have taken careful note of important points that were made.  I acknowledge the resilience of my officials for being here through the entirety of the debate.</p></speech>

Having regard to the fact that some weeks in August are weeks during which people traditionally have the opportunity to take a break, I see the month of September as being a time for reflecting on the next Stage of the Bill and on how to accommodate many of the important issues raised by Senators into legislation that, of course, must accord with the Constitution.  I have taken very careful note of the views expressed by Senators as to the constitutionality of the legislation.  I am satisfied, from my discussions with the Attorney General and the advices he has given me, that the Bill accords with our Constitution, as it should.  Not only should our Bill be in strict accordance with the Constitution, but it should also be legally robust and practically workable.  It is because of this that I believe we should now all go through the product, as completed in committee, with a fine-tooth comb and resume in September.  I would be happy to engage along the lines proposed by Senator Bacik.  We all need to work together.  I would be very keen to have this legislation, which forms a fundamental pillar of A Programme for a Partnership Government, enacted in its entirety during the course of the autumn and into the winter.</p></speech>

This amendment allows for the Minister to facilitate a multi-annual increase and a multi-annual reduction in a rate payment following a revaluation, if requested, by a local authority.  The amendment is a response to the valuation process, particularly where the local authority area completes the process but has not done so in a number of years.  As the Minister of State will know, many business owners can then experience a drastic and very abrupt spike in their rates.  This may happen where the property itself has not undergone any improvement works but the area around it has.  As was mentioned on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, some of these businesses have experienced a 300% to 400% increase in the space of a year, although such increases are rare.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I give credit to Deputy Pat Casey who first introduced this amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  We wanted to make sure it was discussed in this House also.  My colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, is also very much in favour of it, as is our entire party.</p><p>In the absence of an effective valuation system that is not sensitive to what large increases can do to a small business, and after possibly decades of radio silence from the Valuation Office, this should not be acceptable.  In many ways, this amendment addresses the resource issues of the Valuation Office.  If it is not able to hold more regular revaluation processes, another mechanism must be created that allows sensitivity to be shown towards businesses that experience large increases in rates.</p><p>I put it to the Minister of State that this proposal is common sense.  I understand this type of model is already in place in Irish Water, so we know the Government can put such a model in place.  It would mean that businesses would not face either a sharp spike or decrease in rates as increases would be introduced in phases in line with the Revenue's overall rules to keep this revenue neutral.  If the Minister of State does not adopt this amendment, he will let down business people throughout the country.  That is the bottom line.  It is common sense and has broad support across the Seanad.  I hope this Chamber today is used respectfully.  I do not want to hear the Minister of State say the amendment cannot be adopted because we are finishing up this week.  It is the right thing to do and I ask him to do the right thing.</p></speech>

As Senator Gavan said, Deputy Pat Casey spoke about this issue in the D&aacute;il.  I also believe it is important to provide for phased increases or decreases for that matter.  As the Minister of State will be aware, businesses, especially smaller companies, often cannot afford large increases in rates, whether they are doubled or tripled.  Rates are important to businesses and jobs and we have to make sure we protect our businesses.  Changes should be phased in.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

My roots are in the midlands and I sometimes visit County Laois.  In many of the small towns I see that small businesses are closed, many because of rates they cannot afford.  I very much agree with the possibility envisaged in this amendment that rates may not only be increased but also decreased.  It is absolutely right in a circumstance where a business is struggling and is on the margins that the council should be allowed to decrease its rates to allow the business to continue and survive.</p></speech>

We all hear from individuals who have experienced a large spike in rates but we do not always hear from those who have experienced a large decrease in rates.  Within the current legislation, rates income must be neutral following a revaluation.  This is the difficulty we face.</p> <p>As I understand the amendment, it will empower the Minister to provide for phased increases in rates.  I am not sure if a phased decrease is legally possible because a case could be taken by a commercial ratepayer on the basis that the rates applied to his or business should be much lower, yet the Government was providing that the necessary decrease would be phased in over a number of years to allow the local authority's funds to balance.</p> <p>I remember distinctly the previous revaluation, which disadvantaged small businesses and shop owners and was of major benefit to hotels and offices.  We never heard anything from the hotel sector when rates in the industry decreased significantly in urban areas.  That revaluation put small shopkeepers, pharmacies and small restaurants to the pins of their collars because it resulted in an unplanned increase in costs, which they found difficult to manage.  Spikes in rates, especially when unforeseen, are difficult for marginal businesses to manage.  We have to try to empower local authorities to assist such businesses over a period.</p> <p>I understand the bind the Minister of State is in arising from the way in which the legislation is currently laid out.  Senator Craughwell proposed addressing this issue through a statutory instrument at a later stage.  A more in-depth examination of the matter is probably needed because there could be serious unintentional consequences.  While I agree with the spirit of the amendment, I understand the difficulties in framing legislation to allow this to happen. </p></speech>

All of us understand the intent and spirit behind the amendment and the need for understanding to be shown if there is a sudden increase in the rates payable after a revaluation.  If we go back to the whole framework for rates, we all agree that they should be fair, sustainable and neutral.  During yesterday's Second Stage debate, I highlighted that where revaluations have occurred, there have been winners and losers.  Senator Humphreys referred to a previous revaluation.  While we hear about the losers because they are concerned about the increase and the spike in their rates, we rarely hear about the winners who see a reduction in their rates.</p> <p>I am concerned about the consequences should this amendment be passed and implemented.  I would like to hear from the Opposition Senators who proposed the amendment how they would address the shortfall in rates income which would be faced by local authorities if the amendment was in place.  I presume those who I would categorise as the winners, namely, those who have had a reduction in rates, are constitutionally entitled to have those reductions and would rightly seek them because they are provided for in the revaluation.  This would leave a gap in the funding available to the local authority to deliver the vital services we all want.  The question I ask the Opposition, rather than the Minister of State, to answer is how we would address the shortfall in funding available to local authorities in the event that the amendment is passed?  I presume the Senators will answer that it will come from central government's magic tax revenues.</p> <p>The rates system has to be sustainable in its own right.  As was said on Second Stage yesterday, rates are a major and fundamental mechanism for funding local authorities to deliver services.  I fully understand the intent around the amendment and perhaps there is a compromise or solution the Minister of State might consider when a significant spike in rates payable arises.  Perhaps ratepayers could be given time to become accustomed to the higher rate.  Rates are a big overhead in any business.  Anybody who has run a small business will agree that the rates bill is one of their largest overheads.  Local authorities could allow an increased rates bill to be paid over a period.  I offer this solution as a matter for debate but I want to know where the shortfall would come from if this amendment was to pass.</p></speech>

Senator Norris may have been slightly wrong.  Decreases in rates are accepted and the revaluation process will produce decreases.  One section in the Bill proposes that decreases would become instantly applicable and the rate book would change immediately.  Senator Norris's concerns are already addressed in the Bill in that sense.  If, for example, a valuation were to fall from &euro;10,000 to &euro;5,000 for a shop in Rathdowney or another town in County Laois-----</p></speech>

I have no problem with what the amendment is trying to achieve, but the reality on the ground is that this is implemented wholesale across the country.  I was in Donegal County Council with some of my officials last week or the previous week.  The first thing I always raise when I visit a local authority is the rate of rates collection.  The Donegal rate was lower than I would have liked it to be.  The reason it was lower was that over a period of years through the recession the council introduced its own version of an alleviation scheme, which saw some rates written down.  The freedom that currently exists, which I accept is not exercised by every local authority, is retained in the Bill.  The problem I have with it is the illegality of a phased decrease but also, as Senator Coffey pointed out, in a rates revaluation situation that the proportion from different businesses would change but the overall figure coming to the council would not change.  My concern is where Carlow County Council would find the extra &euro;250,000 that it loses in that process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#AA00700"><p>I agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor, but Carlow County Council already has the freedom to do that.  The situation varies from county to county on whether such a power is exercised by the members, through the management.  All local authorities will work with ratepayers who are in distressed situations if the ratepayers engage with them to devise an appropriate payment plan.  One of the things this legislation does is it gets rids of the old archaic system of two moieties and will allow a staged payment system over the course of a year, which for some businesses might mean they have good months and bad months and they will know when they are able to pay more rates perhaps than in other parts of the year.  We are putting that on a statutory footing in this legislation.  Equally, I reiterate that such discretion already exists and is used by some local authorities and should be used by more.</p> <p>I will refer to some of my notes before I get sacked.  Once a ratepayer engages with a local authority, the local authority can work with the ratepayer to facilitate an appropriate payment plan.  The liability remains, however, and that cannot be defrayed.  It would be inequitable to other ratepayers.  I am thinking of two retailers on the same street; one whose valuation was more up to date and whose rate did not change and another who experienced an increase in rates due to an out-of-date valuation.  It would not be equitable for one ratepayer to continue paying rates at a higher level while subsidising a lower rate payment by a neighbouring retailer.  That situation could arise, in particular in light of the fact that, as Senator Gavan pointed out, there have not been revaluations for years but they may have occurred if somebody carried out substantial work to their premises.  Therefore, one could have, in effect, two different systems operating on the same street.  Furthermore, how would the provision apply to ratepayers whose valuation has reduced?  Should they be expected to pay more than they legally owe if there was a multi-annual decrease?</p> <p>It is worth noting at this point that global utility companies such as the ESB, Eir or Vodafone pay approximately 33% of overall commercial rates.  The amendment, as proposed, would have the effect of allowing for a phased approach to an increase in the valuation of a global utility company, such as Vodafone, the ESB or Eir, as well as for the more traditional ratepayers who, proportionately, are a smaller group in many local authorities in terms of the amount of rates they collect.  It is expected that utility companies would also be subjected to a phased reduction in the case of their valuations decreasing.  The question is whether they would legally challenge it, which of course they would.  For context, in 2015, the seven global utilities being revalued that year had their collective rates bill reduced by &euro;24 million following a decrease in most of their valuations.  It would be safe to assume that local authorities would have to defend costly legal actions in a scenario where they try to impose greater rates demand on a ratepayer than is merited by the actual valuation of their property or business.</p> <p>The local authority has the flexibility to engage with individual ratepayers in such cases.  In response to Senator Craughwell, the circular that will issue following enactment of this Bill, will ask local authorities to be cognisant of those ratepayers who have experienced significant increases in valuations.  In recent years, the Minister has requested that local authorities exercise restraint in the determination of the ARV and, to give them their due, local authorities have done as requested.  I have committed to looking at valuation issues and the impact of valuation in the autumn.  As I said yesterday, that may require primary legislation on the valuation side rather than on the rates side that we are looking at today, and in particular the impact on businesses which had a significant increase in valuation and hence in their rates bill.  The likelihood of such increases occurring will lessen as the revaluation programme completes, and the revaluation cycle becomes regular.  As Senator Gavan pointed out, it has been far from regular in the past 30 to 40 years and that is what has led to the significant jumps in valuation because we have not had an ongoing revaluation process.  I referred yesterday to progress with clearing the backlog of revisions in terms of the resources that are available to the Valuation Commissioner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.399" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1417" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#AA00800"><p>I wish to speak very much to the spirit of the amendment.  We are going through a major transition period regarding the main shopping streets, but even in urban areas, shopping centres in town centres find it very difficult because people have changed their way of interacting and they now purchase online.  It is always the most vulnerable in society who are worst affected by the transition.  We must manage the transition to make sure that the services remain in place.  I accept what the Minister of State said about local authorities having discretion to work with businesses but, unfortunately, not all local authorities do so.  We must make sure, as we have done in the amendment, that the Minister is empowered to give stronger instruction to local authorities on the management of the transition.  We are not going to prevent change.  Change is happening in every town and shopping centre.  Whether one is in Dublin, Carlow or Donegal, we all see that the shopping centre is changing.  We must work to make sure that there is a shopping centre, gym or small community facility in Clondalkin, Tallaght or elsewhere.</p> <p>The spirit of the amendment gives the Minister a little more direction.  I do not think the language of the amendment is quite right yet.  What we want to do is empower the Minister to act when local authorities do not engage with businesses or assist them with the transition.  There is no role for local authority councillors in that regard because the manager has executive functions in the matter.  I refer to setting the rates, the valuation and how the ratepayer is treated.  The Minister of State could examine the spirit of the amendment and consider whether he could introduce a statutory instrument to empower the Minister to instruct local authorities to work with small businesses that experience a sudden spike.  We could look at percentages for the spike.  If the rates go up by 5% it would be automatic but if it is greater than 5% there should be a transition management because the business itself could not support a larger increase suddenly.  I will not give the Minister of State the percentage increases but the matter could be examined.</p> <p>I do not wish to delay proceedings further.  I support the intention of the amendment.  I can see where it is coming from in terms of the business sector.  I have dealt with people who have experienced a large spike.  The Minister is constrained regarding the rates.  I urge the Minister of State to look again to see if there is a way to achieve what he wants to do as well.  I do not say that it is not the intention of the Minister of State because this is what he would like to see as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State might give a commitment to the movers of the amendment that he will work with them to try to resolve the issue, which is well highlighted.  It was highlighted by Fianna F&aacute;il on Committee Stage also.  There is a willingness on the part of everybody to work with him to try to resolve the problem.  I seek a strong commitment from the Minister of State that he is clear about the problem and that we will work together to come up with a solution.</p></speech>

Some can be much higher, others can be much lower and some can be in the middle range; they all get their lists.  In terms of the higher levels of rates, for businesses that may be under pressure or are closing, is it not better to work with and reach an agreement with them on rates rather than have a shop close on a main street?  We need to consider talking to businesses.</p> <p>Local authorities are not a bank.  It is taxpayers' money.  When we are dealing with business people who pay their rates we need to ensure there is a balance.  If a business is not in a position to pay its rates - some are and others are not - there must be leniency shown and more discussion between local authorities.  Everybody needs to work together in that regard.  As other speakers said, some local authorities might have more correspondence with businesses than others and may meet with them but the Minister must make sure that local authorities work with businesses because we do not want to see businesses closed on any main street.  Businesses are competing with online shopping, which does not involve paying rates.  Many of my friends and other people I know shop online but I always ask them to support local, shop local.  Businesses are now competing in an entirely new era in terms of shopping malls and online shopping.  We must make sure that we look after business people by dealing with them and giving them the chance to phase in their rates payments if they are not in a position to pay them.</p></speech>

In fairness, he always gives a thoughtful response on these matters.  I will make a couple of brief points, and I thank my colleague, Senator Humphreys, in respect of this aspect.  Section 6(3) is important.  It states: "The Minister may by direction in writing amend or revoke a direction under this section (including a direction under this subsection)."  We have built in the power to address that in the Bill.</p> <p>On the point my colleague, Senator Coffey, made, I fully understand that this has to be revenue neutral.  There will not be a loss of revenue here.  The legal issues referred to by Senator Coffey, and the Minister of State, are issues for the Minister but I believe businesses expect a more subtle and realistic approach to rates.</p> <p>We support this Bill.  We are not opposing it overall but we believe the Minister of State has missed an opportunity to phase in these increases in particular.  I refer to Irish Water which, I have been informed, has introduced just such an undertaking.  If a State authority can do this in one area, I am at a loss as to why the Minister could not consider doing something similar.</p></speech>

You are very welcome to Leinster House.</p> <p>Does the Minister have anything further to add?</p></speech>

First, I am not sure in what context Senator Gavan is speaking but Irish Water do not pay rates yet.  It is envisaged in the immediate term as part of the provisions of this Bill, particularly in respect of the changes to the existing section 56 of the rates legislation, that Irish Water will start to pay rates.  That is one of the time sensitivities to this.  Some local authorities such as Wicklow County Council, for example, and others that have big water utility and Irish Water facilities potentially would be at a severe financial disadvantage if this legislation is not passed because of the revaluation process.</p> <p>I absolutely agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor about the competition from online shopping.  It is not just small towns that are being affected by that.  The main streets in many big provincial towns like Carlow or Kilkenny are more in the food and beverage line rather than the traditional hardware and drapery-----</p></speech>

I do not disagree with her at all but there is a twofold answer.  First, and I accept it is not uniformly exercised across the country, the provision for councils to take account of difficulty to pay is exercised by many local authorities.  I gave a particular example of work done in Donegal where, in the teeth of the recession, a conscious effort was made by management and councillors to do exactly what the Senator said, namely, keep businesses open and have rates into the future rather than have large rates bills upfront.</p> <p>The other aspect this legislation specifically deals with is the introduction of a staged payment process.  As it stands, the two moiety system still exists on the Statute Book.  In reality, local authorities will take money whenever they get it in most cases but this legislation allows for a payment plan to be agreed between the local authorities and the ratepayers.  It goes back to what I said yesterday.  Traditionally, almost everybody on the local authority was a ratepayer, whether they were paying domestic or commercial rates, or both.  Following recent elections, however, there are far fewer commercial ratepayers on local authorities.  As a result, a "them and us" attitude has built up where businesses sometimes feel that local authorities see them as a soft touch for collecting funds if there is a shortfall when it comes to the annual budget meeting.</p> <p>What we are doing in this legislation is enabling local authorities to set up modern payment systems with businesses.  To use the example of the traditional retailer on the high street, the period after Christmas is a slower period once the sales are over and one might not be paying any rates.  One might have an agreement with the local authority not to pay any rates in February, March, April and May and then one pays commercial rates for the rest of the year.  That is what the Bill is doing in terms of its provisions.</p> <p>What is proposed in the amendment presents me with two impossible things I cannot accept.  The first concerns the point made by Deputy Humphreys.  We cannot have phased increases because that would be challenged, and successfully so, in the courts by any business paying more than it should lawfully have to pay.  The other point was from Senator Coffey about making up the shortfall.  I believe local authorities are being given the power in this legislation to make sensible decisions.  It is being put on statute for the first time in terms of those payment schedules.  I told Senator Craughwell that we will be circulating those to the local authorities following the enactment of the legislation.</p> <p>To answer Senator Humphreys, there is a general regulation making power under section 18, which I spoke about in the D&aacute;il debate.  I believe that would cover some of the aspects of the amendment that I accept or at least believe would not be illegal, and might be able to be implemented.  I believe the power exists under section 18 to make such a regulation.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Murnane O'Connor that the local authorities are not a bank, nor are the ratepayers.  What happened here in the Second Stage debate was interesting.  A much broader discussion on funding local government has to take place.  We have a situation where &euro;1.5 billion annually comes from business to pay local authorities and many times businesses do not see where that money is being spent.  We cannot strip that out because we will ruin the financial base of local authorities but there is a bigger picture.  Should a local tax be levied in the future on those businesses doing online sales into Carlow or Kilkenny from other jurisdictions or other parts of the country?  We have to consider online sales tax and such issues.  I saw the T&aacute;naiste and another commentator talking about the potential impact on online sales if a hard Brexit happens in that people would have to claim back from the Revenue Commissioners for returned products.  I see that in my extended family where packages are coming in the post.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People's lives are much busier and they might do their shopping online at home at night.  They are able to return products freely to Britain at present but in the event of a hard Brexit that would not be the case.  That might be a boon for the shops on the high street and might be one of the unforeseen positive consequences should a hard Brexit happen, not that I want to see it happen.</p><p>I understand what the Senators are trying to address, but there are two issues.  One is the phased decreases and the other is the shortfall in funding and from where that shortfall could be met.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1380" speakername="Paddy Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#EE00100"><p>I wonder how a situation such as that outlined in section 6 might arise.  How would it work in reality?  When the manager of the local authority brings forward his estimates for the end of the financial year or the year going forward and the councillors debate the estimates or the budget and decide to increase or reduce the rate by a certain amount, would the direction be given at that stage?  How does the Minister of State see this mechanism for the power to limit the annual rate on valuation working?  I do not really understand how it would work in practice.  It seems the manager would have the power at the end of the day.  From reading the section, if the councillors were to adopt a rate that the manager was not happy with, he could override their decision and amend the rate with a direction and his word would be the last word.  Is it the case that we are giving more power to the manager?  While it is a reserved function of councillors to set the estimates and so on, section 6(5)(c) of the Bill states "which amendment the chief executive is hereby authorised to make".  It seems to me that the Minister of State is giving ultimate power to the local authority manager to override a decision made by the councillors.</p></speech>

A similar provision was in existence until the 1980s, when it was last used.  I am not sure when it was removed from legislation.  The provision allowed the Minister a power of limitation on the setting of the ARV, which is the annual event that takes place at the budget meeting, as the Senator outlined.  Essentially, however, the councillors will be made aware before the budget takes place as the Department circularises the councils every year.  It did so particularly during the years of the recession, with the need to keep the ARV as low as possible.  Not every local authority has done this over the past ten years.  To that extent, this facility already exists.  Section 6 provides for the power of limitation.  Ultimately, the power rests with the Minister, but the chief executive in this case is, I suppose, an agent of the Minister in the local authority ensuring that such provision is adhered to.  I emphasise, however, that the setting of the ARV is still the prerogative of local authority members.  Furthermore, in section 15 a new reserve power is being created for members of local authorities.  This is the establishment of an alleviation scheme, which must be based on the provisions of a development plan, an area plan or a national Government strategy such as the spatial strategy or the Project Ireland 2040 provisions currently in place.  Again, the ultimate power will still rest with the members.  The provision under section 8 for the power of limitation is a ministerial one.  The chief executive in this case will act as an agent of the Department and the Minister in ensuring that when councillors strike the annual ARV they do so within certain parameters.</p> <p>Generally speaking, in the 20 years since I joined a local authority, there have not been huge annual increases in commercial rates during what were called the Celtic tiger years.  There were certainly increases in various local authorities but they tended to be within fairly modest parameters such as 2% or 3%.  We are anxious that local authorities would still act independently but we are conscious that overall national economic circumstances may change, as happened a decade ago.  Local authorities voluntarily decided, through their membership, not to have large annual increases in commercial rates because they recognised the value of keeping businesses open and having some money to pay rates in the future, as well as keeping premises occupied on streets in towns and villages throughout the country.  This provision places on a statutory footing the existing capability of the Department to circularise the local authorities asking them to use their discretion.</p></speech>

It is not designed for a scenario in which the manager does not like what the councillors have done in a budget and can therefore overrule the budget they have passed.  It is about placing on a statutory footing a limitation to the increases or decreases in commercial rates in-----</p></speech>

What the Senator outlined was essentially that if the management of the council did not like the budget that was passed, it could write to the Minister to seek to have it overturned.  That is not what this provision will enable the Minister to do.  It concerns merely the annual rate struck by the local authority.  It ensures that local authorities do not pass on their entire net losses in a given year to the commercial ratepayers in their respective areas.  In this way, the losses would be spread more evenly throughout the different sources of funding available to local authorities.  However, there is no provision here to the effect that just because a county manager does not like a budget, he can seek to have it overturned.  It must be on the basis of the local authority members voting through a rate of valuation change which is outside the parameters within which local authorities normally vary their commercial rates at budget time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1438" speakername="Anthony Lawlor" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#EE00700"><p>Having experienced this first-hand in Kildare County Council, I agree with the Minister.  That council would have voted against a budget at local authority level if the members and the manager had proposed a rate increase on the commercial sector of 10% while the annual rate of inflation was 2%.  That would have been an 8% increase over and above the rate of inflation, which would impact not alone the ratepayers but also their customers in the area, the people who go into the shops and other retail outlets.  It is, therefore, very prudent of the Minister of State to put a provision such as this into the legislation.  The reason for it is to curtail irrational behaviour on the part of councillors and managers in local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Anthony Lawlor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As far as I can see, those who go above the rate of inflation in the context of increasing rates is doing harm to local businesses in their own areas.  This is a very prudent amendment.  On Second Stage, I proposed that when the Minister of State sends out the circular it should be consistent across the State rather than being selective for various counties.</p></speech>

I speak from experience as the leader of the Labour Party group on Dublin City Council for several years where there were year-on-year reductions in the commercial rates.  We said at the time that it was prudent to reduce the commercial rates.  It is worthwhile compiling the circular letter and including the information provided to councillors through the strategic policy committees.  Often, this information is not provided in a timely manner.  Generally, there is a budget information meeting for councillors which is followed very quickly by a vote on the estimates within two weeks.  If councillors are to be fully engaged in setting the rate and a budget for a local authority, that engagement has to start at a very early stage.  If a budget is to be set in October or November, for example, the engagement needs to be on a department-by-department basis, which is also resisted by the CEOs, formerly the county managers.  It is not good enough for overall figures to be provided at a budget information meeting.  If councillors really want to have that extensive control and democratisation of local authorities, then they must have the right to get the information to which I refer at a very early stage and at a departmental level.  A week into the system is too late to start fiddling around with budgets.  One cannot do it.  The only way one can have a real impact on budgets in a local authority is to have the engagement four or five months prior to the estimates.  That is the only way a councillor can act in a responsible manner.  He or she can see money being moved from one section to another and that the impact this has on services.</p> <p>It is not just the rates that affect local businesses, it is also the services provided to such businesses and how that happens.  In my experience, this information is not given in a timely manner to councillors in order that they can act in a prudent manner.  Members of Dublin City Council were given that information.  I am aware that it has not operated in the past five years because the council has been in chaos to some extent.  In fairness, Mr. John Tierney, the much maligned former Dublin City Council manager, bought into that level of engagement with the political parties and councillors were able to stand over the budget as a result.  It was not a budget that was implemented by the manager at the time, it was proposed by the councillors who took questions on that budget.  When looking at powers and if we really want to empower people by sending out circular letters relating to budgets and estimates, it would be very prudent if the Minister of State issued a circular letter in the new year instructing the CEOs of local authorities to carry out proper engagement with councillors at a very early stage.</p></speech>

Three town councils were abolished in County Mayo.  Rates equalisation brought all the rates up to the higher level, which was the county council rate.  Within the Ballina Town Council area, all the shops and businesses experienced rate increases.  This may have happened to a lesser degree in Castlebar and Westport - Castlebar is a county town and has a county council and Westport may be a different kettle of fish.  I can safely state that in my town of Ballina, the rates have increased and the services have diminished.  Already there are issues in Ballina.  I am aware that the matter has been well debated, but the abolition of the town councils has resulted in a greater centralisation of power to the chief executives of the councils.  I do not believe it has had the desired result in the context of helping all parts of a county or a local authority area.</p> <p>Commercial rates are a bigger burden on a small independent shop, retail outlet or cafe than they ever are on bigger businesses.  This is a general statement, but it is true.  The problem with smaller businesses on high streets is that they are competing with online retailers.  They cannot compete.  We can talk about market forces and it being the changing face of retail but another issue has to come into the debate, which is that we want vibrant town centres and we want these independent shops because their presence serves a public good.  They are, however, being treated pretty much like the big guy and cannot compete.  Compare this to a business that sells online, does not pay commercial rates and takes the money out of an area.</p> <p>I feel that we need a new model for the smaller shops.  The bigger retailers, multiple retailers and franchises can look after themselves.  There could be a threshold established for special treatment for some people in identified two centre areas.  Those town centres could be identified in conjunction with local authorities.  I can tell that I will get a good answer in respect of that proposal.  Hand in glove with that would be an incentive scheme to see people living back in the town centres.  There are schemes under the housing programme and other initiatives, but when one goes to the rural market towns or even some of the bigger centres with urban sprawl around towns they are not very appealing places.  Frankly, I am of the view that we need a more targeted approach.  By leaving it to market forces in some of the towns and villages, people will continue to go elsewhere, spend their money elsewhere, live elsewhere and shop elsewhere.  We need something radical.</p></speech>

The Minister of State can realise that all of us here are fighting for the smaller shops that are finding it hard to survive.  It is important that the Minister of State would meet the chief executives and local authority members.  Sometimes there is a lack of information for councillors or a lack of awareness among them.  It would be good for the Minister of State to send out regular letters to local authority members.  These are the councillors who do the work on the ground and deliver.  If the information was to come from the Minister of State and the chief executives of the councils, it would mean a lot to the councillors.  They would have more information.  I agree there should be more meetings with the local authority members and the chief executives of the council.  All of us should work together because we have a very big problem.  The smaller towns and rural towns are absolutely feeling the effect of this, and the smaller shops, cafes and businesses are fighting hard to survive.  I understand that we have to look after all businesses but we need to have some kind of a mechanism in place for the smaller shops.</p></speech>

This is a very important section.  I totally agree with the section but I would be happier if the variation or the direction the Minister of State may give was tied to something.  If it was tied to inflation, as Senator Lawlor stated, I would fully agree with that.  There might be 5% in one local authority area and 6% in another.  As has been stated, there are many money streams for the local authority members to take into account when finalising their budget.  Where does the relevant Minister draw the line in a local authority?  Would it be at 5% or 2% in one county, 0% in another county or would it be tied to inflation?  The guidelines might stated that it is tied to inflation and once it went above the rate of inflation, the local authority would have to notify the Minister.  It does not, however, seem to be tied to any relevant piece of work.  I would be happier if it was.  Otherwise, I fully agree with the section.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some councils and local authorities may feel it is very easy to put a huge burden on the ratepayer.  I saw situations where previous county managers felt 70% or 80% of the rates of the local authority were being paid by big business and multinationals when, at the same time, they were crucifying the smaller people, who were getting huge increases, those of them that had lasted in business.  I totally agree with this.  I hope the Minister of State will limit it to some reference point, whether annual inflation or an average of annual inflation over a number of years, or something like that.</p></speech>

One of the centrepieces in this Bill is the alleviation scheme that is provided for under section 15.  I spoke to the officials, when we were drafting this Bill originally, specifically with reference to rural towns and villages where the main street has suffered.  There is now online shopping and people's travel habits and work habits have changed, and it is all of those things.  It was a question of nailing down that alleviation scheme so that it can be designed by the members of a local authority.  For example, in the municipal district of Ballina, they would pick not just Ballina town but Killala and Crossmolina and say that on the main streets in those towns there would be a reduced rate for a period of time, and that is underpinned by what is in the local area plan or the county development plan for the Ballina district of County Mayo.  This legislation, for the first time, will give local authority members that power to introduce an alleviation scheme to target town centres in particular, because the Senators are correct that they have a social function.</p> <p>I had a situation recently where two constituents, a couple in their 80s, came to me.  They had an electrical shop in a town in my constituency and their valuation had increased to a level which was above their annual turnover.  The way the husband looked at it, he was going to work in his shop until he died and that was just it.  However, it was also the case that, within their town, it happened to be a big shop premises.  The way around it, in terms of reducing their valuation from the Valuation Office, was to divide their premises so that more than half of it would be vacant.  However, this defeats what the Department of Rural and Community Development is trying to do in terms of keeping town centres looking well and active.</p> <p>Section 15 allows for the six councillors in Ballina district, for example, to say that, on the basis of their local area plan or their county development plan or the targets of Department of Rural and Community Development, they want to do something for the town centres in their district.  That is what section 15 enables councillors to do for the first time.  I probably did not explain that.</p></speech>

That freedom is in the section.</p> <p>On Senator Paddy Burke's point about linking it to something, the issue is that there is such a variation.  Over 50% of the income of Dublin City Council is rates whereas it is 13% for some local authorities.  I would like to see it set at inflation but that might not be practicable in every local authority, particularly ones with a very small commercial rates base, which is why we have not specified it.</p> <p>I point out this is for use in extreme circumstances where councillors go off the reservation, so to speak, in terms of deviations from the ARV.  It is not something I would envisage being used generally.  To take in the point made by Senators Lawlor and Humphreys, that information is key and they are right, but some local authority members are better than others at looking for it.  I would have no problem if a similar letter were to be sent to the members of the local authority as well, and no problem in requesting early access to information for councillors before the budgetary process gets into full swing.</p></speech>

I welcome the section.  This issue comes up quite often in certain areas, especially where a business is struggling and may find it is only using half of the premises.  We then have to go to the local authority to try to find a way to get some sort of alleviation.  Will this apply not just to a whole building and could there be circumstances where it could apply to a portion of a building for a short period?</p> <p>What we often find is that the person goes to the local authority but it will effectively say it is only implementing the valuation put in place by the Valuation Office.  This could be a common-sense measure if it were used properly.  We do not want it to be open to abuse, whereby some people would retain vacant properties where they could let them at a reasonable rent and bring businesses into towns and villages in particular, as well as areas of the cities.  I am assuming this is not retrospective and that it will only apply moving forward.  I am linking it to section 10, which proposes that there would have to be a database.</p> <p>In the context of Limerick city, places like Castleconnell, Murroe, Cappamore and Caherconlish are towns and rural villages where we would like to encourage businesses to set up.  However, in many cases, SMEs would be reluctant to take a whole building and the owner of the building would be unwilling to let a portion of the building.  I note it is a reserved function.  Will this level of flexibility be available to allow a local authority to come up with a scheme?</p> <p>When does the Minister of State anticipate that the regulations for the scheme will be issued to the local authorities?  When will this come into being?  When will the local authority in Limerick city and county be able to come up with a scheme that allows abatement of rates over a period for hard-pressed businesses, for businesses that may be downsizing, or for businesses that want to set up but which cannot pay the rates for the entire building?

It is important that we have a timescale for small shops with an upstairs not in use but which might have been used for storage.  That is so important.  Another person came to me about a garage.  Half the garage was being used and it was too big.  He shut off half of it.  There are major issues with that.</p> <p>Certain counties were revalued.  The work was privatised and carried out by a company.  Some of the revaluations were done off a map.  Those doing the work did not go down to each shop and measure the premises.  Does the Minister of State have any concerns about that?  I know of shops that would have been left with valuations from years ago.  The same size would have been on the map but if someone had gone into the shop and revalued it, then the calculation would have been different.  Can the Minister of State clarify the position on revaluation?  Who is doing it?  Does every local authority have someone doing it?  Is the Minister of State going to have it privatised?  What is the timescale?  Can the Minister of State clarify those points?</p></speech>

Are they both the same?  Will the Minister of State outline the difference between abatement and a waiver?  This is an important section.  My local authority introduced an 85% waiver.  For a closed property, the local authority charges rates at 15% of the value.  Is that a waiver or abatement?</p></speech>

Obviously, rates would be due but the collection would be zero and they would have been written off at the end of the year by the council or the manager.  How does it operate under this section?  A person could be letting a property.  It might be let for two or three months of the year.  There might be change or a new lease drawn up and the place might be closed for a further two or three months.  Does the person look for an abatement or waiver for that?  How does it operate?  Does the person apply for the waiver?  What if the owner cannot rent or sell the premises?  What if there are other complications associated with handing down properties, including disputes and so on?  There are many complications with properties when they are closed for one reason or another.  In any event, when the Bill is enacted will someone have to apply for the abatement or waiver?  Heretofore, if there were problems with the property or disagreements within families, no one took action until D-day came and the asset was disposed of.  If the waiver or abatement is not applied for, will a bill have accrued over time?  Do the people who own the property or estate find that they owe a sizable amount to the local authority with interest and so forth?</p></speech>

If a new occupier was taking possession or occupation of a portion of a building, then it would have to be revalued for that portion.</p><p>I cannot really get into the nitty-gritty referred to by Senator Murnane O'Connor about whether the Commissioner for Valuation has the same status as the Revenue Commissioners.  The Senator is right that a private company carried out work.  As I understand it, there may be more of that.  We may require more of it because there is a backlog.  I will certainly raise some of the issues pointed out about maps and so on.  These are legitimate questions.</p><p>Senator Burke asked about the difference between abatement and alleviation.  Abatement effectively is a refund.  At the end of the year the local authority in most counties may decide that, while there might be &euro;10,000 owing on a given commercial premises, since it is unoccupied the bill will effectively be written off.  Whether we call it a waiver or alleviation, the alleviation scheme is really on the basis of achieving objectives of a local area plan, county development plan or the national development plan.  As I said to Senator Mulherin, there may be a target in the Mayo County Council plan for the ten largest towns in the county if we want to get people working and living on the main streets.  That would be the basis of the alleviation scheme.</p><p>Senator Mulherin raised the question of a business closing.  Section 4 for the first time allows a <i>pro rata</i>system to be established for the payment of rates.  Heretofore if a business closed for a portion of a year, the owner would effectively still be liable for the full rates to be paid.  Now, if a business closes for a period for renovations or if it closes through natural causes, notification to the local authority will cease the liability for rates.  Equally, if a new occupier comes in, then he or she will be liable for the remaining portion of the year.  This is a change from the old legislation of 1836.</p></speech>

This amendment would amend section 15 of the Bill, which permits the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to issue regulations to allow a local authority to develop schemes for the waiving of all, or a portion of, the rates due by ratepayers under the Bill.  The section lists certain strategies, plans and objectives within different Acts which the local authority can use to justify waiving rates for ratepayers.  These include a national spatial strategy under the Planning and Development Act 2000 and other plans which allow for balanced social, economic and physical development  Local authorities are essentially being empowered to waive rates where certain existing public policy and urban and rural development objectives, set out in legislation such as the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Local Government Act 2001, are met and where the waiving of the rate is justifiable to achieve those aims.</p><p>My amendment adds a provision which would allow a local authority to cite charitable purposes in accordance with the Charities Act 2009 as grounds for developing a scheme to allow ratepayers to apply for a waiver of rates or a portion of rates if in keeping with the charitable purposes in the 2009 Act.  Examples of these purposes are listed in section 3 of the Act and include important issues such as the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship, the advancement of education, as well as more specific issues such as the promotion of civic responsibility, health, conflict resolution, racial harmony and harmonious community relations and the protection of the natural environment.  I have not mentioned a number of other excellent purposes listed in the Act but I recommend that Members look at them.</p><p>My motivation in tabling this amendment is to give local authorities the space and legislative basis to develop charitable purposes as grounds for exempting groups and organisations engaging in this crucial work.  The State needs to support these organisations and exempt them from the financial obligation of paying rates in light of the excellent and worthwhile work they do in supporting community development and positive change.  They deserve the opportunity to apply for waivers on their rates.  I have in mind in particular youth groups and premises in local authority areas, such as charity shops.  Some smaller charity shops are more of a service than a shop in a retail sense.  For example, there is a charity shop in Tallaght called Manna, which is run in partnership with the YMCA and a local church.  Its annual profit of approximately &euro;1,600 goes straight back into YMCA activities.  However, the shop is considered a retail organisation and is paying rates at a level that will see it close its doors at the end of July.  It applied for a charitable waiver in 2017 but South Dublin County Council has not yet engaged in communication with it.  It has not even received a response to its application and is now receiving sheriff's notices.  The shop operates in a community with a high level of poverty and provides a space where people can engage with its workers, have a connection to Christian organisations and the YMCA and buy clothes at a price of &euro;1 or &euro;2.  It is a worthwhile shop in the Tallaght community.</p><p>Many other health and well-being services were set up during the years of austerity.  I have seen how young men have done training in health and fitness to enable them to open up gyms in the community and provide local jobs.  Such organisations would not be seen as charitable but nevertheless contribute to a community and its health.  During the years of austerity, many of these places kept people's lives together when, due to harsh economic realities, they had no control in other areas of their lives.  People engaged in fitness at a much higher level during the years of austerity than they did at any other time.  The number of gym members increased, as did participation in local boot camps and wellness activities, because the only aspect of their lives people could control was their appearance, as they had lost control of everything else.  As the economy picks up, many smaller organisations and charity shops that do not make a profit are being forced out of the local economies they were crucial in maintaining during the worst economic period in our generation.  I hope the Minister of State will look favourably on this amendment and introduce a decent appeals and waiver system that is transparent and does not operate like the current system, where charity shops such as Manna have to close because they are being threatened with sheriffs.</p></speech>

I would like to see them fully exempt from rates.  Whatever about gyms, it is important that charitable activity is encouraged, especially in villages with derelict or empty shops.  Why not put them to use for the community?  As Senator Ruane said, people can buy cheap clothes in these shops, which is a socially useful thing to do.  I got myself a magnificent overcoat by a well-known designer for &euro;50 in one such shop.  I gave the shop an extra &euro;50 because I wanted to support the charity.  This was during my presidential campaign when I was wandering around meeting and greeting people, and I got a bloody good coat out of it.</p></speech>

However, I see merit in what Senator Ruane is saying.  This issue could be addressed in the regulations.  These shops could be included in an abatement-type programme so they are at least seen to be paying something or included as part of the scheme within local authorities.  If the Minister of State wishes to have the Bill progress quickly, perhaps he could give a commitment to address this issue in the regulations.

The high street was devastated a few years ago and is now doing very well, albeit only in certain areas.  One of the downsides of that is that community spaces will be squeezed out.  Senator Ruane has explained extremely well the damage that is being done and the severe pressure charity shops are already under.  This amendment strikes me as very reasonable and I hope the Minister of State will respond to it in a reasonable manner.</p></speech>

It is a cumbersome system and it is important that the Department makes charities aware that such a scheme is in place.  Many of them are not aware of it and, having dealt with them, I know the system is cumbersome and awkward.  We are talking about a waiver scheme but the bulk of the charities Senator Ruane is talking about should be entitled to charitable status under national policy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are put through a very onerous and cumbersome system to qualify for it.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to get it.  There needs to be a balance for charities which make very little profit but give so much to the community and have many people depending on them.  We need some sort of waiver or regulation such that we ensure that we look after such charities which provide a service.  I support the Bill.  The charities will understand the importance of working with their local authority, which is dealt with in this section of the Bill.  I support this section of the Bill.</p></speech>

I can see that will present a problem for the Minister of State.  I would not like the House to divide on the matter but rather find another way around the problem.  I look forward to the reply of the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#KK00500"><p>Senator Ruane emailed me to inform me of her amendment.  I must confess that I put forward a similar proposal when I was a finance spokesperson in this House in a previous life.  Senator Norris said he did likewise.  All those who spoke on the amendment are in favour of it.  I support what it is trying to achieve, but I wish to get into some of the detail referred to by Senator O'Donnell.</p> <p>The intention of the amendment may be to allow for the exemption of charity shops from rates.  However, the Valuation Acts already provide that certain categories of property are not rateable.  These details are set out in Schedule 4, which is currently the subject of a review which will conclude in the near future.  The exemptions include a property occupied by a charity and used exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for profit.  As Senator O'Donnell outlined, it is probably that many organisations do not avail of the exemption, possibly because they are not fully aware of it or, as Senator Murnane O'Connor stated, because charitable status is no longer as straightforward as was previously the case.</p> <p>The difficulty is that the exemption does not cover retail activity.  Senator Lawlor yesterday referenced a town in his constituency in which there are several charity shops, some of which are in direct competition with small draper-type shops.  I do not hold a candle for the big multiples, whether in a shopping centre or on a main street, but I do for the few surviving small drapery shops and similar that exist in towns throughout the country.  In effect, some of the bigger national charitable shops are in competition with those drapers.</p> <p>There has been no change in policy in this area in recent years.  I think Deputy Harris was the Minister of State who oversaw the passage of the most recent valuation legislation in 2015.  I am mindful that many Senators expressed concerns on this matter.  The aims of Senator Ruane in the amendment can be achieved under the alleviation scheme in section 15.  To use her example, if the kind of wellness centre referred to by the Senator which is not just a gym but deals with other issues, possibly mental health issues, were stitched into South Dublin County Council's development plan or the local area plan for Tallaght, it would be covered by the alleviation scheme.  I do not wish to enshrine in national legislation a measure from which some of the big charity shops that are in competition with local small businesses will benefit.  That is not the Senator's intention either.  Local authority members on the ground in Tallaght, Kilkenny and elsewhere know the type of organisations in their area, including the shop she mentioned which is run in partnership with the YMCA as well as wellness centres, and are able to design their development plan or local area plan to provide for such facilities without giving a blanket free-for-all to the charity shop sector.  Section 15 will allow the local authorities to achieve what the Senator is seeking to do through the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#KK00600"><p>As the Minister of State identified, the issue arises in respect of retail premises.  I am not an expert on local government and, unlike certain other Senators, did not come to the Seanad from that area.  Some of the shops which were visited were told they possibly should not have identified themselves as retail premises.  The shops were just trying to be honest in their engagement.  There must be some sort of upper and lower limits on what is seen as profit.  The annual &euro;1,600 profit turnover of the charity shop to which I referred is being swept up with the larger charity shops which pay lots of wages and so on from their profits, but they are different situations.  There needs to be some sort of communication to or guidelines for local authorities regarding an upper limit on what is seen as profit and a consideration of the ultimate goal of small sums such as that to which I referred.  Is the ultimate goal to pay a wage or employ someone new or is it a charitable goal?  In the case to which I referred, the outcome is charitable - the organisation runs a youth service - even though it is a retail operation.  It is about the level of flexibility of local authorities in terms of how they frame what is a retail business and the consideration of its profit.  Can we give them more discretion in terms of how they determine what profit-making means in real terms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-07-10a.482" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019071000002#KK00700"><p>The best way to achieve the Senator's aims is through section 15 because if the amendment were to be introduced, it would allow the bigger charitable shops competing with existing smaller retailers, particularly in smaller towns, to get through a gap.  The requirements she outlined could easily be stitched into the local area plan in Tallaght, for example, such that organisations involved in community development etc. would be exempt.  They are already exempt in terms of certain properties they occupy, but that could be extended to their retail premises.</p> <p>The Senator is correct to point out that there is a significant difference between making &euro;1,600 and investing it in charitable purposes and companies that are making significant profits.  That is why stitching the amendment into national legislation would be akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and could allow organisations through a gap, which is not the Senator's intention.  There are 11 recently elected local councillors in Tallaght between the two districts who sit as an area committee and make the ultimate decision on what goes into the Tallaght local area plan.  They have a level of local knowledge which I, my successors, the rates commissioner or the staff in the rates section of the Department do not. That is why the alleviation scheme in section 15 is appropriate to these circumstances.  It is a new initiative.  I outlined to Senator Mulherin its role in terms of planning objectives in the centre of some regional towns.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, one of the other purposes is to allow for that level of local knowledge.  The issue of people receiving letters from the sheriff about rates owed was mentioned.  We want a rates scheme that is flexible and reactive to the reality of the situation on the ground, wherever that is.</p><p>If an issue is underpinned by the county development plan, the local area plan or the city development plan, it can form the basis of how an alleviation scheme or an aspect of same can operate.  While that might not include a commercial gym, I see how it could cover the type of centre that was mentioned.  The Senator is completely right.  I have never been to a gym, but people are more conscious of other local issues and their role in same, particularly during a recession.  The membership of gyms and the like has increased significantly.  For half the people who go to gyms, it is a mental health issue as much as a physical health one, given that endorphins are, I am told, released when people exercise.  The section 15 provision allowing for an alleviation scheme would cater for the types of scenario that the Senator outlined.</p><p>I am not in a position to accept the charitable purposes amendment in full.  It would have other adverse effects, particularly in provincial towns where small draperies or retailers can be in competition with large charity retail outlets.</p><p>I hope that my answer is sufficient for the Senator.</p></speech>

That is different from the position of some of the other - "more professionally run" is not the right term - more business-oriented charity shop organisations.  As well as being drawn up and finalised by the councillors, the alleviation scheme will be subject to public consultation in much the same way as development plans and local area plans.  Members of the public and businesses can seek to feed their own stories into the final decision on policy at local government level.</p></speech>

We cannot address circumstances case by case.  The point I will make is very local.  I never do that, so I will allow myself this once.  The Minister of State referred to the public consultation process, but the likes of the Manna Charity Shop will not exist when this Bill is signed into law.  The rates section of the Department and the local authority need to prioritise an appeal that was made in 2017 but which has not been denied or communicated on.  If something could be done in the interim while we examined other parts of section 15 that could benefit such organisations, it would ensure that a vital service would not close by the end of the month before it could even avail of section 15.</p></speech>

Large-scale changes will be required.  We have been focusing on housing, but they will also affect businesses and others across the country.  I reserve the right to try for an amendment on Report Stage.  If a local authority that is trying to achieve a climate or environmental target wants to give an incentive in the form of even a partial waiver of rates or a reduction in same in respect of those businesses that engaged in active retrofitting, how would that fit with this Bill?  I may table an amendment on this.</p></speech>

If it is a policy objective of the local authority or, as in this example, the recently announced Government policy on climate change, what the Senator outlined is something that could have many impacts, particularly in respect of older retail premises.  To use the example again of a small drapery shop on a main street in a rural town, insulation and energy preservation might not have been significant issues heretofore, but if the owners retrofit their shop, section 15 as drafted will allow the relevant council - it could be urban or rural - to reduce the rates payable in a given year under its alleviation scheme where premises have been retrofitted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Paul Phelan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will fall to each local authority and to council members to make their own scheme.

I recognise that it is a matter of concern for councillors.  It was an anomaly in the rates legislation of a number of years ago that the offices of Oireachtas Members were rates-exempt while those of other public representatives were not.  I do not think this was done on purpose but was an oversight.  The playing pitch has to be levelled fully and I would include MEPs in this also.  Commercial rates should apply to commercial activity, whether it is in a charity shop or a large multiple, but they should not apply to stuff that is not commercial activity.  It should apply to councillors' offices as well as those of Oireachtas Members.</p></speech>

However, I have been intrigued over the years by the fact that the valuation never changes.  When new businesses start with huge rates, the valuations of other properties do not go down.  In my county, the gas pipeline went right through the centre of the county, from the west coast to the east coast.  It had a huge rates bill of over &euro;1 million, which the local authority is lucky to be getting.  It should mean the valuation relating to other ratepayers should go down.  When new properties come online with big valuations, one would expect the global valuation certificate to change but I have never seen that.  It always goes up, in every town, and the valuation of Dublin, for example, has probably quadrupled in the past 30 years.</p></speech>

When the revenue-neutral aspect of the revaluation process is mentioned, it means it is revenue-neutral in terms of the existing rates base.  When a new business opens, such as when a wind farm is rated, the initial revenue does not go towards evening out the rates that are collected.  "Revenue-neutral" refers to the existing rate base.  Global buoyancy is included by amending section 56 of the Valuation Act.  One of the main provisions which makes this legislation so time-sensitive is that there are a number of local authorities that will shortly embark on the revaluation process, at the same time as a revaluation for utilities is about to commence.  Buoyancy created by new developments by utility companies could have been included in the overall pie of rates revenue in the relevant local authority and could have led to large utilities benefitting greatly from the rates revaluation, to the detriment of smaller businesses.  This legislation separates the process of revaluation of global utilities from the process for mainstream business in a local authority area, such as Senator Paddy Burke's.</p></speech>
