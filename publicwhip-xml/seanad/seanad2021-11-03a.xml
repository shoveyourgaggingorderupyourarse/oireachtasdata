I thank the Minister of State for coming here today to discuss this all-important topic.</p> <p>I welcome, first of all, the increase in funding to do with Garda recruitment and Garda numbers in budget 2022 and acknowledge the work that the Minister of State and the Department have been doing in this regard.  Listening to local radio and reading local newspapers, there has been an increase in minor crime, such as break-ins.  In my area, there were five cars broken into recently.  There were some very valuable items taken out of the boots of people's cars.  You would say when something is in a boot that people would not know that it is there.  Certainly, from listening to the radio, reading the newspapers and speaking to residents in different areas, it is in every town and village.  It not just in cities.  While there are increased numbers of garda&iacute;, there are a number of retirements as well.  I would like a debate on how the extra resources that have been allocated in this budget will be used to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour.</p></speech>

It is a matter that is important to Senator Maria Byrne, who has raised it on a number of occasions.</p> <p>The Government recognises the great harm that can be done to communities living with antisocial behaviour.  We are committed to ensuring that antisocial behaviour is tackled head-on and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is provided with the necessary resources to do so.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Senator will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible under law for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes the planning and deployment of Garda resources in response to crime trends.  The Minister for Justice has no role in such directions.</p><p>Prioritising visible policing in rural and urban communities will ensure community policing is at the forefront of our police service and an integral strand of our social contract with the public.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to implement high-visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and antisocial behaviour, with a particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and antisocial behaviour typically increase.  For example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has put in place Operation Citizen in Dublin city centre which is aimed at reassuring the public that Dublin city is safe through high-visibility patrolling, particularly at hot-spot locations and also through community engagement.  The Garda mobile unit was located on O'Connell Street last weekend.  This was well received and I understand this will continue for the duration of the operation.</p><p>I am, of course, aware of recent incidents of antisocial behaviour on public transport.  A key element of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na 's community policing role involves ongoing, extensive Garda engagement with transport operators and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address the antisocial behaviour incidents on public transport that have occurred in recent times. </p><p>I am pleased that budget 2022 provided an unprecedented allocation of over &euro;2 billion in funding, reflecting the commitment of the Government to ensuring our communities are safe and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources for effective policing.  I am happy to confirm that 450 garda&iacute; will be recruited by the end of this year and that funding provided for next year fully supports the sustained recruitment of Garda members and staff, with provision for the recruitment of an additional 800 Garda members and 400 Garda staff in 2022, amounting to an additional 1,200 personnel.  The 400 additional Garda staff are very important in that their recruitment will allow for garda&iacute; deployed to administrative duties to be returned to operational duties.  Approximately 800 garda&iacute; have been already moved from administrative to operational duties.  As I said, the additional 400 Garda staff will help further that aim.  This increase in the number of Garda members and staff will deliver significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide and in improved services to the public generally.  Redeployment of garda&iacute; from administrative and support roles will also continue next year.</p><p>The Senator will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is also introducing a new Garda operating model designed to make each division the central unit of policing administration as the current smaller district model is struggling to deal with the modern crime environment.  This model will provide a more comprehensive and inclusive policing service and will help further strengthen the focus on community policing.  We can all be very proud of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has been operational since the foundation of the State.  It is a community-based policing service, which came to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of being absolutely instrumental in ensuring that our communities were protected and that the more vulnerable were looked after.</p><p>I welcome the budget 2022 allocation of &euro;2 million to the community safety innovation fund.  The intention is that the operation of the fund will be reviewed and that further allocations will be part of the normal budgetary process.  This fund will be open to bodies involved in community safety and will support them in addressing local needs and opportunities for innovation not provided for in other funds managed by Departments and agencies.</p></speech>

There is an issue with regard to safety cameras in that, I am told, residents associations do not have access to funding for them.  Perhaps that could be looked at by the Minister.  When cameras and extra lighting are provided in areas, it helps people to feel safe and also it helps the garda&iacute; in their role.</p> <p>I pay tribute to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is doing a great job under difficult circumstances.  The reduction in Garda numbers in certain areas is leading to petty crime.  People are upset about this.  I ask that consideration be given to the installation of more cameras and to the provision of additional community policing.  I would like to see more garda&iacute; on the streets.  Perhaps the current recruitment of the additional staff for the offices will help in the return of more garda&iacute; to our streets.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to tackling antisocial behaviour.  As Minister of State at the Department of Justice, I was honoured to set up the antisocial behaviour forum, which has met on a regular basis since its establishment last year.  Earlier this year, it produced recommendations around scramblers, both in terms of tackling, on a community basis, why the scramblers are being misused by young people and to try to direct their energies to more positive activities but also in terms of recommendations around road traffic laws to see if Garda powers can be strengthened where, despite interventions, people are still insisting on misusing scramblers, particularly in our cities.  The antisocial behaviour forum has set up a sub-task force around knife crime.  We are looking at what other areas it might tackle as well.</p> <p>In addition, three pilot local community safety partnerships have been established.  These are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the communities.  The work of the community safety partnerships is similar to the work of the local community development committees, LCDCs, in terms of bringing together all of the different actors within a community to address crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only do so much.  We need to tackle the underlying issues and we need to bring in the HSE, the local authorities, Tusla and other relevant bodies to help take on any issue around antisocial behaviour.</p></speech>

I am delighted he could be here with us this morning.  What prompted me to put forward this Commencement matter was anger and frustration in regard to the inconsistent access to public transport in this country, which I hear about and witness, but do not experience because I am able-bodied.  When I want to travel by train or bus I can do so.  However, for thousands of citizens in this country who wish to travel they have to jump through hoops.  They have to pre-book, plan and make arrangements and be ready to be let down at all times.  They face barriers and blockages and cannot obtain either access or answers.  These are our friends and neighbours and their human rights are being denied and, often, ignored.</p> <p>I want to a highlight a particular situation that occurred last Saturday.  Vicky Matthew took to Facebook to highlight that Connolly railway station in Dublin had failed to meet its obligations to her as a customer.  She had given 24 hours notice that she would require ramp and assistance.  This lady did everything that she was supposed to do, but she was abandoned on the train.  She telephoned the station for help, but nobody arrived to assist.  A random passenger helped her by getting a ramp to enable her to get off the train.  This is unacceptable.  We have to find a better way of providing equity in our society.</p> <p>Another situation involved a man from Louth, Mr. John Morgan, who highlighted to me that he had been prevented from travelling to Wales to see a relative.  He had purchased flights and planned to travel to Dublin Airport from Dundalk via the Bus &Eacute;ireann 100X service.  He left home early in the morning to ensure he would be on time for his flight.  He had contacted Bus Eireann two weeks in advance to ask about wheelchair accessibility on the 100X service.  His call was promptly returned and he was told that the bus leaving Dundalk was not accessible.  It is not an accessible route and that meant he could not get to the airport.  Owing the lack of infrastructure, he was prevented from travelling.</p> <p>The infrastructure on public transport does not fully enable the freedom of movement on all modes of transport.  This is not only about access, it is about having to give notice.  It is about singling people out to be different, making them do things differently to those of us who are able bodied.  Therefore, it is not about choice but about planning ahead for a smooth journey to become a reality.  The lack of accessible transport services impacts on inclusion, social interaction, jobs, education and mental health.  The cost of living with a disability affects not only the disabled person but his or her family and community, as well as every aspect of his or her life.  For some disabled people, transport is inaccessible for small and simple reasons such as human error, lengthy pre-booking requirements, inaccessible routes and because the built environment does not link with the transport service, that is, the bus does not connect with the pavement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When that happens it means that the route is inaccessible.  </p><p>Independent Living Movement Ireland has done excellent research and I am delighted the Minister is in the House as I can give him copies of its research.  The organisation is a disabled person's organisation, DPO, that is run by people who know their story best, which means they are the best advocates for themselves.</p><p>I highlighted in my Commencement matter that our rights are obligations of the State, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  Article 9 relates to transport and states "To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications".  We should not block them and I hope that we will adopt the optional protocol to the convention, as it will ensure that we are accountable for not taking action on accessibility. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#C00200"><p>The Senator is absolutely right to quote Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As she said, the article puts obligations on State parties to ensure access for persons with disabilities to, <i>inter alia</i>, transportation in both urban and rural areas.  In line with that article, my Department and its agencies are progressively making public transport accessible for people with disabilities, including in rural areas, by ensuring that new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start, and by retrofitting older legacy infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible.</p><p>Accessibility features, such as wheelchair accessibility and audio or visual aids or both, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from their design stage.  Newer systems such as the Luas are fully accessible, as are all new buses purchased by the National Transport Authority.  However, as the examples cited by the Senator in respect of Connolly Station and Mr. Morgan and his difficulties show, work remains to be done, particularly on the retrofitting of older legacy infrastructure such as a lot of our Victorian-era train stations.  My Department, therefore, funds an ongoing accessibility retrofit programme that is managed by the NTA, which includes programmes to install accessible bus stops in rural and regional areas, to upgrade bus bays at regional bus and train stations, to upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and to provide grant support to increase the number of wheelchair-accessible taxis. </p><p>The Department has developed a number of three-year sectoral plans called Transport Access for All, under the Disability Act 2005.  The concept for Transport Access for All is based on the principle of accessible public transport that does not distinguish between people with disabilities and other passengers.  The third sectoral plan was published in 2012.  The first whole-of-government national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, was established in 2013, followed by the current NDIS for the years 2017 to 2022, which covers all sectors of society, including transport.</p><p>In addition to the NDIS, the UNCRPD, and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024, there are a range of other national strategies that contain actions towards making public transport accessible for persons with disabilities, persons with reduced mobility and older people.  All of these actions across all such strategies have been combined into the Department of Transport's accessibility work programme, which is in effect the successor to the sectoral plans.</p><p>My Department's accessibility work programme provides the framework for prioritising projects and programmes to progressively make public transport accessible.  It is a living document that is updated quarterly in advance of meetings of the accessibility consultative committee, ACC, and the NDIS steering group.</p><p>Under the national disability inclusion strategy, each Department is required to have a disability consultative committee to oversee and monitor the actions assigned to it and its agencies.  My Department's consultative committee is called the accessibility consultative committee.  It is the successor to the Department's public transport accessibility committee, which was established in 2000.  Members of the accessibility consultative committee are drawn from organisations that represent people with disabilities, members of the disability stakeholders group and key agencies under the aegis of my Department, as well as other relevant State agencies.  The ACC uses the accessibility work programme to monitor progress in progressively making public transport accessible in line with the UNCRPD, the NDIS and other national strategies.  The next accessibility work programme update will be published in early December on the <i>gov.ie</i>portal.  That is where previous updates along with minutes of all ACC meetings can be found.</p></speech>

This is a great country for producing policies and documents but work and investment are needed.  We are talking about encouraging everybody onto public transport.  I would love to have a safe and accessible transport for all of my community and friends because I want to know that they are going to be safe.  I want to know that they are not going to be blocked getting on or off a bus or train and that people who are visually impaired know at all times where they are.</p> <p>Accessibility is not about equality.  We are all equal and we all should have equal access.  Accessibility is about equity.  We need to build equity within the infrastructure and create a fairer society.  Citizens with disabilities deserve every single right and deserve not to have barriers put in front of them.  Almost 15% of the population has some sort of a disability and, therefore, are a huge cohort of our friends and community.  I thank the Minister for his time. </p></speech>

Let us take the Luas as an example, because it was designed as an accessible system.  Such infrastructure benefits everyone, whether that be a parent with a child in a buggy, someone in a wheelchair or someone who is visually impaired because it has been designed for people with disability.</p> <p>I want to give some further detail as background.  Lifts at stations has been a critical issue for disability.  This year, we have provided an investment of &euro;5.8 million and an additional &euro;2 million was provided in recognition that we need to accelerate the programme.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned an incident that occurred at Connolly Station, which is a real concern.  My understanding is that as there is not a mechanism or an automatic wheelchair ramp facility for heavy rail systems, someone from Irish Rail must be in attendance.  In the instance cited, another passenger was in attendance for whatever reason, which is not acceptable.  Irish Rail is developing a smartphone accessibility app to address some of the key communications breakdowns that occur - as human error can occur - when providing assistance to persons with disabilities.  I hope that initiative may see such instances not happen in the future.</p> <p>Let me refer to Mr. Morgan's experience on the coach.  My understanding is, and the information that I now have, is that all long-distance coach types require the removal of up to four seats to be accessible and that is why there is a 24-hour notice requirement.  I am surprised that the Dundalk route did not have a coach where seats could be taken out for whatever reason.</p> <p>I have been told that in the case of long-distance coaches, they do not yet have anything other than high-floor options, which present some difficulties in terms of making travel easily accessible.  For all public service obligation, PSO, regional commuter routes now - up to something like 50 km - new buses are coming that, typically, will have low-floor access thereby allowing wheelchair users to board with normal ramp access.  So the situation is slowly changing.  It is particularly difficult on older rail and on long-distance bus services but that should not stop us looking to make sure that they are as accessible as any new services that we provide. </p></speech>

I will start by putting on record our thanks for his support in creating the technological university of the south east that was announced yesterday.  The initiative is a game changer for the region.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The appointment of Professor Philip Nolan, the former president of Maynooth University, as the director general of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is welcome.  We should reflect on the wonderful contribution that the outgoing director general, Professor Mark Ferguson, has made.  However, the role of director general and that of the Government's chief scientific adviser should never have been combined.  With the appointment of Professor Nolan, there is an ideal opportunity to split the two.  SFI plays a crucial role as a national research funding agency, but it is essential that the office of the chief scientific adviser be independent and not in any way perceived to be influenced by funding decisions or to favour any particular type of scientific research.  Splitting the two roles is something that many academics have called for, including the Royal Irish Academy, RIA.</p><p>We should consider establishing a scientific advisory council to support the Government's chief scientific adviser.  There are similar operations in other jurisdictions, for example, the Netherlands, France and the US.  The remit of the Dutch scientific council is to advise the Dutch Government and Parliament on strategic issues that are likely to have important political and social consequences.  We have seen the benefit of independent advisory councils in terms of climate change and economic policy.  We cannot expect the Government's chief scientific adviser to have a knowledge of every issue ranging from nanotechnology to artificial intelligence.  Given the importance of science and research to our future economic development as well as the convergence of new technologies, it is important that the Government be informed and up to date on the possible societal implications of those changes.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's announcement that Ireland will move towards having a national research policy.  I hope it covers laryngitis and research into how we can cure it quickly.  It is essential that we have a public policy to underpin a research direction and research infrastructure.</p><p>The Minister is committed to this area and I look forward to his answer.  In particular, there is an immediate opportunity to split two key roles.</p></speech>

I will begin as he did by remarking on the importance of yesterday's announcement of a technological university for the south east.  I thank the Senator for his support and leadership on this matter.  As chair of the cross-party group of Oireachtas Members from the south east, he convened Members from all political persuasions a number of times to engage with me.  I found that helpful in reaching this point and working through issues in the interests of the region as a whole rather than people playing party politics with the matter.  There is always a bit of the latter but, thankfully, there was not that much in this instance, as people worked together for the region.  I reiterate our commitment to delivering the Wexford site.  I thank Wexford County Council for working with us on that matter.  A Wexford campus will be a core part of the university.</p> <p>I am delighted to be invited to the Seanad to discuss an issue of science.  I am pleased that, next week being science week, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il have decided to have debates on science.  I look forward to participating in those.  I am not sure that the Houses do enough in that regard, so I welcome the debates.</p> <p>As the Senator is aware, the substantive post of chief science adviser was abolished in 2012.  Upon that happening, the current director general of SFI was given the title of chief scientific adviser on an unremunerated basis.  I join the Senator in paying tribute to Professor Ferguson, who has been a superb chief scientific adviser and director general at a crucial time for science and research in our country.  I thank Professor Ferguson for his leadership and work.</p> <p>The current unremunerated role of chief scientific adviser will fall vacant when the current director general retires this year.  As such, it is a natural moment in time to reassess the situation.  Professor Nolan will become the next director general of SFI in January 2022.  I congratulate him in that regard and look forward to working with him.</p> <p>I intend to bring a memorandum to the Government next week on the next steps that I intend to take in respect of the role of chief scientific adviser.  I would be happy to return to the Seanad once I have done so.  I will give the House some of my thoughts now, though.  It is important that our science advice structures can evolve.  The past 18 months have shown that, not only in respect of Covid, but also in terms of climate change and many other issues, including those the Senator mentioned.  I strongly believe that there is a need to ensure that whatever structures we put in place enable science to be at the heart of all of our discussions as a Government and an Oireachtas and embed access to scientific and research advice and expertise in policy decision making.  When we as legislators followed public health expertise during the pandemic, we did well in general.  In times when we did not, perhaps we did not do as well.  Following expert advice and embedding it in policymaking is a good thing.</p> <p>I agree with the Senator that one scientist cannot be an expert in every aspect of science.  Perhaps it shows a lack of understanding on our part of the breadth of disciplines when we talk about "science".  How can we put a structure in place that enables a resource to be available with a range of expertise to support the work of a chief scientific adviser?  Scientists have different areas of expertise and can bring a wide range of views to the wide range of issues that we face as a society.  It is important that the Government and the Oireachtas have access to a range of expertise and advice.</p> <p>I am preparing a memo to bring to the Cabinet next week.  I will have a chance to update my Government colleagues on my thinking, after which I will be happy to return to the Seanad.  Indeed, we will have a debate on science next week, which might be a chance for me to do that.  Whatever we decide to do will be based on a couple of elements, the first of which will be best international practice and international comparators, that is, how other countries have managed to do this and evolve their structures.  Second, we will enable a chance to engage with the scientific community.  The Senator mentioned the RIA, which has done great work on this matter.  Academia has strong views and the public is beginning to engage in our conversations.</p> <p>Regarding the Senator's second question, my Department is developing a new national strategy for research and innovation.  Development is ongoing.  There have been many action-led work programmes mapping out specific desirables.  A public consultation was held in June and July, with more than 115 submissions received.  The new strategy will aim to strengthen the capability and capacity of our research and innovation system to deliver excellence and impact and make a real difference to the lives of our citizens.  A great deal of cross-departmental and agency work is ongoing.  I intend to bring a draft strategy to a Cabinet committee by the end of the year and i am likely to publish the strategy at the beginning of the new year.</p></speech>

It is essential that Government decisions be based on science and research.  The Minister is right, in that, when we follow the science and the evidence, we tend to get better outcomes.  Evidence-based policymaking should be at the heart of government.</p> <p>I look forward to next week's debate on science.  I appreciate that the Minister is not giving the House a direct answer, but on the basis of what he is saying, I am optimistic that he will be announcing that we will have the independent chief scientific adviser role recreated and that he is open to the idea of a scientific advisory council based on the evidence from other jurisdictions.</p> <p>We are living in a period of phenomenal change and it is important that we be willing to use all of the evidence garnered from science and research to inform everything that we do at Government level.  I look forward to the debate next week and I take the Minister's response positively, even though he may not have said it directly.</p></speech>

Let me say this - I am recognising on the floor of the Seanad that the structures that are in place need to evolve and change.  I am certainly not saying that the <i>status quo</i>should continue.  There needs to be an evolution of the structures.</p><p>The world is a different place than it was in 2012.  Our country is a different place and its needs are different.  I passionately believe that our future economic and social well-being as individuals, as a country and as a people will be reliant on science, research, talent and ingenuity.  We can see from the debates on global tax that the world is changing and shifting.  Investment in talent, people, research and innovation will be key.</p><p>Whatever structures we arrive on will be based on international comparisons, international best practice, learning from others and listening to the voices of the scientific community and the public at large.  I expect to be in a position to expand on this further in the House next week.</p></speech>

Thankfully, that chapter has come to a conclusion and a new chapter has begun with yesterday's announcement that a technical university for the south east will be established by 1 May and that all final year students currently attending Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, and IT Carlow will graduate with a university degree.  This is fantastic news for Waterford and the entire south-east region.  It is good for students, families, jobs and inward investment.</p> <p>The establishment of a university in the south east has been described as a necessity by stakeholders for a protracted period.  I am very encouraged by the interactions I have had with stakeholders and IDA Ireland and their positivity about the establishment of a technological university in the south east.</p> <p>I thank the staff, management and students at WIT and IT Carlow for their diligent work and determination, sometimes in the face of opposition.  Their commitment to the establishment of a technological university, TU, has to be complimented.  I am sure everyone will join me in congratulating them on their work and resolve.</p> <p>I have some points and questions on which I hope the Minister can bring clarity.  The first is on the designation and commencement dates for the new technological university.  At our meeting yesterday, the Minister indicated he expected designation in January and commencement by 1 May.  I hope he will clarify that, in the event that everything is in place to enable a designation and commencement before those timelines, nothing would preclude that from occurring.  It is imperative that we commence with the international competition to appoint a president of the new technological university.  Existing contracts are coming to a conclusion and the new president, whoever that may be, will likely have to work a notice period in his or her existing role.</p> <p>There is also the matter of the process and timelines for the appointment of a chairperson and two external members.  I have told the Minister several times that I believe these are of critical importance if we are to gel the two institutions and ensure the new governing body can realise the vision we have for higher education in the region.</p> <p>Last but not least, one of the most important issues outside of the headquarters location, which we discussed in a previous Commencement debate, is the expanded campus development in Waterford.  Extensive work has been undertaken on the proposal to acquire additional land to enable the new technological university to expand in Waterford, particularly in the last six months but even before that in the development of master plans for the envisaged site.  What are the next steps after the meeting on Friday with WIT, the HEA and the Department on the business plan?  Will the Minister reaffirm the Government's commitment to this proposal?</p> <p>On capital funding, WIT and IT Carlow made submissions to the HEA as part of the national development plan review.  Support is needed, not only from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science but also the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, both in relation to borrowing capacity and accessing cheap financing from the European Investment Bank and others for projects such as student accommodation, incubation spaces and research and development centres.  I would appreciate assurances from the Minister on this.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for the resolve he has shown in ensuring we will have a technological university in the south east for the first time. </p></speech>

I know this is an issue that he has personally prioritised and given a lot of time to.  I hate to think of the conversation we would be having had we not got to this point, considering the degree to which the Senator banged on my door to ensure Waterford and the south east were no longer neglected in terms of a lack of university presence in the south-east region.</p> <p>I join the Senator in thanking everyone who has worked on this issue over a sustained period.  I am conscious that I am fortunate to be the Minister in office when we reached this significant milestone.  Many people have worked on this issue for a decade and, indeed, the more I look into the issue, the clearer it becomes that this work has been done for decades.</p> <p>I acknowledge the two presidents, Professor Willie Donnelly of WIT and Dr. Patricia Mulcahy of IT Carlow, the chairs of the governing authorities, Mr. Jim Moore and Mr. John Moore, all the members of the governing authorities, all the staff, students and stakeholders, the business community and public representatives.  They, together, working tirelessly along with Mr. Tom Boland and his project team have brought us to this point.</p> <p>As the Senator knows better than most, the south east was the only region in the country without a university presence.  This was a glaring anomaly and was holding the region back both in access to higher education but also attracting inward investment and jobs.  One only needs to talk to IDA Ireland to hear that view.  It was a significant and glaring gap on the map of Ireland which is now being addressed once and for all.  The technological university will be established by May 2022.  Words matter, as our President reminds us.  The word "by" was not chosen accidentally.  If establishment can happen earlier, it will.  Yesterday was a really exciting day for higher education in the south-east region, signalling as it did the establishment next year of a multi-campus university presence across the region.</p> <p>The application seeking TU designation was submitted to me jointly on 30 April.  I subsequently appointed an independent international advisory panel to assist in assessing this application and sought the views of the board of the Higher Education Authority on that report and any other matters of relevance.  I have received and considered reports and, on foot of my deliberations and extensive engagement with the two institutions, I am proposing to approve the application.  In short, I can state that all parties are working towards the new university opening its doors by 1 May 2022.  The HEA will now seek to confirm the finalisation of technical and operational elements.  The HEA will continue to keep me informed and advise me on these matters.  I wrote yesterday to the institutes' governing body chairpersons in this regard.  There is now a prescribed period in law during which the institutes may make representations.</p> <p>I addressed the Senator's question on establishment by May 2022.  On the governing authority, this month, the Department will invite expressions of interest through a public process for the role of chairperson and two external members of what should become the first governing body of the new TU.  I will also be writing to the education and training boards to seek a candidate to sit on the governing body in due course.  I will encourage people to step up and come forward.  Being on the governing body of this new technological university will be the epitome of public service.</p> <p>The process to identify a suitable candidate to be submitted to me for designation for appointment as first president by the new technological university's first governing body will be by way of an open international competitive process, which will be run by the applicant institutes in the new year.  I hope that will kick off in January.  </p> <p>The Senator has raised consistently the very important matter of expanding the footprint of the new university in Waterford.  I want to be categorical and be crystal clear, to pardon the pun, about wanting to do this.  We want to expand the footprint of the university's presence in Waterford.  I have been clear in my commitment to expanding the imprint, as are the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste.  WIT is undertaking an appraisal process and business case process in accordance with the requirements of the public spending code.  Its representatives will meet my Department and the HEA later this week.  We will work with them to progress that.</p> <p>On the headquarters, as I have said previously, this is legally a matter for the governing authority.  That is the law.  The Government does not run universities.  This is an open, modern European democracy.  Waterford seems like a sensible location for the headquarters for a variety of reasons, including national planning policies.</p> <p>On borrowing capacity, I am very pleased with the progress being made on student accommodation under Housing for All but I accept the need to do more on this and I am very committed to doing that.</p></speech>

I would expect nothing less.  He has been across this issue since his appointment.</p> <p>On borrowing, significant work has been done to enable technological universities to borrow to fund purpose-built student accommodation, of which there is a shortage in Waterford, as there is elsewhere.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, beyond that we need to get to the point where we have the likes of incubation spaces and research and development centres which can be revenue generators.  These will prove the ability of the new technological universities to be able to repay the investment.  In the same context, that should be expedited with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would appreciate the Minister's comments on that.</p><p>I welcome also his comments on the headquarters of the new TU.  It is essential it is located in Waterford, notwithstanding the fact the president will obviously have a presence on both campuses.  That is a natural progression here but there has to be a designated HQ and I welcome the Minister's comments in that regard.</p></speech>

We sometimes throw words around in politics but I really believe this has the ability to be transformational for the south east.  It is not just my belief but the belief of so many stakeholders, the business community and student groups as well.</p><p>On borrowing, I remain committed to working intensively with my colleagues in Government to ensure we can continue to increase investment across the technological university agenda.  We have a transformation fund with &euro;90 million in it.  In the Government's national recovery and resilience plan there is an additional &euro;40 million for the technological universities.  We have the highest ever <i>per capita</i>budget for higher education in our State and we now have access to borrowing by TUs and ITs for student accommodation in a way that was not there before, but I will continue to engage with the Senator on this.  As recommended by the seminal TU Research Network, TURN, report, a fully-resourced, state-of-the-art, digitally-connected TU with attractive student-centric environments will strongly assist in the delivery of national strategic objectives on higher education.  Yesterday was a big step forward but nobody, least of all me, is suggesting it is the end of the conversation.  It is just the beginning of the next step of a new and exciting journey.  I thank the Senator for all his work on this.</p></speech>

To say that it caused shock throughout County Clare and the mid-west would be an understatement.  In fact, it caused very considerable shock throughout the country because there is little doubt that the Doolin Coast Guard is probably one of the best known units in the country.  It is known nationally and internationally.  Its volunteers have put to sea in the most hazardous conditions and carried out search, rescue and recovery missions 365 days a year, both day and night.  It is probably one of the busiest stations in the country and, sadly, much of its work involves the recovery of loved ones who have departed through suicide from the Cliffs of Moher.  The work is arduous and difficult.</p> <p>It appears that some HR issues are at the core of this decision, but such issues are in every organisation and office in the country.  It is very unfortunate that matters have been allowed to reach a point where this has now happened.  The people who depend on the service and those who work in it deserve better.  I call on the Minister to come before the House at the earliest opportunity to set out a path to the reinstatement of this service.  It cannot be allowed to go on for a protracted period.  We have waited five years for the publication of an investigation into the death of one of its volunteers, Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas.  That is a very long time and should never have been allowed to happen.  We need to bring closure to this issue and see the service reinstated.  I am not suggesting there are not issues that have to be resolved, but the operational management of the Coast Guard is there to ensure that issues like this are brought to a head.</p> <p>I will draw the House's attention to another matter, which is the recent media reports of anti-social behaviour on public transport.  It has been well documented and many examples of it have been quoted on a regular basis by random journalists who have seen these matters taking place and have reported on them.  The National Bus and Rail Union is now balloting members on what should, and needs to, happen.  That is a wake-up call to us in the Legislature to call on the Minister for Justice to come to the House to outline the plans her Department and, hopefully, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, have.  The way forward is a dedicated public transport unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It works well in other countries and would be the appropriate method to address this situation rather than expecting transport companies to establish their own security within the service they provide.  The responsibility should rest and remain with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and form part of a dedicated public transport policing unit.</p></speech>

One of the beautiful things about this proposed TU is that it is a multi-campus university.  There are now university towns throughout the region, from Castlebar to Galway city, Killybegs, Letterfrack, Letterkenny, Mountbellew and Sligo.  A unique aspect of this TU, and one that will enhance the offering in the region, will be the ability of students to obtain a technical university qualification and, all going well, which I expect it will, the fact that students graduating next year in the existing institutes of technology, ITs, will do so with a TU degree.  That is a wonderful acknowledgement of the process of the TUs.</p> <p>I acknowledge the dedicated National Centre for Excellence in Furniture Design and Technology in Letterfrack, whose present campus has a great reputation, and the fact that Letterfrack will also be a university town.  That is a wonderful achievement.  It will increase higher education access, drive enhanced regional development and increase opportunities for students, staff, business and enterprise, and local communities.  It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the process and I welcome last week's announcement by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the engagement across the political spectrum that took place with the constituent ITs of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, Sligo and Letterkenny.  It is a wonderful day for the west and north-west region.</p> <p>I have previously raised the issue of funding of local authorities.  As a former member of Galway County Council, the continued funding issues within that council, in particular, are evident.  People of all parties are aware of the issues.  It is not just me as a politician saying it.  Officials within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage acknowledge the funding model is broken, especially as it relates to Galway, which is a county with a large geographical area, population and coastline, with offshore islands.  The model is broken.  The officials stated it would be fixed or, at least, somewhat repaired by the review of the local property tax, LPT, which is ongoing.  I ask for a debate on the issue of funding for local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am especially parochial.  I know other local authorities also have an issue but it is an issue in Galway in particular.  They are in dire straits, especially in this coming budget.  The distance between the decision to increase or not increase a LPT and the final allocations from the Departments post the passing of a budget in October is too long.  The allocation should come first and then the council and members should be able to decide whether to increase the LPT in response to that.  I ask for a debate with the Minister.</p></speech>

I concur with Senator Dooley on his comments about a designated policing unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for transport.  I will not elaborate much more on it because I have an amendment to that effect and look forward to Senator Dooley's support and engagement as we discuss the Private Members' business later this afternoon.  It makes common sense.  We have heard much talk about a designated policing unit in all quarters, but today we will have an opportunity to support it.  I thank Fine Gael for giving me that opportunity to use its Private Members' business on transport today.  It will be an interesting dialogue.</p> <p>I thank the MEPs Frances Fitzgerald, Barry Andrews, Clare Daly and Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe for their meaningful, helpful and comprehensive engagement on the European Union yesterday.  I took a look back at some of the commentary on it and the recurring themes were: EU scrutiny; agriculture; just transition; social solidarity; the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA; workers rights; the energy crisis; equality; social progression; the European Charter of Fundamental Rights; social cohesion; migration; EU policy, the European Green Deal; social progress; climate change; human rights; EU trade; recovery and resilience;  EU care strategy, which was especially well set out by Frances Fitzgerald; and the horizon European project.</p> <p>What came out of that was what Clare Daly said in the end in that there was so much there.  We need to have themed discussions.  Yesterday was a good beginning, but I would like to see, with some engagement from the groups, how we can put some themes around some of those issues such as energy or the European Green Deal over the coming 12 months.  It is important we discuss those and stay focused.  There is a role for the Seanad in that regard.</p> <p>Another recurring theme we talked about was parliamentary scrutiny.  I referred to a report which dealt with identifying issues of legal and political importance to Ireland.  How do we hold our Government and Ministers to account in terms of influencing Government decisions on EU issues?  How do we influence EU policy makers and especially MEPs on what they will do?  I cited the Bundestag yesterday and the elaborate and well-resourced unit it has to do this.</p> <p>There are real key issues.  It was a good day and I thank the Cathaoirleach for initiating it and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the excellent way he conducted the business.  There was an energy about it and real engagement in this House.  I commend the secretariat, the Seanad Office and all the people involved.  It was a positive engagement and shows when we work well, it is in everyone's interest.  It was a very good day.  In time, if we could develop some of those themes and have specific topics in the Seanad and debates on those issues, it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

He aptly mentioned Martin Groves and his team in the secretariat.  They put much of the background work into these things, for which I thank them.</p></speech>

It is not just an issue in Clare.  The only reason we have a Coast Guard in Ireland is the volunteers.  The management would not be able to carry out the Coast Guard functions, of which there are many, by itself.  I thank all the volunteers in the Irish Coast Guard for all the work they do, for free, off their own bat.  They put themselves at risk which affects their families, in order to protect all of us in this beautiful, large coastal island of ours.  We have to recognise the work of the volunteers.</p> <p>It is sad to hear that some people have left the service and will probably never return because of conditions with which they have been dealing.  We have seen this before.  It is usually between employers and employees that there are employment issues and workplace disagreements.  This situation is worse in some ways because these people are not even getting paid.  It is terrible that Doolin Coast Guard has been closed down.  Despite what people say, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, did not close it down.  It is quite the opposite.  He has been trying to get these issues resolved and there is no shortage of supports, both financial and resources, coming from within the Department to try to resolve this issue.</p> <p>Unfortunately, from listening to many people who work in the Coast Guard over the past number of weeks and years, there seem to be serious issues with Coast Guard management and volunteers, and how all that does and does not work.  It is dysfunctional.  It is not good enough to say Inis O&iacute;rr can sort out what is happening in Clare.  That does not cut the mustard at all.  We cannot be waiting for somebody from Inis M&oacute;r to come down with a lifeboat.  It is a serious issue.  Clare is one of the largest coastal areas in Ireland.  We need this rectified as soon as possible.</p> <p>There is no shortage of supports from the Department.  We need Coast Guard management to step up to the mark.  It has been using mediation, but it has not worked.  I have experience of HR companies that are great for representing the management or employer, but do not always represent the volunteer.  That seems to be the issue here.  We need it resolved.  It is not fair to treat volunteers in this way.  There is obviously a huge issue when one has volunteers leaving, not just in Clare, but all over Ireland.  There is a huge issue in the Coast Guard.  It needs to be resolved before any more lives are lost.</p> <p>I will mention Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas who lost her life five years ago.  We are still waiting for that situation to be properly rectified.  The report initially produced on what happened to her was completely inaccurate.  The report authors did not interview the right people and had her one nautical mile out to sea which was not the case.  Huge issues are ongoing with the Coast Guard and it is a disgrace it has to come to this, where Coast Guard stations are closed down.  I know from speaking to the Minister that there is no shortage of supports from the Department to rectify the issue.  We need to push it back on Coast Guard management, come up with a plan and stop wasting money on consultants covering HR and mediation.  It is not working.  We need to do better and the volunteers deserve that.</p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media produced its pre-legislative scrutiny report on the online safety and media regulation Bill yesterday.  The Bill is an immense piece of legislation to come before the Houses and will place Ireland among the first countries in the world to provide a systematic regulation of online platforms.</p> <p>The committee engaged in an extensive pre-legislative process.  We have called for an individual complaints mechanism for citizens to be established for the big designated online platforms.  We have also called for an online safety commissioner to be explicitly included in the legislation, and for children's navigation of online spaces to be protected so as not to render children vulnerable to data profiling or harmful advertisements.  This work is crucial to a democratic and pluralistic society.  I commend Senators Hoey, Carrigy and Byrne who served on the committee.  I thank the Chair, Deputy Smyth.  We have also called for a content levy that would help the funding of independent productions in Ireland and other policies that would support the media production sector.</p> <p>I also had the privilege of serving alongside the Deputy Leader, Senator Chambers, on the forum on a family-friendly and inclusive parliament.  It was a privilege to be invited to take part in that by the Ceann Comhairle before the summer recess.  I commend former Deputy, Mary Upton, who so ably chaired the committee and Senators Chambers and O'Loughlin, and Deputies Cairns and Richmond for partaking.  We did so alongside members of civil society groups, private citizens and business people.  We have 51 actions in the report and I encourage all Members to read them.  The actions involve: how we include all perspectives when legislating; modelling a family-friendly parliament for the 21st century, affecting the sittings of the House for all Members and staff; online abuse of Members; and staff safety.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I encourage Senators to read both of those reports if they get a chance.

While this is very welcome in terms of stabilising rents in the long term, immediate action must be taken to provide a short-term intervention and a rent freeze for tenants.  We are told there are legal impediments to that, but we know it is possible because, when he was Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly implemented an effective two-year rent freeze on rent increases in 2015.</p> <p>Covid and the lack of supply have led to a rental accommodation crisis.  Last year, we had a rent growth of 7%, despite a supposed 4% limit in three quarters of the country.  Let us take a look at the counties that were affected.  It was not just urban centres such as Dublin, Cork, Galway and elsewhere.  There was a rental increase of 17.3% in Leitrim.  The rate in Kilkenny was 15.5%.  In Clare the rate was 16.1% and in Mayo it was 11.8%.  This does not just affect urban centres; it affects the whole country.  Every single county has had rental increases in the past year of more than 4%.  Despite that, just 29 landlords were sanctioned for breaking rent cap rules.  We need an immediate rent freeze to stabilise the rental market and to bring rents back in line with wages.  We also need proper enforcement of the rules.</p> <p>One of the reasons renters have not reported increases to the Residential Tenancies Board is because they are afraid of losing their homes.  One could ask why that is the case.  It is because we have some of the worst tenancy rights in Europe.  There are approximately 350,000 people living in private rented accommodation.  The largest cohort of families entering homelessness are coming from the private rented sector.  Since the end of the ban on eviction, we have seen a month-on-month increase in the number of families entering homelessness.  People are banned from having pets or are being charged pet rents.  We know the importance of pets to families, particularly children who are living in rented accommodation.  What we need is proper renters' rights.  We need to have affordable rents with a rent freeze.  We also need proper standards and security of tenure for renters in this country.</p></speech>

I stated then that we are in desperate need of adult safeguarding legislation.  That week I was responding to a horrendous report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which revealed that more than 108 instances of abuse were experienced by adults in a HSE care facility in Donegal and that the HSE not only failed to stop this abuse, it also covered it up.  I am back in the Chamber to raise this issue yet again because in the space of those two weeks there have already been more distressing revelations.  This just goes to show how urgent and pressing the matter is.  First, it was revealed this week in <i>The Irish Times</i>that HIQA knew the names of those who experienced the abuse at the Donegal facility in 2016 but that the families were not notified until 2018.  It seems now that HIQA was also part of the cover-up.</p><p>In addition, last week the HSE national safeguarding office released its report for 2020.  I will read out some of the statistics in the report.  In 2020, there were more than 10,000 safeguarding concerns reported to the HSE.  That might just sound like a number, but it means 10,000 people, loved ones, family members, who were potentially experiencing abuse last year in the middle of the pandemic.  Between 2016 and 2020, there were 51,000 safeguarding concerns reported to the HSE.  That number is staggering.</p><p>I point out again, as I did two weeks ago, that the Civil Engagement Group's Adult Safeguarding Bill was introduced in 2017.  We are still waiting for it to be progressed.  I ask Senators to imagine how different things might have been if we had progressed the Bill more quickly.  Could we have prevented those 10,000 cases of abuse?  Could we have prevented 20,000 cases?  The HSE report also states that abuse of adults is still likely to be under-reported.  That is truly shocking.  There have been 10,000 safeguarding concerns reported and it is likely that even more will be reported.</p><p>We met with the Law Reform Commission in the past week, which is still working on reviewing our 2017 Adult Safeguarding Bill.  Unfortunately, its report is not due out until the second quarter of 2022.  To be honest, that is a little bit disappointing.  I would have thought it would have been sooner than that.  I know that the commission could complete the report earlier if it had more resources.  I ask the Deputy Leader to take quick action to help the Law Reform Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible.  We need adult safeguarding to be made a top priority for the Law Reform Commission.  We need extra resources allocated to its team and we need the report published by February 2022 at the latest.</p><p>Given the rate of 10,000 reported cases of abuse each year, we can assume more than 800 cases are occurring each month.  Every month we wait for this report and every month we wait to introduce legislation we are complicit in the abuse experienced by 800 more people.  These are our citizens, our families, our loved ones and we must take action now.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the matter of disability services in Dublin 12.  The first service to which I wish to refer is the Employ Ability service in Dublin west, which is based in Bluebell.  Service users were told in November that the office would cease operating next month and that it would continue to give support until then.  When I made my own inquiries with the Department as to what was happening to the Employ Ability service in Bluebell, however, I was told that its contract will expire on 31 December 2021 and that the Department had started proceedings on new contracts for 2022 and that bid proposal documentation had been issued to Employ Ability services, including the Employ Ability service in Dublin west.  It is waiting on the bid to come through.</p> <p>It is completely unfair that service users are being told a completely different story from that which the Department has told me.  We need to find out exactly what is going on.  If there is an issue with Employ Ability Dublin west in the context of why it is not putting in a bid, then that issue must be brought to light.  Any opportunities there might need to be advertised to other providers that might offer these services to the community.  It is a real loss to those who are availing of the Employ Ability service in Bluebell.  I cannot understand why there is a such a divergence between what the service users are being told and what I am being told.  It seems like I am being placated and the service users are being given more harsh information.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is therapies for children with autism in Dublin 12.

The group has told me that not one child in Dublin 12 is receiving therapy.  We know that the three-month assessment rule applies and that children are getting assessed within that time, but there is no point in a child having an assessment of need if he or she is not going to get the therapy arising from it.  It makes no sense.  A parliamentary question was tabled by an Oireachtas colleague asking how children are affected and a blurb outlining the policy position came back.  Ultimately, it did not say how many children are getting services.  Anecdotally, no children in Dublin 12 are getting any therapies.  The issue must be examined.  It is a disgrace.  We are not looking after our most vulnerable.</p></speech>

I know we have the Minister for Health coming in this afternoon, but there is a need to have a debate on our response to contact tracing in an educational setting and substitution in schools.</p> <p>I heard Colm Henry's remark on "Morning Ireland" earlier to the effect that transmission in schools is low.  The reality is that the Government reduced, curtailed and stopped contact tracing in educational settings.  It should not have done so.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I call on the Government to return to contact tracing in schools.

I ask that the Minister, Deputy Foley, would come to the House as a matter of urgency.  I accept the remarks of Dr. Colm Henry this morning that it may well not be the case that pupils are contracting or transmitting Covid-19 in schools but it is a fact of life that Government stopped contact tracing and it should not have done so.</p><p>I also seek a debate on the issue of Taiwan.  It is high time that this House took a firm stance with regard to our relationship with Taiwan.  I am utterly appalled and dismayed at the remarks last week of former Deputy, Mick Wallace, MEP, with regard to Taiwan.  It is complete fake news.  Taiwan is a vibrant democracy which upholds human rights at all times.  As I have done previously, I call for a debate in this House on Taiwan and our relationship with Taiwan.  </p></speech>

I am seeking a debate in this House with the Minister for Finance on the future of banking.  This summer, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided to launch an investigation phase of the digital euro project.  Our Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was there in his role as the President of the Eurogroup and he expressed his full support for the project.  As cryptocurrencies increase steadily in number and popularity, their potential to both improve international trade and to be used as payment looms ever larger in the eyes of the international community.  The European Central Bank is investigation into the digital euro is in the interest of ensuring its continued grip on monetary transmission.  The ECB needs its transmission channels to carry out its primary task of price stability and cannot conduct monetary policy if the euro disappears from the eurozone.  While this is a welcome move in the right direction, there is no reason Ireland should be idle as it awaits a response to cryptocurrencies at a European level.  Other countries are not sitting on their hands when it comes to laying the groundwork for early adoption.</p> <p>On Monday, the US Government released a long awaited set of recommendations on how regulators and lawmakers should treat stablecoins and digital coins, the values of which are tied to fiat currencies such as the US dollar.  The move has been welcomed by market participants and the US Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Michael J. Hsu, stated that while the salient risk may be mostly trading-related today, tomorrow the risks will be much broader than that and it behoves us as regulators to be strategic in how we approach this issue and think ahead.  All countries will have to react to this at some point.  Let us not be left behind in the dust by the way of stubborn caution.  Let us instead be proactive in preparing for the inevitable global financial shift.  We are always quick to talk about being a global world leader when it comes to climate activism.  Why not the same appetite to be number one when it comes to something that may actually improve the lives of the Irish people?  Another debate with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on the future of banking is needed in the new year.</p></speech>

Having grown up 200 yd from Eyre Square, I can say with certainty that this is unprecedented.  At a recent joint policing committee, the chief superintendent of Galway city suggested that consideration should be given to closure of the area at night time.  I can inform him that this is not an option and will not be happening.</p> <p>Eyre Square is in the heart of Galway city.  It is often the first impression of Galway for visitors and tourists.  It has been, largely, a safe and happy place to live and visit.  We cannot allow the actions of a tiny minority to change that.  The Christmas market in Eyre Square commences next Friday week and will continue until close to Christmas, with the support of a private security firm.  This allows time for a plan to be implemented, which will ensure the safety of Eyre Square for both residents and visitors.  A co-ordinated plan involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Galway City Council and the Department of Justice is required as a matter of urgency.  </p> <p>Budget 2022 commits to the recruitment of 800 additional garda&iacute;.  Galway city needs to be prioritised for additional Garda resources in terms of upcoming graduates from Templemore.  The Deputy Leader will be familiar with our city.  She will have noticed in recent weeks that these incidents have taken place.  I ask that she would write to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, with urgency.</p></speech>

The forestry issue in Ireland is one that we need to address immediately.  Over the past two years, we have had discussions on forestry in this House and at the agriculture committee.  We have seen changes in legislation with regard to the serial objection issue and with regard to environmental issues but there is a huge issue in terms of licences.  At the moment, the ambition in terms of licence production for this year is 4,500, which is exceptionally low, but we will not reach it.  According to the industry, we need to be producing 8,000 licences per annum.</p> <p>That Ireland of all places is importing raw timber to keep its timber mills going is disgraceful.  This has the potential for us to bring in pests such as beetles, which could have a huge impact on our forestry in the future; the biosecurity measures are not good enough.  This could have a huge impact on our industry in the future as a legacy.  We need to have an urgent debate but we also need legislation to be brought forward with urgency.  There are no timelines when it comes to a forestry licence.  When you apply for a planning permission, you get a timeline through a local authority, which is usually eight weeks.  You then submit further information and the whole matter can be sorted out within six months.  There is no fixed timeline with regard to forestry licence applications.  Some applications have been ongoing for almost four years.  Could one imagine any business waiting four years for information as to when it might be granted a licence?  We are in a time lag.  Unless we get our act together, the real issues of carbon and climate action cannot be addressed.  We have a decade to make sure we get our forestry services up and running and have trees growing in the ground.  Only 30% of our afforestation targets for this year have been met.  People are not planting trees because they have no confidence in a system that provides no timelines.  </p> <p>I propose that the Deputy Leader would ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, who is a Member of this House, to come to this House to discuss the introduction of legislation to put fixed timelines in place so that the industry has a chance.  If we do not do that, we will have no forestry industry and we will not reach our climate targets.</p></speech>

I support him in that regard.  There is a motion on the Order Paper, in my name and that of other Senators, in regard to Richard O'Halloran who is entering another year of captivity in China.  I want to emphasise that.</p> <p>Today, I want to raise an issue of volunteerism and, in particular, to ask the Deputy Leader to seek the presence in this House of the Minister for Justice, when available, to discuss the issue of the Garda Reserve.  The Garda Reserve is withering on the vine.  When I was Minister for Justice and Equality, I had all-party support for its introduction.  The recruitment process for the Garda Reserve has completely collapsed.  At the moment, it is in that terrible limbo of being under review.  I support Garda Commissioner Drew Harris in all of his reforms and all of his improvements of standards within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its professionalism and policing function, but he does not see the urgency of having local contacts for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, people in every area in Ireland who have direct links with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will go back to what Senator Crowe said about Eyre Square.  If there is a resourcing issue in Galway at night or whatever, there is a simple way to deal with that and that is to have reservists who will support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out their functions.</p><p>It may be that Commissioner Harris, who comes from Northern Ireland, has a slightly different view of reserve constables and, historically, I could well understand that.  I believe that keeping An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in contact with the people rather than patrolling and policing from cars travelling at 30 km/h through areas does require new consideration to be given to improving the Garda Reserve recruitment, and making use of those decent people who have been effectively left aside, having volunteered and become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

This has been a policy for some time and it was brought to my attention again over the weekend.  Only in recent days the lights have been turned off at the junction of the M4-M6 at Kinnegad, with which she will be familiar.  The person to whom I  spoke is very familiar with the route but almost missed the junction due to the lack of lights.  He told me that only for the fact that he was familiar with the site layout he would have missed the junction as he could not read the sign.  I have researched the matter and know the reasons that have been given.  In the current climate there is a threat of power cuts and it has been mentioned that this energy and money saving policy will save &euro;1 million.  Without sounding flippant, &euro;1 million is not a big price to pay to protect the health and safety of motorists.  These roads were built in the not too distant past and designed with enough lights to protect the health and safety of road users.  I do not recollect a change being made to health and safety laws or observations.  We should invite the Minister for Transport in here to discuss this matter.  I can see where the policy has come from but I can also see the associated dangers.  I believe that the risks far outweigh the potential saving and we need to debate the matter.  The person told me that the junction was in complete darkness last weekend and if he had not been aware of it, he would have taken the road to Mullingar instead of Athlone.</p></speech>

We now have a situation where the numbers are rising again at a worrying level.  I will outline an issue that has been brought to my attention recently.  A few fully vaccinated people around the area in which I live have came down with Covid-19 and this is causing massive worry among people of my age group.  The older lemons in society are concerned that the vaccines may not be as effective as they should be although all of the assurances are that everything is fine and people should hang in there.  We need far better reporting by Government.  We need a breakdown of the age groups who have been diagnosed with Covid-19.  We need to know how many of the people in ICU are not vaccinated.  We need to get the word out there that vaccination is the only way to beat this and reassure people.</p> <p>Yesterday I spoke to some grandparents and they are now afraid to bring their grandchildren into their houses because the word has gone out that children get and can carry Covid-19.  This is causing people to think in a very different way so I think we need far clearer reporting.  We need a breakdown, on a daily basis, of the age groups in ICU and the age groups who have been diagnosed so as people can be relatively comfortable in their thinking around Covid-19.  To throw out a figure of 3,796 cases last night has left people asking what the point is in getting a booster vaccine if the thing is no good.  We need to retain faith in the system.  The system is working well but we need better reporting right across the board.</p></speech>

It is a debilitating disease.  Any of us who knows anyone who suffered from MND will know how horrible the impact is on the person.  It also has an impact on their families and those who are close to them.</p> <p>One of the difficulties is that only four nurses are dedicated to dealing with the disease in the entire country.  They are primarily funded by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association.  We need to invest more money in research into how we will deal with MND and ways to combat it.  We have to have a greater support structure not only those with MND but also for their families.  Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Health to consider putting in place the necessary supports for individuals who suffer with this disease and their families.</p> <p>I have previously raised this matter in the House.  It is a horrible illness and Charlie Bird spoke eloquently about its impact.  We do not have to continue to listen to those stories.  There is a need for more than just four nurses serving the entire country who are funded by a charity.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Health to provide greater support. </p></speech>

I am not sure if the Deputy Leader is aware of the fact that Doolin Coast Guard unit was stood down yesterday by the Irish Coast Guard.  Let me put that in context.  It is one of the longest serving and busiest Coast Guard units in the country, servicing serves the coast of counties Clare, Galway and Kerry.</p> <p>The standing down of the Coast Guard is a worrying development for a number of reasons.  First, 12 volunteers have been stood down and I want a clear answer from the Minister for Transport as to why that has happened.  Can he guarantee the safety of people off the Clare coast at this moment in time given the fact that the Doolin Coast Guard is one of the busiest units?  If an accident occurs off the Clare coast we will have to rely on the Aran Islands service.  They are great people but they can only do so much.  I want the Minister to assure us that he is satisfied with the emergency response that will be available if an accident or tragedy occurs off the Clare coast.</p> <p>I want him to outline when the Coast Guard intends to reinstate the Doolin Coast Guard.  What are the plans?  Are we talking about days, weeks, months or years?  Will Doolin Coast Guard be reinstated at all? </p> <p>The current situation is unacceptable but the overall picture in terms of Coast Guard volunteers needs to be addressed.  We are an island nation and it is not acceptable that we must rely on a largely volunteer-run Coast Guard operation.  Proper terms and conditions for Coast Guard volunteers need to be introduced.  At the moment a good fire service model operates throughout rural Ireland where volunteers are paid a retainer fee and paid per call-out.  It would be reasonable for the Coast Guard to have the same facility where a retainer and call-out fees are provided.  I also believe that the scheme could be operated by the local authorities.</p> <p>A number of years ago I tabled Commencement matters on this issue in this House which the then Minister, Shane Ross, addressed but nothing happened.  The fact that one of the most successful Coast Guard units in the country was stood down yesterday has escalated this issue to a point where action is urgently needed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to look after, respect and pay these front-line workers.</p></speech>

We hear an awful lot of talk about it, especially with COP26 going on.  There is an awful lot about what could and should be done.  Are we reaching a point where we will start paying, especially marginalised farmers on poor land, to be unproductive, pick blackberries once a year in September and stand at a gate for a tourist?  It seems we have no plan on what we will do with agriculture.  There are incredibly environmentally-friendly marginalised farmers on hill farms and special areas of conservation who are very productive and eco-friendly.  These farmers need to be protected.  They are on small family farms and provide an incredible amount to their local economy because nearly everything a farmer earns goes back to his or her community.  We need a proper, strong and honest debate in this House on the future of agriculture.</p></speech>

It is high time we addressed the issue of terms and conditions and ensure people are properly recognised for the amazing work they do.  The issue I will raise this morning is that of the proposed public holiday, which all of us think is a welcome recognition for the incredible work that not only our front-line workers but the entire country has undertaken to face the challenge of the Covid pandemic.  I am concerned by reports it may be a one-off.  Let us be clear that Ireland is bottom of the table when it comes to public holidays.  We are four days behind countries such as Portugal, Poland, Sweden and Austria and three days behind Germany and Greece.  Why on earth would we introduce a bank holiday as a once-off just for next year?</p> <p>We should all agree we want to build back better after the pandemic and give people a better work-life balance.  A number of us have spoken about that in terms of the right to disconnect and work from home.  We need a clear signal from the Government that this public holiday will be a permanent addition.</p> <p>I invite the Deputy Leader to endorse that call for a permanent public holiday and not a once-off one next year.  People have worked to keep this country going, not just in the past couple of years, but the past decade.  We have come through a hell of a decade and working people have brought us through it, in particular.  The least we can do is take a significant step towards a European model of better work-life balance.  The idea that this bank holiday next year will be a once-off is entirely unacceptable to me or trade union movements and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael should be clear it needs to be a permanent addition.  If we need a debate on it, let us have that debate.</p></speech>

I met with the Social Economic Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland, SEEFA, yesterday and there is a large group from throughout the country here this morning.  It is important we have that sooner rather than later to address not just the logjam in the felling licences due to the objections, but the logjam in the planning applications for putting in more forestry.  Then we have the whole issue of having to plan for road licences and thinning.  We need to readjust the whole forestry system, as it is in other European countries.  I ask that be done sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Sport is in my brief and it has been in the news this morning.  We need clarity from Sport Ireland and the Department on underage sports indoors.  Certain sports such as basketball and squash are not taking place and are being cancelled because they are indoor and we cannot ask for vaccination certificates for children between 12 and 18.  Those under 12 do not have certificates.  There needs to be clarification to make sure those sports can continue.  That is important for our youth.  If people are vaccinated, which they are from over 12 years of age, those sports should be allowed go ahead, rather than be cancelled as they have been over the past number of days.</p></speech>

It is important to recognise the huge contribution wind energy makes to this country.  Some 5,000 are employed in it and if we hit our targets by 2030, another 2,000 people will be employed in it.  It contributes &euro;410 million to the economy every year.  The problem with the legislation was the fact it would have increased the distance of wind turbines from homes to ten times the height of the turbine.  At present, it is three to four times the height of the turbine.  If one was to increase it to ten times the height of the turbine, from any dwelling anywhere in the country, this would mean the land space for any wind turbine is null and void.  If one were to increase it by four times, that reduces 45% of the land available to wind turbines in Ireland.  If that is 40% at four times the height, imagine what it would be at ten times the height.  That is not me saying that, but it is Maynooth University saying that in a study it carried out.</p> <p>The reason I raise this is I am travelling to Glasgow in a few days for COP26.  It is a week in which the world is meeting to discuss how we stop global temperatures rising and coming together to ask how we can combat climate action.  On one hand, we have the cleanest, safest and most renewable form of technology in the world, which we should be using and can become a huge natural resource for Ireland, while on the other hand, we have a political party that, thankfully, withdrew a Bill, but one which was knocking around for seven years.  Just last year, on 24 November 2020, was reintroduced for the third time.  The Bill would have dramatically reduced and basically made null and void the ability to build inland wind turbines.  We all have to be on the same page and to make the same sacrifices and move the same way.  It is not on that we have people who claim they fight in support of climate justice, while introducing legislation that would hinder renewable energy.</p></speech>

It is due to incredible fundraising over decades.  It is phenomenal.  The hospice will cost an estimated &euro;6 million to complete and is an eight-bed inpatient unit with full day care facilities.  The Mayo Roscommon hospice has been fundraising for these community palliative care facilities for families.  Every family in Ireland has lost loved ones to cancer.  We know the painful end to this disease and condition and the palliative care that has been put in place is incredible.</p><p>In Roscommon town, each of the rooms in the hospice will have a door and a private garden in order that family members will be able to visit their loved ones.  I thank the volunteers and the fundraisers and acknowledge Martina Jennings, CEO, and her team and the board of the Mayo Roscommon Hospice Foundation which has funded two hospices in Castlebar, which the Deputy Leader would know very well, and one in Roscommon which will launch on Friday.  It is absolutely incredible.  There are such advocates at local, regional and national level and even at a global level.  President Joe Biden has close links with Mayo and especially with Larita Blewitt and the Blewitts and wrote this year to say what it has meant to have been involved in this project since the start.</p><p>I thank Tony Canavan, CEO of Saolta University Health Care Group, and Mary Garvey, Roscommon University Hospital, as this facility will be adjacent to the hospital and will help and support its services.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, will be there to celebrate this launch on Friday.</p><p>What can we do?  We can support it by making donations at <i>hospice.ie</i>.  These community pallative care services have to be fundraised for every single year.  There are also the hospice shops.  Every single time you see those wonderful charity shops, do not forget to think of the treasures that lie within and of supporting them with a few euro or even donations?</p></speech>

Under-12s cannot be vaccinated at the moment so how are they taking part in other activities?  Assistance needs to be given to Basketball Ireland and to the basketball clubs on this.  Of course,  those aged under 18 are not being asked for proof of vaccination in other areas.  We have done such a good job with the digital Covid certificate that we have a lot of confidence in that system, but we have to make sure it is consistent.  It is important that clarity is given to these voluntary organisations to make sure that whatever other sports are doing, it is applied to these sports as well.</p></speech>

We had an impressive display from the four Dublin MEPs who came to the House yesterday.  One of the issues that arose in the course of the discussion was Taiwan.  Members will be aware that, last month, the European Parliament passed a motion or approved a report in respect of strengthening ties between Europe and Taiwan, which was passed with a huge number of MEPs supporting it, some 580 to 26 against, with, I think, 66 abstentions.  Unfortunately, two of the MEPs who voted against it were Irish MEPs and one Irish MEP did not turn up for the vote.</p> <p>This is a very strong statement from Europe that we need to strengthen our ties with Taiwan.  We need to look at Taiwan as we approach a situation where China is essentially threatening to take over Taiwan and to integrate it into the mainland of China as part of its "one China" policy.  One of the answers given by one of the MEPs yesterday was that that is Government policy and, therefore, that MEP voted against the motion on the basis that she did not feel she could contradict Government policy, notwithstanding the fact she contradicts it in lots of other ways, which is her right.</p> <p>As a legislature, I wonder if the time has come for us to make a clear statement about our views on Taiwan.  I had the opportunity in Rome last week to attend a conference with Minister Wu, the Foreign Minister of Taiwan, to discuss these issues.  For us, as a small nation, we should understand this better than most.  Granted, we are a great deal smaller than Taiwan, but there is a larger country next door and we know what it is to be taken over or to be overruled by that country.  We must understand how frightening it is for ordinary citizens in Taiwan facing down an increased militarisation in that area.  I wonder if we could have a debate in this House to discuss what we feel about Taiwan and what we should be saying about strengthening our ties, as well as those of our European colleagues, with Taiwan.</p></speech>

Senator Dooley started the day by bringing up the issue of the Doolin Coast Guard, which has been brought up by a number of colleagues this morning, including Senators Garvey, Conway and others.  I join with colleagues in sharing their frustration and concern over the standing down of that very busy Coast Guard.  My current information is that the Department of Transport is working with local stakeholders and the community to try to get the issue resolved and get the Coast Guard back up and running as it is not the intention to permanently close that Coast Guard.  It is a fair request by the Members of this House to ask for a timeline as to when that service will be back up and running.  Senator Conway asked whether the citizens in that area are safe currently without that service, given they are now relying on the Aran Islands.  It is a question I cannot answer but it is a fair question that has been posed.</p> <p>Senator Kyne raised the issue of the Technological University for the West and North West that was announced last Thursday with great fanfare across the north-west region.  I join with him in congratulating all of the institutes of technology involved - GMIT, Sligo IT and LYIT - which came together to make this happen.  I join with him in saying it is fantastic to have a number of university towns across eight campuses, one of them being my own hometown of Castlebar.  I can say it is something that is a very exciting prospect for the students and communities in those regions.</p> <p>Senator Kyne also raised the issue of funding for local authorities.  I concur with his remarks in that there is an issue around current funding, given the current levels of funding are based on 2014 assessments.  There is a deficit in funding, particularly in smaller and more rural local authorities, which do not have the same level of income as some of the larger urban centres.  It is something that should be reviewed and we will seek a debate with the Minister of State with responsibility, Deputy Peter Burke, at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of the Doolin Coast Guard and spoke about the need to reassess how we do the debates with our MEPs.  I join with other colleagues in saying we had a very good debate last night with our Dublin MEPs.  The standard and quality of the debate was quite high.  It is fair to say that all four MEPs took a lot of questions on a variety of topics.  The suggestion from Senator Boyhan is that we would perhaps look at themed discussions going forward.  As I understand it from the Cathaoirleach, it is the understanding that once we complete the third constituency in the south, we might take feedback from Members and MEPs as to how we can improve that process for the next round of engagements.</p> <p>Senator Garvey raised the issue of the Doolin Coast Guard and spoke very passionately about her work in trying to resolve that with her party leader, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p> <p>Senator Warfield spoke about two reports that were launched this week in which he was personally involved, namely, the report on online safety from the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, chaired by Deputy Niamh Smyth.  A number of Members of this House are participants in that committee, including Senator Warfield and Senator Malcolm Byrne.  I commend the committee on its work.  Some 33 recommendations were made.  One of the key recommendations is around an online digital safety commissioner but various other recommendations are around making the online space safer for all of us, in particular children.  It should certainly be viewed by all Members of this House.  I hope the Department and the Minister will take on board the recommendations made by that cross-party joint committee.</p> <p>Senator Warfield also spoke about the report launched yesterday by the Forum on a Family Friendly and Inclusive Parliament that was launched and initiated by the Ceann Comhairle almost a year ago.  I am a member of that forum.  The culmination of all of that work came yesterday, when we produced our report with over 50 recommendations as to how we can improve both Houses of the Oireachtas as a workplace for all Members and make it more family friendly and inclusive for everybody.  I urge Members to have a look at that report at a time of their convenience.</p> <p>Senator Rebecca Moynihan raised several issues around housing, as she very often does, namely, the need to improve standards in rental accommodation, improve security of tenure for rental tenants and deal with the ongoing increase in the cost of rent across the country.  She correctly pointed out that it is not just an issue in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Galway, and it is affecting other areas.  She pointed to Mayo, where she said there was an increase in rent cost of 11.8% last year.  I can attest to that.  I can see that the prices are increasing across the board and it is something we need to deal with.</p> <p>Senator Frances Black raised the issue of the adult safeguarding legislation that is currently with the Law Reform Commission.  We will certainly do our best to see if we can assist in getting that report published sooner.  I suggest to the Senator that she might circulate the proposed legislation to Members of this House so we can have a look at that.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised two particular issues in regard to disability services.  One was the around the EmployAbility service (west) in Bluebell and the conflicting information that service users have received and that she has herself received as a public representative in that area.  There is a need for clarity.  I suggest to the Senator that she might table a Commencement matter to try to bring clarity on that issue.</p> <p>The Senator also raised, as she has on a number of occasions, the issue around therapies for children with autism, which I know is an issue many Members have raised in the House.  A very worrying statement from her was that no child in the Bluebell area is currently receiving any therapy.</p> <p>Senator Jerry Buttimer requested that we have a debate in the House with the Minister for Education, in conjunction with the Minister for Health, around contact tracing in schools in regard to Covid-19, and also the ongoing difficulties many schools are facing in getting substitute teachers to cover where a teacher is out.  We will certainly request that.</p> <p>The Senator also sought a debate on Taiwan.  Many other Members, including Senators McDowell and Ward, also raised the need for that debate, and I know Senator Malcolm Byrne has on many occasions requested a similar debate.  We will try to get that debate at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke about the need for a debate on the future of banking and finance.  She went into a lot of detail around cryptocurrencies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will not even suggest I have a level of knowledge to debate with her on that.  It is certainly a worthwhile debate to have in the House in order to get some information from the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Senator Crowe raise the issue of antisocial behaviour in Eyre Square.  I know the area well.  I went to college in Galway so would have frequented Eyre Square regularly.  I am surprised to hear the response from garda&iacute; locally was to just close Eyre Square.  That is not really possible.  It is the centre point of the city and that would be devastating for businesses, I imagine.  Again, that might be one for a Commencement matter with the Minister for Justice because what the Senator is requesting is quite specific.</p><p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of forestry and the ongoing licensing crisis in the forestry sector, as did Senator Carrigy, and I raised the issue myself yesterday.  We are looking for a debate with the Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, at the earliest possible opportunity.  Many of us had the opportunity to meet with that sector yesterday, when they were in Buswells Hotel for a number of hours to provide a briefing to Oireachtas Members, and I thank them for making themselves available to us to do that.  I concur with the remarks of the Leas-Chathaoirleach that it is a huge issue that has been dragging on for many months.  I know the agriculture committee was meeting throughout the summer with the Minister of State to try to resolve this and it is still not resolved.  A debate on that is certainly required.</p><p>Senator McDowell raised the issue of volunteerism, in particular in regard to the Garda Reserve, which I think is a fantastic initiative.  As somebody who served in the Army Reserve, I can attest to the importance of volunteerism, giving people in the community an opportunity to serve in those organisations, to give back to their communities and to work in the local space.  We see how much it benefits young people to be part of those organisations.  It can be character forming if people come in at a certain age, and it certainly was for me.  There is a very lax attitude in regard to maintaining that organisation.  It is the same with the Army Reserve, which has just been left to wither and die, in my view.  I am sure Senator Craughwell will know a lot of the issues around that as well.  This is an issue that needs to be debated with the Minister for Justice to get an update on what are the plans to maintain and enhance the Garda Reserve and ensure people can apply and join again, which is not happening currently.</p><p>The Senator also raised the issue of Richard O'Halloran and the ongoing nightmare that he and his family are living through.  This was also raised in the Chamber yesterday.  I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs is doing everything it can to try to get justice and get him out of there.</p><p>Senator Paul Daly raised the issue around the dimming of lights and poor lighting on our motorways.  I suggest he puts forward a Commencement matter on that as it is very specifically around whether there has been a policy change within TII and the Department in order to try to make those savings.  It seems like a small amount of money in the grand scheme of things, given it is a matter of health and safety.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised a number of issues around vaccines.  We need to take on board that questions are being asked.  It is very important that Members of this House and all public representatives hammer home the message that vaccines work and they are protecting the country.  It does not mean people cannot contract Covid-19 and that was never suggested, but there is a lot of misinformation flying around.  It is incumbent on all of us to try to correct that and to try to get the message out that vaccines do work.  A booster has been approved for healthcare workers, which is very welcome and I know they welcome that.  It is important that we continue to do the things we have been asked to do all along.  We know what we need to do at this stage.  That is all I can add on that front.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of motor neurone disease and the need to increase support around that.  That would be a welcome debate with the Minister for Health.  The fact we only have four nurse specialists in the country who are funded by a charity is not sustainable and that should not be how we provide healthcare.  Credit to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association for providing that service because, otherwise, it would not be there.  We will certainly seek a debate on that with the Minister at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Senator Conway also raised the issue of the Coast Guard, which I have dealt with.</p><p>Senator Erin McGreehan asked for a debate on the future of agriculture.  This is timely, given the comments that have come out of COP26 around emissions reductions and methane.  There is a lot of change happening in agriculture, particularly with CAP being out for public consultation and Ireland needing to finalise its plan by the end of this year.  There are competing interests and the farming organisations, unfortunately, are not on the same page and not united in what they are requesting of the Minister.  There is a lot of change.  It would be timely to have a debate with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, on that at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Senator Paul Gavan joined others in asking about an update on the Doolin Coast Guard and, in particular, spoke about the need for improved terms and conditions for the workers.  It is a conversation we need to have.  It should be a service that is paid because of the work they do and the risks they take.</p><p>I concur with the Senator that if we are going to have a public holiday, it should be a permanent fixture.  I am not sure where the one-off suggestion has come from.  I know my colleague, Senator Fiona O'Loughlin, is pushing for St. Brigid's Day to be the new public holiday.  I join with Senator Gavan in aspiring to bring Ireland in line with other similar countries in increasing the number of public holidays we have.  We should aspire to that as a country, why would we not?  With advances in technology, we should be looking to reduce the number of hours people have to work, that being a choice, of course, but it should be something we try to do.</p><p>Senators Carrigy and Currie raised the issue around Basketball Ireland and sport.  I am not fully up to date as to why that directive was issued by Sport Ireland.  It needs to be clarified and, again, I suggest a Commencement matter on that or we could seek a wider debate with the Minister of State with responsibility for sport as to why that directive has come from that particular sporting body but has not been applied across the board to children in other activities.  There is confusion there, of that there is no doubt.</p><p>Senator McGahon raised the issue of the Wind Turbine Regulation Bill from Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is welcome that it was withdrawn.  The Senator raised the wider debate we need to have around renewables, wind energy and how we manage that.  There are a lot of things happening offshore as well and I know it is a big conversation, particularly in the west, where there is huge potential for offshore wind.  We need to take all angles on this because we have a huge gap to make up in terms of how much renewable energy we produce and can rely upon to meet those demands for energy.</p><p>Senator Dolan spoke very positively about the Mayo Roscommon Hospice.  I have been involved with the hospice for many years as a public representative and I can attest to the huge amount of fundraising done.  No stone has been left unturned in terms of gathering funds from every corner of the counties of Mayo and Roscommon.  Credit to all involved, the hospice was opened in Castlebar a couple of years ago and it is great to see the hospice in Roscommon being opened as well, with a &euro;6 million investment in an eight-bed unit that will make a huge difference to the lives of the people and families who go through that service.  It is a positive day for Roscommon.  I commend all involved in the Mayo Roscommon Hospice on delivering that.</p><p>Senator Barry Ward concluded the debate.  I concur with his remarks on yesterday's debate with the MEPs and how good it was.  Credit to the four MEPs who attended and made themselves available.</p><p>I also concur with his remarks around Taiwan.  We will seek to have that debate at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

That would have been appropriate.  The Bill has already been passed by the D&aacute;il, so I do not know what opportunities remain in this regard.  Perhaps changes may come in a subsequent Bill.</p><p>Concerns have been flagged.  One of the key aspects is that the legislation as set out defines international force in an extraordinarily wide way.  This is breaking new ground in respect of our national defence legislation.  The Bill defines an international force as &quot;an International United Nations Force or any force to which a contingent or a member of the Defence Forces may be assigned to for service outside the State&quot;.  I raised with the Minister my concern that the term &quot;any force&quot; is, frankly, extraordinarily wide.  It is too wide and does not give us clarity regarding the kinds of force and circumstances that may be involved.  I had suggested narrowing the definition to refer to a United Nations force, but I withdrew that proposal in acknowledgement that it might be too narrow.  Nonetheless, to have no clear definition of &quot;any force&quot; remains a concern.  Section 2 continues with the words, &quot;may be assigned to for service outside the State for any purpose specified in section 3 of the Act of 2006&quot;, but that assignment is only limited by the proposed new section 17A(1)(<i>a</i>) of the principal Act.</p><p>My proposed amendment, which has a wide sense in this regard - wider than I might like - at least ties the definition of &quot;international force&quot; to an existing definition set out in the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.  That definition refers to an &quot;international organisation&quot; as meaning &quot;the United Nations; the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe; the European Union or any institution or body of the European Union; or any regional arrangement or agency that participates, or has participated, in operations as part of an International United Nations Force&quot;.  I have concerns about the phrase &quot;or any regional arrangement or agency&quot; that I will address later, but that is at least a definition and we can point to it and see the source.  In my amendment, then, I have suggested that we would tie the definition of &quot;international force&quot; to the definition of &quot;international organisation&quot; that already exists and has some attendant detail included in the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.  This would give us a degree of clarity regarding the kinds of forces and organisations to and situations in which we might transfer operational control.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was hopeful that the Minister would have brought us a definition, whether he agreed with how I sought to define "any force", on which we could all rely and refer to.  We may have agreed or disagreed about it but at least a definition would have given clarity.  I am concerned that this legislation proposed to be passed in the Seanad today still does not have clarity on "any force". </p></speech>

For example, nobody would have believed or envisaged a couple of years ago that the European Union would put its own forces into a specific conflict zone.  Therefore, I am reluctant to tie anything down at this stage and urge that we retain flexibility.  If we commit troops overseas to anything, with any organisation, the matter will be debated in the D&aacute;il and Seanad before we send anybody into harm's way, so I would leave the flexibility to the Minister of the day in this Bill.</p></speech>

I understand, as ever, that Senator Higgins is coming from a reasoned place but I think the issue was addressed by the Minister for Defence during the Committee Stage debate.  We must, as a House, trust that the Minister of the day will make the right decision.  I am also conscious of the fact that the triple lock still applies and there are still procedures in place to prevent going beyond what was intended by legislation.</p> <p>I have not tabled an amendment on this matter but rereading the definition and context of the amendment tabled by Senator Higgins it seems to me that there is an extra "to" in the definition.  The Bill reads: "'international force&rsquo; means an International United Nations Force or any force to which a contingent or a member of the Defence Forces may be assigned to".  There is an extra "to" and the definition is grammatically incorrect.  Perhaps the definition can be amended as a simple technical matter.  The definition should read "any force to which a contingent or a member of the Defence Forces may be assigned".  I do not agree with the Senator's amendment in any event.  </p></speech>

I also thank Senators Craughwell and Ward for their comments.</p> <p>An extensive debate took place on Committee Stage on a similar amendment and the Minister for Defence has given careful consideration to this matter.  The Senator is concerned about the definition of "international force" in section 2 of the Bill.  It is important to clarify that the purpose of section 2 is to provide for the delegation of a level of operational control to the force commander.  The legislation simply provides for the current de facto position and does not alter the existing long-standing legislative provision set out in the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.</p> <p>In particular, I wish to assure the Senator that the wording of section 2, including the definition of "international force" in no way widens or extends the types of role and functions for which Defence Forces personnel may be deployed overseas.  Strict statutory limitations already exist for any such roles or functions and they are clearly specified in section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.</p> <p>I wish to add that the reference to "any force" in the definition of "international force" is explicitly linked to the provisions of the Act of 2006.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the use of the term "any force" in the definition is appropriate and, as previously stated, does not alter the purposes for which Defence Forces personnel may be dispatched overseas.</p> <p>As the Minister advised the Seanad on Committee Stage, in particular concerns that the Senator's amendment would neuter the effect of section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, which recognises that certain missions, including humanitarian and training operations, would usually not be subject to a UN Security Council resolution as such operations do not constitute a threat to international peace and security for the most part.  I am certain that this was not the intention of the Senator.  However, it is important to note that if this provision was enacted then certain humanitarian operations and training missions, conducted using military forces and capabilities, would not be possible as they would not be a UN or a UN-mandated operation.  They are both training and humanitarian missions.  They do not necessarily fall into the category of a UN or UN-mandated operation but they may well require co-ordination, under a force commander, to ensure that there is proper operational control.  The wording of section 2 appropriately reflects this position.</p> <p>As Senators Ward and Craughwell have outlined, there are existing democratic structures for when troops are deployed.  There is also an accountability remit that happens annually through the Oireachtas committee and the D&aacute;il in terms of defence matters.</p> <p>For the reasons outlined, there are serious concerns about this amendment if it was introduced.  Therefore, it is not possible to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

As Members will be aware, my amendments explicitly excluded the humanitarian piece on Committee Stage but there are lots of other things such as monitoring, observation and recognisance.  There are a number of different activities listed in section 3.  Most of them are not direct military activities but it does matter and makes a difference for whom one does them.</p> <p>I agree that we are in an evolving situation internationally.  In fact, we are in a devolving situation internationally because clearly, over the last five to seven years, there has been a strong pull away from multilateralism, and from structures of the United Nations and others, and into a dynamic whereby we talk about larger states which have states that support them.  That is why we need to be clear about the type of international organisations.  If Ireland is a champion for multilateralism then we need to be clear about the type of multilateralism and who we work with.  We do not want to be part of the coalitions of the willing, friends or groups of like-minded nations that act without clear clarity of actual multilateral structures.  To be clear, those are not simply offshoots or extra things that happen.  In many cases, those kinds of alliances or forces are set up to dilute the international multilateral structures that were hard won after centuries of war.  We know that we need to have clarity, rules and international structures.  We need international structures that move outside the realm of interests and operate instead on the basis of principle.  That is why we need to be clear not just about what we do but who we do it with and on what grounds.  It is a pity that we do not have clarity from the Government on what is meant by the reference to "any force".</p> <p>I accept that the Minister of State will not accept my amendment at this time but that is regrettable.  I hope that this question will be revisited and that there is clarity.  I hope that the defence committee will monitor in terms of which forces, with whom we work and for which circumstances.  I will revisit some of those monitoring matters and other measures that we can put into place in my later amendments.  I have decided to withdraw the amendment because I will revisit some of the other others and I do not want to divide the House.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, relate to changes to section 3 of the Act whereas amendment No. 2 is really about section 1 of the 2006 Act.  It specifically relates to that definition of "international organisation".  This is one of the reasons I did not press my amendment No. 1.  There are concerns around the way "international organisation" is defined in the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.  One specific concern relates to section 1(d) which includes international organisations to which not just an individual but an entire contingent of our Permanent Defence Forces may be assigned.  Under the new provisions of the new legislation, they may be assigned and may have operational control transferred in regard to their activities.  It includes any regional arrangement or agency that participates or has participated in operations as part of an international United Nations force.  On Committee Stage, my concern was about the words "or has participated".  Frankly, my concerns are much deeper than they were going into Committee Stage because the example given was co-operating with NATO in regard to mine clearing under a UN mandate, and that is something I support as it happens under UN mandate.  However, the question is having co-operated with NATO in regard to mine clearing under the UN mandate, does that mean we can then always co-operate with NATO?  That seemed to be the position being put forward.  I know we have a triple lock but it is a concern if we have regional arrangements or regional agencies which have engaged in UN mandated activities in that the fact that they have at some point engaged in UN activities does not mean that is a carte blanche that we should consider the other operations of that international organisations are necessarily ones to which we can second contingents of the Permanent Defence Forces and to which we potentially concede operational control.  There are many other activities that NATO or any other regional alliance or agency may take part in which are very much not in the remit for Ireland, and that is very important.</p> <p>I have another amendment in that regard.  I have tried to clarify it to give some clarification in respect of "or has participated" to "and is currently working as part of an international UN force".  I am trying to make it very clear.  I am not saying that we do not work in exceptional circumstances with many different kinds of partners.  I recognise that, but the fact that we worked with it under a UN mandate once does not mean the State should consider it fine to work with it in other circumstances.  I would bear in mind that section 3(1)(a) is quite wide in what we might second Permanent Defence Forces to.  There are other aspects of the definition which I have chosen not to take issue with because I am really trying to drill down to the core piece here.  There are other aspects.  If we look at partnerships the European Union has had - I am not sure where they fall in to it - it has made some mistakes in its partners.  Consider the immigration control deals we had in the past where the European Union partnered and trained the kinds of activities covered here, such as the Libyan coastguard which has been involved in extreme human rights breaches, or where the European Union supported the former military dictatorship under Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir in Sudan for his border guard.  There are times when co-operation may be appropriate but there are other times when it is not appropriate.  There is much at stake in terms of ensuring we make clear and good decisions.  We must be clear on who we work with, and when.</p> <p>This does not rule out the humanitarian capacity but it states that when seconding an entire contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces, we should be sure we are doing so either to the United Nations, OSCE, the European Union, or if it is a regional arrangement or agency, that we do that as part of a United Nations force.  This does not affect engagement in humanitarian partnership under section 3(1)(b) to section 3(1)(h).  It does not affect those activities but it affected the secondment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces.</p> <p>It is a loophole and it may be an oversight in the legislation.  We can all understand that "has participated" one time does not mean it is an imprimatur of permanent potential alignment.  Given that the Minister gave the example of NATO under this example - I did not suggest this example; it came from the Minister on Committee Stage - that rang alarm bells for me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#S00200"><p>I do not agree with the amendment.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, used NATO as an example on Committee Stage but as the Senator said he used the example of mine clearing in the context of the co-operation that goes on between the Irish Defence Forces and NATO.  My understanding is, and I am open to correction on this, the other structures that are in place to protect our involvement in international operations remain.  The notion that the definition in section 1 of the 2006 Act could be stretched to where Senator Higgins is expressing concern is legally impossible.  It is a definition that has been there for more than 15 years.  It does not appear to have been misused in any way.  I wonder if Senator Higgins is identifying a problem that is not actually there.  The definition is undeniably broad but I refer to what I said in respect of the first amendment.  To an extent we must trust in the Minister of the day whoever he or she may be or whatever party he or she may be from to make the decision and to afford that Minister the flexibility to make the decision, conscious of the fact that he or she could not make a decision that would contradict Ireland's neutrality or put Irish forces into an operation that would contradict the triple lock that is in place.</p> <p>While I acknowledge that Senator Higgins identifies an issue, I am not sure it is in real terms a practical issue that might arise.  It is a definition that has been there for some time.  To use it in the way the Senator fears it may be used would be to stretch it to a legal breaking point.</p></speech>

If there is any danger that we are crossing the line or being asked to cross the line, there is a senior Irish Army officer or a senior Defence Forces officer in the field who can get straight back to the Department.  There is very little chance that our troops could be used for something that was not approved by the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the first instance.</p></speech>

In regard to amendment No. 2 and some of the other amendments, I know these were discussed on Committee Stage.  I am concerned that if this amendment No. 2 was accepted it would result in a fundamental change to what is a long-standing and settled policy in regard to the despatch of military contingents for overseas service.  It might be useful to set out briefly the quite strict limitations in law on the roles and functions for which the Defence Forces can be deployed overseas outside of being part of an international United Nations force under the 1960 Act.  These particular roles and functions are specified in section 3 of the 2006 Act as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	(1) A contingent or member of the Permanent Defence Force may, with the prior approval of and on the authority of the Government, be despatched for service outside the State for the purposes of&mdash;  	(a) carrying out duties as a military representative or filling appointments or postings outside the State, including secondments to any international organisation;<br /><br />(b) conducting or participating in training;<br /><br />(c) carrying out ceremonial duties, participating in exchanges or undertaking visits;<br /><br />(d) undertaking monitoring, observation or advisory duties;<br /><br />(e) participating in or undertaking reconnaissance or fact-finding missions;<br /><br />(f) undertaking humanitarian tasks in response to an actual or potential disaster or emergency;<br /><br />(g) participating in sporting events, or <br /><br />(h) inspecting and evaluating stores, equipment and facilities.  </blockquote> <p>There is nothing in this Bill which would seek to alter or extend those specific purposes as Senator Ward has outlined.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jack Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2429"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2429&amp;amp;pid=JackChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This specific amendment proposes to amend the definition of "international force" in section 1 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 by inserting the text "and is currently working" after "or has participated" in paragraph (d) of this definition.  This paragraph refers to any regional arrangement or agency that participates, or has participated, in operations as part of an international United Nations force.  However, inserting the text "and is currently working" into this definition would only allow the State to potentially deploy or work with organisations that are currently working under a UN mandate.  That is unnecessarily restrictive and would prevent the Defence Forces from being deployed overseas with many well-respected organisations.  For example, it might prevent the secondment of individuals or the posting of small numbers of personnel.  Checks and balances on such postings already exist within the Oireachtas.  The practical effect of this amendment and the other amendments in this grouping would be that additional restrictions would apply if the Minister for Defence considered personnel for appointments or postings in the EU, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, or any other similar organisation.  That is my position on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#T00200"><p>With due respect to the Minister of State, what he has said is not accurate.  The amendment would not prevent postings in the EU because the EU is covered under paragraph (c) of the existing definition, which refers to &quot;the European Union or any institution or body of the European Union&quot;.  It would not prevent postings to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe either because it is covered under paragraph (b).  It would only place a condition on paragraph (d) which refers to any regional arrangement or agency that is not the OSCE, the United Nations or the European Union or any institution or body thereof.  It is inaccurate to suggest that the amendment would affect work with the OSCE or the European Union.  It is also unnecessary to list all of the various factors under section 3(1) of the 2006 Act because the next three amendments will amend those and because this amendment does not affect any of them except the first one.  My amendment No. 2 would not affect participation in training, ceremonial duties, monitoring or observation, humanitarian tasks, reconnaissance, sporting events or the inspection or evaluation of stores.  It would only affect the provision at section 3(1)(a), which relates to secondments to an international organisation of individuals and contingents of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>There has sometimes been a tendency to present one piece, which we are all in favour of and which is, therefore, passed, but let us be clear.  My amendment specifically seeks to define an international organisation and to ensure clarity on taking part in regional arrangements or agencies - which, again, is very wide phrasing - that are not the OSCE, the UN or the EU.  It would still allow participation with such arrangements or agencies under all of the other grounds I have listed.  It would only affect engagement with them in respect of secondments.  It does not even interfere with appointments or postings outside the State.  It only relates to secondments, that is, where we are giving our Permanent Defence Force personnel to another international organisation.  It is reasonable that we would be clear on what international organisations we may do that for.  If it is not to be one of our trusted multilateral partners, we should at least now that we are acting under a United Nations <i>imprimatur</i>.  That is the clarity we need and that we should have.</p><p>We are discussing activities for which contingents of the force may be seconded which are not covered under sections 3(1)(b) to 3(1)(h), inclusive, of the 2006 Act and not carried out by the OSCE, the United Nations, the European Union or any of its bodies.  These are other activities that we are seconding people to other forces to take part in.  It is a problem.  In fact, it is an abuse of the United Nations if we use the fact of having previously participated in a United Nations activity as a badge to give sanction for any potential future activity.  That is a misuse of the United Nations.  It makes it problematic for the United Nations to work with specific regional or other parties, groupings and forces if, when it does, that is seen as an <i>imprimatur</i>for other countries to continue to co-operate with them on any level.  It is problematic and Ireland, with its responsibility to the United Nations, should be careful as to how United Nations participation is used or abused.  The Minister of State gave the example of mines and asked whether I was suggesting that, when we finish participating with the United Nations, we should not continue to co-operate with those involved, outside the UN mandate.  I was very clear that we should not.  </p><p>I regret that the Minister of State is not able to accept the amendment.  It is something on which we need to be clear.  We are entering very turbulent times internationally.  We need clarity.  Ireland has something to lose because we have been champions of multilateralism.  That is why I want us to have high standards and clarity.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

Again, I have adapted all of my amendments to reflect the discussion I had with the Minister.  I greatly respect the Minister and the very strong points he made on Committee Stage.  That is why I have adapted these amendments to reflect that discussion.  It is also why I am disappointed that the Minister and the Department have not brought forward their own amendments because that would have been a very positive signal.</p> <p>Amendment No. 3 seeks to introduce clarity with regard to secondments under section 3(1)(a) of the 2006 Act.  My amendment refers to the secondment of a contingent.  The Minister made the case, which I understood, that Ireland may occasionally have to second individuals to a number of different kinds of international organisations.  This may be for the purposes of giving an organisation those individuals' expertise or it may relate to the honorific appointment of a member of the Irish Permanent Defence Force.  However, when a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force is involved, that is, a large grouping that can be commanded, especially under the new Act, thereby giving military power to an international organisation, rather than an individual who is there to represent and be the voice of Ireland in a given situation, it is appropriate that there would be engagement with the Oireachtas where such secondments are for a period of 12 months or where a second secondment to the same organisation is proposed.  </p> <p>I am again trying to give space.  The Minister said that most of these secondments and roles tend to last six months.  These are not covered in my amendments.  I am allowing the Minister to make decisions that may be needed to second a contingent to an international organisation for six months.  My amendment explicitly refers to secondments that last for longer than those six months, for 12 months or more, and to the renewal of secondments, that is, a second period of secondment.  At that point, we are no longer talking about situations in which speedy decisions need to be made, perhaps in high-pressure circumstances.  There will have been a period of at least six months, if not one year, in which the Minister will have had the opportunity to engage with the Oireachtas appropriately and to discuss why Ireland is choosing to second contingents, not individual members, of our Permanent Defence Force.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Sadly, due to the poor terms and conditions that apply within the Defence Forces because of the failure to value its members, we do not have as many personnel as we should have.  That is a separate discussion, which, I am aware, we all had on Second Stage.  I hope we will have a chance to address it further.  If we are renewing an arrangement to send a contingent of our overstretched Permanent Defence Force to an international organisation, or sending it for longer than one year, it is appropriate for the Minister to engage with the Oireachtas and make his or her case for it.  That is what amendment No. 3 seeks.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 refers to where a contingent or member of the Permanent Defence Force is seconded to an international organisation described under paragraph (d).  Again, this relates to the issue regarding paragraph (d).  Amendment No. 4 does not affect the secondment of an individual or a contingent to the OSCE or any EU or UN body, but it means that when sending individuals or a contingent to be part of a more ambiguous arrangement, such as a regional agency, body or alliance, such as NATO, they should be engaging only in activities under section 3(1)(b) to (1)(h) of the 2006 Act.  I refer to arrangements involving a force that may have participated at some point in a UN activity but that may not be participating under a UN mandate.  The activities encompassed include humanitarian action, reconnaissance and information-related work, or those associated with the various grounds that the Minister of State listed.  If there is ambiguity over an alliance that personnel are to be seconded to, let us at least nail down the exact purpose for which they may be seconded.  Under the relevant section of the 2006 Act, there is not a tightening of purposes.  Section 3(1)(b) to (h) clarify the purposes.  If we cannot tighten the kinds of bodies encompassed, let us tighten the purposes further.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 is the same.  Again, I am responding on the basis of the Minister of State making good points.  There is a wide range of bodies to which members of the Permanent Defence Force may need to be seconded.  Amendment No. 5, which is a reasonable compromise, proposes restrictions and simply suggests that those restrictions should apply only to contingents of the Defence Forces rather than individual members.</p><p>I engaged very thoughtfully on what we discussed on Committee Stage.  I believe these amendments reflect a refinement, a nuance and the discussion.  My preference would always be for the Government to introduce its own amendments to address the issues and concerns raised.  The amendments are my attempt to do so.  I hope the Minister of State might be able to consider them or at least indicate his intentions to address these issues.</p></speech>

As I set out previously, there are quite strict limitations in law covering the roles and functions in respect of which members of the Defence Forces can be deployed overseas beyond being part of an international UN force under the 1960 Act.  I set out the roles covered in section 3 of the 2006 Act.</p><p>Amendments 3, 4 and 5 are alternatives and are concerned with the provisions in the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006 for the secondment of members of the Permanent Defence Force to an international organisation.  These amendments, if accepted, would significantly alter the process for the secondment of a person for duties as a military representative or filling an appointment or posting outside the State.  Most of the time, secondments are of individuals or small numbers of personnel being posted.  If it were a larger contingent of the Defence Forces, other checks and balances would apply.  The practical effect of the amendments would be that additional restrictions would apply if the Minister for Defence considered personnel for appointments or postings in the EU or to the NATO Partnership for Peace liaison office, the OSCE or any similar organisation. </p><p>Amendment No. 3 would, in certain circumstances, require the Minister of Defence to seek the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann regarding the secondment of a member of the Permanent Defence Force to an international organisation.  It is important to note that the list of organisations and types of organisations covered by the term &quot;international organisation&quot; are clearly specified in section 1 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.  They are:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) the United Nations,<br /><br />(b) the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe,<br /><br />(c) the European Union or any institution or body of the European Union, or<br /><br />(d) any regional arrangement or agency that participates, or has participated, in operations as part of an International United Nations Force </blockquote> <p>There are already clear provisions in the Defence Acts covering the secondment of a member of the Permanent Defence Force to an international organisation. It is vital to our national interests, in respect of engaging with and influencing developments in these spheres, that the State have the capacity to deploy personnel to such organisations, in support of international peace and security, to influence ongoing developments, gain professional experience and knowledge of the structures and <i>modi operandi</i>of such organisations and feed that information back into the defence organisation and the wider Government system, as appropriate.</p><p>The Minister has considered the Senator's amendments.  As indicated, we will not be accepting them.  There is an annual motion in the D&aacute;il that already allows for the discussion of secondments.  That is an existing structure within our parliamentary system.  The relevant Oireachtas committee regularly debates the secondments or any international role the Defence Forces have.  Information is also made available through our parliamentary question system, whereby details and facts are given to Members.</p></speech>

My proposed subsection (3)(a) explicitly states, "for a contingent, rather than an individual member, of the Permanent Defence Force".  It was explicitly about contingents, not individual members.  It is unfortunate that the response still reflects the same argument made on Committee Stage when, in fact, the amendment is trying to address something quite different.</p> <p>It is good that there is a discussion on secondments.  I hope there will be a more detailed one.  Unfortunately, the parliamentary question system is not available to us in the Seanad &ndash; that should be rectified but I will leave that aside for now &ndash; and that is one of the reasons we seek clarity and more information.</p> <p>With absolute respect for the Minister of State, I took on board the various concerns, including on the training of individual members.  My amendments do not relate to individuals; they relate only to contingents.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has indicated that a motion on secondments will be brought before the D&aacute;il, which is appropriate, but the purpose of my amendment, which proposes that report be laid before the Houses, is to strengthen slightly the information we have and our examination of our participation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every two years there would be a report to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I know that a motion is being brought to the D&aacute;il but I am seeking to include the Seanad in this.  The report would give a summary of international missions in which Ireland is participating and a summary of the secondments of the contingents of the Permanent Defence Force.  I recognise that there may be confidentiality reasons relating to individuals when they are seconded, so this provides that it is only where there is a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force that we would have that information regarding secondments.  It would outline the delegations of operational control where a delegation of operational control has been decided upon and where the Minister has authorised that under the new powers in the Bill we are passing today.  Where a Minister has authorised "participation in international missions, delegation of operational control or the secondment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to an international organisation not operating under a United Nations mandate", that is, if any of those other grounds of a covered international organisation or potentially wider grounds covered by any force, the report should include information under the relevant category of international organisation.  If it is under that definition that includes the OSCE, the European Union and its relevant bodies and regional or other alliances, there is clarity on which international organisation we have delegated operational control to participate in an international mission with or seconded a contingent of the Defence Forces to, and information relating to which of the purposes listed under "section 3(1)(a) to (h) of the Act of 2006" have been relevant.</p><p>Some of this information may already be available and it certainly may be available in response to individual questions, but it is important that we identify the patterns.  I believe we must have further examination even under the categories of sections 3(1)(a) to (h).  As I said, some of the apparently benign activities, for example, activities where we are perhaps participating with or supporting the European Union, are raising very serious questions that are actually at odds with some of Ireland's humanitarian and human rights commitments.  The fact is that many of those who we partner with are not bound by the principle or idea that one only engages in military activity or in these security activities in respect of principles, but that one does not do so in respect of consolidation of powers.  One of those clear areas has been in respect of immigration control.  The question for us is whether we participate in or contribute to a security agenda which is, in fact, an immigration control agenda.</p><p>I believe the European Union has lost a lot of international credibility with regard to its human rights record through some of the arrangements it has made, which are security arrangements and which have involved the transfer of military and other supports not necessarily to direct conflict but to authoritarian regimes, in respect of immigration control.  One has to ask if that is an appropriate purpose.  The Libyan coast guard is the example I gave, but the other example, which is very sadly in my mind at present, is the support that was given to the Sudanese border guard which many humanitarian organisations identified as having connections to the Janjaweed during the military regime of Omar al-Bashir.  Ireland was an example of how the European Union could have been doing something very good in that region because Ireland had an excellent diplomat, Dr. Sinead Walsh, who was the EU representative in South Sudan and doing incredibly important work, the type of work Ireland can lead on, on diplomacy and peace-building.  At the same time other elements of the European Union were giving partnership, military training and supports to a border guard.  Eventually that ceased, which was good, but those who were originally supported are now part of the military coup that overtook the civilian-led Government just a month ago in Sudan.  That is really tragic because that was probably one of the most visionary and peaceful revolutions and transitions away from dictatorship that we have seen on the continent of Africa.  It is heartbreaking that this has happened.</p><p>I am saying this to indicate why I am seeking that report.  I am sure that technical information might be available mission by mission, but it would be useful to put them alongside each other and to also put it in a context of having a conversation about where we want to contribute and what we want to be part of.  Ireland's humanitarian search and rescue in the Mediterranean got switched to a security agenda which involved basically ensuring that nobody crossed the Mediterranean, even though people ended up in Libyan camps funded by the EU where human rights breaches were taking place.  This is the context.  I am very pro-Europe and I am part of the future of Europe.  I believe Ireland can be the moral standard in terms of humanitarianism, human rights and extremely thoughtful and principled military engagement in defence, security and peace-building engagement in Europe.  The reason I am seeking this extra information and discussion and want the Oireachtas to get engaged on these issues, is that I believe we have something important to offer and it is important that we do not let it slip away.  I hope the Minister of State can give a response on the report.</p></speech>

It is important to note that section 2 of the Bill simply provides for the current de facto position and will ensure the continued efficient and effective operation of the mission to which the contingent is being deployed.  It allows the force commander to direct the activities of the Irish contingent, within certain limitations prescribed by the Minister, to undertake the mandated tasks required for the effective operation of that force.  The Bill does not extend in any way the purposes which are clearly specified in section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) Act.  This legislation maintains the same approach that has applied on an administrative basis for many years in terms of what has been a delegation process, which was not written into legislation.  That is now being regularised through this Bill.  The Bill is not putting anything new in place.  Furthermore, the legislation does not alter the current legislative framework relating to the triple lock and any requirements in terms of getting Government approval, D&aacute;il approval and having a UN mandate.</p> <p>As regards the proposed requirement to report on the operation of the Act every two years, as has been stated by others there is already a statutory requirement for the Minister for Defence to report annually to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the deployment of members of the Defence Forces on UN missions or UN-mandated missions.  The report includes details of any such missions and it could also be used to provide information relating to any delegation of operational control issued by the Minister for Defence in the previous year.  In addition, there is a motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann each year on this report.  This gives the Members of the House an opportunity to have a comprehensive discussion on all issues relating to overseas missions.  As Senator Craughwell mentioned, all those reports, and I schedule them as a Whip, are referred in the first instance to the respective Oireachtas committee where there is a comprehensive discussion.  Then they are referred back to the D&aacute;il with the committee's approval.  There is Seanad involvement from that perspective.</p> <p>Furthermore, details are provided regularly in response to parliamentary questions or Commencement matters on the deployment of members of the Defence Forces on overseas operations, including details relating to the secondment of members of the Permanent Defence Force to international organisations.  To summarise, the Minister is of the view that there are existing comprehensive mechanisms in place for the reporting of information on the deployment of the Defence Forces in overseas operations and that there is no requirement for any additional reporting structures, so I will not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Seanad has an international interest and an international perspective.  The Minister of State will be aware that many key debates on defence, ranging from Jadotville to other matters, have taken place in the Seanad.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He will also be aware that the Seanad has a long record of human rights and humanitarian activity and motions.  In fact, not just this Seanad but several Seanaid have had that focus.  The annual discussion that takes place in the D&aacute;il might be something we should seek to replicate in the Seanad.  It is certainly a proposal I will bring to the Seanad Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight or to our leaders' meetings.  I hope the Minister of State and the Department will facilitate such a discussion because Members would have useful perspectives to add to the debate and it would give further assurance or another level of scrutiny or set of perspectives to that scrutiny.  In this context, I will not press the amendment but I am going to pursue an annual discussion on secondments and international missions in which Ireland takes part.  </p><p>For example, I am very concerned that Ireland is withdrawing its participation in the UN mission in western Sahara at a time when I believe the mission should expand from supervision of a referendum that is not happening to humanitarian and human rights monitoring on the ground.  The mission in western Sahara that deserves a slightly expanded brief and I hope Ireland will continue to participate in it.  I am aware the Permanent Defence Forces are overstretched, which is another reason we need to be very careful about how we are using them in order that they are most effective and used where Ireland can add its unique value and talent and its particular perspective and international credibility as a neutral but committed human rights and humanitarian peacemaker.</p></speech>

It is a relatively short Bill but it is significant.</p><p>The need for the Bill follows from the 2019 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Wayne Ellis <i>v. </i>Minister for Justice and Equality.  In this ruling, the Supreme Court struck down section 27A(8) of the Firearms Act 1964, which provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment for a second or subsequent offence of possession of a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances.  The court found that it is not constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to specify a mandatory minimum sentence that only applies to a limited class of persons, namely, those who have committed a second or subsequent offence for one or more listed offences.  The court held that the application of a mandatory minimum sentence to a distinct category of persons in such cases amounted to the administration of justice and, under Article 34 of the Constitution, justice may only be administered by the Courts, not by the Oireachtas.</p><p>From a policy perspective, the Bill only has one purpose, which is to rectify the constitutional infirmities identified by the Supreme Court in the Ellis case.  This is achieved by the repeal of all sentences on the Statute Book that provide for a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for a second or subsequent offence.  I am advised that it is not necessary to repeal the specific firearms provision that was struck down in the Ellis case.  I  am advised that the practice is not to repeal such provisions as they are already deemed void.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This Bill repeals all other penalties, including those linked to firearms and drug offences, which involve mandatory sentences for second or subsequent offences.</p><p>It is important to note that the Ellis judgment only deals with mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences.  It does not affect provisions in statute which provide for presumptive minimum sentences where there is judicial discretion.  In addition, the ruling did not mean the automatic release of offenders who may currently be in prison having been convicted of an offence which has a mandatory minimum sentence for a second or subsequent offence.  Instead, the Supreme Court ruled that the appropriate course of action in such cases was for the offender concerned to receive a new sentencing hearing.  It is also worth noting that in giving its judgment in this case, the Supreme Court made the important general point that sentencing always involves a consideration of the following factors by the Judiciary: the gravity of the offence; the circumstances in which it was committed; the personal situation of the accused; and mitigating factors.  These important sentencing principles are unaffected by the Bill.</p><p>I will now outline the Bill's main provisions.  The first three sections refer to pre-1922 legislation that is still in force in Ireland.  These older Acts contain unusual provisions with a type of mandatory sentence for repeat offenders which have now been identified as being in conflict with the judgment in the Ellis case.  Amendments are being made to ensure that the offence referred to in each section operates in line with judicial discretion and does not provide for a mandatory sanction which is more punitive for persons who have committed second or subsequent offences.</p><p>Section 1 amends section 49 of the Dublin Police Magistrates Act 1808 and mandatory penalties for second or subsequent offences relating to the concealment of stolen goods.  Section 2 amends section 40 of the Illicit Distillation (Ireland) Act 1831 and penalties for second or subsequent offences relating to illicit making of malt and distillation of spirits.  Section 3 amends section 32 of the Refreshment Houses (Ireland) Act 1860 and penalties for second or subsequent offences relating to wine licences for refreshment houses.</p><p>Section 4 amends section 15 of Firearms Act 1925 which provides for penalties for the offence of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life.  Section 5 provides for the amendment of four separate provisions in the Firearms Act 1964, namely: section 26, which provides for penalties for possession of a firearm while taking a vehicle without authority; section 27, which provides for penalties for use of firearms to assist or aid escape; section 27A, which provides for penalties for possession of a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances; and section 27B, which provides for penalties for carrying a firearm with criminal intent.</p><p>Section 6 amends section 27 of Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 which provides for penalties for a range of offences relating to the misuse of drugs.  Section 7 amends section 12A of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 which provides for penalties for shortening the barrel of a shotgun or rifle and similar offences.  Section 8 amends section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 which provides penalties for the commission of a scheduled offence where a person has already been convicted on indictment of a scheduled offence within a specified period.</p><p>Section 9 is a technical amendment to section 24 of the Parole Act 2019, which sets out provisions on the eligibility for parole.  Section 24(12) of this Act makes reference to section 27(3F) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, which provides for the mandatory minimum sentences for second and subsequent drug offences.  This reference is in the context of specifying the minimum term of imprisonment to be served before a person may become eligible for parole.  Section 9 removes this reference from the Parole Act 2019.</p><p>Section 10 addresses transitional issues in the form of the retrospective application of this Bill in certain circumstances.  By way of background, the normal position under section 27 of the Interpretation Act 2005 is that any repeals or amendments of existing criminal penalties by way of new legislation only apply to offences committed after the new legislation has been enacted.  Therefore, the proposed repeal of mandatory minimum sentences in the Bill as published would not apply to persons who have committed an offence before enactment but who have not yet been charged, persons currently before the courts or persons who have been convicted of a relevant offence and are currently serving a sentence.  I am advised that in these circumstances, there is potential for further litigation in the case of persons who may have committed offences or may have been convicted before the enactment of this Bill, which could potentially engage the penalties for mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences that are to be repealed by this Bill.  Such litigation would potentially involve continued legal uncertainty and legal costs.  In these circumstances, the Attorney General has advised that the State must be clear and explicit on the issue of retrospective application of the repeal of sentences in the Bill.</p><p>The net effect of section 10 is to ensure that persons who have already committed an offence, persons who have been charged with an offence or persons who have been convicted of an offence will also be subject to the repeal of mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences.  In any case where such persons will be sentenced, the mandatory penalties for second or subsequent offences will not be a sentencing option.  In any case where such persons are already serving a sentence, they will have been able to seek a fresh sentencing hearing.  It is also important to note that section 10 provides that the repeal of sentencing provisions in the Bill applies in all cases with the exception of those that have reached final judgment, that is where a case has already proceeded to appeal stage and been finalised or where the time for the appeal has expired.  This approach is consistent with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights.</p><p>Section 11 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and commencement.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators.  There will of course be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail any aspects of the Bill that Senators wish to explore further.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il is delighted to support the Bill, which addresses the constitutional issues that emerged in the Supreme Court judgment in the Wayne Ellis case in 2019.  In that instance, the Supreme Court found that the Oireachtas could impose mandatory prison penalties but only if they applied to all persons.  It is not constitutionally permissible for the Oireachtas to specify a mandatory sentence which only applies to a limited class of persons, such as a person who had previously committed one or more listed offences.  The court held that the application of a penalty in such cases in the administration of justice and under Article 34 of the Constitution may only be administered by the courts.  A number of other similar legislative provisions provide for mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences contained in firearms and misuse of drugs legislation.  It is essential that other laws containing similar provisions should be repealed.</p> <p>It is important that this legislation passed quickly as it has been advised that no further sentencing hearings should proceed until the relevant legislation has been amended.  The DPP has given instructions to that effect.  It is critical that no delays should occur with this legislation after, of course, it has been properly scrutinised.  It is important that the free flow of the courts system is not blocked by this.  However, the Supreme Court ruling does not have any impact on laws which provide for presumptive minimum sentences where there is judicial discretion.  The Minister of State referred to this legislation as small but significant, which is a very accurate description.</p> <p>It is important that we proceed with haste with the Bill.  It is limited in scope and targeted at discrepancy that has been highlighted.  I look forward to its speedy passage through the House.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an-bhr&oacute;d orm a r&aacute; ar son Fhine Gael go bhfuilimid i bhfabhar an Bhille seo.  Is ceart agus c&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn mar Oireachtas a bheith ag &eacute;isteacht i gc&oacute;na&iacute; leis an Ard-Ch&uacute;irt, ach go h&aacute;irithe, agus leis na c&uacute;irteanna go l&eacute;ir agus a bheith ag f&eacute;achaint ar an m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh na hAchtanna &oacute; na Tithe seo agus conas mar a chlo&iacute;nn siad leis an mBunreacht.</p> <p>It is very important that we take on board the decision of the Supreme Court in the Ellis case.  I will not rehearse what has been said about that case, but the Supreme Court has identified a very clear issue there.  Sometimes in these Houses we like to talk about imposing particular sentencing regimes and saying that certain mandatory sentences must be in place, which we should be slow to do.  It is very important that we trust the Judiciary, which is made up of individuals who are beyond reproach, incredibly experienced and well trained in their own professions when they come to the Bench.  On the whole the Judiciary in this country is very functional, which is not something that cannot be said of every European state even.  Obviously, we are particularly aware of the difficulties that exist in Poland, for example.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Here, we have a Judiciary that acts well, in accordance with law and with fairness to all sides.  It is therefore appropriate that in the legislation that we put forward in this House, we should give the Judiciary the discretion to deal with cases as it sees fit.  Notwithstanding the importance of certain mandatory sentencing regimes, as Houses, we should generally be slow to impose mandatory regimes.  Therefore, it is appropriate that this Bill undoes some of the mandatory elements that we had put in place in legislation.<br/><br/>I cannot help but remark on the fact that this Bill very closely mirrors a Bill I put forward earlier this year, the Criminal Procedure and Related Matters Bill 2021, which was a reaction to the Ellis case and sought to undo some of the elements that were in place, particularly in relation to the modern legislation like the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, the Criminal Justice Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I will not pretend that I did as good a job as this Bill does.  Certainly, this Bill has uncovered legislation that I did not even know was in force, such as the Dublin Police Magistrates Act 1808, which I suspect nobody outside this room has either heard of in the last 50 years, or had any reason to deal with.  I looked up section 49 of the Act, which reads, very succinctly:</p><blockquote>	And ... that any person in whose dwelling-house, out-house, shop, warehouse, cellar, yard, or other place within the said police district any such stolen goods or chattels or any receiver of stolen goods shall be knowingly and wilfully harboured or concealed shall, upon being convicted by due course of law of so knowingly and wilfully harbouring or concealing such goods and chattels or any such receiver of stolen goods, for the first offence forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds, and for every subsequent offence the sum of two hundred pounds, or, if he or she shall be unable to pay the same, shall be committed to prison, without bail or mainprize, for any time not less than three or more than six calendar months for the first offence, nor less than six nor more than twelve calendar months for every subsequent offence; such forfeiture to be recovered by civil bill in the court of the recorder of the city of Dublin.   </blockquote><p>Of course, the court of the recorder of the city of Dublin no longer exists.  Therefore, the notion that we are repealing this legislation is entirely appropriate.  I was going to say that it is timely, but it is long past time.  In that context, it is worth acknowledging the ongoing statue law revision project within the Office of the Attorney General.  It is important that we particularly look at pre-1922 statutes, many of which are still on the Statute Book.  The Dublin Police Magistrates Act 1808 and the Illicit Distillation Ireland Act 1831 are still in force today, and until this Act passes, which, on one level, is absolutely ridiculous.  I encourage the Office of the Attorney General to continue at pace its work repealing that legislation that is no more in effect.  I recall that when I worked in these Houses as a member of staff many years ago, there were two or three Bills that went through at that stage that dealt with the most archaic legislation from the 16th century and 17th century relating to brick burnings and requirements for taxis to carry a bale of hay at all times, and that kind of nonsense.  Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that we proceed to undo that legislation and consign it to history, where it belongs.<br/><br/>I do not propose to speak to a large extent on this Bill because, as the Minister of State said, it is largely a technical one, but it does good things from the point of view of bringing the law in accordance with the Constitution, and addressing the issues that have been identified by the courts and some other issues in terms of the Bill.  In the context of making further amendments, I might suggest some amendments on Committee Stage arising from my own Private Members' Bill.  Perhaps the Minister of State will have regard to them.<br/><br/>On the whole, what has been done here is a very positive piece of streamlining of our law so that we both bring it into accordance with the Constitution, and equally, and perhaps almost as important, reflect the decision of the Supreme Court in the Ellis case - and I may be paraphrasing and putting words in the judges' mouths in this regard - to give greater power and discretion to the very effective Judiciary that we have to make decisions in the way that it sees fit in relation to any person who is being sentenced before the court.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1667" speakername="Vincent P Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#Z00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Previous speakers have said that this is a positive legislative initiative.  I would add that it is an essential initiative.  It stems from the case of Mr. Ellis, who entered a guilty plea in the Circuit Criminal Court.  The trial judge at the time, Judge Ring, suspended one of the counts relating to a five-year sentence.  It is worth noting that Mr. Ellis came before the court with 26 previous convictions.  That is commonplace in the criminal legal system.  The scourge and challenges which recidivism place on us all should get a proper airing on a day like this.  We have little or no say in bringing this legislation in, because the highest court in the land found that section 27 of the Firearms Act 1964, as amended, was repugnant to the Constitution.  When a provision is repugnant to the Constitution, it is up to the legislators to legislate and respond.  On this day, we should note the huge challenge of the scourge of repeat offenders, and the fact and harsh reality that many of the people who are convicted of more serious criminal offences before the court come from a couple of postal addresses in this country.  They are not given the same chances in life.  They almost follow their family, parents and grandfathers into criminality.  At times, it is weirdly like a badge of honour for some.  They have been let down by the State.  They have never got a second chance.  The prison system does not support them adequately when they are in custody, or else they would not reoffend upon release.</p> <p>The DPP challenged Judge Ring on the grounds of undue leniency in the Circuit Court.  One sees here a wonderful playing out of the courts, in a sense, in all their brilliance, and in ways, unpredictability.  The High Court judge, Mr. Justice Twomey, upheld the appeal of the DPP, and the three judges in the Court of Appeal did likewise.  Ultimately, the case went to the Supreme Court, under Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan, which held, by unanimous decision, that the Oireachtas had "impermissibly crossed the divide" in the constitutional separation of powers because it sought to determine the minimal penalty which must be imposed by a court not on all persons convicted of an offence contrary to section 27A of the Firearms Act 1964, as amended, but only on a limited group of such offenders identified by one particular characteristic, namely, that they had previously committed one or more of the listed offences.  </p> <p>As legislators, we should accept that when we are in the legislative business, we are not immune from such challenges.  We should accept that as part of the business that we are in, such challenges happen.  This is a classic example of the dynamic interplay of the separation of powers in our country, whereby Article 15(2)(1) of the Constitution vests with the Oireachtas the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State, but we are to be cognisant of other countervailing rights, such as those set out under Article 34(1), which states that: "Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided in this Constitution", and Article 38(1), which provides that: "No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law."  That is where the legislation fell.  It was very well intended, but due to the protections afforded us, the highest court in the land has given us clear guidance in its decision that the legislation was repugnant to the Constitution.</p> <p>It is a great example of how we should not take offence at, or take the hump with, the intervention of the court.  We should recognise it as a classic example of the democratic State working in all its splendour.  Central to the workings of this democratic State, and the central axis and backbone, is Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  I have cited the relevant articles.  While Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann is a living document which breathes and changes by the decade, particularly in light of the jurisprudence of implied rights, there are certain fundamentals, like the independence of the Judiciary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are lucky when compared with other EU member states such as Poland.  We have a robust, independent Judiciary which is doing its job well.  It is vigilant and we should be grateful for its vigilance.  We have a Legislature which also takes its job seriously.  From time to time, unintended consequences can be produced when the Legislature legislates.  That is the safely valve and those are the countervailing rights.  It is the beauty of the dynamics of the Constitution of Ireland, which is the central infrastructure of a working, organised State and rule of law.</p><p>The Minister made reference to the settled jurisprudence of sentencing law.  It is very well settled and it is a fine and complex science.  By and large, judges get it right but, from time to time, there is an unmerciful outcry in the media when judges seem to get it badly wrong.  However, like everyone else, they are human.  I hope there are enough resources for the Judiciary to constantly train its members in the challenging legal science of sentencing law.  Of course, the gravity of the offence must be considered but several other factors, some of them mitigating, come into play when passing sentence.  When the Circuit Court judge in the case in question was passing sentence, it was adjourned on a number of occasions and she was looking at different reports.  The learned trial judge ruled that a suspended sentence was appropriate on one count.  After a long and transparent run through the courts, the system has now made an unequivocal and unanimous judgment.  It is up to us, as legislators, to run with the ball, to respect the import of the judgment in the Supreme Court and legislate accordingly.  That is the process we are a part of today.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire St&aacute;it don d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.  The Minister of State is welcome to the House for the debate.  I have listened intently thus far.  I have a Second Stage speech, which is primarily technical in nature.  I suppose I can sum it up by saying that much like my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the D&aacute;il, we support this important legislation and will work with the Minister of State and our colleagues as it progresses through this House to help ensure it is as good as it can be.  My colleagues have acknowledged and said that this legislation stems primarily from the Ellis case.  That has been outlined by the Minister of State and other colleagues so I do not need to rehearse its technical importance.</p> <p>I want to make a couple of observations and points, respectfully.  I agree with the sentiment as to why this legislation is necessary and important, as my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues in the D&aacute;il argued when the Bill progressed through that House.  The heart of the matter must be about supporting communities and victims of crime, and ensuring that people are kept safe.  That must be the crux of considerations.  In taking on board all of the legal and technical points that some of our more learned friends have made already during this debate, we must also be alert to the needs of communities and the lived experiences out there.  We must ensure that the Garda is involved at every level and that community policing is front and centre in tackling repeat offenders.  We must also ensure that communities feel safe, able and emboldened to help all of the relevant agencies to come together and tackle the scourge of criminality on our communities and also in understanding why some people have become criminals and how they have been exploited, in some instances, to be repeat offenders.</p> <p>I do not know if I picked something up wrong, but I take issue with the notion of defining postcodes.  There are statistics that point to the presence of repeat offenders in certain postcodes but that does not suggest for one minute that there is not criminality in other postcodes, that repeat offenders are not engaged in criminal activity in other areas, or that some of those who are overseeing the repeat offences and criminality are not sitting quite comfortably in certain postcodes, while other postcodes endure the suffering.  The point of Second Stage is to have these sorts of debates and talk about legislation in its broadest sense.  I have a feeling that my colleague, Senator Ruane, will home in on some of those issues, given her own experience of working with communities, not least on the front line.  </p> <p>I again make the overarching point that we are clear that this legislation needs to be supported.  It needs to become a fact.  However, we also need to ensure that we in this House are fluid and that we can adapt, understand, appreciate and work to the needs of communities.  We must understand the lived experience out there.  Ultimately, we must be sure and clear in our conviction that we want to enable all of the relevant agencies and parts of this State to tackle the scourge of criminality and to keep our communities safe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#AA00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I welcome the Bill, which represents a step forward towards a fairer and more caring judicial system that is built on the ideals of justice and rehabilitation, rather than simply punishment.  I have spoken at length in the past of my strong beliefs that a culture of rehabilitation and education should be put firmly at the heart of our justice system because the way in which we treat our penal system is a reflection of us as a broader society.  We should, therefore, work towards creating a system which best supports reintegration into society.  I believe the best way of fostering such a system is by respecting the separation of powers which underpins our Constitution.  Article 34.1 of the Constitution establishes the courts as the administrators of justice in Ireland, the reason being that while laws can be simple and straightforward when legislated, their application to the complexity of life requires for each case to be considered on its own merits in order for justice to be fairly administered.  The principle is made clear in the detail underlining the Ellis <i>v</i>. the Minister for Justice case.  The issue at the heart of that case was that having heard the evidence presented before her, the judge sentenced Mr. Ellis to a five-year, fully suspended sentence.  Outlining the reasoning for her judgment, she wrote that Mr. Ellis was undertaking credible measures to reform himself and was therefore entitled to a degree of leniency.  However, due to the legislation which this Bill rightly seeks to repeal, she was barred from delivering her suspended sentence.  It begs the question of how many more judges wish to suspend the second sentences based on the circumstances of the case before them.</p><p>The Ellis case serves to illustrate the importance of respecting the separation of powers.  When we enter the Chamber and pass legislation, we can never fully imagine the individual circumstances of each case.  We should instead trust and support the Judiciary to be understanding and fair in its sentencing, based on the specific facts of each case, rather than binding judges to a pre-legislated set of minimum sentences.</p><p>In its recommendation for the Bill before us today, the Supreme Court set out how it reaches a just and fair sentence.  It considers the gravity of the offence, the circumstances in which it was committed, the personal situation of the accused and any mitigating factors.  The Supreme Court also highlighted that, regardless of legislation binding judges to a sentence, prior convictions or the lack thereof will always form part of the consideration when a judge is reaching an appropriate sentence.  For that reason, I support today's Bill to remove mandatory minimum sentences for second offences but I believe that this Bill is a genuine opportunity for us to go further and create a more understanding and rehabilitative justice system, first by removing the bar on temporary release under certain Acts.  For example, the same Firearms Act 1964 which this Bill seeks to amend still contains a bar on temporary release for those convicted under the Act.  In practice, that would mean that if Mr. Ellis was subsequently imprisoned due to a suspended sentence being overturned, the judge would be barred from allowing him temporary release to continue undertaking the credible measures to rehabilitate himself which led to the delivery of the suspended sentence in the first place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Shockingly, this is also the case with the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  Should a person who was showing signs of rehabilitation only to relapse temporarily be convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the judge in the case would be barred from allowing the individual to continue his or her rehabilitation through temporary release.</p><p>Second, the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Firearms Act still carry presumptive mandatory sentences.  While the legislation before us allows us to get rid of the current two-strikes-and-you-are-out system of sentencing, I believe this Bill is an opportunity to challenge the presumptive mandatory sentences that still exist and that continue to bind judges when sentencing, despite the individual mitigating circumstances of each case.  Repealing mandatory minimum sentencing with regard to drugs and firearms offences would be in line with recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its 2013 report on mandatory sentencing.  In making the recommendation to remove mandatory sentencing for drugs and firearms offences, the commission noted that the offenders most likely to be the subject of mandatory minimum sentences are usually individuals whose involvement in the drugs trade comes about through circumstance and for whom any statutory minimum sentence is unlikely to act as a deterrent.  Particularly in cases involving the misuse of drugs and firearms offences, these minimum sentences often only further dissuade those who have little or no intention of committing a crime in the first place.</p><p>If the State is to persist in legislating for minimum sentences, the law could simply become a reactive instrument.  If the Government is serious about lowering the number of convictions relating to the misuse of drugs and firearms, the Government should focus less on minimum sentences and more on anti-poverty and community policies.  Continuing to be seen to be tough on drugs by raising minimum sentences only serves to further punish and stigmatise communities that desperately needs investment and support.</p><p>I welcome the Bill as an opportunity for the Government to create a justice system that is based on rehabilitation rather than punishment.  I firmly believe that the Bill represents an opportunity for us to implement the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust to remove the bar on temporary release and presumptive minimum sentences for those convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act or in respect of firearms offences.</p><p>Under a sentencing Bill, which I successfully amended in the previous Oireachtas, it was accepted that there would be a review on sentencing guidelines carried out within two years.  That two years has now lapsed.  Is there an update from the Department on this review?</p></speech>

I now invite the Minister of State to make his concluding remarks.</p></speech>

The Senators will be aware that the Bill is limited in scope and is designed to rectify the constitutional infirmities identified by the Supreme Court with regard to repealing second or subsequent mandatory sentences, mainly in the area of firearms and the misuse of drugs.  As I noted in my introductory remarks, the Supreme Court ruling does not affect the provisions in statute that provide for presumptive minimum sentences where there is judicial discretion, and that issue is not addressed by the Bill.</p> <p>I note the following revisions to the criminal law amendments provided in this Bill.  First, in all of the laws that are being amended in this Bill there will still be very serious penalties in each law being amended for offences relating to drugs, firearms and other offences.  Second, the Bill will reduce legal uncertainty and litigation risks arising from the Supreme Court judgment in the 2019 Ellis case.  I note that the principles set down by the Supreme Court were adhered to in a further ruling this year on a section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  Third, while legislation providing for mandatory minimum sentences in second or subsequent offences is now deemed unconstitutional, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that previous offences are always taken into account by the Judiciary when it comes to sentencing, it is just that they must be considered as part of the overall judicial discretion within sentencing.  Fourth, the court has not struck down the concept of mandatory minimum sentencing that applies to all persons under the law, it has just struck it down as it applies to a subset of persons, in this case those who have committed second or subsequent offences.  The court has also not struck down the concept of presumptive minimum sentences, which set up a legal presumption that a particular sentence will apply, by also allowing judicial discretion for certain exceptional circumstances where presumptions may not apply.</p> <p>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  Senator Gallagher spoke to the importance of this Bill and the need for it to move in a brisk manner.</p> <p>Senator Ward made a number of positive comments, including the importance of streamlining the law and bringing it in line with the Constitution.  I agree with his point about trusting the Judiciary.  We have an experienced Judiciary.  Reference was also made to identifying the archaic legislation that is still out there and seeking to have that removed by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>Senator Martin correctly pointed out that we need a robust and independent Judiciary which is probably properly resourced.  A review is under way in respect of the needs of the Judiciary in the future, including the numbers of judges and the various supports required.  I listened also to Senator Martin's comments on the scourge of recidivism.  He made the point that a lot of recidivism is people ending up back in prison in circumstances where there is lack of support or where they come from areas of poverty, which often fuels a great deal of crime.  We need to tackle those causes by getting in there and supporting communities where crime has taken hold within communities.  These are certain aspects of what we are trying to do within the youth justice strategy, with a number of programmes under that.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said the priority must be to keep our communities safe.  I very much agree with him on that point.</p> <p>Senator Ruane made some extremely important points, especially about rehabilitation and reintegration, and that sentencing should not simply be about punishment because, ultimately, the latter achieves very little.  I do not have an update on the review on sentencing, but I will certainly get one for the Senator.  I will seek to have a look at the situation regarding temporary release for those convicted of firearms offences.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#GG00600"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach.  I am here to introduce a resolution to extend the sunset clauses of three Covid-19-related Acts.   The first is Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, No. 1 of 2020; the second is the Health (Amendment) Act 2020, No. 19 of 2020; and the third is the Criminal Justice (Enforcement (Covid-19) Act 2020, No. 14 of 2020.</p> <p>The House will know that these Acts are due to expire next week.  They provide for time-limited emergency powers to protect human life and public health.  These are powers that this House has already passed to meet the significant challenges we have faced to date in with Covid-19.  We had hoped to be well along the road to transitioning away from mandatory requirements to  an approach based on public health advice, personal judgement and personal protective behaviours.  This, unfortunately, is not the case.  This vicious disease has once again shown how quickly it can spread.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, we had an in-depth debate on these resolutions.  Opinion is, of course, inevitably divided on the powers that these Acts provide and, in particular, on the extension for the three further months permitted given the temporary nature of the provisions.  In this context, it is important to reiterate the public health environment that we are now experiencing. </p> <p>Disease incidence is very high and rising.  The 14-day incidence is nearly 700 per 100,000 of population, the 5-day case average is a little over 2,800 and reported cases today are likely to be well in excess of 3,000.  Cases numbers are rising across nearly all age groups.  While we are seeing a stabilisation in the numbers of people with Covid-19 in hospital, this is likely to increase again off the back of the current higher daily case numbers.  We are in a place where we have to be concerned about the burden and impact that this level of disease is having, and could have, on our health and social care services in the coming weeks and months and, obviously, on public health and, indeed, on public life.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are already seeing the cancellation of procedures and operations across the country and we have to be concerned that things could deteriorate further.  In its most recent advice to me, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, advised that the epidemiological situation in Ireland indicates a worsening disease profile, with the future trajectory very uncertain.  It is for this reason that the Government, on the advice of the NPHET, decided to extend a range of public health protective measures on a mandatory basis.  This means we need to extend these pieces of legislation that are before the House.</p><p>As has always been the case through the pandemic, the Government continues to commit to use these exceptional powers in a proportionate way.  These are emergency powers directly proportional to the emergency public health environment.  Their use is confined to mitigating the impact of the disease on the health of the public and they are not for prolonging a moment longer than is necessary in society.</p><p>I will provide a summary of each of the Acts.  The Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 allows me, as Minister, to make regulations giving effect to a range of public health measures for the purposes of protecting the public from Covid-19.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2020 provides for fixed payment notices in respect of certain alleged offences under the aforementioned Act.  The Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides additional enforcement powers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address breaches of the relevant Covid-19 regulations by any business or service selling or supplying intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises.</p><p>I remind colleagues of each of the sunset provisions in the three Acts that are pertinent to this debate.  The original extension of the sunset clauses in each of these three Acts to 9 November next was provided for in the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) Amendment Act 2021.  This House approved these extensions when it voted to pass the legislation.  Members will remember that I introduced an amendment to that Act, which originally provided for more than one extension of up to three months for each Act.  The amendment I introduced and which was accepted by the House permitted only one extension of these Acts for a period of up to three months on the passing of a resolution providing for such extensions by both Houses of the Oireachtas, which is what we are here to discuss.  After this one extension has lapsed, these Acts will no longer be operational.  The resolution before the House today is to provide for this final extension of the three Acts until 9 February.  Any requirements to extend these provisions beyond 9 February will require new legislation.</p><p>All present understand and appreciate the impact on people of this disease and the emergency measures put in place to deal with its harmful effects.  I have highlighted previously that Ireland is not alone in this crisis.  Indeed, across Europe and much of the rest of the world, Covid-19 has had a devastating effect on individuals, communities, societies and economies.  We are again seeing a changing situation across the EU, with rising incidences in many countries.  The measures we have decided to retain in Ireland are included in those that other countries are currently reaching for to deal with this surge in the Delta variant.</p><p>These are not easy decisions for us to make.  They do not sit easily with us in government and I know they do not sit easily with any Member of the Oireachtas.  It is the stated hope of the Government that we will not have to be in a position to use the provisions in these Acts any longer than is currently the case, but I must again reiterate the caveat that we simply cannot know what will face us in the coming months.</p><p>Of course, the reason we are able to keep so much open in spite of the current case numbers being so high is our vaccination programme and, critically, the fact that so many people across the country have stepped forward to protect themselves and everybody else, as well as the healthcare system and workers.  I acknowledge the very broad, generous and strong support right across the political spectrum in this House and the D&aacute;il in encouraging people to step up and get vaccinated.  It has been really important and I thank all colleagues in the Chamber for their help in that regard.  As Members will  be aware, we are continuing to send our message and are still reaching out to the 7% who have yet to be vaccinated.  Those who are unvaccinated account for a highly disproportionate burden on the healthcare system because they are so much more at risk.  Approximately half of Covid hospitalisations and nearly two in three ICU Covid admissions are from this very small group who are yet unvaccinated.</p><p>I am very happy to be able to share with colleagues that it appears that recent appeals to people to step forward, do the right thing and get vaccinated are being received well.  In the past two weeks, there have been approximately 24,000 new registrations, and more people who had not got around to getting a second dose are coming forward to get it.  That is very encouraging.  Obviously, we need to continue with that and I ask all colleagues for their help in getting that message out and encouraging people to do the right thing and get vaccinated.</p><p>As colleagues will be aware, the booster programme for the most vulnerable is now well under way.  Those who are immuno-compromised are receiving a third dose.  Residents of long-term residential care aged 65 or over have been receiving a booster dose, as have those aged 80 or over in the community.  As colleagues will be aware, we are starting this week with those aged 60 to 79.  Earlier this week, I was very happy to be able to authorise booster vaccines for healthcare workers.  Adding up all those groups, we are at approximately 1.3 million people in terms of boosters.  We may go further, but it is very encouraging that that is happening right now.</p><p>The continuance in operation of these emergency powers maintains the potential and flexibility to respond to this emerging Covid threat that is jeopardising public health.  It is a surge that we cannot allow to go unchecked.  The Government must act with caution to ensure the most vulnerable continue to be protected to the best of our ability.  In essence, the motions before the House ask for agreement such that we would be able to continue with Covid measures on a regulatory basis for the next 13 weeks.  That is it.  When this one sunset clause ends, there will have to be a whole new suite of legislation should we seek to be able to continue with this.</p><p>This relates to things like the Covid pass which has allowed large section of society to open and stay open.  Was it not wonderful to see the entertainment sector, artists, musicians and singers being able to get back to what they love to do?  That was only possible because of the Covid pass.  Much of the opening up of sporting events was only possible because of the Covid pass.  The opening and keeping open of hospitality such as pubs and restaurants was possible because of the Covid pass.  The mandating of face masks in retail, transport, healthcare settings and other settings is among the things that are only possible because of this legislation and these regulations.  Were the House to vote against this one extension, essentially, next week the State would no longer be able to insist on the use of face masks in places where public health experts tell us they are essential, the use of Covid passes or the use of a great number of measures that have very wide public support.</p><p>There was a very good debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday on a private Members' motion in respect of healthcare workers and there was a genuine expression of support for healthcare workers from right across the D&aacute;il.  I know all Members of this House feel exactly the same in that regard.  The motions today allow us to continue to protect healthcare workers such as nurses, midwives, doctors, students, therapists and everyone else working in the healthcare community in hospitals, communities, mental health services and disability services right across the country.  I am asking the House for agreement to the extension of these measures for 13 weeks - at which point there can be no further roll-overs - in order to protect public life, the healthcare system, patients, healthcare workers and jobs and keep the economy open.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that we are in this position.  I do not think anyone present wants to be in it.  The Minister stated that it is not an easy decision for this House or the Lower House to extend these extraordinary powers.  We hoped we would be in a much better position.  The uptake of the vaccine was extraordinary and very well received in this country but the viciousness of Covid is apparent to us all, as is the impact it is having on healthcare and the impact it will have in the future.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is proportional that we extend these powers for 13 weeks.  It is a relatively short period.  I hope we will then be able to reassess the situation and if, unfortunately, needs be, we will be able to proceed with further legislation, but I hope we will not be in that position.  I hope we will get through the winter, but these powers are needed to protect ongoing education and healthcare.  They are the two most important functions of the State.  If a state cannot keep its citizens healthy and educated, it has failed.  That is why these powers are necessary.</p><p>I wish to raise a couple of issues to which the Minister might respond when he responds to the debate.  I have had a number of queries from constituents worried about the lack of contact tracing in schools.  Our children are back in school and contact tracing is not ongoing because children generally do not pick up Covid in schools.  Our schools have been excellent at maintaining hygiene and other good practices within their environments.  However, I have had a number of vulnerable parents who are getting increasingly concerned contact me.  These parents are immunocompromised.  The Minister might address that point and whether there are any plans to reintroduce contact tracing in schools.</p><p>The booster programme is under way.  It is unfortunate that that did not happen a couple of weeks ago.  I understand that the more vulnerable sectors of society, such as people in long-term residential care and people over the age of 80, have received their boosters or are in the process of receiving them.  In addition, our healthcare workers, thankfully, are now getting their booster shots.  Will the Minister comment on other vulnerable communities?  I refer specifically to homeless communities and the Traveller and Roma communities, who have less positive outcomes from the health system.  They are medically vulnerable as well.  Are there any plans to give booster shots to those vulnerable communities?</p><p>There is also the issue of fake Covid certificates.  I have become more aware that they are freely available online and that people are using them.  Is the Minister planning any public awareness campaign about the existence of these fake Covid certificates or will there be any clampdown on their availability?</p><p>Finally, a number of people who got their first Covid shot had an adverse reaction to it but have not been able to avail of a second shot.  Therefore, they do not have Covid certificates, which rules them out from accessing a lot of areas of society.  Will these people be able to have a second shot of a different vaccine in order to obtain a Covid certificate?  These people are not vaccine-hesitant.  Because of their reaction to the first shot, will they be able to get a different vaccine?  The Minister might address that.</p><p>Members across the House might have concerns about extending these extraordinary powers.  I do too and I think every right-minded person does.  Given, however, the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves, it is reasonable and proportionate that we extend these powers for 13 weeks.</p></speech>

It takes me a couple of days after the clocks go back to adjust.  I am glad we are still limiting our clock changes to twice a year.  The Government seems satisfied more with changing the sunset clauses in its legislation.</p><p>It is with great pleasure that I inform the Minister that I am one of the reckless elected Members who will vote against the motion.  It really was a show in the Lower House yesterday - I will touch on that in a moment - but the Minister's speech gives too great an opportunity for scrutiny.</p><p>He stated: &quot;We are in a place where we have been concerned about the burden and the impact this level of disease is having on our health services.&quot;  We are coming up to two years of Covid.  That is two years to plan, two years to mobilise and two years to pull out all the stops and beef up our healthcare system to the point that is necessary to deal with this problem.  I spoke last month of how Sweden doubled its ICU capacity to tackle the pandemic, with the number of ICU beds in its capital quadrupling.  Drastic action was taken not in the form of foisting responsibility for disease control onto the population by enforcing lockdowns but by rising to the challenge and protecting the people.  If our health system is now burdened, it is not the fault of people who choose not to get vaccinated or children who want to go to school or play basketball.  Responsibility begins and ends with the Minister and his remit.  He said these laws were &quot;not for prolonging a moment longer than is necessary&quot;, yet we are prolonging them for as long as is possible under the parent Act, that is, the full three-month period.</p><p>He also stated: &quot;The intention is to only use the provisions within these Acts for the measures that are currently in place.&quot;  Quick, start the clock, because the last time the Minister came into this House and used that line in respect of the use of Covid certificates, it was less than two weeks before the Cabinet changed its mind.  I will keep an eye on the news on 17 November.</p><p>He then stated: &quot;Our strategy to manage the adverse impact of Covid has been guided by an evolving understanding of the disease.&quot;  What nonsense.  Our understanding of the vaccines has evolved.  Their real-world efficacy is falling far below test results, but the Government cannot acknowledge that, aside from boosters for the elderly, because it has never had a single plan other lockdown and waiting for the vaccine.  Now, with a 93% vaccination rate, we are no better off and the Government is, let us be honest, entertaining the idea of another lockdown, although it will wait until its media scare people for a few more weeks until it is open about it.</p><p>The Minister said: &quot;Government must act with caution to ensure the most vulnerable continue to be protected.&quot;  Who is he talking about?  That was the line being used when the narrative was that we just needed to have the over-80s, the over-70s or the over-60s vaxxed and that then we would go back to normal.  What is the narrative now?  Where are the goalposts?  They have been moved so many times I have lost track.  Maybe the Government has quietly packed the goalposts back into their container and we will just keep playing for the heck of it.</p><p>As for yesterday's fiasco, &quot;Fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts.&quot;  That is a direct quote from Community Transmission and Viral Load Kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) Variant in Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Individuals in the UK: A Prospective, Longitudinal, Cohort Study, which was published last month in <i>The Lancet</i>medical journal of infectious diseases.  Inconvenient science is still science - or should we just follow the State-sanctioned science?  It was this finding that Deputy Verona Murphy was getting at yesterday, a finding published in one of the world's oldest and best known medical journals, which the Minister labelled anti-vaccine information.  Of course, that has been one of the most useful social tools in controlling the debate on Covid - simply slap the label &quot;anti-vax&quot; on an opponent and suddenly any of his or her questions or critique do not have to be taken seriously.  It is beyond ridiculous that for months now, in both Houses, any Members wishing to ask bona fide questions about vaccines have been forced to qualify then with, &quot;I am not an anti-vaxxer but&quot;.  It is a cheap trick to insulate those in power from criticism and it makes for sorry behaviour from a Cabinet Minister.  The Minister can slap any label he wants on me.  I do not give two hoots about how he or anyone else will try to limit and police my speech.  I know who I am and I know what I am about, and that is standing up for the people of this country and for their civil liberties and freedom of speech and holding this Government to account for its stubbornly stagnated, faltering Covid response, which has simultaneously failed to suppress the virus while adopting the most overreaching and constrictive lockdown measures in Europe.</p><p>I have never supported the two-tier society the vaccine passport has created.  I suggest the Minister look at the scientific data on the efficacy of these experimental vaccines and start looking for a refund.</p></speech>

She has contradicted herself on a number of occasions.  It is unsurprising that she uses language about experimental vaccines that we know have worked.  The vaccine programme has been a universal success in this country and I have complimented the Minister on that previously.  That is not to say I am uncritical of how we have dealt with it and that mistakes have not been made; they have.</p> <p>I have reservations about aspects of what the motion proposes.  In fairness, the Minister has also expressed reservations.  It is not where we wanted to be.  I listened to what he had to say about where the current figures place us on this spectrum.  Even in that regard, we can be quite proud of where we are on that relative to our counterparts in this part of the world and in other parts of the world.  </p> <p>The figures are worrying.  Sometimes the job of Government is to make unpopular but courageous decisions to do things that people do not want us to do because they are in the common good.  The real challenge is in identifying where exactly that line is.  The danger is pushing through something that is unnecessary simply because a particular expert has advised the Minister to do it.  That said, I am very conscious of what has been said by the relevant experts in this case.  There appears to be unanimity among them as to what we should do in respect of this.  I am also not uncritical of what they have done and said in the past.  At times they have gone too far.  It is our job as a Legislature to consider what they say, assess it critically and make a decision based not just on the scientific evidence.</p> <p>One of the issues that has dogged us throughout this pandemic has been the debate between those who say we must slavishly follow the scientific advice and those who acknowledge that for us as legislators and for the Minister as a member of Government our job is not to slavishly follow that advice but to critically analyse it and to make a decision that does not simply take account of the scientific element because that is only one element.  We must also counter that with the economic effects, the social effects, and the effects on individuals from the point of view of their own physical and mental health.</p> <p>All of these factors must be weighed up in arriving at a decision, which is why I recognise that there are times when the Minister and his Government colleagues have made decisions that do not exactly mirror the scientific advice.  That is exactly right and proper.  I see no contradiction in that.  I see no difficulty with the idea that we should listen to the advice of experts, parse it and take from it what we need before making a decision that is hopefully in the best interest of everybody in the country.</p> <p>In considering what we are being asked to do today, we must also consider the legislation we are being asked to renew.  The Minister has pointed to the sunset clause that is coming next year and that this will be the final extension of this legislation.  That is as we voted for when these various Acts were being passed.  We all hope there will be no further need for legislation in this vein or any need to legislate for the restrictions and the infringements, if I can put it in those terms, on people in this country.  </p> <p>I also welcome the booster programme and the suggestion that boosters will be available particularly to those in the most vulnerable categories.  We all hope that as we get to the end of this year, we will hear much more positive news than the figures the Minister has outlined today and how we might address them.  </p> <p>We need to examine the effectiveness of the laws.  Based on what the Minister has told us, we do not have any analysis of how often they have been used.  How often have these significant powers included in these Acts been deployed by the relevant authorities, be it An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or anyone else?  How many cases have arisen from that?  How many successful prosecutions have there been?  It is important for us to have that information to make a proper assessment of the necessity for this legislation or otherwise?  I say that in circumstances where I have every intention of voting for this motion, reluctantly or otherwise.  None of us is happy about it, but I accept what the Minister has said that it is necessary on the basis of the advice he has received.</p> <p>Many of the legislative instruments he is asking us to extend are ineffective and unusable.  I said that during the debate on the Health (Amendment) Act 2020 last year when we identified in the Seanad on a Friday evening some significant flaws with the legislation.  In particular, the definitions of an occupier and things like that render it absolutely useless.  I have no concern that that legislation will be used to trammel any individuals rights because it is not constructed in a way that makes it usable.  Nonetheless, there are other important powers in the legislation we are renewing.</p> <p>The Minister made reference to the vaccine passport.  I absolutely and fundamentally disagree with the comments of Senator Keogan on the creation of a two-tier society.  We would all like to be able to do whatever we would like to do without the restrictions being in place, but that is a fact of life.  The reality is that we need to make tough decisions from time to time.  I genuinely feel for people who are unable to avail of the vaccine for whatever reason, particularly because of their own health.  I do not feel for people who choose not to do so.  That choice is not just about themselves, but also about the people they live with, the people they work with and the people they meet in the street, the supermarket or wherever it might be.  I have little enough sympathy for those people.</p> <p>However, there is a cohort of people in society who are unfortunately caught in the situation where they cannot be vaccinated for whatever legitimate reason, meaning that there are certain aspects of social interaction and ordinary activity in society that are not open to them, which is regrettable.  Unfortunately, some people choose to capitalise on that and to focus on terms like "two-tier society", which are grossly unfair in circumstances where we are facing something that has life-and-death consequences for certain people.  We cannot be cavalier about it like that and we should not try to score political points from it.  </p> <p>As I have said, I will support the motion.  I would like the Minister to address the two issues I have raised.  First, how much has the legislation been used or required?  I am not talking about the restrictions that we know about, such as the vaccine passports; I am talking about the times when the State or any State agency has been required to take action on foot of the particularly penal provisions that remain in these Acts.  What has the outcome of them been?</p> <p>Second, many of the provisions we are being asked to renew today are ineffectual; obviously many others are not.  A concern was expressed in this Chamber at the time of the passing of the Health (Amendment) Act 2020 that I think is correct.  It was passed on a Friday night to be in place for the weekend, but I do not believe it has ever been used - perhaps for that reason.  The Minister might be able to confirm that.  </p> <p>It is a horrible political clich&eacute; that we are where we are, but that is the reality of the situation.  We had all hoped to be further along the road than we are now, but we are not there.  I acknowledge that in those circumstances we need to maintain certain measures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#KK00200"><p>It is good to see the Minister, who is very welcome.  He will not be surprised to know that Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose the motion.  I wish to make it clear that we are not opposed to continuing reasonable levels of restrictions, such as face masks, testing requirements, travel restrictions and measures deemed essential to combating the spread of Covid-19.  We accept that some restrictions will need to be maintained, but circumstances have changed since this legislation was introduced in the first wave in early 2020.  We are opposed, in principle, to continuing emergency powers nearly two years into the pandemic.</p> <p>We believe that the onus is on Government to bring forward more appropriate primary legislation that does not needlessly and unaccountably devolve the powers of the Oireachtas to the Minister for Health.  It is the Oireachtas that makes the law, not the Government or Departments.  We have a constitutional duty to protect the separation of these institutions.</p> <p>This will be the third extension of Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020.  This is the tenth time that the Government has either introduced more emergency powers for the Minister for Health or sought to extend existing emergency powers in place, not counting the initial Acts, which we all supported in early 2020.</p> <p>Each time, we have called for more oversight, engagement, and scrutiny on new regulations.  In February, Deputies Daly and Cullinane introduced the Health (Parliamentary Oversight of Certain Instruments Relating to Covid-19) Bill, which would ensure a debate on new regulations within two weeks and encourage a more co-operative framework from Government.  The Government did not oppose this on First Stage but has not taken it on board in any subsequent Bills or Acts.</p> <p>The Government's defence is that it has limited extension of operation by way of resolution to one occurrence with further extensions requiring an amendment to the primary legislation, but that is not good enough.  Whether for mandatory quarantine, travel restrictions, Garda powers, offences, Covid-19 certs for travel or hospitality, or other restrictions generally, there has been a total lack of accountability to the Oireachtas by the Minister for Health.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are fundamentally opposed to the principle of indefinitely extending emergency powers to the Minister without adequate parliamentary oversight and no engagement.  We have, time and again, requested more robust, constitutionally compliant legislation with regular scrutiny and engagement on the regulations rather than the every-so-often theatre of motions to renew emergency powers long after that phase has passed. </p><p>The most recent example of why the Government's approach is bad for lawmaking is the latest hospitality regulations and the litany of problems in this regard, including having no back-up plan and leaving several days of no regulations at all.  There will be no more blank cheques from this side of the House.</p><p>I refer to the issue of vaccines because it has come up.  It is important to be clear about vaccines.  I went to London at the end of August with a number of friends, all of whom were vaccinated, like myself.  Three of them caught Covid-19.  They are clear that the vaccines stopped them from going to hospital and potentially losing their lives.  I want to be clear on one message from Sinn F&eacute;in, that is, we fully support vaccines.  We have no time for people who doubt vaccines.  We believe in the science.  It is important for that message to go out from all sides of this House.</p><p>There is another issue, which I mentioned on the Minister's most recent visit to this House and which I will raise again now.  When we talk about vaccines, we must talk about vaccine justice.  To date, the Government has not spoken out and called for a waiver of intellectual property, IP, rights for these vaccines.  When the Minister was in this Chamber a few weeks ago, he said in reply to me that he believes that the call for a waiver of IP rights has merit.  That was nice to hear, but, unfortunately, it does nothing.  We know that only 2% of people in Africa are vaccinated.  This Government has been silent.  It has not spoken publicly and called for a waiver of IP rights on vaccines.  That means there is still a situation where private companies, often imbued with millions in taxpayers' money from different governments, decide who gets the vaccine and who does not.  There should be no profit in a pandemic and I encourage anyone who has not yet signed that petition to do so.  When the history of this awful time is written, is the Minister prepared to say that he did not make a public call for a waiver on IP rights?  It is morally bankrupt.  I am saying that to him because I may not have another opportunity to say it before Christmas.  I am horrified that this Government will not stand up for justice and the developing world, or make a clear call on the EU and European Commission to change their policy and waive IP rights so that other countries can produce these life-saving vaccines and save their own people.  It is morally bankrupt, as I say, that this Government has not, to date, had the moral decency to stand up and do that.  I am calling on the Minister to do that today.  It is not enough for him to say he thinks the idea has merit.  He and the Government need to make that call.  We need to stand up for the people of the world right now.  Regrettably, this Government is still aligning itself with big pharma.  That is a disgrace in the light of what is happening in the world.</p></speech>

I spoke about the issue at the pre-COP26 conference and in both our sessions here with Members of the European Parliament, MEPs.  The EU needs to stand behind a TRIPS waiver.  However, that is not what we are talking about here today.  I completely understand that the Minister is here and that is why Senator Gavan brought up the issue but let us go back to what we are here to talk about because it is important.  I feel for people who have a fear around the vaccine and feel something is being done to them by the Government.  However, all of us here know that is not the case.  We have an obligation, as legislators and politicians, to stand up against that kind of rhetoric and say that these are not powers that extend to everything.  These powers will extend for a further three months and that is all.  They are not forcing anybody to do anything.  They are merely intended to protect front-line workers and those in the hospitality sector.  We are giving more supports, and continuing supports, to the Garda.  I am quite shocked, although I do not know why, at Sinn F&eacute;in representatives speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  They are in favour of vaccines but they are not in favour of protecting those who are vaccinated.  Human rights are not about us being able to do whatever we want; they are also about protection.  Workers in the hospitality sector do not have an option but to work in that sector.  They should be protected against those who put them in harm's way.  That is fundamentally what is happening if people go into pubs, restaurants and so on when they are not vaccinated.  We know it.  We can see the statistics.  The 14-day incidence rate has gone up even in the few days since I started researching this matter.  It is stunning.  If this was a year ago, we would have been shocked but we are almost becoming immune to it.  We are in a serious situation.  People are dying.  The Minister has outlined that two thirds of those in ICUs are unvaccinated.  This is a no-brainer.  We must make sure that everyone in society is protected, even in instances where they do not want to be protected because that is ultimately what will protect our workers.  It is the job of a government not to stand on the fence.  A factually incorrect statement was made to the effect that the emergency measures are being indefinitely extended.  How is a three-month extension indefinite?  It simply is not.  It is unfortunate that those sorts of terms are being used because it puts people into a situation where they feel fear.</p> <p>Some of the arguments are ideological and that is unfortunate.  Research has shown that of those who are against vaccines, 52% are on the right of the political spectrum and only 7% are on the left.  I do not say that to put people into categories but people who have that fear need to be aware that they are sometimes being pushed into a belief that they should be afraid of vaccines by people who are coming from a very ideological place that those people would probably disagree with if they understood what was behind it.  It is important to point that out.  I have personal experience of the people who contact me and send constant emails fearmongering about the illegality of vaccines.  They are often the same people who were against numerous other things.  Unfortunately, we do have to categorise some of those people who are against vaccines and having any of these powers in place.</p> <p>I share concerns, of course, and our job is to bring to light anything we feel is going beyond the reach of what we think is constitutional.  Of course we need to do that, and Senator Ward, in particular, has raised issues about previous legislation.  We were here late one Friday night discussing that issue and that is what this House is about.  However, we are now talking about a three-month extension of powers.  It is not allowing the Government to do whatever it wants.  We are in the Oireachtas so when Senator Gavan says that this legislation is allowing the Minister and the Government to do whatever they want, that is not the case.  We are voting on this.</p> <p>Those are my few thoughts on the matter.  I am supportive of these measures.  Every time we look at extending restrictions and powers, we need to have the Minister here to explain, as is right.  We should be allowed to freely raise our objections every time.  We must end the factually incorrect statements and scaremongering-----</p></speech>

We are rapidly hurtling into winter.  It is getting chilly.  We can see the numbers of people interacting with our health service.  The health service and our hospitals are very busy every year, but this season will possibly be busier than we have seen before.  Our system is going to be under enormous pressure because of the impact of the ongoing pandemic.  People also have continuing regular healthcare needs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is also a backlog which seems to be eternally growing.</p><p>Our health service is going to be under enormous pressure this year and while the Minister for Health may know what we may potentially be facing into, I am not sure that people do.  I have family members and I know people who are working in healthcare and who are completely exhausted.  They are incredibly tired.  We have to be honest.  We often use the phrase "perfect storm" in politics.  We love talking about a perfect storm appearing but we do face the three things I have outlined with regard to what this winter is going to look like for those healthcare workers.  Some people are saying that we have to use the measures we are talking about, looking at what happened last winter when numbers increase and it was very difficult.  They say we have no choice.  The flu will come back this winter.  I am getting my flu vaccine next week.  We could face an even more detrimental situation in our hospitals.  I do not necessarily want to bring this to the Minister's mind; rather, I want to highlight it for others.  We have healthcare workers who are still battling through and working.  I have never seen a healthcare worker who was not tired but I have never seen the ones I know as drained of every last ounce of anything they have.  The trolley watch figures from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation are particularly high.  There were 35 people on trolleys in Cork University Hospital only a couple of days ago.  I worry about what is going to come down the line with regard to hospital trolley numbers.  Healthcare workers in particular are feeling the impact in this regard.</p><p>I know we are talking about extending the emergency regulations but I will speak about our winter plan because it is relevant.  We do not have our winter plan yet.  Last year, we had it in September.  It is now November.  Is there a date for when that winter plan will be released?  It is already seven weeks later than it should be.  When talking about the extension of powers, the necessity for that and healthcare services, it is very important that we also have other legislation and plans to back that up, such as our winter plan.</p><p>If we have to extend these measures, there are other things that we and members of the public have to do and other things that we, as legislators, need to look at.  One of things that has come up a good bit is the issue of clean air and air quality.  Ventilation is one of the issues which has been most under-assessed or underutilised in dealing with Covid, especially considering that it is an airborne disease.  In conjunction with the extension of powers, do we have a regulatory proposal for the winter months regarding ventilation and clean air in workplaces as people go back to work?  We are shivering in our offices because we have every last window open, but that is something we have taken on ourselves.  Do we have a regulatory proposal?  If we are telling people that things are deadly serious and that we must extend these extraordinary powers, they would probably like to see guidance and leadership in related areas.</p><p>I believe it was 24 May when we last discussed these matters.  Many people talked about an analysis, review or report on these regulations and how they have been used.  They talked about a sort of human rights analysis of the measures.  I know we are saying these powers are not used very often but we are once again being asked to extend these extraordinary regulations, as we have been over the last 18-month period.  The Minister said that they did not sit easy with him when he was last here to talk to us.  We therefore have a responsibility to get a review of how, when and why they have been used.  We are turning to the public and saying that we must take these measures but without being able to say how, when and why they are being used.  The Minister must understand why that is causing frustration, annoyance and a sense of distrust.</p><p>We, as politicians, can get access to information through asking questions and so on.  That is why we are here.  However, it is important for members of the public to be able to understand how, when and why these regulations are being used.  They have been more than understanding and more than willing to come with us.  People have really put their best foot forward but, if we keep saying that we need a review as to how and why these powers are being used, there is an onus on us to be able to give a really comprehensive answer at some point.  If - heaven and God almighty forbid - we find ourselves coming back here in February having to pass further legislation or regulation, it would be extremely difficult to say that we have to extend these regulations again without having engaged in some sort of analysis as to how and why they are used.  I flag this issue because I mentioned it on 24 May.</p><p>As already stated, we recognise that these measures are extremely harsh and difficult.  We hope that they will not have to be used.  A colleague of mine said that, given the situation that is unfolding this winter, which mirrors the situation we saw last year, we may have no option but to use these measures but, as I have said, I believe the situation in our healthcare settings may be even more difficult.  I again put it to the Minister that there are staff who are worked to the bone.  I know there have been conversations about compensation and how they will be repaid but, if the winter we believe is coming does come, that conversation may need to be jogged on a little bit.</p><p>I will end with something I always talk about, the issue of our student nurses and midwives.  If we are talking about extending these regulations because we are still in a crisis situation with regard to Covid, that means our hospitals are still in a crisis situation and that our student nurses and midwives are still working in a crisis situation.  On 1 September, we ceased the &euro;100 weekly payment.  I know there is discussion about extending that and whether it will be put on the table again, but I will put it on the record today that, if we are extending these measures because there is an emergency situation, we need to recognise that our student nurses and midwives are working in that emergency situation.  That &euro;100 Covid payment needs to be continued for them.</p></speech>

It is only a few short weeks since we gathered in this Chamber to debate the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021, which saw the sunset clause on emergency powers extended by resolution until the 9 January 2022.  We were all hopeful in the intervening weeks that the epidemiological situation would improve to such an extent that these emergency powers, while provided for in legislation, would not be required.  Unfortunately, the epidemiological situation has deteriorated further in the interim and we are currently seeing infection rates as high as those at the beginning of this calendar year.  That is really sad.  The current trajectory of the disease is of concern, especially as we head into the winter months.  I am worried about the impact that the current infection rates will have on our families, friends and communities.  I am also very concerned about the impact that the disease will have on and in our hospitals.</p> <p>I advised in that last debate that we needed to continue to progress with caution and I maintain that view today as it relates to the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2021.  I would love to be able to stand here and confidently say that early 2022 will herald the end of this awful disease and spell the end for the powers required to contain it.  However, as we have learned over the course of this pandemic, Covid-19 can make a fool of our best-made plans.</p> <p>The powers as legislated for in the Health and Criminal Justice (COVID-19) (Amendment) Act 2021 may well be required past the proposed end date of 9 February 2022.  This is something we need to acknowledge openly in both Houses.  We cannot say with any sort of certainty that this will be the last time that we require this legislation as Covid-19 may simply demand these responses of us.  I know that this is not what the Irish people want to hear but we really do need to be clear and transparent with them.</p> <p>I again stress the importance of this, and any future emergency legislation, containing an end point.  This is something that myself and my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group brought attention to during the Second Stage debate on this legislation earlier this year.  The legislation as enacted is far reaching and has significant implications for our society.  Because of this, we must ensure that it undergoes the correct democratic oversight and scrutiny as opposed to being continually extended by simple motion and resolution.  The fact that the legislation, when first introduced, did not provide for this was highly unsatisfactory.  I am thankful that the Minister was very receptive to making amendments to take account of this and that he ultimately inserted a sunset clause into the legislation to state that it can only be extended once by resolution, for a period of three months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I and my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group would have liked this amendment to go further, I am glad that this is the last occasion on which we will need to pass legislation of this nature by simple resolution.  It may be the case that we will require similar legislation past 9 February 2022 but we must ensure that it first undergoes the necessary scrutiny in both Houses.  My colleague, Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, previously called for a review of the emergency legislation passed during the course of the pandemic.  It is very important in light of the extension by resolution of this legislation and the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 a review of this nature is reconsidered to ensure that the legislation and the powers it provides for are both compliant with human rights law.  Additionally we must ensure that the enforcement of the powers, as set out in the legislation, occurs fairly across Irish society.  My colleague, Senator Ruane, spoke about this in the context of the Joint Committee on Justice highlighting the extent to which certain communities were subject to greater scrutiny than others.  I implore those responsible for these emergency powers to be especially mindful of this moving forward.</p><p>Lastly, I wish to speak of the importance of the Government's support for the TRIPS waiver.  This is something my colleague, Senator Higgins, has continually drawn attention to in this House.  While we can rightly be proud of the success of the Covid-19 vaccination programme in the country, it will be a futile effort if we do not support the speedy delivery of Covid-19 vaccines globally.  Without that new variants of concern will continue to arise, threatening the progress we have made on this island in recent months, and endangering the lives and livelihoods of people around the world.</p></speech>

I listened to the debate in my office before I in came to speak.  I am reminded of the old phrase that you govern in prose and campaign in poetry.  It is easy for some Members to come in and make sincere speeches.  It is fair to say none of us wants to be here today to support the continuation of the legislation.  Senator Black made the most pertinent point of the afternoon when she said we may well be here again in February.  We may well be, but our debate needs to be put in context.  We have seen a change in the information from NPHET and NIAC and a slowness in transmitting that information to us.  I am happy to support this legislation because it is the right thing to do.  I respect the rights of all people whose viewpoint differs from mine.</p><p>I am struck by the figures and the 14-day incident rate.  The debate we have seen in our country about vaccination in other parts of the world, and the lack of vaccination in parts of the world, leads me to ask a basic question: where would we be today if we did not have the vaccination programme?  In asking that, individually and collectively we all have a responsibility in terms of measures we can take.  That includes the hospitality sector, us, individually, the sporting organisations and those who are involved in running public transport and in our education settings and so on.</p><p><i>The Lancet</i>study published last week shows that the low risk of infection by those who are vaccinated means that vaccinations work.  I am concerned about the situation in our schools.  I spoke about it during today's Order of Business.  I know what we have said and what NPHET has said, but for some reason that I cannot comprehend, we have stopped contact tracing in our schools.  I genuinely believe, as somebody who taught in a school and is familiar with the workings of the contact tracing in our education system prior to the mid-term break, that we should reverse that decision and go back to contact tracing in schools.  It is about security.  I heard Colm Henry this morning speaking about how the school setting is not the place that the virus spreads in, and that it is more the home setting.  He may well be right but schools are still a reservoir of infection.  We have seen it with the substitution issue where teachers and pupils are absent.  That is causing concern to all involved in education.</p><p>Senator Keogan mentioned bed capacity.  We have increased bed capacity in our ICUs and in our hospitals but we need to see a fundamental reappraisal of bed capacity in the future, in Sl&aacute;intecare.  I had a Commencement matter for tomorrow, which was not selected, on the elective hospital for Cork but I will resubmit it for next week.  As part of our living with Covid-19 and emerging from Covid-19, we need a debate on usage of our public hospitals.  We are back to pre-pandemic levels in emergency departments.  In fact, in some cases we are gone beyond it, which is a source of concern also.</p><p>The measures, for which the Minister has asked permission to continue, are ones we should support.  I understand there are differences of opinion on that, and I accept them.  We do not want to see civil liberties taken away.  We do not want to go back to another lockdown nor to the 5 km limit again.  We must put public health at the heart of what we do.</p><p>Reluctantly, I support the motion but I hope we will have a firm debate again around the issue of our health provision.</p></speech>

I will start by saying that I tuned in to "Prime Time" last night and heard the Minister give an extensive and comprehensive interview.  He touched on many of the issues Members are asking about today.  I want to acknowledge public broadcasting and the media and the role they too have to play in this.  It occurred to me while listening to the Minister last night that I had entered two places of hospitality in which I was not asked for a certificate or ID and I turned around and left.  The Minister said last night in his interview with Miriam O'Callaghan that it is up to us as citizens to challenge places and say that they are putting people's health at risk.  The places to which I refer were jam-packed.  If we are going to have legislation, we have to have some enforcement but we also have to take measures ourselves.</p> <p>As the Minister pointed out, Covid-19 incidence is rising rapidly and we have to be concerned.  There is no community and no family that is not touched and impacted by this terrible pandemic.  We have to do something about it.  I recall when the Minister, Deputy Coveney, came to the House a long time ago and talked about this thing called Covid-19, and we in the previous Seanad were shocked.  We thought this was only going to be thing for weeks.  All of us have been affected as have all our communities, our families, our loved-ones and our businesses, but we have to tackle this disease.  I am going to support the Minister and I am not going to apologise about supporting him.  It is the right thing to do.</p> <p>The Government has sought professional advice.  Someone has to share that advice.  There would be more shortcomings, and more criticism, if the Minister came into the House and said he had conflicts himself.  The Minister has set out the advice he has been given.  In the most recent advice to him, he stated that the National Public Health Emergency Team advised that the epidemiological situation in Ireland indicates a worsening disease profile with a very uncertain future trajectory.  Those are the facts.</p> <p>One of the thing we have had to learn is to take advice, and to seek advice.  We have also to listen to it but, more importantly, act on it.  This is the right thing to do.  As the Minister clearly said, this is a measure until February 2022.  There may be more legislation.  We can never predict.  However, this motion proposes to extend this to February 2022 and I support that.</p></speech>

I wish to underline the independent nature of the members of the Independent group to say that there is no unanimity among them, as is obvious already.</p> <p>I fully accept that we are in an emergency and that emergency measures have to be taken.  I am one of these people who rejects completely the suggestion of a two-tier society.  In my view, the responsible thing to do is to become vaccinated.  Maybe there are some people who, for some reason, fear a vaccination or have some hesitation about vaccination but that is their problem, so to speak.  For the great majority of people, to keep one's workmates, family members, elderly relatives and those whom one deals with in day-to-day life safe, the responsible thing to do is to be vaccinated.  I have no problem with saying that for some things - like going into a crowded nightclub, pub or restaurant where ventilation, however it is going to be done, in winter months is going to be limited - there is nothing wrong with requiring people to prove that they have been vaccinated.  It is their choice to stay at home, if they so want.  If they want to go into a restaurant, which is higher risk, then in my view they just have to take the consequence of their own decision not to be vaccinated.</p> <p>It is just as well that Senator Gavan spoke before me because he might have been embarrassed to have to say that he would agree with everything that I am about to say.  It is a little bit the other way around.  I agree with him completely about one fundamental issue, and this is the reason that I am going to vote against the Minister's resolutions.  Simply, what is being done in these Houses is wrong.  We had a temporary Covid committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy McNamara.  It was in a position week on week, if people turned up to it and were willing to turn up to it, to give constant scrutiny to examine the trends over a week, and to examine the reasonableness of one measure rather than another.  The permanent Government of Ireland, and I have presided over a Department that is part of the permanent Government of Ireland, found it inconvenient that there should be such a forum of parliamentarians to which it would be responsible.  I accept the need for emergency legislation but in an emergency, what about Leinster House?  Can we not adapt our arrangements to establish a committee, which the Minister must come into it every week-----</p></speech>

The Garda checkpoints are either justified or unjustified.  The 5 km rule is either paying off or it is not.  Vaccinations are having this effect or that effect.  Schools are or are not a vector for infection.  It is or is not safe to reopen this, that or the other in terms of universities or the like.</p> <p>There should be a forum where the same group of Members of the Oireachtas hear the same issues dealt with week on week, and can monitor them.  There is absolutely no excuse why such a forum, if we are in an emergency, was not maintained in existence and amplified, and that the permanent Government became fully available to the members of that committee to explain in detail exactly which vaccine, for instance, was more effective than the last.  I am an AstraZeneca double-dose man myself but I do not know whether my dosage is right or wrong.  I do not know now that I am coming up to six months since my last dosage whether I need a booster.  The Minister has said that I am going to get one if I want one.  That is great and I am going to take it but I believe that all of these facts should be tested.  We should know whether one vaccine is more or less more effective than another.  Are we continuing to buy them or are we sending them to the Third World because they are ineffective or whatever?</p> <p>I do not say the following on a personal or political level.  There is no excuse for the Minister coming in and saying that we may have legislation and regulations.  There may be, as Senator Ward has said, a need for another Bill.  That will be tightly Whipped.  The one advantage of the committees is that the Whip does not work on them.  One must answer the question there and then.  One cannot just avoid it and say here is the regulation so vote it down if you like, if one can get five, ten or 20 Deputies or Senators to vote it down.  There is no excuse whatsoever, in my view, for not having a permanent committee of the Oireachtas supervising this emergency, none whatsoever except institutional self-protection.</p> <p>Lastly, I agree with Senator Gavan about intellectual property rights.  All of the pharmaceutical companies were given huge sums of money by governments across the developed world to develop vaccines.  For a situation to exist in which those companies, which have these intellectual property rights, now control which people in the Third World, who cannot afford any of these vaccines themselves, should or should not have vaccinations and, in effect, on a global basis, which countries should have higher rates of death than others is wholly unconscionable and I do support what Senator Gavan said about that.  </p></speech>

I do not think that there is any Member of either House that they do sit properly with.  It is not just right and proper but essential that we have serious debate even on something that is a relatively modest proposal in terms of a 13-week extension followed by a need for legislation.  These are serious powers and they must be interrogated seriously.</p> <p>I had my closing remarks but I am not going to make them.  What I am going to do is try to address the various points that were raised by colleagues, some of which pertained to this matter and some of which pertained to the wider Covid situation.  So, with the indulgence of the Acting Chairperson, I will try to address the various issues in the order in which I think they were raised.</p> <p>In terms of contact tracing in schools, we all want to do what is best for the children ultimately.  That is the primary motivation of all of the policy recommendations in terms of schools.  There was contact tracing, as colleagues will be aware, for schools.  It came at a very serious cost to the children because children missed two weeks of schools.  Indeed, after returning a child could miss another two weeks of schools if he or she was deemed to be a close contact.</p> <p>Public health worked with the Department of Health in the round to say what are the risks in terms of Covid versus the known damage of these children being taken out of schools for weeks at a time.  We are all very aware of the damage that was done last year, which was unavoidable, with children not being in school.</p> <p>This morning, Dr. Henry gave an excellent interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; when he went through some of the facts and figures.  We found that the positivity rate on contact tracing in schools was a really small fraction of the positivity rate for the same cohort of children in the household.  In  other words, the data that public health has, and on which it bases its advice to me, is that the schools are low-risk environments.  Great credit goes to the teachers, principals, parents and the students themselves because the infection prevention and control measures in the schools are working, and continue to work.</p> <p>When public health and the Department of Health looked at this in the round they concluded that given the low-risk nature of schools, given that the infections in the main are happening for school children in households - so it is not on sportsfields and not in classrooms but in households - the thing to do was to continue protocols for household close contacts, which are happening and there are a whole set of protocols for that, but not to have them in the schools because we wanted to keep the students at school.  However, I, the Minister for Education and the Chief Medical Officer are reviewing the potential for rapid testing.  I know rapid testing is something that some of the education partners, for example, are considering.  I have outlined why the decision was made in terms of contact tracing in schools but obviously we can keep that under review. </p> <p>In terms of a booster vaccine for vulnerable groups, that is something that is being kept under review.  NIAC is looking across a whole gamut of different individuals.  Some of the vulnerable groups will have been picked up.  People who are immuno-compromised are already receiving boosters.  For that group, the booster has been deemed a third dose.  Anyone who is 60 years and over in those cohorts will be covered by a booster vaccination.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->NIAC is currently looking at those with underlying conditions.  We are forensically going through the most vulnerable populations, as we did at the start of the year, and going to them.  I will raise the progress on the vulnerable groups with the Chief Medical Officer and Professor Butler.<br/><br/>With regard to fake Covid certificates and the question about enforcement data, I will ask the Department to provide all Members of the Seanad with the latest information on enforcement data.  It is all available online.  The enforcement data is published on <i>garda.ie</i>.  I believe the latest data there is up to about mid-October, but I will ask the Department for a full report on that for the Seanad.  As regards fake Covid certificates, it is a serious offence under the legislation to do this.  There is a tiered set of penalties for first, second and third offences.  The first offence starts with a fine of up to &euro;4,000 and-or one month in prison.  It is important that people who are thinking about falsifying Covid certificates understand that there is the potential to end up in jail for up to a month for doing that.  It is a really serious offence.  Essentially, what they are doing is choosing to put other people's safety at risk by falsifying documentation and bypassing important Covid safety protocols.  Everyone who is going into a pub or a restaurant is doing so with a clear understanding that everyone else in the venue is fully vaccinated.  It is a very important additional protection.  That brings us to compliance, which I will address later.  There must be rigorous compliance in terms of both checking the certificates and cross-checking identity.  An absolutely zero tolerance approach must be taken to false certificates and that is reflected in the legislation.<br/><br/>Covid passes for those who cannot be vaccinated is something we have discussed previously.  It is a difficult balance.  In many cases the reason people cannot be vaccinated is that there are underlying conditions that put them at higher risk.  When I have discussed this with officials and public health doctors previously they have pointed out that it is not fair to say to people who cannot get vaccinated, the vast majority of whom would choose to be vaccinated, that they cannot avail of pubs and restaurants indoors.  The counter to that is that while it may not be fair, if they have an underlying condition that puts them at higher risk of Covid-19, there is a real risk to them in some of these situations.  There is no clean or easy answer to this.  It is a deeply unfair situation.  It is a small number of people, but it is an unenviable position.  The current position is based solely on their health and safety and minimising the risk of exposing them to Covid.<br/><br/>Regarding the position outlined by Senator Gavan on behalf of his party, we discussed this last night.  I have made a point of not getting into political charges when it comes to Covid, because it has to remain above politics.  Last night, when I heard the position put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in while I was in the D&aacute;il, I made the decision to call that out.  The reason is that I feel very strongly about the position that is being taken.  We are in a situation where we have had in excess of 3,000 cases for two days in a row.  It is very serious.  It is essential that we can continue to regulate through the winter months.  I find it hard to understand how a party that takes itself seriously - not an Independent Member, and I was formerly an Independent Deputy, or an individual - and talks about itself being in government would actually vote against us being able to regulate on Covid through the winter.  I feel very strongly about that and that is why I called it out last night.<br/><br/>One of the arguments put forward by that party last night, not here, was that it was not appropriate for these to be regulations and that it all should be legislation that the Oireachtas can adapt.  After last night's debate I asked the Department for a note on how many Covid regulations I have signed just in my time in office.  The answer was 133, not including mandatory hotel quarantine.  The officials are looking at how many were in mandatory hotel quarantine.  If we just take the 133, I do not believe any of us would seriously suggest that there should have been 133 separate legislative processes.  It just would not be feasible.  It would swamp the Department of Health, the political system and the Oireachtas.  As Senators will be aware, the Oireachtas legislates and governments regulate through statutory instruments.  I fully accept that these are not normal statutory instruments.  They are extraordinary statutory instruments given the powers contained in them.  Normally one could make a very reasonable argument, and Senator McDowell did the last time we had this debate, that they are of such import that they would be comparable to what would be contained in legislation, with all the important checks and balances that the legislative process brings.  The counter to that is that we simply could not legislate 133 times and whatever number we had to do for mandatory hotel quarantine.  It is not a comfortable position for any of us.  The Houses can annul the regulations when they are put forward.<br/><br/>In terms of parliamentary oversight and, indeed, it was raised at the end of the debate with regard to the Oireachtas Covid committee, that is a matter for the Oireachtas, not the Government.  I have no issue with an Oireachtas Covid committee.  In fact, I was a member of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response before I was appointed to office.  I have regularly come to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad for questions and answers.  The Department of Health received 63% of all parliamentary questions for the summer term, just to give a sense of how much the Department and the HSE are trying to answer questions.  I am very open to more Oireachtas oversight in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and committees can do things that neither House can do easily.  However, it is a matter for the Oireachtas, not the Government, as to whether it wishes to instigate a standing Covid committee.<br/><br/>The final point I wish to make in response to the objections from Sinn F&eacute;in is about the depiction of the process.  Some of the language used today was quite mild; some of the language used in the D&aacute;il was not.  There was reference to chaos, no plan B and all sorts of things in respect of the process of getting to regulation in the hospitality sector.  The recent regulations were cited.  We have had this narrative many times.  The process is as follows - NPHET advises, the Government meets and the Government decides.  However, Government decisions do not include regulations.  It is broader and at a higher level than that.  The next step is regulation.  Quite properly, in terms of hospitality and many other regulations, the line Departments immediately engaged with the sectors.  Then an agreement was reached, my Department created the regulations and I signed them.  That process is somehow depicted as chaotic because the Government, in reaching its decision, does not walk out of Cabinet and say: &quot;Not only have we a decision, but we also have all the fully formed regulations in place&quot;.  It simply cannot be done like that.  It does not work like that.  One has to engage with the sector.  The argument we seem to be hearing, and I presume there would be no objection to engaging with the sector, is that on top of that we should have a full legislative process as well and that this would somehow result in a clearer or faster process.  This constant undermining of the development of the regulations is not helpful.  There is a process and there has to be an understanding that it is right and proper that there would be engagement with the people affected, that there is a process in that regard and that then we reach some form of agreement.<br/><br/>These measures are important.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted against the Covid pass.  Not only did it vote against it, there was a very heated debate.  It was at the end of the last D&aacute;il session in the convention centre.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some very serious accusations were thrown about and some of the contributions were very heated indeed.  That is fine.  They voted against the Covid-19 pass, however, and that is what allowed us to open the sector.  We were accused of all sorts of discrimination and apartheid and all sorts of things, but the pass is what allowed us to open the sector. </p><p>Turning to the winter plan, and concerning the questions from Senator Hoey, much work has been done and many of the measures are already in place.  Last year, we had a comprehensive winter plan that involved spending of &euro;600 million.  The majority of those measures are still in place, including beds, patient pathways, diagnostics and many other aspects.  We are working through additional measures now.</p><p>Regarding global vaccine justice, I agree with the TRIPS Agreement waiver.  I said that before and I reiterate it now.  I do not think it will solve the problem, but even if it were to prove nothing more than symbolic, then it would be the right thing to do.  Analysis has been done at the level of the European Commission concerning the full pathway required in this regard.  These are extremely advanced manufacturing processes and similarly advanced global supply chains are also required, while the transportation and storage of the vaccines after manufacture is equally complex.  Therefore, a TRIPS Agreement waiver on its own would not solve the problem.  A whole supply chain has to be put in place, and much of it is now being put in place.</p><p>What can Ireland do?  One of the things that we can do, and which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and I regularly push, is to ensure that Ireland has a strong voice on this issue at the EU table.  To its credit, the EU, by a large distance, has exported more vaccines than any other region in the world.  As Members will be aware, Ireland has signed up to and has donated in-country vaccines to Uganda.  We have also signed up to donate 1 million vaccine doses to COVAX.  Those vaccines will not arrive in the country, but will instead go straight from the manufacturers to COVAX.  We have much further to go in this regard and I will be bringing such recommendations to the Cabinet.  We have the extraordinary luxury in this country of talking about booster vaccines for healthcare workers, when in some countries less than 2% of healthcare workers have had a first vaccination.  It is something that we must be cognisant of when we talk about providing booster vaccines for more people here. </p><p>I will end by asking for the help of colleagues right across the House.  The situation now is serious.  We have a plan that is a national response.  It includes actions to be undertaken by the Government, industry and individuals.  We are doing a great deal in Government.  We spoke about the booster vaccines.  We are also increasing testing, PCR and rapid testing, and bringing in additional supports for nursing homes, including serial testing.  We are signing up to efforts to encourage new drug therapies.  We are not there yet, but the signs are encouraging at an EU level.  We are also rolling out the flu vaccine and extending the regulations, which is part of what we are doing this evening, and pushing on ventilation, winter planning and more.  Therefore, we are doing a wide range of things as a State.  </p><p>The single most important thing that industry must do is to comply with the regulations and the public health advice.  I acknowledge that most outlets in the hospitality, retail and other sectors, are doing a fantastic job.  The evidence we have from surveys and compliance data, however, is that far too many premises are not checking Covid-19 passes or, if they are, they are not cross-checking the I.D.  There has been a slippage, an understandable one, in aspects such as the use of hand sanitisers and an increase in overcrowding - not everywhere at all, but in some places.  What we need therefore is for industry to go that bit further again.  I refer to those businesses that are not adhering to the regulations and the public health advice.  As I said, many businesses are complying with the measures.  </p><p>Turning to what individuals can do, this is where much of the public health advice is targeted.  The single most effective thing that could happen would be for the 7% of people who have not been vaccinated to get vaccinated.  Were that to happen, then our numbers of Covid-19 patients in ICUs would be less than half what they are now.  Our Covid-19 hospital patient numbers would also be at about half what they are now.  Such a development would take an immense strain off our healthcare system and off our healthcare workers and it would mean that more men, women and children could have elective surgeries.  It would be incredibly effective if that were to happen, and we are seeing encouraging initial signs in this regard.  As I said, 24,000 people have signed up to be vaccinated for the first time in the last fortnight.</p><p>In addition, for a while we must reduce our discretionary social contacts.  The public health advice that I have is that the R number is now above 1 and a relatively small reduction in our social contacts would help to bring that number down to 1 or, ideally, below it.  Without everything that is going on, the thinking is that the current Delta variant would have an R number of around 6 to 8, which would mean that the virus would spread extraordinarily rapidly.  The R number is still relatively low, but exponential growth makes the situation difficult.  Therefore, a reduction, even for a short while, in the number of discretionary social contacts is one of the big messages and major requests that our public health experts are asking for.  I refer to sticking with the basics that we all know, such as the use of masks, maintaining hand hygiene, etc.  Critically, people who are symptomatic should stay out of work or school, or whatever it may be, isolate and get tested.  That is very important.</p><p>That is where we are at now.  This motion is an important part of addressing this situation in respect of being able to regulate for the next 13 weeks through these winter months.  If all of us, individuals, industry and the apparatus of the State, can push again, as we have had to do every time we have seen a surge, then we will be able to push the incidence of the virus back down and we will be able to protect the hard-won gains of our society and economy being open.</p></speech>

This is a very important and opportune time for us as a House to reaffirm our commitment to the national development plan, to ensure the programme for Government commitments in the context of the national development plan are met, and that we adhere to and follow our obligations and duties for the reduction of carbon emissions.</p><p>This was a very important week for the world and for us as a nation.  We meet and gather here tonight with this debate at an inflection point for the world.  We are told that the world is burning.  The commitment by the Government will be seen in the publication of the climate action plan tomorrow.  At the same time, those of us who are members on the transport committee will recognise that there is now a huge investment by the Government in our public transport.  The objective of this motion is to reaffirm and support the view and the role of the Government to invest in public transport and to deliver the national development plan projects, recognising that we must make a modal shift in how we use transport as a country, collectively and individually.</p><p>This debate is in the context of us living on an island with 5,300 km of national roads network.  We must get the balance right between connectivity and this is why the &euro;5.1 billion for new national roads is to be welcomed.  In my own geographical area of Cork the M20 and the M28 are very important projects, along with integrated public transport networks of BusConnects and the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy with investment by Government in public transport.</p><p>Just this week Bus &Eacute;ireann launched the BusConnects for rural Ireland programme after a period of consultation.  It is an exciting and new significant departure by the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Government and Bus &Eacute;ireann. I am excited because the plan is about increased capital investment in public transport.  It is part of the commitment, as the motion indicates, to an all-island strategic review of rail, in the context of the demand for sustainable public transport.  We must all live up to seeing this plan implemented.  Whether they are walking or cycling, or using light rail, public transport or the bus, the public wants to have sustainable transport models never seen before in this country, along with reducing our carbon emissions, which is not just an obligation: it is a must that we have to meet.  I welcome that the NTA has commenced a number of sustainable projects in the State that will help to transform our transport infrastructure.  It will give a new positive enhanced connectivity, with options and choices for people across the country, which is important.</p><p>BusConnects is not just about rural Ireland.  It is about urban Ireland and the five major cities also.  It is about the expectations that people have.  It is about commitment and the new system of ticketing, enhanced connectivity and increased frequency.  It is about investment in the mundaneness of the bus stop such as real-time information, passenger information and the shelter provided to people in rural and urban areas.  It is about ensuring also that we have wheelchair accessible public transport and bus stops.  If we want to reduce our emissions and meet our targets, then investment in electric buses and in changing the rail system must be done, and not just with words and grandiose plans.  It will require all of us to ensure there is adherence to and scrutiny of this.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, as are Senators Craughwell and Boylan.  We have had a lot of engagement with the NTA and TII.  As a result, Oireachtas Members have a greater understanding of the need for Ireland's semi-State companies to deliver and to be held to account in terms of timelines, aspiration and delivery.  The year 2030 is only nine years away.  The national development plan has commitments to upgrade.  In the case of my own city of Cork this includes the introduction of light rail and increased bus frequency for buses.  We must ensure these commitments will be met.  People will not forget if we do not do that.</p><p>We must fully utilise the envelope of funding for the national development plan and the urban regeneration development fund to unlock the potential in many of our towns and cities, but in particular in the city of Cork where I come from where we are moving people in the city down towards the docks to make sure we have a new livable and sustainable city.  This is an exciting project that has huge potential for the city of Cork.  Given that it is in the national development plan, that pocket of growth will need to see Government support matched.  We must pursue the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy, and the proposal for the east-west transport corridor for light rail.  At the transport committee today I spoke with the TII and the NTA about road, rail and bus projects for Cork.</p><p>Senator Boyhan's grouping of amendments includes a very interesting amendment to our motion before the House where he supports the need for a dedicated transport policing unit on public transport.  All Members are concerned about the spiralling of antisocial behaviour in parts of the country.  It has become very clear now, from media reports and from our own experiences, that there has been an increase in antisocial behaviour on certain transport modes, be it the DART in Dublin or buses in Cork or in other places.  There is merit in considering a transport policing unit to be put in place.  I have said previously that there is a real need for an increased Garda presence and Garda visibility in the context of public transport in places where people gather and use public transport.  Certainly, on our intercity trains there is a real need to increase the presence of garda&iacute;.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The decision taken by the National Bus and Rail Union last Friday to ballot its members is one that we should take cognisance of.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#WW00200"><p>I second the motion.</p> <p>I thank Senator Buttimer for sharing time and I welcome my colleague, the Minister of State.  I thank my colleagues in Fine Gael for their input and support in respect of this most important motion.  I also acknowledge the programme for Government commitments and my colleagues within the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il.  I mentioned the Green Party first.  I meant no disrespect to Fianna F&aacute;il, but I think it is fair to say that the Green Party has a huge interest in the area of public transport, as do we all.</p> <p>The mass movement of people for work, leisure, education and health is a positive.  A strong public transport system, which often we see more so on the Continent or when we are on holidays, particularly in cities, is something to which we aspire.  There is slow progress in certain areas, for example, with the DART in Dublin.  I must say that I do not think the DART would get planning permission today, but it is there and it is working.  The Luas is a success, from what I can see.  BusConnects is possibly more problematic, based on feedback that I have received in respect of issues relating to the displacement of traffic.  As BusConnects is rolled out to Galway and other cities, perhaps this is something that will become evident in those communities.  Cycle lanes and infrastructure can also be problematic in certain areas in terms of opposition.  That is part of the process of consultation, engagement and bringing people with you in relation to what is planned and why.  The national development plan provides the opportunity to improve the infrastructure and delivery of public transport.  Climate change - and COP26 and everything else in that regard - is the reason behind this.  That is important.</p> <p>I will speak first in relation to buses.  Questions have been asked as to what it would take for people to increase their use of buses.  Reliability, affordability, frequency and comfort are the areas I would highlight in that regard.  On affordability, I welcome the initiative to introduce half-price fares for those aged 19 to 23.  That is a positive in terms of affordability.  As we go into the future and in the context of the use of carbon taxes, however, it is an area that we could focus on when it comes to reducing the costs of public transport.  It would be a huge incentive to those on low incomes and to students.</p> <p>I welcome the NTA's Connecting Ireland plan, which has gone to consultation, and the proposals that it contains.  The consultation period will run until mid-December, as I understand it.  This represents progress, and more is needed.  I presume this will be incremental, subject to continued funding for the NTA to deliver more.  It does, however, signal an intention on the part of the Government because, as matters stand, the alternatives to private cars in rural areas are limited.  It also means that some families that have two cars may decide, based on the adequacy of transport links, that they could do with one and reduce costs as a result.  This would be better for the environment.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer touched on the issue of bus shelters.   These are extremely important because we do get a drop of rain in this country.  We get blustery conditions and it is not fair to see people having to stand in the rain, whether it is in urban or rural areas.  Continued investment in infrastructure is important.  The provision of bus shelters, bus pull-in areas and real-time information is also extremely important.  I will not say that providing such facilities is simple because in certain circumstances, particularly in urban areas, land may not be available.  I know of cases where, despite the best efforts of those involved, land was not made available to provide bus shelters.  There are conditions laid down regarding the width of bus shelters and measures to allow for buggies and wheelchairs to be able to use the footpath as well.  This is an issue, but it is also hugely important.</p> <p>Greenways are mainly looked at in terms of tourism and local recreation, but there is potential, certainly in and around urban areas, to use them for the purposes of commuting.  In my area, there is huge potential for the greenway around Oughterard, Rosscahill, Moycullen, Bushypark, Galway city and the NUIG, to become a commuting greenway.  The project has gone back to route selection stage and AECOM consultants are engaged in that.  They will initiate public consultation in the January.  Again, it is a slow-burner.  It was announced and funded initially in 2014.  Some progress and valiant attempts were made by Galway County Council to deliver it, but land was not available.  We need to speed up the process of that consultation, engagement with landowners, lodging a planning application and going through the process.  I welcome the decisions made in respect of the south Kerry greenway.  The latter was very important as a test case for all local authorities across the country in terms of the provision of greenways and ensuring that they are treated in the same as roads in the context of being classed as infrastructure - and much needed infrastructure - and that authorities can access lands to carry out the environmental and planning reports necessary to lodge applications.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, application - approved earlier this year - in respect of the reinstatement of an iconic bridge over the River Corrib using the old railway abutments that are already there.  Project delays are evident in many places, which is regrettable.</p> <p>We must make the best use of the public transport corridors available to us.  This motion mentions the delivery of phase 2 of the western rail corridor.  The project would link all of County Mayo, including the towns of Castlebar, Ballina, Wesport and Claremorris, to the regional capital, Galway, through Tuam, Galway's largest town.  It would provide a public transport option into the centre of Galway city to the thousands of people who make journeys from south Mayo or north Galway, all of whom have to suffer the traffic problems around Galway city on a daily basis.</p> <p>Phase 1 of the western railway corridor from Galway to Limerick carried 500,000 passengers pre Covid-19.  The latter was the fastest-growing route on the rail network before the pandemic.  It is a classic example of how the provision of a service leads people to use it.  Athenry, at the junction of the Dublin and Limerick lines, has passenger numbers at the same level as Kilkenny and close to the those evident in Waterford.  If you provide the service, people will use it.  We would argue that case as well in respect of other projects, including services to Navan and elsewhere.</p> <p>I would like to acknowledge the URDF application for a passing 1 km railway loop and a new platform at Oranmore, and the potential for double-tracking and new stations, for example, at Merlin Park or Renmore.  In the medium term, double-tracking from Athenry, through Oranmore, into Galway would have huge potential for the eastern part of the city, which is the area most likely to grow and develop, pending delivery of the Galway city ring road.</p> <p>I also wish to touch on Senator Boyhan's amendment regarding the transport policing unit.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State is in a position to accept the amendment.  Certainly, it is worth considering.  It could be looked at by the Department of Justice, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and transport providers, to see if it is something that would have a positive impact on making public transport safer for vulnerable people, women and those travelling on their own.  I think it would hugely beneficial.  I am not sure whether the Minister of State is in a position to accept the amendment, but I think, wearing her hat as a former Minister of State at the Department of Justice, a commitment to look at something like that would make sense.</p> <p>There is a lot to this motion.  I have touched on some of the points and I know that my colleagues will touch on other areas, particularly in relation to MetroLink in Dublin.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

It is timely that she is here.  I thank Fine Gael for using Private Members' time to put forward a motion on transport.  It is really important.  I had actually tabled a Commencement matter in respect of this issue last week.  Suddenly, this motion came up and I saw it as an opportunity.  With Commencement matters, a Minister will come in and say something and it is finished whereas with a motion such as this, we will actually be required to make a decision today, hopefully.</p> <p>The Minister of State is from the west.  Many of the emails I have received in which concerns were expressed came from people from the west who travel up on the trains.  I will speak to the amendment in particular.  I have no difficulty with any of the contents of the motion, but the amendment seeks to insert into the body of the motion the phrase "collaborate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the NTA and public transport stakeholders to establish a dedicated Transport Policing Unit on the public transport network&rdquo;.  I have not specified in the amendment that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be responsible for such a unit, although I think that would be the best option.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Let me set out the context.  Mr. Dermot O&rsquo;Leary from the National Bus and Rail Union says what is happening is unmanageable and that the whole thing is chaotic.  Therefore, I am deeply concerned about the front-line staff and passengers who are being exposed to threats of sexual assault and aggression on buses and trains, including the DART and Luas.  The problem is occurring in both urban and rural areas all around the country.<br/><br/>We now know that drugs are being taken openly.  Dealing and fighting should not have to be encountered by any member of the public travelling on the national transport corridors, wherever they are.  We have heard reports on this subject from Irish Rail.  It has been covered on the radio by Claire Byrne.  RT&Eacute; has covered it extensively in the past two weeks.  The Minister of State, as with everybody here, will be aware of reports that Irish Rail toilets are being blocked up by people who are shooting up heroin and other drugs.  It is happening along our transport corridors and it is simply unacceptable.<br/><br/>The general secretary of the National Bus and Rail Union, Mr. Dermot O&rsquo;Leary, has said the staff have had enough and that it is now high time that something was done.  He has made a call on the Legislature.  I have given the union my commitment.  I have no doubt that its members are tuned in tonight and are interested in our discussion and its outcome.  I fully support the union&rsquo;s members and the travelling public.<br/><br/>It is high time that we had zero tolerance of antisocial behaviour on our transport network.  I am calling for dedicated and fully resourced public transport policing similar to that in the UK.  I have examined the latter.  It is very successful.  It is evident from Liverpool, Manchester and Wales to Edinburgh and London.  They have a very successful model.  It might not be the model that best suits us, but it is certainly one we should consider.  The travelling public need to be confident and assured that they can travel in safety.  We should remember it is Government policy to encourage people to use sustainable forms of transport.  All this simple amendment seeking to do is to be compatible with Government policy.  Therefore, I hope it will attract support.<br/><br/>The public will not, and should not, continue to have to put up with what they have had to endure.  They want a highly visible Garda or security presence on public support.  They want to travel in comfort and safety.  The reality, certainly after dark in the city of Dublin, is that many people are afraid to use public transport.  That they have been made to feel this way is simply unacceptable, and no one should support it.<br/><br/>What am I asking?  There is a need to take action.  We need to get the thugs off our buses and trains, including the DART and Luas.  We need to support the staff who work in these services and the travelling public who want to travel in safety.  That is simply what I want to achieve.<br/><br/>This does not come as a surprise.  I do not believe it comes as a surprise to the Minister of State, to be fair, nor do I believe it comes as a surprise to any Member of this House.  There is a time for action, however.  We can have some mechanism in this regard.  I am not prescribing that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the function I advocate.<br/><br/>I acknowledge the additional budget of &euro;2 million.  There was a Commencement matter in the name of Senator Maria Byrne this morning and the relevant Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, responded.  He stated: &quot;I am pleased that budget 2022 provided an unprecedented allocation of over &euro;2 billion in funding, reflecting the commitment of the Government to ensuring our communities are safe and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources for effective policing.&quot;  This is to increase trust in public services and allow the public to use them.  Also in his response, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, stated:</p><blockquote>	I welcome the budget 2022 allocation of &euro;2 million to the community safety innovation fund.  The intention is that the operation of the fund will be reviewed and that further allocations will be [made]. </blockquote><p>He talked about the importance of people feeling safe.<br/><br/>I appeal to all sides of the House to agree with this simple amendment.  I am not saying what I advocate can be achieved tomorrow, next week or next year, but let us work on it and plan for it.  Let us give the unions, which are crying out for support, the travelling public and everyone else an opportunity to feel safe and work safely on our public transport network.  I would appreciate support for this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#XX00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for being present.</p> <p>I have listened with interest to Senator Boyhan&rsquo;s contribution.  I am minded to support, in general terms, what he is advocating.  I, too, have had contact with numerous people who work in the sector and have read with considerable interest the reports of recent weeks.  The problem has been arising not only in recent weeks but also for a considerable period beforehand.  I have witnessed antisocial behaviour myself on occasion when using public transport, particularly later in the evening.</p> <p>Some of the behaviour in question has emerged during the pandemic, when there were probably fewer people in public areas.  From talking to people around the city, I have learned that some of our public areas have been taken over to some extent by those with a desire to cause trouble.  The taking of drugs in a public area is regrettable and reprehensible, and it makes it very difficult to encourage people to use public transport.</p> <p>I have two young daughters.  I would be concerned about them in a city at night, and I am sure many other parents would be concerned about their daughters.  Despite this, I am trying to inculcate in them a desire to use public transport to a greater extent.  Perhaps it is the other way around because our younger population is very much focused on doing what is right for the climate and environment yet, if the situation is not addressed quickly, we will have considerable difficulty in getting our younger cohort, or perhaps those of any age group, to use public transport after dark.</p> <p>This issue arose previously in the United States.  I remember seeing the approach taken by former New York police chief, Bill Bratton, together with his deputy at the time, John Timoney, who was of Irish extraction.  During their governorship, they took a zero-tolerance approach to crime generally.  Former Minister for Justice, Senator McDowell, will know full well about that policy.  The police chief and his deputy started applying their zero-tolerance policy to crime in the train stations and on public transport, through a dedicated unit.  It was felt that those who were infringing the law by not paying their fares were worth focusing on.  There is something in that.</p> <p>Perhaps the Minister of State will not be able to accept the amendment but I hope she can.  The truth is that it sets out a desire to work with those concerned rather than dictate what the result should be.  Of course issues will arise in respect of the Garda wanting to work with the various transport companies, but the problem should not be insurmountable.  The amendment recognises that we need to do something to resolve the problem.  It is not overly prescriptive.  Hopefully we can move on it.</p> <p>In general terms, the discussion on public transport is timely and important.  It is important because of a desire to have a modal shift from the unnecessary use, or overuse, of individual vehicles.  That is somewhat easier in urban or more built-up areas, where additional buses, trams or trains can be made available.  It is more challenging in rural areas because the population density generally does not support additional public transport services.  Addressing this requires an examination of planning laws and ensuring higher density in villages and towns such that they meet the needs of a changing population.</p> <p>Covid has provided some opportunities.  There is now a considerable number of people thinking about working from home, working in villages and towns around the country and getting out of the cities.  That could have a genuinely positive benefit for all.  It could help to reduce some of the competitive tensions in the larger cities in respect of purchasing housing.  It could help to reduce, to some extent, the congestion in cities.  If people who have been used to living in cities are to return to the villages and rural towns from which they came, they will need to see an investment in public transport and other facilities and services, including public lighting and footpaths, which would allow them to walk between their homes and the centres of their villages.  A programme of work has to be implemented.  Various development plans are focusing on that.</p> <p>There is a significant investment proposed for our rail network, which is good.  We must also consider pricing.  If people can be convinced to have just one car within their household, they will save a lot more money.  To achieve that, we will have to convince them.  We also need to consider the fares on public transport.  Fares for journeys between Limerick and Dublin, and Cork and Dublin, are expensive.  The Minister of State needs to examine that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am of the view that we should look to eliminate all fares on public transport for a period of five years in order to help to get that modal shift.  That would be a good investment in the future.  I would not be suggesting that we do it forever but, like any investment in infrastructure or in assisting people to get to their destination, it would be money well spent.  This matter also needs to be looked at.</p><p>There is a crazy situation with school transport.  I always look at young people.  If you can get a certain cohort of people at an early stage in life to follow a particular behaviour, you will have them for life.  The reality is that we are pushing people off buses if they live 0.1 of a mile outside the set limits and charging them money unnecessarily.  We should have a free public transport system for taking people to school, with some restrictions as to where a person lives and not crossing over to assist someone to get to a school in circumstances where he or she lives outside the catchment areas of that school.  If you capture young people at an early age and can get them into the habit of being on a bus, you will then have them for life.  I will conclude on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#YY00200"><p>It is great to see Fine Gael bringing this motion forward.  I was involved in the programme for Government negotiations and I know that the Green Party fought hard for a major investment in public transport.  For the first time in history, more money is going to be spent on public transport than ever before.  I will claim that partly for the Green Party.  We have been raising the issue of rural transport for many years, so it is great to see Fine Gael coming to the table with this motion.</p> <p>Public transport means so much more than just getting a bus to town.  For me, when I consider where I live in rural Ireland, it means that young people will be able to move around independently of their parents and that people with disabilities or who cannot afford cars will have some ability to get to places they want to go.</p> <p>The Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan is important.  We have to be very careful to listen to users because I know that so far the NTA has engaged with most of the local authorities.  I am aware that most of the people it has engaged with in the local authorities drive everywhere.  They are not going to be the people who will have the brilliant knowledge we need.  We need to talk to people who do not drive everywhere.  I hate slating engineers because some of them are brilliant.  In the context of our road engineers, however, as they say, if you design for cars, you get cars and if you design for people, you get people.  There is a significant missing piece in this regard.  I speak passionately about this matter because I worked on modal shift and getting people out of cars for 15 years full-time all over Clare, Limerick and Galway.</p> <p>The missing piece has always been that the local authorities do not have the money or the staff.  Every local authority has now been given the funding and the staff and we need to use that in a way that works.  In the context of the public transport we have at present, the websites are really annoying.  I refer to the websites of Irish Rail and Bus &Eacute;ireann in this regard.  I have been advocating for the use of public transport for years but doing so it not easy because public transport providers' websites are appalling.  We have a Green Party Minister for Transport, which is brilliant, and he is throwing a great deal of money at this, but we have to ensure that the NTA and TII are involved.  For some reason, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is involved.  The RSA is not a Government agency.  It is always talking about speed limits and is obsessed with car use and covering everybody else on the road with high-visibility gear from head to toe, as if that is going to solve the problems that exist.  I have a number of significant issues with some agencies now being given a great deal of money.  If these agencies do not listen to the people who need to use public transport, we are going to fail and waste money.  The motion is good and is quite comprehensive but, ultimately, we do not want to waste money.  In that context, the public transport system has to work for the people who need it most.</p> <p>When I come to Dublin, I can use a Leap card on the Luas and on the bus.  I can even use it along with my Dublinbikes card.  In Clare, I cannot do that at all.  Why can we not use such cards on Local Link services?  What are we waiting for in that regard?  I costed it at approximately &euro;100 plus VAT to put in place a card reader on each Local Link bus.  Let us treat everybody equally, regardless of whether they live one in the middle of nowhere or in Dublin.  I would like to see many of the services that I can avail of in Dublin available in rural areas, and these need to be linked up.</p> <p>I mentioned to the NTA the other day about having bike storage facilities on buses.  I was pretty much told that that would not be fair to people with disabilities because we need low buses in order for people with disabilities to get on to them.  It was almost as if the NTA was pitting one against the other.  I could not come back to say that there are well-designed buses all over the world on which it is possible to accommodate bikes and people with disabilities.  This is not directed at the Minister of State, but we do need to look at people whose views on car use are set in stone around and who believe that this represents the best way forward.  I genuinely believe that public transport has a significant part to play in how we change how we move around.  It is worth the money because it is more sociable and better for people physically.</p> <p>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the idea of hail stops.  At present, if a person in a rural area wants to use public transport, he or she has to catch the bus in the closest town or village.  People used to be able to flag down buses.  The latter is done all over rural Germany, France and Holland, so I am not inventing something crazy.  I spent weeks mapping every potential safe hail stop in my county.  When I submitted the information to the NTA, I was told that hail stops are not going to be part of the solution.  This means that I have to travel 5 km to the closest village or 10 km to the closest town in order to get the bus.  If we are serious about public transport, we have to bring services to the end of all secondary and tertiary roads.  We are familiar with most of those roads and we can walk and cycle on them safely.  What do you do when you get to the end of the road and the bus passes you by?  If we are serious about public transport, then we need to talk about proper bus stops.</p> <p>I am sick of talking about three-year-old timetables.  When I look at a bus stop in rural Clare, I see people with disabilities or older individuals standing in the rain and looking at a bus timetable that is three years out of date.</p> <p>Before we begin to increase everything significantly, we have much work to do to bring the current system up to standard.  I did not want this motion to proceed without that being acknowledged.  It is funny because I am advocating for public transport but I am half hiding behind it because sometimes it is very difficult to promote the thing that I want people to use because it is not being done well.</p> <p>We have all of the technology that is required but we need to make it easier for people to look at Local Link services.  The information relating to some of these services is brilliant.  With others, however, it could take you an hour to figure out where the bus is going to or coming from.  Some people have taken this on board and printed off timetables which are then sold in local shops because that is the only way that one will find out where the relevant bus is going to or coming from.</p> <p>A good deal of work needs to be done to inform people.  We have quite good public bus and train services, but trying to access them, figure out what is happening and get tickets is something of a nightmare.</p> <p>Pricing is also an issue.  We subsidise public transport, which is perfectly acceptable and which is done all over the world, but we need to look at pricing.  It is brilliant that we brought in half-price fares for 19- to 23-year-olds but there is more work to be done.  I book train tickets and I know that I can get to Dublin for &euro;15 if I book a week in advance.  However, it will cost me &euro;50 if I have to make the trip at the last minute.  Not everybody has their life planned out in advance, so there is also some work to be done in this regard.</p> <p>I want people back on trains and buses.  Public transport has to be affordable and accessible.  We need people to be able to take their bikes on buses because that is how you connect when you get to your destination.  You cannot walk everywhere in rural Ireland but you can cycle to the nearest stop, take your bike with you on the bus to town and then onto the train.  That is what we need.  We need proper connectivity to do this well but I welcome the motion.</p></speech>

I will speak to it then.</p> <p>We welcome the debate on the national development plan, which contains many positive measures.  We would like to see the MetroLink and DART+ progressed rapidly in order that people might be helped to get out of their cars.  It is regrettable, however, that the 2027 completion dates for both the MetroLink and DART+ have been removed from the plan and that no dates at all are provided.  While the western rail corridor and the Navan rail line are mentioned in passing, no firm commitment is provided in respect of these important projects.  We hope that the national development plan is not just a booklet with a long list of projects to keep backbenchers happy, but, rather, that it is a serious plan to address the deficits in our infrastructure.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Garvey that lower fares will be key to achieving a reduction in transport emissions.  The Government has an important role in encouraging more people to use public transport by lowering the cost of fares.  This is a key policy of Sinn F&eacute;in.  We were heartened to see the U-turn by the Minister for Transport who, just a week before the budget, stated that fares would not come down until more people used public transport.  This was the complete opposite of the research that we had heard at the Oireachtas committee, which was informed about the London plan and of how the then mayor, Ken Livingstone, did not even countenance bringing in measures such as congestion charges or anything like that until the cost of public transport had been reduced down to  &pound;1 per journey and people could jump off one bus and onto another having paid that amount.  That is the way one encourages people to use public transport.  One has to make it more affordable.  It must be so for families to travel together rather than them factoring in that it would be just cheaper to take the car and park it in the city centre.   Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget allocated funding to make public transport free for under-18s.</p> <p>There are also serious equity issues to be considered in how we plan our transport system.  Earlier this year, I published a survey on energy poverty.  One of the key findings was the link between domestic energy poverty and transport poverty.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will relate the real lived experiences of a couple of respondents.  This survey was carried out months before the cost of living soared or the price increases that have come in.  One respondent stated, &quot;I cut back on my food bill or car tax, or I bounce the bills around so that way there is heating&quot; in his or her home.  Another person said: </p><blockquote>	Our car has been off the road since March as we can&rsquo;t afford tax and insurance.  We have to choose between having a car on the road or having energy for the house.  This causes great difficulty for me personally as it has an effect on me being able to attend my hospital appointments amongst other things. </blockquote><p>These findings mesh with the latest European transport energy poverty index for 2019, which ranked Ireland 25th out of the then EU28 because of the poor access to public transport and high levels of car-constrained citizens, or what I like to call forced car ownership.  Nobody should be forced to have a car.  One should be able to choose to have a car but one should not be forced to have one.<br/><br/>It is important that the benefits of public transport are shared equitably.  Will the Minister systematically review the social impact of transport spending to make sure it is reducing rather than reinforcing inequalities?  All present know transport policy can be regressive.  The classic example is the bike-to-work scheme, of which I have availed.  It benefits workers on higher incomes more than those on lower incomes as the former get a bigger tax break.  It is not open to those outside the workforce, such as children, teenagers, pensioners, the unemployed or students.  None of them can avail of the bike-to-work scheme.<br/><br/>Another typical example of regressive transport policy is the grants that were available for very expensive cars.  Analysis from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggests that subsidising 100,000 electric vehicles, EVs, at 2019 levels of support would cost the Exchequer between &euro;965 million and &euro;1.23 billion.  That is an enormous amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  It is, therefore, essential that this funding is targeted towards those who need it.  We do not want the taxpayer to have funded EVs for people who did not need financial support or to have a concentration of EVs in an area where they are least required.  We need to think about how and where the issue of forced car ownership is targeted.  There are significant swathes of this country where there is forced car ownership, as anybody from a rural constituency knows.  On its current trajectory, the Government will end up directing subsidies everywhere but to the areas where people are forced to own a car.  There is incoherence in the policy.  The Government should consider increasing EV grants for those on lower incomes.  In addition, a grant for buying a second-hand EV should be introduced, as it was in France.  That proposal formed part of the alternative budget put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The aim of such a grant is to assist people with the higher cost of purchasing a second-hand EV and to encourage the purchase of new EVs by sellers.  <br/><br/>I will not speak to my amendment until I have the opportunity to move it but I hope that the Minister will take on board the suggestions that have been made in respect of the fact that it is vital to have policy coherence and target those who are most in need of the subsidies.  Otherwise, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Private Members' motion and discussion.</p></speech>

I thank the Fine Gael Senators who tabled this Private Members' motion.  Obviously, it is timely, given what happened across the water in Glasgow this week.  I acknowledge the detailed presentation by the National Transport Authority, NTA, that all Senators received this week.  It was exciting in parts.</p> <p>The motion calls for investment in existing rural and regional bus services.  Many of the services needed in the south Kildare area where I live were referenced in the presentation by the NTA.  I will take this opportunity to highlight the No. 880 route, which currently serves the town of Castledermot and terminates in Naas.  It is to be hoped that, with investment, it will serve the villages of Ballitore, Narraghmore and Calverstown and link up those important corridors in south Kildare.  I have raised previously in the House that there is a need to extend this route now.  The public has already spoken.  The current service is inadequate and commuters are simply being left on the side of the road as the existing services cannot cope with the numbers of passengers at certain times.  The Local Link service has already applied for funding to extend and develop this service.  The proposal has been on its website for more than a year.  Despite my following up on this on several occasions, the replies have always referred to waiting on funding.</p> <p>It is my hope that the connecting Ireland routes announced this week will be properly funded and, most important, will be implemented as quickly as possible following the public consultation.  If we are serious about how public transport can change rural life and village life, then the No. 883 route from Athy to Newbridge is a prime example of Local Link working well.  The route has seen phenomenal growth since it was first introduced.  Most important, for those living on or close to the route the service has provided a social outlet that simply did not exist prior to its establishment.  It has also allowed those living in these rural locations in south Kildare the chance to seek and hold down employment.  I am aware of this positive benefit as an outcome.</p> <p>The motion calls for support for the NTA in its development of an equitable fare structure across all State-funded transport.  I welcome the new travel card as a positive step in helping with the cost of rail transport, particularly from counties outside Dublin, but it does not go far enough.  In its alternative budget, the Labour Party proposed free transport for all children and students, which is important.  As I have stated previously, I am aware of students who are paying more than &euro;100 per week to travel to college from train stations in places such as Monasterevin because of the lack of student accommodation in Dublin.  The youth travel card, when introduced, will make a difference to them but we need to look at train fares urgently.  </p> <p>In calling for support for the NTA, the motion should also recognise, as every speaker in this debate has done, the urgent need for the Government to address the significant variance in rail fares.  In recent replies to my Labour Party colleagues, the Minister has stated that the NTA is responsible for setting fares.  However, in her reply in connection with reducing those fares, the CEO of the NTA stated that she cannot do so as she simply does not have the funding that would be required.</p> <p>The reality, of course, is that motor carriageways such as the N7, on which I travel most mornings, have become little more than car parks.  The reason for the number of cars on this carriageway is that commuters are still choosing to travel by car, even with the increase in fuel prices, due to the cost of travelling by train.  Who can blame hard-pressed commuters who are still saving up to &euro;200 per month by travelling from their homes in south Kildare to Sallins rail station to avail of short hop prices, avoiding the train stations in their area along the way?  If we are serious about developing the habit of using public transport, as the Minister said recently, then we must reduce train fares outside the short hop zone.  The reality is that these families are being forced to buy homes in these commuter belt locations but, to date, the Government has failed to recognise that by supporting them financially in their commute.  </p> <p>I support the amendment tabled by Senator Boyhan which recognises what is happening on the rail service and public transport.  I refer to the coverage of this issue on radio and television programmes in the past week.  Many people have contacted my office regarding incidents on rail and bus transport.  We have to do something about this issue.  I totally support the call by Senator Boyhan as a starting point.  There is a need for a consultation on this issue.</p> <p>As I stated, this is a very welcome and timely motion that facilitates debate on a range of topics that are raised with my office almost daily.  South Kildare, where I live, has several wonderful villages that would benefit from enhanced Local Link services.  They have benefitted in the past, but further links must be introduced for those living in these villages in order that they are not totally isolated or dependent on car transport, as has been stated.  We must urgently introduce equitable fares, as called for in the motion, for rail transport outside the short hop zone.  Investment in public transport does work and can create the life-changing habits the Minister has called for and is seeking.  However, this investment must be front-loaded so that those who use public transport can see the benefit of doing so immediately.</p></speech>

I know many of them have individually championed public transport projects but to bring it together into a motion for the House is a very positive step.</p><p>My amendment relates to the significant issue of how we describe things.  How we describe what we are doing makes a difference to how we approach it.  My amendment suggests that the line in the motion, &ldquo;that the role of carbon tax is to effect change in habits&rdquo;, would be changed to a recognition of the fact we had been subsidising carbon and subsidising fossil fuels for a very long period of time.  Indeed, that justification was given by the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when it was first initiated and at the higher, European level in regard to carbon tax.  My amendment calls &ldquo;for carbon pricing to better reflect the social and environmental cost of carbon emissions and to reduce public subsidisation of the fossil fuel industry&rdquo;.  Again, I have had agreement in the committee, when I quizzed the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that that is the rationale.  It is a Pigovian tax.  The idea of a Pigovian tax is that, when an industry is producing and selling something but is externalising all of the extra costs that go with its products and getting society to carry them, and getting the environmental costs to be carried by others, and having others pay for the health costs and the clean-up costs and pay the trillions we spend on climate change, it is not fair for everybody else to carry those costs and they should be contained within that industry.</p><p>If we recognise that that is the situation, it is very important for two reasons.  I worry there has been a perception through the use of language about &ldquo;habits&rdquo; or &ldquo;lifestyle&rdquo;, and there are certain taxes we bring in to encourage good lifestyle choices.  That can be patronising and it can add a sense of insult to injury.  The fact is that, for many people, it is not that they are using fossil fuels as a bad habit; it is because they find themselves in situations where they rely on these fuels simply for survival.  To tell somebody with a disability who has high energy usage that it is their habit and that we have this tax to change their bad habit sends a very negative message, as it does to say that to people in rural Ireland who do not have public transport options.  How we frame it matters.  We should be framing it as follows.  The fact is we are moving away from fossil fuels that we cannot socially afford.  It is a social transformation and, therefore, we have a duty to protect the most vulnerable and to provide them with alternatives.</p><p>Moreover, when we recognise the problem is the subsidisation of the fossil fuel industry, we can do a bit better around how we target those taxes.  For example, a huge amount of our subsidies to the transport industry are subsidies we give to jet kerosene or subsidies for excise duty on diesel fuel.  That is where much of the cost and the subsidisation is coming from.  We need to think about whether we carbon tax at that level.  Maybe it is about where we put the taxes and perhaps it will be more on production rather than just on consumption.</p><p>To move to the motion, I strongly support it because it is very good.  I particularly welcome all of the conversation in terms of rail but particularly in terms of the western rail corridor.  A huge opportunity was missed in the past to include this in EU funding projects.  I want this because it gives strength to the motion and highlights the climate committee&rsquo;s transport report, in which we highlighted that the cost-benefit analysis that has been used on rail projects in Ireland is inherently flawed.  This is the type of cost-benefit analysis that is used to delay things like the western rail corridor and to delay changes and new rail projects.  That happened because an excessive weight was given to time savings and there was an undervaluing of the social, environmental and other benefits of rail, and the time horizons within cost-benefit did not reflect the long-term value.  I can give more detail on this.  However, what I am saying is that one of the key ways that we move forward on rail is by having proper cost-benefit analysis that really looks to the benefits and realises, as others have said, that the benefits are not just simply in ticket sales.  In fact, we should be looking to lower those as far as possible, if not make public transport free for a period.</p><p>Deputy Dooley made good points on that.  We have almost missed a moment of opportunity.  When people returned to work and school this September, it would have been great if they were returning with a really new and affordable offering in terms of public transport and school transport.  It was a moment for a sea change in habits, although we have had a bit of an incremental piece by targeting discounted fares just for some young people.  Those cost-benefit analyses will make a difference and will make the value of things like the western rail corridor become very apparent.  I want to particularly support that.</p><p>The amendment put forward by Senators Boyhan and McDowell has very good merit.  One of its potential merits is that it is publicly led.  At the moment, we have a bit of a piecemeal approach in terms of private security that may be attached to some transport but not to other transport.  It needs a co-ordinated approach.  I would add that as well as looking to the policing, one of the key things is having shelters, having proper lighting and having staffed railway stations and bus stations; it is about having people on the ground.  We know that where we have people, we have much less of the disruptive behaviour.  Having so many unmanned stations is an unfortunate decision.</p><p>Again, I welcome the motion and I am happy to support it.  I hope others might be able to support my amendment.</p></speech>

When we look at the concept of public transport, a couple of issues arise.  The Ireland of 100 years ago was connected across our entire island with railways.  Then, for whatever reason, through whatever the consensus was at the time, we ripped up a lot of those railways and we are now replacing them with greenways.  My long-term vision for this country is that we will be so interconnected with greenways that we will be able to go from one end of the country to the other quite safely and along greenways.  It is very important in terms of fostering relations between North and South, and fostering the ability for tourism to thrive and prosper in Border regions, to develop the concept of cross-Border infrastructure.  Greenways and blueways are very good tourism initiatives that we can use to bring business back to both sides of the Border, which is very important.</p> <p>We have seen this in my own county of Louth, where we have the north Louth greenway connecting up with the greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock, which has been promoted by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.  That is just one example.</p> <p>Last week, I was in Derry with the Fine Gael engagement group on Northern Ireland.  I have heard Members from the north west, including former Senator Elisha McCallion, speak about this in the House, and I hear my colleague, Deputy Joe McHugh, talking about it as well.  It is not a part of the world I am from but I was amazed at the lack of connectivity to the north west.  If we have any long-term views in terms of transport and infrastructure, we have to look at connecting the north-west of this country properly and sufficiently to the rest of the island.</p> <p>To turn to the motion, the lack of alternatives to the private car in rural areas is a real issue.  How do we go about that?  We have to go about it when we have such an ambitious target to get 1 million people in electric vehicles by 2030.  We do that by increasing the charging infrastructure.  Let us put aside, for example, the amount of money it costs to get an electrical vehicle and everything else.  We are not going to get people into electric vehicles unless they are confident, particularly in rural areas, of having sufficient charging networks and even an abundance of charging networks.  If we see substantial Government investment in the charging network, we can do something to help people get out of private cars in rural areas and help to deal with the lack of alternatives in rural areas.</p> <p>That is my overall view and I am keen to hear the response of the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#AAA00800"><p>I welcome the motion from my colleague, Senator Kyne.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is important in a motion that is all about investment that it is not just investment into the major cities but into the regions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is important to ensure connectivity and to ensure all corners of the country have access to our capital and major cities.  In the past couple of days, the NTA announced extra funding and extra routes throughout the country.  A number of these routes are to be in my county.  There are to be extra routes through the rural regions connecting into other towns outside of our county, namely, Athlone and Cavan.  Some routes are also to become more frequent.  That infrastructure funding is positive.  I served on the committee for rural transport in Longford and Westmeath for a number of years and I have seen the benefits of it.  That is an area that should be strengthened.  There should be more routes in those local areas, connecting all the various towns and villages within our county.  </p><p>I have been involved with the greenway project for many years, since funding was first sought to develop the Royal Canal greenway.  This started with a section from Longford town to Cloondara on the River Shannon.  This ultimately meant all the local authorities coming together to develop what will be the longest greenway in the country when we get it between Maynooth and Spencer Dock.  This can only be a positive and a driver for economic activity within our county.  </p><p>An upgrade of the rail line from Mullingar to Dublin is mentioned in the NDP.  I mentioned this at the time and asked for it to be looked at.  The commuter rail route to Dublin starts from Longford but an upgrade to the line from Longford has not been included.  I ask that this be considered and that the line between Mullingar and Longford be included in that review because, as the Minister of State knows, people are moving further away from Dublin as a result of remote working.  If they are going to be travelling to Dublin, a good high-speed service needs to be available to them.</p><p>Senator McGahon mentioned the key infrastructure of charging points.  I fully agree with him.  We need to roll out points in every village.  If we are going to get people to invest and buy electric cars, we need that infrastructure in place.</p><p>Safe routes to school are mentioned in our motion and are one of the most positive measures brought forward for many years.  As far as I can remember, there have been more than 900 applications from schools.  I have been contacted by a large number of schools that missed the deadline for application.  I ask that the scheme be opened up again to allow schools to apply.  It will take a number of years for the routes to be funded but the schools would at least know that they will get their project done at some stage in the future.</p><p>When speaking about funding being allocated in a 2:1 ratio between public transport and roads, it would be remiss of me not to highlight the issue of the N4.  Looking at a map of Ireland, it is the one missing link as regards connectivity to Dublin and other national routes.  I refer to the Sligo route, which has dual carriageway status to Mullingar.  Work has been done on the N5 from Castlebar towards Longford and from Sligo back but there is a missing link in between, the section between Mullingar and Rooskey.  I ask that this missing link in the national network be prioritised as we proceed on that 2:1 basis.</p></speech>

We will take three minutes each.  I am very happy to support this motion, which Senators Kyne and Buttimer and the Fine Gael group have tabled.  There is almost nothing to object to in it.  It is all very positive.  I had not even considered it a motion just on public transport, which is what the screen is telling us it is, because it is not really just about public transport.  It also refers to active travel, although not enough, which is why I am speaking.</p> <p>I would have liked it to say a little bit more about cycling.  I happen to be one of those.  Senator Higgins also often cycles.  Perhaps other Members also do.  It is not necessarily workable in rural areas where people are travelling long distances but an awful lot of journeys in cities, particularly in compact cities such as the Minister of State's city of Galway, for which people think they have to get in their cars, could be done on a bike.  It came as a revelation to Senator Buttimer at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications with TII and the NTA, that I was elected D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown's cycling champion approximately ten years ago.  That was not because I was any good at it.  I was just supposed to promote cycling.  Other people got other positions and that was the one I got.</p></speech>

Perhaps Senator Boyhan should cycle too.  It would probably be of benefit to us all to get a bit more exercise.  That modal shift should not only be to public transport, although public transport is very useful.  Although Senators Boyhan and McDowell probably do, many people may not remember the furore over the quality bus corridor for the 46A taking over a lane of traffic of two lanes in Donnybrook in 1998 and 1999.  That was the most unbelievable achievement.  I believe Owen Keegan was director of traffic for Dublin City Council at the time.  People thought it was never going to happen, but it did and nobody would say that we should go back and take that transport corridor out of Donnybrook now.  People also said that nobody would use the Luas, but the Luas was not there.  The minute it opened in 2004, enormous numbers of people were sucked into it because they got a reliable and frequent service.  It was more a question of the reliability than the frequency.  People did not need to worry about a timetable.  They just went down to the station.  On a weekend, it might have been a wait of ten or 12 minutes but it was also often a wait of three, four or six minutes.  It has been very popular.  The public want to buy into public transport but it has to be there, by which I mean it has to turn up.  It also has to be reliable and relatively cost-effective.</p> <p>The fastest way for me to get to Leinster House is to cycle.  Walking to the Luas, getting the Luas and then walking to Leinster House takes twice as long as my journey time on a bike at rush hour.  We need to get all of those journeys of less than 2 km, 3 km or 4 km.  My journey is approximately 6 km.  We need to facilitate anyone who can cycle but, to do so, we need to make sure they are secure.  One of the biggest barriers to me cycling is not knowing that, when I park the bike at the other end, it will still be there when I come back to it because there is so much bike theft and we do not have enough cycle parking.  </p> <p>I could go on for a lot longer but I am conscious of time and want to let Senator Cassells in.  From a climate change perspective, I was disappointed to learn in our meeting with the NTA and TII that the upgrade of the Luas green line is being shelved or deferred.  Senator McDowell might be quite happy about that because he was certainly concerned by what was to happen in parts of Dublin Bay South but the Luas green line was at capacity before the pandemic and this needs to be looked at.  Charlie Haughey introduced free travel for older people and it worked out very well.  S&eacute;amus Brennan removed the peak travel times restriction.  Older people love that freedom they have.  The more public transport, the better.  We need to get people out of their cars and that involves getting people cycling and walking as much as getting them on public transport.</p></speech>

The investment in the public transport network under the NDP, particularly in the area of rail, is massively needed.  In that respect, I am glad that the Navan rail project is included in the plan, as is referenced in this motion.  As has been stated, allocations provided under the NDP will allow for the commencement of the planning and design of rail projects that might emerge from the review, including options for the proposed Navan rail line.  This is a major advancement in the life of this project.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, for listening to me, to the people of Navan and to the people of Meath and for making sure that the project was back on the books because it has been off the books for the past decade.  It was dumped as a policy in 2012 by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, even though the project was at rail order stage, having completed the first phase in 2010.</p> <p>Over the past few years, we have done a serious amount of detailed analytical work, led by Meath's local authority and its chief executive, Jackie Maguire, in her term.  This work has resulted in a serious plan being sent to the NTA.  This plan is based on projected population growth along the route and projected development and planning permissions along the route.  It is to be hoped the authority will give this plan a positive endorsement when the greater Dublin area plans are produced shortly.  I hope that, when we get that endorsement, the Green Party Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, whom Senator Kyne praised so effusively in his opening remarks, will sign the cheque for what is needed and allow us to construct the most deliverable of all the rail projects included in the NDP.</p></speech>

It is the distinction between public and private transport.  I am sure the Minister of State knows the route around Galway city well.  That is not private; it is public infrastructure which is badly needed.  There is no point in pretending, as Green Party members in Galway do, that it will be possible to provide some kind of Luas system there which will obviate the need for that circular route.  It is public infrastructure.  Likewise, the Sligo route mentioned by Senator Carrigy is public infrastructure.  It is not private.  It is not as if it is being given to some fat cat to make money out of.  It is public infrastructure.</p> <p>Some people have now got to the point of suggesting that the only public transport initiatives we should go for are where people share vehicles, be they rail carriages, Luas carriages, buses or taxis.  Sharing the vehicle makes it public and having one's own vehicle makes it private.  I do not think that is a reasonable division.  Someone living in Dublin may need to go to Dunnes Stores two or three miles from his or her house to do the weekend shopping.  There is no point telling such people to take a bus because they would need to be Charles Atlas to bring the shopping home and usually it is not the man in the house who does it.  People need private transport.  If they are going to be able to bring their children to cr&egrave;che in the morning, get to visit their aged mother in the afternoon and do the shopping at some stage, as is the fate of many people, they need private transport and buses will not suffice, nor will bicycles.  People cannot do the weekend shopping on a bicycle either.  Let us be practical about this.</p> <p>Regarding condemning the car, I heard Senator Boylan talk about forced ownership of cars.  It is an absolute essential of people's existence in Ireland in the 21st century to have a car per household.  It is not forced.  It is not merely essential, but it is a liberating thing.  While there may be some kind of a bus service, it will not be the kind of bus service to get someone into a local town at 8 p.m. coming home at 11 p.m. having seen a film or something like that.  It will not be like that and we should not cod ourselves.  </p> <p>On the MetroLink project and on the Luas extension, Senator Cassells spoke about the amount of money being spent on the Navan train line.  All the drawings are done and all the work has been done on it.  The Luas line to Lucan has been shelved.  We have already spent more than &euro;100 million - it is probably nearly &euro;200 million - on the MetroLink project and it will not start in the foreseeable future.  It may never be built because there is a competing project, the underground DART system from Connolly to Heuston.  Nobody is saying which of these projects will go ahead.</p> <p>That is why I object so strongly to the plan that is being praised so widely here.  It is not making the hard choices.  It is not telling us whether it is MetroLink from Swords to Sandyford, whether it is Luas to Lucan or underground from Connolly to Heuston.  We are not being told which the option is.  They are all being thrown up there.  While I am not trying to make a political point, any politician on the Government side can claim it is on the agenda and it has not been ruled out yet.  However, this is dishonest rubbish.</p> <p>We need a transport Minister who will say we are building the MetroLink and we are not building the underground DART or that we will build three more Luas lines on the surface in Dublin and that we are scrapping the underground DART.  We need somebody who will actually tell the truth to people.  We are not getting that kind of thing at all.</p> <p>I am sorry to be divisive and I am very glad to be able to support Senator Boyhan's sensible amendment.  It is the only sensible and real thing that will come out of this debate if it is accepted.  It is about time we got real.  The transport aspects of the development plan are nothing but an extended wish list and a kick-the-can-down-the-road job.  We want to see what will be built and what will not be built.  We want a realistic transport system, not just a thing that will get us through to the next general election, which is what we have at the moment.</p></speech>

It is great to see the Minister of State here.  I support the motion.  Since I was elected as a councillor, there have been many public consultations, which is fantastic.  There was one for BusConnects.  There have been two for DART+ West although they have been conducted during the pandemic.  There have been two consultations on the Royal Canal urban greenway.  One of my first motions as a councillor was about safe routes to school before it became a project.  Obviously, the community is very much behind these.  While there can be disagreement over aspects of the routes, in general people are very much invested in public transport for Dublin West, but we want to see it delivered.</p> <p>I wish to recap some of the projects.  Regarding DART+ West, electrifying the rail line is essential to our area.  Irish Rail needs to be better at how it engages with communities.  Many of the delays come from those consultations not being held in the way that they should be.  They were not conducted well during the Covid pandemic.  We had two and hopefully we will have a third, but we probably would not have needed a third for Ashtown if they had been conducted well in the first place.</p> <p>There is a mandate to close the level crossings in communities.  There are many reasonable questions about whether that needs to happen.  It is possible to automate the gates and invest in signalling to do that.  It has been signalled to us that that will not just be on DART+ West, but it will be on the DART in other areas also.  It is an issue that affects me, but it will affect many other people.  Managing that is sensitive and needs to be done properly.  </p> <p>On BusConnects, there are 150 trees on the Navan Road that could be removed.  Those in the community still do not know if that will go ahead.  I call for clarity on that.  I know the Minister of State cannot give clarity today, but those in the area need to know that.  </p> <p>Regarding active travel, many projects are being discussed, but only one in Dublin 15 has been delivered.  While we have the Royal Canal greenway, Fingal County Council is holding back on aspects of that greenway which could proceed where there are not issues of contention.  It could start on other parts of it but it is choosing not to.  Public transport is very important to Dublin West, but we need more delivery.</p></speech>

We met recently in Athlone at the launch of the new bridge across the River Shannon connecting the east to the west for the Dublin to Galway cycleway.  In fact, as the Minister of State mentioned on the day, we will be able to cycle from Moscow to Galway.  This is an incredible piece of infrastructure that shows the progress of the national development plan.  Those pieces of infrastructure are absolutely crucial, particularly coming into the west which lacks public areas such as parks.  What that will deliver for communities is incredible.  It will be a safe place to walk and cycle.  The Minister of State knows how much this means for communities in the west.</p> <p>The motion is very well thought out.  There is an acknowledgement that regional and rural areas have challenges.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We would like to cycle but it is not a case of being able to cycle ten or 20 miles.  In my constituency area it takes an hour and a half to travel from one end to the other.  It is incredible to think that we can achieve all of this through cycling and walking, and we do not have rail network services to every single town.</p><p>In terms of public transport, it is important that our roads network is supported by the provision of buses as they will enable people to get to where they need to go.  The Connecting Ireland initiative was launched this week after this motion was put together.  It is so important that the initiative is rolled out as it will develop the Local Link services and connect towns that are currently not connected.</p><p>Bus shelters have been mentioned.  As a councillor I got to invest my notice of motion funds in a temporary bus shelter in Ballinasloe.  I hope that with the National Transport Authority we will consider the creation of further bus shelters, particularly for the winter when people will be drowned by the rain, winds and storms.</p><p>I am happy to see the progress and development of transport that has taken place under the remit of the Minister of State in our areas.  I acknowledge the phenomenal Safe Routes to School programme.  It considers ways to ensure that there are safe places, particularly on narrow country roads, where there is not even a footpath to protect people when they drop or collect children from school.  We know what it is like with the pick-up and drop-off zones.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

If we are to truly move to a greener society, live up to our obligations to reduce carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 then people must increase their use of public transport.</p> <p>Connectivity is a particular issue.  I am regularly contacted by constituents in Kildare South who complain of shoddy services and a lack of joined-up thinking in terms of routes, particularly cross-county routes.  I raised these matters at the meeting that we had on Monday with the NTA.  As the Acting Chairperson will well know, many students decide to study in Maynooth and Carlow.  However, it is extremely difficult to access public transport routes to both locations.  Bus, rail and tram timetables must fit together in a way that allows people to use and rely on public transport.  </p> <p>Public transport needs to be affordable, accessible and people-centred.  We need to consider the commuter issues that exist in County Kildare and ensure that people who live in rural parts of the county can use the bus in order to access appointments, health services, etc.  The NTA has published its proposals for some improvements around south Kildare.  They are welcome but there is room for more improvements. </p> <p>In terms of using cycling routes, recently I walked the path between Glenaree to Rathangan that is part of the Barrow Blueway.  The journey was less than half the distance that I would have to take if I travelled by road.  The blueway is fabulous for anyone  who wishes to walk or cycle.  The investment in all of these areas is very welcome.</p> <p>There is an onus on us to facilitate change.  In rural Ireland there is a huge reliance on petrol and diesel cars.  That is an absolute necessity at the moment as there is no choice.  However, we must allow that freedom of choice.</p> <p>For some time I have called for, as has the Acting Chairperson, a medium-hop rail zone to be created between Dublin and Newbridge onwards.  This morning, I paid &euro;27.50 for a return ticket that would allow me to travel between Newbridge and Dublin.  If I chose to board the train at Sallins, which is just 6 km nearer to Dublin, the price of my ticket would have been less than half that price, which is wrong.  The price of tickets can act as a barrier.</p> <p>I welcome the action taken by the Government to date and the transport measures in the national development plan.  I wish to emphasise that implementation of these measures is key and we, in this House, have a duty to hold the Minister of State and our Government colleagues to account to ensure that public transport receives the necessary funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#DDD00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being here to discuss this very important motion.  As I have limited time I will be blunt and make six points.</p> <p>A lot of my points relate to the Connecting Ireland proposals that were launched this week, which are quite welcome.  One of my concerns is evening public transport.  There is a lot of focus on commuters but there is a difficulty.  For instance, if I wanted to travel back home to Gorey by train now I would be unable to do so.  There is a very good bus service but for evening travel that is impossible.  If we want to encourage our night-time economy then we must provide public transport in the evenings.  The same applies to Local Link services in communities.  People should be able to avail of a Local Link service that will allow them to travel between villages and towns.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that the 50% fare for young people will come into being.  We need certainty that when the fare is introduced it also applies to private operators because, as the Minister of State will know due to the fact that she comes from Galway, most of the public transport provided in rural areas is provided by private operators.  It would not be right that only people in Dublin can avail of the new fare.  This issue still has not been fully clarified.</p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin and other Senators have mentioned the issue of interurban public transport.  Almost all public transport roads lead to Dublin.  If I want to travel from Gorey to Waterford or Carlow, and both places have an institute of technology, there are very limited public transport options so we have got to examine interurban connectivity.</p> <p>Yes, we want to get more people using public transport.  In terms of the transition to hydrogen-powered vehicles and more environmentally-friendly vehicles, we have started to see the roll-out of electric vehicles especially in local authorities and by a number of State agencies.  However, we need a real strategy with both public and private transport providers to ensure that there is a move away from oil-powered vehicles, particularly diesel ones.  I am not convinced that there is enough focus on that area.  </p> <p>I wish to mention ports, which is very much a specific focus of the Minister of State.  Of course I must mention the potential of Rosslare Europort but if we are to strike a balance between people using airlines and other forms of transport to get off the island then we must ensure that there are enough services and facilities.  In a post-Brexit context, particularly with all of the direct sailings between Ireland and France, it is essential that we have the necessary ports infrastructure.  I urge the Minister of State to prioritise that area.</p></speech>

I have followed the debate from my office and I must say that it has been a good debate.  It is really good to see people from all sides encouraging investment in public transport and it is a positive change.</p> <p>I take issue with my colleague, Senator McDowell, on one point and agree with another of his points.  I am someone who is a forced owner of a car.  I have two cars at home and my family does not want two cars.  It is extremely costly to run them but the reality is that there is no other way to get my children back from school after study at the moment.  My family does not need two cars and we should not need to have them.  It is about choice.  My choice would be to have one car that I could share with my partner and use to get our children in and out of Limerick.  Unfortunately, we just do not have a frequent bus service at the moment.</p> <p>I agree with Senator McDowell on one important point that he made that is, perhaps, uncomfortable for the Government parties.  The national development plan is a wishlist and it is very clear that an awful lot of its contents will not be delivered.  Perhaps we need clarity on what is and is not going to happen.</p> <p>I have a parliamentary colleague, who shall remain nameless, who gets a picture of himself behind a big sign that says M20 in the newspapers maybe six or ten times a year.  His party has been in power for 11 years yet we are no nearer to having an M20 than we were then.</p></speech>

The northern distributor road in Limerick needs to be completed as it is absolutely essential.  The project has been dropped from the national development plan and that has a huge impact in terms of some of the things that have been mentioned in the motion.  I refer to the problem of a large amount of traffic at both ends of the city.</p> <p>A number of good points were made about cycling and now I will outline some of my frustrations.  Parnell Street is a key thoroughfare in Limerick that runs along to the railway station.  We have piecemeal cycle lanes and not a proper integrated network so on Parnell Street there is a row of parked cars, a cycle lane and then the road.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Cycling is, therefore, hazardous because cars are constantly moving across the cycle lane to park or to leave parking spaces.  That is the result of a piecemeal development.  We need an integrated cycle network across our urban centres and that has not happened in Limerick.  I would not want my kids to go on those cycle paths because they are not safe or secure.  Until recently, although perhaps it is not the case anymore, cycling was seen as something that was nice to have but not a priority.  That attitude has been reflected in the way Limerick is set up.</p><p>I want to talk about buses and trains.  I acknowledge that there are many good things in this motion that we would be happy to support.  The Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan that was launched yesterday mentions increasing services, which is welcome.  However, I am frustrated that it refers, in many cases, to a minimum of three return trips per day.  Towns near where I live, such as Castleconnell, Murroe, Caherconlish and Newport, depend on links to Limerick city and we do not have a frequent service.  For large parts of the day in Castleconnell, there are three hours between a bus coming and going.  I can assure the Minister of State that is not good enough.  Large sections of the young population end up asking their mums and dads to bring them in and out of town because they cannot go in and out of Limerick on a bus service that only runs every three hours.  Castleconnell is actually one of the better served villages, when compared to Newport and Murroe.  We need increased frequency of bus services and real thought going into linking those outer villages and the centre of Limerick.</p><p>To give another example, there is a student accommodation crisis in Castletroy.  If we had a proper, decent bus service, we could offer accommodation in those outlying towns, which would be a boost to those areas.  It just needs common sense, but we do not have it and I do not see it being likely at the moment.  I accept there is a consultation period and I, like many others, will be lobbying hard for increased bus services to villages and towns across Limerick city and county.</p><p>I will move to the issue of the forgotten Ballybrophy railway line.  Small, piecemeal parcels of work have been carried out over the years, such as the upgrade to 3.5 miles of line that is currently under way.  The railway line has great potential but needs investment to cut journey times.  The line has the potential to serve the towns of Castleconnell, Birdhill, Nenagh, Cloughjordan, Roscrea and Ballybrophy.  However, that is not happening because only two trains go out and only three trains come back per day.  The journey times are incredibly slow and that is because the track has not been upgraded.  We need a funding commitment from the Minister of State to complete that track.  Only 8.5 miles of track needs to be upgraded to continuous welded rail.  If the Minister of State did that, we could cut the journey time significantly.  The good news is that the funding to do that is already in place.  It is already there under the infrastructure manager multi-annual contract for the period 2020 to 2024.  I am asking the Minister of State to bring down that funding early.  The fact that little bits and pieces are done each year and then waiting is killing people in Castleconnell and across Limerick.  It should all be done next year.  I ask the Minister of State to consider bringing in a new, midday service because if we are really serious about taking people out of cars and onto public transport, there is an easy win there in getting that railway line, which is already there, up and running.  It just needs a funding commitment.</p><p>Another easy win for the Minister of State would be to open the railway station in Moyross.  It runs to Galway and should be opened.  We need to see a spur from Shannon.  Senator Kyne earlier talked about making that line a double track and that must happen.  I ask the Minister of State to be ambitious for our projects and ensure we get proper balance across the western seaboard.</p></speech>

We have had much discussion this evening about the various aspects of the plan, particularly its regional aspects.  One of the issues about which I have been in contact with the National Transport Authority, the Minister for Transport and the head of Dublin Bus is 24-hour bus services for Dublin.  Many people from D&uacute;n Laoghaire work in the city centre.  It is only a bus ride away and we have the famous 46A which connects us with the city centre.  It is one of the flagship buses in the Dublin Bus fleet.  As part of the BusConnects plan and the plans for changes to the bus network, there will be construction of what they are calling spines, which will run through the whole city, from one side to the other, and the 46A will become the E spine, or the various aspects of it.  I do not have a problem with that at all.  We will miss the name 46A, particularly given that it exists in popular culture and things like that, but that much we will get over as long as a proper service is provided.  The 46A has been an excellent service.</p> <p>One of the issues during the pandemic was that night services stopped.  The 46N Nitelink bus, which followed a similar route to the 46A and served the people of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire and surrounding areas, stopped.  There was a suggestion at one point that the 46N would not return.  I am delighted that it has and from 22 October, the Nitelink is again available to people.  However, the Nitelink is a one-way service.  It is expensive and costs twice as much as a normal fare during the day.  I have consistently raised the notion that we should have a 24-hour service.  It already exists in certain areas and I understand a part of the BusConnects plan is to roll out 24-hour services.  However, that is a conversation for 2023.  That is the kind of timeline we are talking about.  There are people who live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the areas around it, quite a distance from the city centre, and work in bars, pubs, restaurants, theatres or whatever it might be in the city centre, and have a serious difficulty with the public transport facilities that are available to them.  It is expensive to get a taxi from the city centre to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It would cost &euro;25 or more, perhaps even more than &euro;30, particularly at night time when taxis are more expensive.  There is a need for these services.  I am focusing on D&uacute;n Laoghaire because that is where I am from and it suits me to talk about the area but it is an issue throughout Dublin and our other urban areas.  People are working in city centres and need the facility to be able to get home after work.  Of course, it also benefits late-night revellers, people who are out and availing of the leisure industry.  We should consider somebody who is working in a restaurant in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and lives in town.  Such people cannot use the Nitelink services.  </p> <p>One of the things I hope we will have in terms of the development of public transport infrastructure is a focus on that.  We need a service that does not stop at 11.25 p.m., which is the time the last 46A runs.  We need a service that goes right through the night and facilitates people who work shifts and people who work at odd hours.  We need to facilitate people in the night-time economy and the entertainment industry who are currently left a little bit short and rely on an expensive aspect of public transport.  If we want to look at a public transport service that actually behaves in a way that reflects people and the way they behave and work, then we need a 24-hour bus service.  As a part of this motion, we should also be considering the situation and we are not left waiting until 2023.  We should put that in place now.  The plans are there.  The service already exists on some routes and I do not understand why some routes have been chosen over others.  There is an opportunity for us to take a step forward now, when it is needed, and put in place a proper 24-hour bus service for people in places such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other suburbs who need to get in and out of town other than during the normal operating times of the bus service.</p> <p>This is a tiny aspect of what we are talking about in the context of this motion, but it is an incredibly important thing for the people who are directly affected by it.  I know the Minister of State has always been very good at listening to the issues Senators have raised in this House.  I have always found her very accessible.  I hope she will be able to raise this matter with her colleagues in the context of improving that aspect of public transport and facilitating people who are working in a particular way and need the benefit of that service.</p></speech>

Much been said this evening.  I was listening to the debate and it has been interesting.  Everyone is in agreement that we need enormous investment in our public transport.  I took a few notes that contain references to the safety, accessibility and availability of that transport.  We must make it practical and link up our bus and rail services, our greenways and blueways.  We must link them and make them usable for everybody.  We welcome the considerable investment and the excellent things for public transport in the national development plan.  There are some great policies but we have had great policy and endeavour in the past.  We need our great ambition to be matched by action because people are getting a little frustrated.  They want to get out of their cars and to have a safe, accessible and available public transport system.  I had a Commencement matter this morning on the accessibility of public transport and the fact that many of our citizens are barred from access and kept in their homes because of the inaccessibility of our public transport system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I spoke about two incidents.  One lady, Vicky Matthews, was stranded on a train at Connolly Station this weekend because there was nobody there to put up a ramp to allow her off the train.  She rang and nobody came.  Nobody was there to answer the phone.  She booked the train 24 hours in advance.  There has to be a better way and a far better link-up.  The only way that lady got off the train was with the help of a passer-by who was also a passenger on the train.  That inequity and inequality in our public transport system is deplorable.  Another case involved the 100X bus from Dundalk to Dublin, a major route connecting the capital city and a major town.  I heard from a gentleman, John Morgan, who cancelled a trip abroad because he could not get to Dublin Airport due to the bus not being able to take him there.  This is not accessible.  People are being stopped from living their lives, which is keeping them in their homes and othering them.  It really has to end.</p><p>I have so much more to say but I would just push for accessible transport.</p></speech>

As many in this House will be aware, I am passionate about public transport and the need for better, more accessible, more inclusive public transport and a total overhaul of the public transport network.  People in this country are very much aware of the need to get out of the private vehicle, but they need to be given the opportunity to do so and to have public transport that suits where they live and how they live.</p> <p>I am coming from the point of view of living in north County Dublin.  It is the fastest growing part of Europe.  We have housing planned first and then, after a long time, comes the public transport, and that should not be the way.  The public transport should be put in place first; otherwise, people are condemned to a life trapped in a car, trapped in traffic, trapped on a motorway, wasting their lives away in the process.  People want to be able to take the train, but the trains are packed and the service scant.  We in north County Dublin were very disappointed that the timeline for the metro got pushed out even further.  People have given up all hope, and it is hard to blame them because this has been going on for more than 20 years.  As for the expansion of the DART north, while I commend the Government on extending the DART west and south, I do not know why we in north County Dublin are being left to last when we are absorbing most of the housing needs of Dublin and have a completely underdeveloped public transport network which is already creaking before the building of thousands and thousands more houses there.  Even though we in north County Dublin are not as such in the capital city, we are a short distance from it.  The children, teenagers and young people in north County Dublin cannot easily access third level and college campuses.  It is virtually impossible to get to the UCD campus.  It is very difficult to get to our local university, DCU, by public transport.  If you were to hop into your car, you could be in DCU in 15 minutes; if you were to get the bus, it would take an hour and a half.  That is completely unacceptable.  Until we start addressing these real life issues and allow people to access their third level institutions, their hospitals and other services, they will stick to their cars, and who is to blame them for doing so?  It will be an indictment of the Government if we do not deliver decent, accessible, suitable public transport for the people of Ireland.</p> <p>I wish the Minister of State luck in her brief.  It is a big task.  I know there is a commitment there, but we need the follow-through from all arms of the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-03a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110300002#FFF00300"><p>I welcome this motion from my Fine Gael colleagues and thank them for the work they have put into it.  Many of the actions called for in the motion reflect the Government's existing and planned projects and policies for public transport, and I can confirm that the Government supports the motion, as proposed.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the House on current developments on public transport, especially in light of the forthcoming sustainable mobility policy framework and the revised climate action plan 2021, which will be launched tomorrow.</p> <p>The Government recognises the importance of expanding public transport options throughout Ireland.  We all have our own views on the challenges and opportunities related to public transport.  However, I think we can agree on one thing: the need for a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland to reduce our carbon emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Fundamental to that change will be increasing the numbers of people using sustainable modes, not just public transport but also walking and cycling.  Transitioning to sustainable modes has the potential not only to cut emissions but also to improve our health, relieve congestion in our cities and boost our quality of life, whether we live in rural or urban Ireland.</p> <p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits us to a 51% reduction in our overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050.  Currently, the transport sector represents about 18% of Ireland's carbon emissions nationally, with road transport and private car usage accounting for the majority of that.  This motion recognises the requirements on the transport sector both to reduce carbon emissions and to expand transport services across the country.</p> <p>It is important to say that these tasks are complementary, not mutually exclusive.  Active travel and public transport are not only the most environmentally friendly options but also the most efficient, socially inclusive and economically accessible.  By focusing on their improvement and expansion, we can achieve our climate goals and cater for the projected population growth set out in Project Ireland 2040.  I wish to inform the House about the forthcoming sustainable mobility policy framework which the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, aims to publish before the end of this year.  This will set out a strategic framework for walking, cycling and public transport to support Ireland's overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of this decade.  The framework will focus primarily on measures to promote and facilitate active travel and public transport for all and, in so doing, will encourage less private car use nationally to support our climate commitment.  The climate action plan 2021, which has a broader focus, will set out additional measures to promote other complementary transport mitigation measures such as incentivising the switch to electric cars and fostering greater use of renewable fuels.</p> <p>The target of the new sustainable mobility policy framework will be to cater for daily travel needs in a more sustainable manner and to deliver an additional 500,000 daily active travel and public transport journeys by 2030.  We intend to accomplish this by making sustainable modes the smartest and most attractive choice.  The new framework will replace the existing policy framework known as Smarter Travel, which was published in 2009.</p> <p>The Department has undertaken a collaborative approach in developing the sustainable mobility policy framework through public consultation and extensive stakeholder engagement.  It will set out a comprehensive set of actions to increase active travel infrastructure provision and improve public transport capacity and services across the country.  These will be supported by behavioural change and demand management measures to make sustainable modes the preferred choice for as many people as possible.  The policy framework will also include measures to promote smart and integrated mobility through investment in innovative technologies.</p> <p>It important to say that we recognise that there are different issues and solutions across the country to the transport challenges we all know exist.  Transport needs are not uniform across our country, and we recognise that tailored solutions will be needed for both urban and rural areas.  Senators have alluded to that this evening.</p> <p>The new policy framework will be underpinned by funding under the renewed national development plan, which provides &euro;35 billion for transport over the next decade.  This is the largest investment in transport in the history of the State.  It will support the commencement of the major public transport projects of BusConnects for our five cities, DART+ and MetroLink in Dublin and increased investment in our inter-urban and regional rail network.  This will be complemented by expanded public transport services as supported by the public service obligation programme.</p> <p>The Government is dedicated to improving and expanding our active travel and greenway infrastructure network through the provision of walking and cycling facilities in our cities, towns, villages and rural areas.  Our aim is to promote active travel use for short, local journeys.  This will be supported by a significant increase in funding for walking and cycling, with &euro;3.6 billion allocated over the next ten years.  In 2021 alone, roughly &euro;204 million has been allocated to the provision of dedicated cycling and walking infrastructure across the country, including the safe routes to school programme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This programme, which is recognised by the motion, will support safer environments around schools to encourage our young people to opt for active travel modes when travelling to and from school.  It has been a great success, with 170 schools to receive funding under its first round, and another 762 schools entering the programme on a rolling basis.  </p><p>Our commitments to improve and expand public transport projects will work towards reducing car dependency.  BusConnects will be rolled out across all five cities.  It will overhaul the current bus system in the cities by implementing a network of next-generation bus corridors, which includes segregated cycling facilities, on the busiest routes.  This will make journeys faster, predictable, and reliable.  BusConnects will massively expand access to public transport and radically improve cycling infrastructure.  The Government does not accept the proposed amendment to the motion to conduct a review of BusConnects in Dublin to measure current and projected future travel demand in light of increased working from home practices.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the way we travel.  In some respects, it could even be argued that it has had a positive effect.  Working from home initiatives reduce congestion and help lower transport emissions.  That said it is important to remember that the CSO's national travel survey has previously underlined how we tend to put too much emphasis on commuting.  Although it is important, it accounts for less than 25% of all trips.  We also need buses to undertake a wide range of daily activities.  If we are going to support citizens' travel needs across the day in the major cities, we need public transport projects like BusConnects that offer affordable, frequent and high-quality services throughout the day and across the city-regions.</p><p>In Dublin, DART+ and MetroLink will complement BusConnects as part of an integrated public transport system and facilitate compact, transport-led development at key locations.  The preliminary business cases for MetroLink, BusConnects and DART+ were submitted to the Department for review earlier this year and the Minister for Transport expects to bring all three to Government for approval in line with the requirements set out in the public spending code.</p><p>I note the proposed amendments to the motion relating to MetroLink, which the Government does not accept.  Significant work has been undertaken on finalising the preliminary design for MetroLink, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues.  This work is critical to ensuring that MetroLink is in line with both the public spending code and the common appraisal framework.  </p><p>There has also been broad engagement with citizens and stakeholders over the past few years through extensive public consultation processes.  There is no lack of commitment to delivering MetroLink, but it is essential that we allocate the necessary time and expense to ensure that the project meets the needs of our citizens in terms of effective design.  It is important that we learn from the lessons of large-scale capital investment projects in other sectors so that the public finances are not put at risk.  When talking about the potential for a MetroLink southern route, it is important to distinguish between the MetroLink project and the statutory review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  These two different processes are currently under way, and both relate to the potential future development of metro in Dublin.</p><p>First, the preliminary business case for MetroLink is currently under review by the Department.  The public spending code requires a Government decision for major projects such as MetroLink.  The Minister expects to bring the business case to Government in the near future, and if approved, that will allow MetroLink to move into the statutory planning system.</p><p>Second, we have the statutory review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The NTA has stated that as part of this review, it is considering whether additional metro routes, above and beyond MetroLink, should be included in any revised strategy.  The revised strategy will be published by the NTA shortly for public consultation, and I have no doubt Senators will have their views as to what it proposes out to 2042.  I emphasise that the inclusion of projects in any revised strategy is the only first step in what is a detailed, and often lengthy, process.  It takes time for projects to move from the strategic support enabled by inclusion in a transport strategy, to being a project with a preliminary business case seeking approval to enter the statutory planning process, not alone a project in construction.</p><p>As reflected in the motion, improved public transport cannot just be about cities.  The sustainable mobility policy framework will also support enhanced rural and regional public transport.  Increased investment in the interurban and regional network will improve journey times, enhance reliability and maintain safety across the network.  The delivery of the NTA's Connecting Ireland plan in the coming years will significantly improve mobility in rural areas by improving the existing bus networks, adding new bus services and enhancing the current demand responsive transport network.  Senators will be aware that the NTA launched a public consultation process on the Connecting Ireland plan last week.  Alongside improved and expanded services, an enhanced bus stop programme for rural and regional areas will also be delivered.  Improved and more comfortable transport options will support passenger journeys to and from rural communities, creating opportunities for balanced economic growth and stronger regional development.</p><p>On rail, the strategic rail review will examine all aspects of interurban and interregional rail on the island of Ireland, and will examine how to improve regional rail connectivity.  Work has commenced on this review and it will provide a strategy for the development of the railway sector over the coming decades.  As well as enhancing regional accessibility and supporting balanced regional development, it will consider the potential for high-speed rail links between the major cities.  It will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services and infrastructure along the various existing, or future potential, corridors of the network, including the western rail corridor.  I also note that the issue of a rail connection to Navan, as referenced in the motion, is being re-examined as part of the NTA's ongoing statutory review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The motion recognises the budget measure to introduce a youth travel card to allow young adults between the ages of 19 and 23 to avail of a 50% discount across all public transport services.  Alongside this, a new fares strategy will be developed and implemented under the sustainable mobility policy framework to ensure an equitable fares system for all applicable subsidised services.</p><p>The Government does not accept the proposed amendment to the motion to establish a dedicated transport policing unit on the public transport network.  The safety and security of passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with antisocial behaviour, are matters, first and foremost, for individual public transport companies and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  For example, I would like to highlight the approach of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  It has been working extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its employees and trade unions, and its private security personnel to ensure they both proactively put in place measures to address antisocial behaviour and respond to specific incidents.  The garda&iacute; are the best advisers on these issues because they have a critical role in policing public order.  While some argue for a separate transport policing unit, that runs the risk of undermining the work they carry out.  I believe we should instead double down on existing policing strategies.</p><p>Finally, the Government recognises that private car use will always be a feature of the overall transport system.  However, we need to ensure that we reduce fossil fuelled kilometres in the short and medium term, and ultimately, transition the private car fleet to zero emissions.  Regarding the proposed amendments to the motion on carbon tax, we certainly agree that the role of carbon tax is for carbon pricing to better reflect the social and environmental cost of carbon emissions.  The Government also agrees with the EU Council's conclusions that call for "a global phase-out of harmful fossil-fuel subsidies", with which I have no doubt Senators Higgins and Moynihan also agree and, therefore, the spirit of what the Senators propose is, I believe, reflected in Government's actions in this space.  However, the specific wording of the proposed amendment, which goes onto state that the role of carbon pricing is to also reduce public subsidisation of the fossil fuel industry, is technically problematic, as that is not the role of carbon pricing.  We can certainly agree on the need to phase out harmful fossil fuel subsidies and it is unfortunate that due to pressures of time we were unable to work with the Senators on the proposed amendment to arrive at a mutually agreeable one.  However, as currently worded, I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</p><p>The climate action plan 2021 will include measures to promote the uptake of electric and low-emission vehicles where car journeys are necessary.  We have an ambitious goal to have almost 1 million electric vehicles in the private transport fleet by 2030, and we are on our way to meeting this target.  Already in 2021 we have seen a high purchase level of EVs in the car market, accounting for 15% of all new car purchases in Ireland this year.  However, we still have a long way to go and we need to ensure that we have the right supports in place.  Together with Government incentives and investment in the recharging network, we expect to see a further rise in EV uptake in the coming years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=03"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I said from the outset, we all agree on the need for change in the area of transport to address our climate commitments and improve sustainable mobility options throughout the country.  While there is no easy pain-free solution to the decarbonisation of the transport system, the response to our climate challenge requires collaboration, co-operation and a just transition for all.  Achieving the necessary transport emissions mitigation will require individual consciousness and action by us all, underpinned by active and progressive Government interventions and support.  This is an issue that should bring together.  It is not a party political issue.  Collectively we can create the necessary changes in the transport sector.  I thank the Acting Chairperson and Senators for bringing forward this motion today.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I commend the motion to the House.  I was amused by and smiled at my colleague and friend's, Senator McDowell's intervention and contribution.  I would remind him to read the transcript of today's transport committee meeting where we had a robust engagement with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII on the delivery of the national development plan.  The point I make repeatedly, which I made at the committee today, is that people want to see delivery.  They want to see project realisation and visualisation.  It is important to say that at the outset.  The Senator is right that there is a degree of confusion.</p> <p>I am sharing time with Senator Conway.</p></speech>

Government has strategically laid down this marker by the publication of the national development plan, Bus Connects, Connecting Ireland and the climate action plan tomorrow.  I thank my colleagues for the debate tonight in the House.  It was very positive.  Much of what has been said helps us to move forward together.  I am disappointed at one level that Senator Boyhan's amendment is not being accepted.  I, along with other Members of the Upper and Lower Houses from Fine Gael, have mentioned the need for action on anti-social behaviour on our public transport systems.  Many Members of this House and the Lower House and many of us in our offices and personally have experienced anti-social behaviour.  It is not acceptable for staff, the travelling public and commuters who use public transport every day.  I am genuinely concerned about the spiral in anti-social behaviour in all parts of our country but in particular in the public transport system.  We have a duty to the staff and to the travelling public.</p> <p>I was struck by the conversation I had with a number of bus drivers in my own city of Cork who spoke to me about the decline in behaviour and the fear they have.  Senator McDowell or Senator Boyhan mentioned after dark but it is not just after dark.  The attitude towards anti-social behaviour is one we should return to in a different debate.</p> <p>People want to move from the car.  Senator Gavan made reference to the two car family and Senator Horkan referred to frequency and availability.  People want that.  To be fair to the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, Transport Ireland and the NTA, there is a willingness to bring that real need and desire to fruition with Bus Connects, in the case of regions outside of Dublin as well as Dublin.  That is important.  It is about enhancing connectivity for rural Ireland, and it is about the person.  My father, who lives in Kilmichael, asks me every night how does one get the bus to go to Cork.  It is about ensuring connectivity, frequency of service and choice.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for being here tonight and my colleagues for their participation in the debate.  I hope that the motion will be accepted.  I understand the reasons the Minister of State made those remarks on Senator Boyhan's amendment.  I hope that in time we can come back to the issue of the dedicated public transport policing authority or force.  We see it in other countries and cities where it has worked quite well on public transport.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for her time, commitment, accessibility and engagement with us.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
