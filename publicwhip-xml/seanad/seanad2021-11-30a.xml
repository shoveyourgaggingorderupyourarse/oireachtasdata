I thank the Minister of State for coming into this House, as I know she is personally invested in this issue.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, has also regularly raised this issue.  It is an important statement by these Houses on how we value those who are deaf or have hearing impairments as members of our society and how the legislation that is designed to support them is enforced.</p><p>Four years ago, on Christmas Eve 2017, we saw the signing into law of the Irish Sign Language Act.  It was rightly recognised as transformative in the position of deaf people in Irish society.  As Senators know, it followed a report from an Oireachtas committee that highlighted how deaf people were marginalised in Irish society.  We have seen the contribution of those with hearing difficulties in Ireland.  I refer to my Wexford colleague, &Uacute;na Walsh, who appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on Friday.  Over the years, many others who have hearing impairments have made significant contributions.  I am rather concerned, as recently reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>by Donal O'Keeffe, that a survey by the National Disability Authority of a range State agencies found that 32%, or one third, of all public bodies were not aware of the Act and a further 20% were not aware of their responsibilities.  Of the country's 16 education and training boards, only four responded to the NDA's survey.  </p><p>Many tributes were paid in this House in April after we heard Andrew Geary talk about his son Callum to Ryan Tubridy.  People could understand the passion Mr. Geary felt about ensuring that his son's rights, including his right to education, were vindicated.  We have to ensure that right through our education system every young person, regardless of disability, has the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential.  That continues to be a challenge.  Given that many public bodies are not fully aware of their obligations under the Act or have not given them priority, I am concerned that there is not a real commitment to the legislation on the part of the State.  It is also a worry to me that the Department of Education is not sufficiently invested to ensure that young deaf people have the necessary interpreters in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->ISL interpreting is highly specialised and, thus, it is wrong that the best the Department can offer is the salary of an SNA.  The role of SNAs is important but in this case we are talking about highly qualified interpreters who are needed for educational purposes, in respect of which they must complete four years of third level education.  We need to see a seriousness behind the supports that are given here.</p><p>How do we measure the success of this legislation?  The success is that every young deaf person will feel that the State is responding and engaging with him or her and is allowing him or her to reach full potential.  I am not convinced that this very noble Act is being taken sufficiently seriously by all arms of the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for discussion and I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for bringing it forward.  When tabling it, the Senator put it forward to the Department of Education, but it was deflected to me in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for disability.  It is important to understand that while I will be giving an answer, the true pathway in terms of response lies within the control of the Department of Education.</p> <p>As the Senator rightly stated, the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 was enacted on 24 December 2017 and commenced by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on 23 December 2020.  I am deeply invested in this legislation.  It was the first legislation that the Minister and I signed together and, for that reason, it is important to me that there is complete follow-through.</p> <p>The Act recognises the rights of users to use ISL as their native language and imposes a duty on all public bodies to provide ISL users with support when availing of statutory entitlements and services.  Under section 10 of the Act, a report was commissioned earlier this year on the operation of the Act.  The National Disability Authority was commissioned to produce that report, a draft of which I have received.  The report notes that further progress is required to fully realise the ambition of the 2017 Act and a number of recommendations are made, which I will consider and pursue, as appropriate.  The draft report is being finalised and I expect to be in a position to lay the completed document before this House in the coming weeks.  I could not publish the draft at the time I received it because it had to go out to all relevant Departments for observations, the reasons for which I totally understand.</p> <p>Enabling students with special educational needs, including those students who are deaf or hard of hearing, to receive an education appropriate to their needs is an ongoing priority for this Government.  Section 5 of the ISL Act requires the Minister for Education to: establish a scheme for the provision of ISL classes for families of children who are deaf; establish a scheme to provide ISL support for children who are attending school and whose primary language is ISL; ensure that there are a sufficient number of placements for the training of teachers of children who are deaf or hard of hearing; and determine the minimum qualifications of teachers of children who are deaf or hard of hearing, where practicable and necessary, in order to ensure the provision of education to children who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p> <p>There is work yet to be done to fully realise the ambition behind the Act.  Nevertheless, there are supports in place for students.  It is important to recognise that elsewhere the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, published a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme on 20 May 2018.  The Department has noted the contents of the report, as required under the Act.  That report recommends that the ISL qualified assistant should be put in place to support deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Act.  I am told that the recommendation with regard to the introduction of the Irish language scheme is under consideration in the Department of Education.  In plain English, the NCSE has identified this need and the Department is aware of it.  This matter has been ongoing since 2017.  We have a number of children throughout the country who need this provision.  Everything that we do in regard to disabilities has to be about inclusion, integration, participation and equality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unfortunately, a cohort of young people are marginalised because we are not allowing them to reach their full potential by providing them with the equipment and an individual to support them in participating.</p></speech>

I know her passion for this area and exactly what she feels.  That passion is something that we need across all elements of government because, with the greatest of respect, the Minister of State cannot do this on her own.  In the education space in particular, this has to be about focusing on the individual young person and what it is we need to put in place to ensure that he or she can reach his or her full potential.  I encourage the Minister of State to continue being ambitious, but the message has to go out clearly to all elements of government that the era of decisions being taken without the interests of those with disabilities being at the top of the agenda has to end.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's comments and I look forward to the publication of the NDA's report, but the message to all Departments, in particular the Department of Education, is that the approach needs to change.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is the best way to answer the question.</p> <p>At the end of the day, we have young people whose parents are their advocates.  We all talk about early intervention through speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, but we also talk about early intervention in education.  Under the access inclusion model, AIM, programme and the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, the young person down in Mayo was able to access an AIM support worker to ensure that that little person could participate in the early years setting.  It was unfortunate that, when he transitioned from the early years setting into education, he did not get the same approach with a person who was qualified in ISL.  However, the person transferred over at the rate of an SNA, which has to do with the other part of the Senator's question.</p> <p>There has to be a full and comprehensive acknowledgment of the role that the ISL interpreter plays in delivering communication within the classroom in support of the teacher.  We should get to the stage where, if there is an ISL interpreter in the classroom, the children can look either way, left or right, to the teacher or the ISL interpreter, to understand what is being taught.  That is a whole-of-class and whole-of-community approach.</p> <p>My colleagues, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are working hard on this matter.  Perhaps it is officialdom that we sometimes need to push harder in the delivery of our ambitions.</p></speech>

I know how committed he is to this area and the work he has been doing.</p> <p>Alarm bells rang through my head when I read a newspaper report on Limerick and the wider Munster area and how there had been a 4% drop in business start-ups.  I will preface my comments by saying that local enterprise offices, LEOs, are doing fantastic work.  They are running a number of training days, encouraging people to get involved and trying to instil confidence in business start-ups.  I served on an old enterprise board for 15 years and am aware of how important LEOs are to businesses, especially small start-ups.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I served on the former enterprise board for 15 years and am very aware of how important LEOs are to businesses, particularly small start-ups.  I am concerned that people are not confident enough to start a business and I want to highlight the supports available through the Department and the LEOs by way of courses and mentoring programmes.  The latter are very important for business start-ups.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.  He visited us in Limerick recently and saw the wonderful work that is going on there.  It is important to have a discussion on this because there are people considering starting businesses but they are lacking in confidence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this very important issue which allows me to focus on start-up businesses in Limerick and all other counties.  It is important to discuss start-up businesses regularly and to highlight the support and encouragement that is available to them.  This Government talks a lot about a jobs-led recovery but for that to happen, we need to support existing businesses to sustain existing jobs and to create more but we also need to encourage a number of start-ups to come through the system every year to keep the supply of jobs going.  This is essential because the only way we can run this country is through people being employed and paying taxes, which in turn pays for all the services.</p> <p>We have a very strong pro-enterprise agenda as a Government which permeates local government, the LEO network, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and other development agencies like Science Foundation Ireland.  It is important to recognise that and to channel support to the companies that need it, particularly the start-ups, and to drive their ambition.  We really want to help people who are thinking of starting a business, to encourage them to take the plunge and go for it.  It can be risky, awkward and difficult.  Starting a business is not an easy route to take but we want to make it as easy as possible by providing supports to assist people to start and to grow a viable business.  Again, I thank Senator Byrne for raising this and for her continued interest in this area.</p> <p>I am aware from a recent visit that Limerick's LEO is very successful, as Senator Byrne pointed out.  I agree with her that the Limerick LEO is doing excellent work.  It is clear that over the last 18 to 20 months as we have dealt with Covid, the staff and teams in our LEOs around the country, as well as the enterprise teams and economic growth teams in various counties really got stuck in.  They were always there for businesses, providing them with support and guidance.  Staff were always available at the end of a phone line or online to help businesses in difficult times.  The business people I meet in Limerick and everywhere else tell me that they really benefited from that support.  That is a relationship that the Department is keen to build on.  The T&aacute;naiste, with whom I work very closely, wants to be able to drive on that relationship and find new ways to reach companies in order to provide them with support through the LEO network.  The Department wants to complement the work the LEOs are doing. </p> <p>Senator Byrne will be aware that LEOs act as a first-stop shop for providing advice, guidance and financial assistance to those wishing to start or grow their own business.  In addition, LEOs can provide information on and referrals to other relevant bodies, including Revenue, Micro Finance Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, LEADER, and Enterprise Ireland, under agreed protocols.  They can also guide businesses through the local government system.  It is important for people who are thinking of starting a business to engage with the LEO from day one.  I have met many business people around the country who have told me that it was a year or two after starting before they went to the LEO for assistance and they regretted that.  The benefits of going to a LEO from day one, as the local first-stop shop, are significant and I would encourage people to do so.  The staff in our LEOs, including Limerick LEO are there to provide impartial advice.  They have worked tirelessly over the past number of years to continue to promote entrepreneurship as a viable employment option.  They always encourage enterprise, including among primary, secondary and third level students..  They regularly run programmes to encourage more young people to think of being entrepreneurs.  </p> <p>It is true to say that the Limerick LEO has seen a small drop off in start-up activity in over the past few years but that requires some context and qualification.  While it is not something that I would be gravely concerned about because of the times we are in, we need to focus on it and work to address it.  The number of potential new entrepreneurs in Limerick remains strong as evidenced by the numbers attending the Start Your Own Business training programme.  This year alone, there have been 221 people to date, which gives Limerick the seventh highest attendance nationally and demonstrates ongoing strong interest in entrepreneurship within the county and offers hope for future growth.  Another measure that the LEOs use as a significant indicator for the level of start-up activity within a county is the number of successful applicants for priming grants.  In this respect, while there has been a decline in priming grants awarded in Limerick, this is part of a national trend with significant declines in the number of grants awarded in many parts of the country.  This is largely due to entrepreneurs being reluctant to commence trading in what is an uncertain economic climate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From my recent visits to the LEOs and Limerick in particular, I can say that there is optimism among the LEOs that there will be strong demand for such grants as the economy begins to return to normality.</p><p>The local enterprise offices will be receiving an additional &euro;2 million in funding in 2022.  This represents an almost 5% increase to drive on with their work.  This investment will allow each of the 31 local enterprise offices to enhance the role they play in driving local and regional development, including the regional enterprise plans and the Look for Local campaigns, which have been extremely successful.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and I have been working on bringing forward the work of the SME task force which identified the foremost challenges and opportunities facing SMEs and entrepreneurs.  The task force was put together by the T&aacute;naiste approximately this time last year.  These include access to finance for SMEs; digital transformation; increasing the number of first-time exporters; enhanced assistance for high-potential businesses; clustering and networks; SME management skills; reducing the regulatory burden on SMEs; delivery of a single portal for business information and assistance; ensuring comprehensive enterprise agency coverage for SMEs; and promoting SME participation in public procurement.  We will work with the LEOs and other stakeholders to drive the implementation of this policy agenda and actions in these key areas during 2022.  I look forward to having plenty of discussions in this House with Senator Maria Byrne and others as well.</p><p>It is also important to note that Limerick can look to its very vibrant multinational sector for employment and growth and, thankfully, many of these businesses were among the least affected by the pandemic.  Many budding entrepreneurs are working with those companies already.  Often, when the employment market is strong and there is international uncertainty as a result of issues, for example, with the supply chain or inflation, potential entrepreneurs tend to play it safe and stay in employment, rather than taking the risk of starting a business.  Employers are doing everything they can to keep them because they are also under pressure to source all the staff they need.</p></speech>

I agree that we have had significant expansion of multinationals and that employers are trying to keep experienced employees in their employment.  I would like to get the message out about all the support that is available.  I accept the times are uncertain, but I encourage people to have faith in themselves and to get out there.  There are many capable people that have come through the LEOs and participated in the many start-up courses.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to one area where there is a bit of uncertainty and I ask him to keep an eye on it.  I refer to the hospitality and hotel industry.  Given staff shortages, some establishments find it very difficult to keep going.  This is an area the Minister of State could possibly examine in terms of his remit.  I thank him for highlighting all the supports that are available.  I look forward to working with him in the future.</p></speech>

It is important that we have such conversations.  She touched on some of the programmes that are offered through LEOs.  I forgot to mention in my earlier contribution the success of the mentoring programme.  It is working extremely well in Limerick too.  I know there is a strong panel of mentors there and I thank them for their efforts.</p> <p>It is important that if entrepreneurs are thinking of starting their own business back themselves and have the confidence to take a chance.  They should engage with the LEOs to give an extra layer of security, back the confidence and put them in a stronger position.  They can find out what programmes will suit them at different stages of their journey.  As well as the mentoring programme being key, the start your own business programme is also extremely important.  The lean for micro programme is operated through the LEOs as well to help make businesses that are up and running more cost-effective and also to minimise any waste in how a company is run and ensure people run companies to the best of their ability and sustain the competition.</p> <p>Various grants are available to businesses that are in manufacturing or internationally traded services.  The trading online voucher is key and has been very successful.  Applications increased by more than 1,000% in nearly every county, including Limerick in the past year.  We want to build on that success.  We will be having more conversations with LEO clients about digital supports and supports for going green and taking on climate change as well.  There is much interest in that regard.  Microfinance Ireland is another useful resource.  There is access to high potential start-up programme through LEOs and Enterprise Ireland.  A very strong relationship is developing between LEOs and Enterprise Ireland.  They are working very well together and businesses are growing, expanding and moving from one to the other as well.  There is a lot of opportunity in that regard.</p> <p>In Limerick, access to the educational facilities is key, given the work that can happen through the New Frontiers entrepreneurship development programme in conjunction with the education stakeholders.  There is a lot of opportunity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of the companies I have met around Limerick have benefitted from that involvement in the education system, the combination of education and enterprise supports and working together as well.  The key to all that is the local authorities coming together to make it happen.  That will also be reflected in the regional enterprise plans coming through.  There are massive plans for the area the Senator is covering, comprising counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary.  There are many issues there.</p><p>I am conscious it is a difficult time.  The Senator mentioned the hospitality sector.  That sector and many others are under pressure now between trying to keep staff through a difficult time and finding enough staff when they have the business.  We will work directly with that sector in the weeks and months ahead to get it through this difficult time and hopefully get back to a very sound, solid footing.</p></speech>

Professor Eogan was widely regarded as one of the leading archaeologists of his generation.  He is perhaps best known for his work in Knowth.  He was born Nobber, County Meath, and was always proud of his Meath origins, and a proud GAA fan.  Meath was proud of him, and in 2016 the George Eogan Cultural and Heritage Centre was opened in the county, named in his honour.</p> <p>He had a long and distinguished academic career and was a notable scholar of Bronze Age Europe.  It would be difficult to list the numerous honours he received or the books and journals in which he was published.  He will also be remembered as a teacher and a mentor.  His leadership and commitment to Irish archaeology was recognised by his appointment to Seanad &Eacute;ireann by An Taoiseach in 1987.  A quick perusal of Seanad debates during his time shows his contributions in areas such as education and national heritage, and also in topics as diverse as planning, agriculture, human rights and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>At this sad time, my thoughts are with his family.  On behalf of the House, I wish to convey my sincere sympathies to his wife, Fiona, and his children, James, Maeve, Deirdre and Cl&iacute;ona, and to his extended family and friends on their said loss.

We accept the Order of Business as outlined.</p><p>This is disability week.  It is important that we recognise and acknowledge that.  One way we can do that is by wearing purple.  My own county, Kildare, has a number of events this week.  Significant buildings around the county are being lit up and 250 disability network flags are being flown.  It is also putting much emphasis on the Just a Minute card, or JAM card, so that if people are suffering in some way when trying to make themselves understood, being able to show this allows the person who is receiving the card to have a little extra patience and understanding.  It is important.</p><p>I commend Limerick City Council.  I heard on the radio this morning that it has launched an application for those who have wheelchair accessible vehicles.  We all know how difficult it is when driving around cities and towns, trying to find a parking space.  Imagine trying to find a space that is wheelchair accessible.  It is really difficult.  It is a wonderful initiative.  I express the hope that other councils can take this up.  People can download this application and immediately know where there is an available parking space for those who have a wheelchair accessible vehicle.</p><p>Yesterday, I took part in a walkability survey in Rathangan.  It was associated with disability week.  It was done with transition year students.  We walked around our town and looked at spaces that are barely accessible for those who are able-bodied.  We all acknowledge the importance of walking or cycling to school, but we have to make sure that those routes are safe, both for those with disabilities and those who are fully abled.  I commend the transition year students and their teachers on the project that they have undertaken.  We will present that to Kildare County Council along with local councillor, Anne Connolly.</p><p>I want to mention two other areas.  It was with dismay that I read an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i>about an Irishman and his British husband who live in England.  They have two children.  They received a parental order under British law, which is recognised in Ireland, but the Department of Foreign Affairs refuses to grant their son, who was born through surrogacy, an Irish passport.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 states that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if, at the time of his or her birth, either parent is an Irish citizen.  Their marriage is recognised by our law and the parental order, but while this married couple and their two children are part of a constitutional family, recognised by Irish law, and they absolutely should have a right to pass citizenship onto their children, this has not been agreed to.  In this day and age, it is a disgrace and we need to call it out.</p><p>The Connecting Ireland initiative is important for our rural areas.  There is a new plan for a connection from Athy to Rathangan.  It is important that we extend that to Allenwood.  The blueway goes through Allenwood and Rathangan, and through Lullymore heritage park, which we are proud of.  Many people from Rathangan work there.  Some work in community employment schemes.  If they do not drive, they have to get taxis.  The Connecting Ireland initiative needs to be extended.</p></speech>

ParkMagic, along with the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland, launched its app this morning and Limerick City and County Council is the first local authority to avail of it.  A number of service users have used the app and they stated that when they come into town they have to plan their journey because sometimes when they get to the disabled parking space there is a car in it.  It is a message to all to make sure not to park in a disabled parking space.  A little chip has been now put into the parking spaces and it is updated in real time on the app.  I pay tribute to ParkMagic because it is a Limerick company that has worked with the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland on this.  It is something the Department should look at rolling out right across the country.  One disabled driver said that sometimes they have had to return home because there is a limited number of disabled parking spaces.  The Leader might support a letter to the Minister for Transport looking for that to be rolled out across all local authority areas.</p> <p>A young neighbour of mine, Clodagh Bennett, is an 18-year-old student in St. Pat's in Thurles.  She is training to be a teacher but she also recently became Munster Young Carer of the Year.  She helps with the care of her three siblings, who all have issues of their own.  One or two of them have mental health issues and all are on the spectrum.  What that young girl does for her three siblings is to be commended.  We hear of so many people who are helping their family members by being carers.  It is a great achievement.  She is going to college at the same time as helping out with her family so there is great credit due to her.  I compliment her and congratulate her for being named as Munster Young Carer of the Year.</p></speech>

What a great tradition and achievement.  It is a new start and a restart for the people of Barbados and I wish them well.</p><p>I raise the issue of Galway County Council's funding crisis.  A decision to postpone the budget in Galway was made yesterday.  There is a serious crisis as regards local government and the Leader will be aware that this is an issue right across the country.  Senators Kyne, Crowe and others have continuously raised this issue and the need for a debate on local government in this House.  All municipal districts in Galway County Council rejected their proposed funding allocations for 2022.  In an effort to demonstrate their commitment and reject what has been proposed, the councillors are clearly seeking to send a clear message to the Government that they are unhappy.  There is a general view that the funding for Galway County Council is far short of what is required and they are not getting the same cut of the deal as others.  Cynics would suggest this is part of a bigger plan in the Custom House to force a merger of the two councils.  I am not necessarily saying that is the case but that is one view down in the council so there is an issue there.</p><p>I thank the Leader for bringing forward the debate this afternoon on horticultural peat.

Professor Eogan was a remarkable man.  He only spent two years in the Seanad.  His nomination, by C.J. Haughey, was a wise one.

His name is John Martyn, a great Scottish folk singer.  Approximately 50 years ago, he famously wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	Some of us live like princes<br /><br />Some of us live like queens<br /><br />Most of us live just like me<br /><br />And we don&rsquo;t know what it means<br /><br />To take our place in one world </blockquote> <p>His words come to mind because, as colleagues will know, there is a protest taking place outside Leinster House as we speak.  I will join it after I have spoken.  I will return for the Leader's response.  The protest relates to the Government's continued failure to endorse a waiver for the intellectual property rights in respect of Covid vaccines.  I want to say this in a way that is not argumentative, but I am completely at a loss as to why the Government continues to side with the rest of the EU in actively blocking a waiver in respect of these vaccines.  With the advent of the latest variant, we know just how crucial it is that the whole world gets vaccinated.  We know that no one is safe until everyone is safe, yet the fact is the Government, at least at Cabinet level, is consistently backing up the EU position of blocking a waiver of intellectual property rights.</p><p>Two things happen when I raise this issue.  The first is that most people on the Government benches agree with me and state that something should be done.  The second is that they point out the good work the Government is doing in the context of COVAX and so on, and that is important.However, let us be clear that for as long as the Government sides with big pharma against the people of the world, there is something fundamentally wrong.  It lacks a moral compass.  There is no justifiable argument for not waiving those intellectual property rights.</p><p>Let us bear in mind that just 2% of people in Africa are vaccinated.  While we are getting our boosters - I am fortunate enough to be getting mine on Friday - I cannot help thinking there is something fundamentally wrong.  At times, all Senators gather together to agree on key subjects, such as on Covid to some degree, for example, but particularly on this issue.  I am minded to table a motion in the House to get all-party support because there is no way any of us, regardless of political party, should tolerate the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste continuing to side against the people of the world.  The World Trade Organization is holding talks on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, this week.  Unfortunately, unless something fundamental changes, the Taoiseach and the Government are once again going to side with big pharma to ensure its profits get bigger while people are denied vaccines.  Surely  to God, all of us should do something now to make sure that does not happen.</p></speech>

Members will have to excuse me as I am recovering from a cold - not Covid - and my voice is not great today.  I raise the issue of the loophole in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021 that allows landlords who have not previously increased rent to compound it over recent years.  We are living in a time when the livelihoods of many people have been impacted by job losses, the stop-starting of hospitality and the Covid pandemic.  Could the Leader imagine the uproar if mortgages were increased by this amount?  There have already been rental increases in every county, with an increase of more than 7% nationwide.  However, some counties have been particularly affected.  There have been rises of 17.3% in Limerick, 15.5% in Kilkenny, 16.1% in Clare and 11.8% in Mayo.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to ensure that if we bring in rental limitations, for example, linked to the consumer price index, or 2%, that is exactly what it is and that it is not allowed to be increased beyond that or compounded.</p><p>I want to raise the issue of the TRIPS waiver.  We all sat around in this House and congratulated Ireland on getting a seat on the UN Security Council.  I often wonder why we have influence in the EU and a seat on the UN Security Council if do not to use our influence, as a small country, to advocate for things like the TRIPS waiver, which would be very similar to what we did, as a country, for the HIV epidemic.  As Senator Davitt outlined, this is the week for us to do so.  This is the week to put pressure on our EU partners for a TRIPS waiver because, as we have seen with the variants, we are not safe until everybody is safe.  It is up to us to make sure that people in the global south are as protected as we are as we await the roll out of the booster programme.</p><p>I wish to raise the issue of safe access zones, which I raised with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, in this House.  I would like him to confirm that people who travel for abortions and terminations are exempt under the Covid legislation.  He would not confirm that in this House even though it is clear in the legislation.  Senator Gavan offered to give him the time to confirm that.  However, the Cabinet has just agreed that people will get commercial antigen tests, whether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated, when they come into Ireland.  An abortion is an essential medical procedure.  Most people travel after 12 weeks, so it is going to be a surgical abortion for people.  People will be in a facility from early in the morning until the afternoon and you do not want people running around London, Manchester or Liverpool seeking commercial tests and adding to their expense.  The Minister for Health needs to come in here and confirm the exemption.  He has refused to do so for the whole of the pandemic.  I clearly asked him to do so in this House and Senator Gavan offered to give him time.  There are new rules being introduced for travel, so the Minister for Health needs to confirm that this is exempt under the legislation.</p></speech>

Huge congratulations are due to it and its employees.  It employs nearly 2,500 people in Ireland and salaries and pension costs account for some &euro;377 million.  That is a huge and welcome investment in this country.  The average wage for an employee in the company is &euro;168,000, so it is a huge asset to the country.  What it also highlights is that social media giants like Facebook dwarf the traditional media in this country and, indeed, the revenue traditional media would have had as well.</p> <p>My point is that the traditional media is bound by exceptionally stringent rules in terms of libel, the Press Council of Ireland and what they can or cannot publish.  That is not the same for these companies that now make billions of euro in our country.  Those of us who are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media have completed pre-legislative scrutiny of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  Last month, we published our recommendations that included the introduction of a content levy, which will be reinvested in original Irish content.  When one considers the massive revenue earned by Facebook and other social media giants, the contribution made to our own would be minimal but it would mean a hell of a lot.  We have to see action on this matter.</p> <p>This Bill was supposed to be with us before the summer and with the future of media commission as well by the summer. We are not going to have the Bill in the House before Christmas.  These guys move at a pace that leaves the legislative framework behind.  There is no legislative framework at the moment.  We have attempted to put that in place and the Bill must come before us.  The chairman of the committee, Deputy Niamh Smyth, and the members of the committee, including Senator Malcolm Byrne, have done a significant amount of work in bringing a huge swathe of media and other organisations before our committee.  We need to see the Bill introduced.  I implore the Leader to ask the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, about the legislation because when one considers the amount of money that is earned by these giants, which are not subject to the same stringent rules as observed by traditional media in this country, we need to see action in this sphere.</p></speech>

Almost 95% of our population is now fully vaccinated.  Great credit is due to all the staff who have worked in the various vaccination centres, to the HSE and to the public, who bought into the factual situation that vaccines save lives and reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19.  However, I was disappointed to read a report in today's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>that staff have been let go from the vaccination centres in recent months.  Those centres are now struggling to get staff to come back to work.  Everyone knew there was going to be a booster programme.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, as long as ago as last summer, stated that there would be a booster programme.  We are now struggling to meet the demand for booster vaccines because we cannot get the staff.  The Minister needs to come into the House and address that issue.  He must direct the HSE to keep the staff in the vaccination centres until the pandemic is over.</p><p>Getting booster vaccines into people's arms is now a national crisis.  In my home town, there are two pharmacies that do not open on Sundays.  We should be doing everything.  We should be paying pharmacists to give the booster vaccines, particularly in rural areas where pharmacies close on Sundays.  That should be done.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, should be taken up on his offer of the use of the Defence Forces to give booster vaccines.  The quicker we get our population vaccinated with booster shots, the better, and the more lives we will save.  I do not think enough is being done to facilitate the booster vaccine.  We saw the queues at Citywest, where people were queuing for five hours.  That was replicated in other centres around the country.  There is no need for it.  We need to get in people who are skilled and able to give vaccines.  It is simple.  We urgently need to put all of the nation's resources into dealing with this problem.</p></speech>

I have raised this issue in the House on a number of occasions.  Senator Moynihan and others have rightly made the point that until everybody on this planet is safe, nobody is safe.  Senator Conway was correct when he said it is great that we have a vaccination rate of 95% and the average within the European Union is now approximately 70%.  However, only 7% of those in low-income countries have received one dose of a vaccine.  Ireland and the European Union are facing a test of global solidarity and it is important that we take strong action.</p> <p>I raise the issue of accessibility to our beaches.  I know the Leader is very familiar with the beaches of County Wexford.  Beaches should be accessible to as many people as possible but, unfortunately, that is not the case for many wheelchair users.  There have been some strides to ensure our beaches are accessible and measures have been introduced to allow that.  A young man in County Wexford, Mr. Matthew McGrath, is a teenager who is a wheelchair user.  He has launched a campaign to ensure a lot more of our beaches are accessible, focusing on north Wexford.  We need a national approach to how we make our national amenities around the country accessible to everybody.  I am certainly strongly supporting Mr. McGrath's campaign.  There is a need for a whole-of-government to look at our beaches, wonderful assets that they are, and how we can use them.</p></speech>

In particular, I want a debate about the foreign affairs policy of the European Union regarding the secret prisons in Libya that are keeping migrants out of the European Union.  A number of interesting articles have been published by journalists with the Outlaw Ocean Project at <i>The New Yorker</i>and on NBC about the European Union funding Libya in the context of the Libyan coast guard preventing migrants coming to the European Union.  I will quote an article written for <i>The New Yorker</i>by Mr. Ian Urbina and published yesterday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The headline is "The Secretive Prisons That Keep Migrants Out of Europe".  It continues, and I am quoting directly, "Tired of migrants arriving from Africa, the [European Union] has created a shadow immigration system that captures them before they reach its shores, and sends them to brutal Libyan detention centres run by militias."  By any stretch of imagination, if that is even partly true it is absolutely awful.  If we learn nothing from the events of the English Channel, where 27 people were killed last week, then as members of the European Union, as Members of this House, we have a duty to climate migrants in particular, as well as to people who are fleeing their own countries to come to the European Union to be able to have a voice in our Parliament but also at European Commission and European Parliament level.  It is important that we stand up and be counted.  It is equally imperative that we hold those at European Union level, whether it is the Council of Ministers, the Commission or the Parliament, accountable for the actions.  I am asking respectfully that we would have a debate on this particular issue because it is worrying.  I commend the journalist of the Outlaw Ocean Project, some of whom have been held in captivity and thankfully in some cases released.  People have died in connection with this issue.  I urge Members to read this series of articles.  I will come back to this.  One of the journalists working for this organisation is a past pupil of mine.  I highly value his integrity and principles.  As Members, we have an obligation to stand up and hold those at European Council level and Commission level accountable. </p></speech>

As I have spoken on the record in this regard on the Order of Business in the convention centre in the past, I will not use my time on it today.  I have not spoken on Order of Business since the Taoiseach was with us.  I thought the elephant in the room was the fact that the Taoiseach did not give a response on the issue of Seanad reform.  I intend to write to him but I ask that the Leader would also write to him on behalf of the House asking for a response to the Senators who raised Seanad reform on the record that day.  There have been 13 separate reports on Seanad reform.  I was part of the Seanad reform implementation group of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in the previous Seanad.  We worked hard to produce a report and a Bill, which is on the table in this House.  I ask the Leader whether she will support that Bill.</p> <p>I was not here last week when the issue of secretarial assistants' pay was raised.  I wish to put my support for that on record.  I have spoken on the issue in the past.  The starting pay, as we all know, is &euro;11.75 per hour but the living wage is &euro;12.90 per hour.  It takes 18 years to climb the scale.  We know secretarial assistants do much the same job as parliamentary assistants, who are on a starting salary of &euro;41,000.  Senator Kyne dealt with this on the Order of Business last week.  I would welcome the Leader's response to it.  We have a collective responsibility to deliver for secretarial assistants.  In regard to a family-friendly parliament, recommendation 12 of the Ceann Comhairle's forum was that it "recommends a review of the pay scales and role profiles for Secretarial Assistants to increase the starting salary, in light of the comparisons to be drawn with the salaries and role profile of Parliamentary Assistants".  One focus of that was the fact that many secretarial assistants, SAs, go on to serve as public representatives as well.  </p></speech>

I am happy to send a letter to the Taoiseach.  I thought he did actually respond that evening but maybe that was wishful thinking on my part.  I will send a letter and will send a copy of it to Senator Warfield.  It was probably on Wednesday last week that the pay and conditions of SAs was discussed-----</p></speech>

What I think is bizarre, given the restrictions that Senators must operate under, is I am not sure why we have a secretarial assistant.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all know that the secretarial assistants to our D&aacute;il colleagues do all of the constituency work.  Most of us do not have constituencies.  It is the job of Senators to scrutinise and be that second pair of eyes to enhance and embellish legislation that is brought forward, whether Private Members' Bills or Government Bills.  Senator Warfield is correct that what our secretarial assistants do is 100% parliamentary business work.  Therefore, in trying to get the salary scales for them increased, which is probably very true for our D&aacute;il colleagues too, we are fighting the wrong argument.  We should be seeking to have secretarial assistants to Senators redefined as personal assistants.  We need to work together and collectively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the commission to make sure that campaign does not die, or that is not dampened down in the way it has been sought to be dampened down in the past couple of months.</p><p>I support the call by Senators Gavan, Malcolm Byrne and Rebecca Moynihan for a TRIPS waiver.  Senator Gavan made the very good suggestion that he should draft a motion with regard to TRIPS waivers to be put before this House for debate to see if we can collectively arrive at a position that would call not just on the Government but on the European Commission to change their positions.  As stated very clearly by Dr. Michael Ryan, and by Dr. Navarro on weekend radio, unless the world is safe, nobody is safe.  The hysteria, which has been media driven in terms of the overdrive in the media on Thursday and Friday with regard to the variant, shows that we need to act now to have citizens worldwide inoculated.  Otherwise, we will still be talking about the next level of variants this time next year.  </p><p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on foreign policy, particularly with regard to the EU and the treatment of migrants.  I will arrange that debate as quickly as I can because I think some of the indications, particularly on the issues between Belarus and Poland and France and the United Kingdom, and the evidence uncovered in the past couple of weeks leave an awful lot to be desired with regard to the humanity and the way we would treat people, particularly other Europeans.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about the accessibility to beaches and not just in County Wexford, which I love.  He spoke about a young man named Matthew McGrath.  The Senator is dead right; the campaign should be a national one.  I am happy to write to the Minister to ask if he will support Matthew McGrath and to see if we can get that campaign going up and down the country.</p><p>Senator Conway spoke about the vaccination programme and the success we have enjoyed to date.  He is correct to highlight the issue of staff being let go, the most prominent person being Professor Brian MacCraith, when we all knew and were expecting a bonus, booster or third vaccine.  The fact that we are now looking for new swabbers and people to administer the vaccinations seems a little bizarre.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue this morning.  I will bring his suggestion with regard to rural pharmacies to the attention of the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

I will raise it with the Minister and the Department today and come back to the Senator on it.</p> <p>Senator Moynihan raised the TRIPS waiver and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021.  I read with interest the reports in this morning's papers.  I do not have an answer to the questions and queries she raised, but I will raise them and come back to her.  </p> <p>Senator Gavan, as I mentioned, raised the TRIPS waiver.  Senator Boyhan spoke about the welcome news from Barbados.  The Galway County Council funding crisis came to the attention of all of us yesterday.  I have submitted a request for a debate on local government funding.  I am waiting for the Minister to come back to me with a date.  As soon as I have that, a debate will be scheduled.</p> <p>Senators Maria Byrne and O'Loughlin spoke about this week being disability week.  I am attempting to have a debate arranged with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, even though she was with us last week.  I will do my best to try to have that debate this week.  If it cannot happen this week, I will arrange for it to happen as quickly as I can.  It is incumbent on all of us to highlight, not only this week but particularly this week, the things that we take for granted that people who have disabilities have to deal with every week.  Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the company, ParkMagic.  It is an ingenious idea.  We talk here frequently about the difficulties faced by people who have disabilities with regard to public transport.  I do not think we have ever talked about public parking.  In one incident involving a lady in Skerries, where the parking is on-street and there is often no parking space available to her, the council has refused to give her a designated parking space.  She cannot walk any more than 5 m from her car to her house.  She comes every day and the car parking spaces outside her home are taken.  As able-bodied people, we take an awful lot for granted.  We do not really understand or appreciate what people who have disabilities have to go through.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to see through their eyes and initiatives should be supported.

I wish to put on the record of the House that drafting this Bill for the 35 members of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael was a last resort to solving this problem, which, I believe, has been kicked down the road for far too long.  What is in this Bill is a workable solution for an industry in crisis.  The horticultural sector is facing an enormous crisis caused by a shortage of supply.  By no choice of their own, those in the sector have been forced to import a degraded quality of peat at a much higher price, which, ultimately, will put some of them out of business.  Some 17,000 livelihoods depend on this industry.  Hundreds of thousands of households depend on the produce created and grown by the industry.  The growers and nurseries up and down the country need a solution or else they will simply go out of business and thousands of jobs will be lost.</p><p>This Bill was described the other day by colleagues as giving false hope to growers.  It was described as disingenuous.  Using horticultural growers as collateral damage while taking an opportunity to have a go at big industry is disingenuous.  That will offer little or no hope.  The horticultural industry does not have time for political games; it needs solutions.  It needed them months ago.  We are introducing this Bill in an attempt to give the Government, which has now been <i>in situ</i>for almost 18 months, an opportunity to do what should have been done two or three years ago by the previous Government.  This Government has an opportunity to do what is right for the horticultural industry and to recognise that it needs a medium in which to grow its products.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It needs that medium to come from Ireland.  We need a derogation and a just transition but, more importantly, what we need is to put our money where our mouth is to resource the replacement for peat that is needed.  Assigning a young PhD student to that project certainly does not show serious intent.</p><p>As politicians we need to supply people with solutions.  Sitting on the working group report, as has happened for the last couple of months, is not sustainable.  For this reason, I genuinely welcome the commitment given to the House yesterday that the Minister will bring to Cabinet next Tuesday the working group report and its recommendations, as well as the resolutions provided by the nine Ministers from all parties in this coalition Government, which relate to the three Departments responsible for fixing this problem.  We are adjourning the debate after 90 minutes as otherwise we would otherwise have to put the legislation to a vote.  The outcome could have been very different today with regard to the 35 Government Senators who brought this issue to a head because we did not feel it was being dealt with.</p><p>I will address what is in the programme for Government with regard to horticulture.  We agreed in the joint programme for Government that we would review the supports available to the horticultural sector, grow and expand the businesses in this sector supplying our domestic and international markets, invest in the promotion of Irish horticultural products and enhance the capital investment available to horticulture producers.  What I want to know is what it is that is giving false hope to this industry.  Is it the lack of action by the Government over the past 18 months on the commitments in the programme for Government?  This Bill genuinely seeks to find a solution for an industry in crisis, one on which 17,000 livelihoods depend.  </p><p>Since the introduction of this Bill last Tuesday, the people who are against it have sought to make it something completely other than what it is.  It is not about exporting peat, nor is it about using peat for anything other than horticultural practices.  The main argument, which is made without explanation and which the Government is apparently making today also, is that the Bill contravenes EU legislation.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to give us an explanation.  EU law requires assessment before consent to be given for certain projects involving peat extraction for horticulture under both the environment impact assessment directive and the habitats directive.  European law is not, as some people suggested over the weekend, prescriptive about whether the necessary assessment is completed under the Planning and Development Act or the Licensing Act.  In 2019 the State considered licensing more appropriate.  The Planning and Development Act, the statutory instrument setting out the executive development regulations and the European Union statutory instrument were introduced by the then Minister.  We are all well aware that those statutory instruments have been overturned by the High Court and the Supreme Court on the basis that they are not suitable instruments for doing what we want to do in Ireland, namely, have a just transition for the people who produce our food.  European law, which has been stood up by the Supreme Court, prescribes that we must do what was attempted in the two statutory instruments in primary legislation.  That primary legislation is this Bill.  Unless really viable information is brought to us by the Government on behalf of the Attorney General as to why this Bill contravenes EU law, I will find it very difficult to see it as anything other than another obstruction to finding a solution for this problem.</p><p>Over the weekend, our arguments were conflated with the issue of exports, and peat has left this country in the past nine or ten months.  This is not about exports for reasons other than horticulture.  There is no escaping the fact that we started importing for horticulture in September of this year.  Unless we do something to produce Irish peat for Irish producers, we will have to continue importing peat from Sri Lanka, Latvia and wherever else we can get our hands on it.  Having large shipments with hundreds of trucks bringing these products to different places in the country is not sustainable. </p><p>Despite the argument that seems to have been created over the past week, this is not about fuel or exporting.  It is about taking a very small amount of the peat that could be produced in this country to provide for an Irish market that produces food for Irish consumers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The fact that we have ignored this issue, or not found a resolution to it since the SIs were overturned in 2019, which is effectively nearly three years ago, tells us that the Government and, probably, the previous Government did not see this as the crisis that the 17,000 workers who rely on their income week in and week out off the back of this industry tell us that it is.  </p><p>I am happy to pull in my horns today.  It is a pity that we on the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il benches had to show our horns in the first instance to try to get this issue resolved.  We are happy to stall the Bill today on the basis that the Government will commit to doing what it said yesterday it would do, that is, bring the working group report to Cabinet next week, publish it and, more important, publish the recommendations and make available the resources that will fix this supply issue and fix it in the very short term.  Otherwise, we will find ourselves back here in a short number of weeks having a vote on this Bill that might not end in a way that will keep us all happy.</p><p>The people that I want to keep happy are the people who elect all of us to this House and the other House.  For a long time, we have forgotten that we are supposed to be on the side of the people we represent.  These people need us to provide a solution for them so they can continue to provide product for the Irish market.  I hope that the Minister of State, in his response with regard to the plans for the next couple of weeks, will also provide a just solution and Irish peat for Irish producers so that they an continue to provide us with the best quality food, as they have been doing for generations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#LL00200"><p>I am happy to second the Leader's proposal with regard to this important legislation.  We have brought forward legislation that we believe will play an important part in trying to fix a problem that needs to be addressed.  Within the horticulture industry, 17,000 people are affected by this issue.  We need to have movement and to make sure that these people have a viable income and that their families can survive.</p> <p>Last night, I spoke at an IFA meeting close to my home town, which was attended by over 100 people.  Rarely in my entire life have I seen such despondency in a room.  Never has the farming community been so berated in so many ways.  There were young farmers talking about walking away from farming and having no more to do with the land because of what is happening in agriculture.  This stuck with me today on my way here from Cork.  There are major changes here in terms of CAP reform and nitrates action plans.  This debate is about the licensing of peat in order that we can have a horticulture industry that will be viable going forward.  We need a more plugged-in approach to what is happening on the ground when it comes to the agricultural community.  It is important to acknowledge that this flux in the horticultural community has been there since 2019. </p> <p>In many ways we have failed to grasp the nettle and bring forward appropriate primary legislation that would resolve this issue.  Appropriate primary legislation has come forward this afternoon.  It is exactly what we need on the ground.  We could potentially have an economic, if not a food security, crisis going forward because of the way agriculture is going and the feeling within the agriculture community that it is better to walk away from it.  That is a huge issue for society and a massive issue for Government.  I do not think that has been realised.  It certainly is not being dealt with.  The situation is compounded by commentary in the media, with some MEPs saying that there should be no access to credit for farmers.  That is degrading the farming community to a level which is beyond belief.  It is not appropriate.  We need to start speaking up our agricultural community, instead of speaking it down.  </p> <p>This Bill is brought forward to try to give some hope to the farming community when it comes to horticulture.  Horticulture is a vibrant part of our society.  It is something we always take pride in.  It brings so much to our economy.  It provides 17,000 jobs.  Horticulture is in almost every parish in our communities.  We are now saying that owing to a shortage of peat it must be imported from the Baltic states or Sri Lanka.  One-to-one that is exceptionally hard to explain.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In fact, it is impossible to explain.  It is because of that issue that we need to introduce this primary legislation.</p><p>We have spoken about European law and what is required.  The Leader has clarified that issue and that the proposed primary legislation is appropriate for providing what is required.  It moves away from the statutory instrument, which was thrown out by the courts because it was not strong enough.</p><p>We are trying to give these people a future.  We are trying to ensure that the small degree of peat extraction they have been doing for generations can continue.  Otherwise, we will see something that we should be proud of vanishing from the face of the Earth.  That is not appropriate.  We know that technology will play a large part in finding the solution, but we also know that it could take a decade for that to happen.  That is the evidence that we on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine have received.  It could take anything up to a decade for the so-called futuristic product that we have talked about to be online.  A great deal of research is badly needed if we are to get to where we need to be, but there is no product at the moment that can sustainably do what is already being done.</p><p>We must discuss publishing the report's recommendations.  It has been a bugbear for many people that we put taxpayers' money into the working group's report and recommendations and they have not been published yet.  I welcome that the report's publication will be announced next week.  That is an important step because, without publication, we would be hammering ourselves against a haystack.  It would make no sense.  We are going nowhere without publication.  With the report's publication, though, we will be able to see what the recommendations are, what is required and how the industry is to go forward.  Until it is published, though, we will in many ways be in the dark.  The publication of the report is an important step forward for the industry.</p><p>I have met the industry several times.  It is amazing to think that this industry of all industries has been importing a natural product from a Baltic state to, in the industry's opinion, stay alive since last September.  If there was a suitable product in Ireland, surely the industry would use it.  That would be the normal course of action.  There is not a suitable product, though, so the industry has to import.</p><p>Last night's meeting rattled me because I had never seen so many young people in a hall.  Confidence has drained out of the industry.  Peat and forestry were mentioned.  They are core industries and we need them to have futures.  We must have a future for our young people in agriculture but they do not have that future at the moment, nor will they until we give clear guidance on how we are going to deliver it.  I hope that this debate is the start of the process.  We need clarity and a roadmap and we need to show how this industry and the families involved can survive.  Unfortunately, without that clarity and roadmap, those families will leave the land.  What I heard about at last night's meeting will happen in every parish around Ireland.  Young families and young people will leave farming because the Government failed to provide a roadmap.</p><p>These are challenging times and we need to find a solution to the challenges.  The farming community is up to that job, but the only way it can succeed is if we have the roadmap.  I hope that the Bill is the start of that process.</p></speech>

I also thank the Leader, Senator Gallagher and all the other Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Senators who signed this important Bill.  From listening to the Leader, I got a sense of the urgency and frustration around the Bill.</p> <p>I have worked in the horticulture business all of my life.  I worked in the research centre in Kinsealy.  Thirty years ago, people were looking at alternatives in the casing of mushrooms.  By the way, a mushroom is not a vegetable or a fruit.  It is a fungus, and how fungi are treated, grown and nurtured is special.  In terms of the sustainability of the mushroom sector, I pay tribute to the Monaghan Deputies and Senators who have advocated strongly for the mushroom sector in Monaghan and the wider Border region, with employers operating in the area North and South.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The mushroom industry in Monaghan in particular has been enormously successful.  Let us not forget that we export mushrooms to Britain and France, where they are a valued and valuable agrifood crop.  This is about jobs.  The programme for Government, a tripartite agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Minister of State's own party, the Green Party, talks about growing the horticultural sector and about sustainability in the agrifood sector.  This sector, more than any other, relies on milled peat and while there are certain bogs that will never be remediated, some bogs may be able to facilitate some additional milling of peat.  I am in favour of saving our bogs; we are all in favour of that.  This is not an issue of "them" or "us".  This is about a just transition.  I think of workers in Kildare, Laois, Offaly and Monaghan that have relied on this industry and that still have no jobs, despite many promises.  There is a transition, a plan and a vision but many people have experienced a drop in income.  We have a proud mushroom sector that is heavily reliant on peat.  I make the case for the mushroom sector over and above the nursery stock sector or other areas of horticulture and forestry because they can get on with loam and other new and innovative materials that can be used for growing plants.  We must make a special case for the mushroom sector and we must sustain this industry, particularly in view of where it operates, in the Border and midlands regions.  These are two areas that really need jobs.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to publish the report as soon as possible.  I am not sure it would be published next week were it not for the fact that this Bill is before the House today.  I welcome the fact that he is going to publish it.  I also call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as part of a collective Government, to play his part.  The Minister is constantly before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss sustainability, fairness and a just transition.  This Bill addresses many of those issues.  There is no suggestion that the Bill is proposing a free-for-all in milling.  Rather, it proposes that the EPA would monitor milling and harvesting on select bogs under very strict criteria.  I support this industry and believe it is vital that everyone supports it.  This Bill has given a renewed impetus and has forced the Government to focus on this issue and deliver for the people affected.  In that sense, it is a really important Bill which I will support.  I had to think about it, long and hard, but to be fair to the communities that are relying on peat and the horticultural sector, we need to support it.  </p><p>It is also important that an economic impact assessment is carried out on the cumulative economic effect on sales, exports and employment associated with peat and the horticultural sector.  That is valid and should happen.  I do not suggest that as an option for delay because we have a peat crisis in this country right now.  The Minister of State and his party are focusing on small artisan growers and producers of organic food, which must also be taken into account.  What is peat?  It is neutral, as the Minister of State knows.  There is not a lot that will grow in peat but it is a very successful soil conditioner.  Teagasc must work to develop an alternative.  Why are we not working on the international stage to innovate and bring about success?  We know that there is no short-term, sustainable, economically viable alternative as we speak so we need a short-term intervention.  This Bill is proposing a relatively short timeframe for the controlled harvesting of peat for the horticultural sector.  </p><p>I have already referred to the mushroom sector and have spoken about the importance of regional and rural Ireland's reliance on peat.  We must address this issue.  Like the Minister of State, I believe in rural development and rural opportunities.  Today we have an opportunity to send a signal to the rural parts of this country that this is not about a green, urban agenda.  This must be about a green, national agenda that includes rural people, small entrepreneurs and those who want to grow sustainable and healthy food.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I urge the Minister of State to give a high priority to addressing these issues.

He may remember this time last year I raised in a Commencement debate a matter related to horticultural peat, which he addressed.  It is a matter of sadness that a year later we are having essentially the same debate.  There is at least a heightened sense of urgency and willingness to do something about the issue, more or less because of the Bill.</p> <p>I am very pleased to co-sponsor the Bill.  I and many others have spoken on numerous occasions about the ridiculous situation in the horticultural peat industry, which is a vital component of the horticultural nursery and mushroom industry.  Those in the business, including many in County Kildare, need clarity on how they are to proceed.  We are discussing horticultural peat again because there has been no action to date.</p> <p>Kildare is the second most affected county in terms of job loss impact as a result of the ending of peat harvesting for power generation in the midlands region.  We are also at a significant disadvantage, as we have a shortage of suitable sites to establish new green enterprises that could replace the labour-intensive work of peat extraction.  This directly affects many people in south-west Kildare around Rathangan, Allenwood, Carbury, Kilberry and just over the border into counties Laois and Offaly.</p> <p>In my previous contribution on this issue, I spoke about the ridiculous situation that large shipments of horticultural peat were beginning to be imported and how the first 4,000 tonnes of peat had been shipped from Latvia, causing significant carbon emissions.  That was a 3,000 km journey by ship, in addition to 200 trucks to transport the peat to the port in Latvia and unload it in Ireland.  Until a viable alternative is sourced, we would require a shipment every two weeks for a decade to meet the existing demand.  It makes no sense.  We cannot allow this to continue.  We need an interim solution such as the one suggested in the Bill.  The horticulture industry has been crying out for a solution for about a year and a half at this stage.  It has campaigned very effectively.  It is time for the nine relevant Ministers and all other Oireachtas Members to step up to the plate and find a solution.</p> <p>We all know we need to tackle climate change and that tough decisions must be made to meet our obligations, but we are cancelling one carbon-heavy process and replacing it with another more expensive and more awkward alternative.  We must support jobs in green industry and in the growing industry.  There is a world of difference between burning peat for electricity and using it for growing produce.  There should be a derogation for the industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#OO00500"><p>There can be no greener sector of the economy than horticulture and mushroom growing.  By its nature, as an indigenous industry, it is deeply committed to the greening of Ireland.  It is impacted by climate change and those involved are very much aware of the effect of climate change.  Most are strongly supportive of ending the use of peat as a fossil fuel because they see the impact of it.  We have effectively thrown the baby out with the bathwater here.</p> <p>Let us consider the volume of peat used in a normal year.  Peat for energy usage was normally of the order of approximately 14 million cu. m.  Heating briquettes were of the order of approximately 4 million cu. m.  Let us contrast that with the sector about which we are talking.  Professional horticulture use was approximately 131,000 cu. m., while mushroom growing used approximately 245,000 cu. m.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The amateur market, including those who produce salad boxes and things like that, use something of the order of about 470,000 cu. m.  Thus, it is a very small proportion of the peat that was actually used.  These are, for the most part, local community businesses that are green businesses providing food not just in our community but also, as has been mentioned already, to the export market.  It is not just in County Monaghan that we have mushrooms.  We have very good mushrooms in County Wexford through Walsh Mushrooms.  There are also many nurseries there.  These producers are really committed to the green agenda but at the moment their businesses are struggling.  If one looks at the European Union, the Dutch, who have a wonderful reputation for horticulture, have not given up using peat.  Nor have the Germans.  We do not want to bring forward this legislation.  This is not something we like doing.  However, it comes at the end of a process where those who have been trying to save this business have felt there is no other option.  I agree with the Leader that we would like to draw back but we must have certainty for those in the horticulture and mushroom-growing businesses.  These are some of the greenest businesses in Ireland.</p></speech>

If the Bill before us was going to solve the problems of the horticultural industry I would say that.  I think people know I am straight enough to do that.  However, it simply is not.  Making me the enemy by pointing that out is not helping anyone.  It is not helping the horticultural sector.  We need to distinguish between growers in this country and those who are making money out of extraction.  We must point to the fact that ten times the amount of peat is being exported as being imported, otherwise it is a completely dishonest conversation.</p> <p>What this Bill does is recreate regulations in primary legislation that were struck down by European law in 2019.  It is on that basis the Government is opposing it.  Let us be really clear about that.  Peat is a global commodity.  For Ireland it has always been a global commodity.  Of the peat we extract, 90% is exported.  That continues to be the case today, years later.  I completely understand the frustrations.  I have them myself.  I would be more than happy to put down a joint motion saying we need to move on this.  However, with respect, it is not just 18 months we have been waiting for this.  It is ten years.  We have known for ten years this was a problem coming down the tracks.  The Minister was already bringing a memo to Cabinet, as I think most of us know.  I appreciate people wanted to create an urgency around this but we must also take on board the Attorney General's advice.  That means opposing the Bill today but it also means being really honest about what is going to hold the solutions for the horticultural sector.</p> <p>Given there is some extraction that is permitted under Irish law, I do not understand why we are not seeing that extraction happening on the ground, unless it is because it is not profitable for a large business.  I received an email from a large extractor, as I am sure most Senators did, pointing out that there is no problem with EU law.  That is incorrect.  The Attorney General's advice will tell us it is incorrect but common sense would too.  Let us look, therefore, at the proper solutions around this.  Some people have asked me where my evidence is for the illegal extraction.  They should come to the west of Ireland or come to the midlands and they will see the evidence of illegal extraction all around them.  Nobody in this country has a licence for extraction, other than Bord na M&oacute;na.  Who then is doing all that extraction, because it is not Bord na M&oacute;na?  Perhaps it will be argued the extraction is all being done by people who are doing it under 30 ha but that is certainly not what research from UCC showed.  It actually showed there are 50,000 ha that are being extracted over 30 ha.</p></speech>

It is so great to have the House agreed on wanting to support the horticulture industry.  It is fantastic we are all agreed on that.  I hope everybody takes that into account when buying their fruit, vegetables and plants so they are only buying off local horticultural growers, as there are many in Ireland who could do with our support.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is great we all agree on that.</p><p>It is also great how everybody keeps saying they really care about our bogs, which is fantastic.  No more than Senator Boyhan said, it is great that people say they really want to support our bogs, but then there is a full stop.  There are no "buts" on this issue.  People cannot say one thing and then say we should start going back to harvesting our bogs again.  Let us make it very clear that 11 times the amount of peat needed by the horticulture industry is exported from this country.  If we want to tackle this issue, be honest about it and not use it as some kind of political football, we would ask why we are exporting peat when our horticulture industry needs it right now.  That would be something worth talking about and enacting.</p><p>This Bill does not serve any purpose.  First, it is asking us to break the law, which is a complete contradiction for legislation.  Second, it is a pity that Green Party Senators were left out of the discussion on this Bill before it was introduced, because we know peat and bogs.  I would have happily informed Senator Doherty and her colleagues about information we have on the export of peat, which is a major issue.  If we want to sort out horticulture issues, we should stop the madness of exporting ten times what we bring in.  We should also stop going on about this 4,000 tonnes of imported peat and all of a sudden caring about carbon emissions when the party referring to those things is talking about exporting pigs to China.  Let us be real and honest and have a proper, clear debate on this issue.</p><p>Some 500,000 tonnes of peat have been exported from this country since last January.  Why are we not up in arms about that on behalf of our horticulture industry?  As Senator O'Reilly pointed out, there is big difference between the small horticulture business and the big guys who are making a lot of money from exporting peat.  Why are we not targeting the latter and asking them what they are doing?  Do they have environmental impact statements?  Why are they exporting peat when our horticulture industry needs it?  Let us have a proper, intelligent and nuanced debate about the issue of peat and stop with the "We care about our bogs, but ..." approach.  There are no buts.  We either do this correctly and have an intelligent debate or we are wasting everybody's time.  Let us not use this issue as a political football.  We all care about the horticulture industry.  Many of my friends and acquaintances have jobs in the sector.  We need to do it right.  If we are exporting peat, why are we saying we will go back to cutting more peat?  If we are exporting peat, why are we not giving it to the horticulture industry?  Let us have an intelligent debate on peat and saving our horticulture industry instead of playing political football.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#QQ00200"><p>The Government has known for many years that the use of peat for horticulture must be phased out.  It has known that this would require a transitional plan to ensure the horticulture industry had sufficient supplies of peat in the short term while sustainable alternatives were being identified and put in place in the medium to long term.  Despite knowing this for years, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael failed to act, even though some members of those parties were in government.</p> <p>Today, we have the bizarre situation of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of peat, including horticultural peat, being exported from the State, while the horticulture industry is left to import peat from elsewhere.  In 2019, the Government introduced badly drafted regulations as a short-term measure to address a mess that it created.  The regulations were challenged in the courts, rightly so, were found not to be in compliance with the State's environmental obligations and were struck down.</p> <p>Since then, the Government has sat on its hands and done nothing.  It has not engaged those who are exporting horticultural peat from the island, particularly State-owned Bord na M&oacute;na, to ensure that the horticulture industry had sufficient supplies from existing stockpiles.  The Government has not pursued the issue of sustainable alternatives to horticultural peat in order to provide growers with a viable alternative.  It has simply buried its head in the sand in the hope that the problem would simply go away.  That is the context in which we have to see today's Bill.  It is nothing short of a cynical piece of political theatre designed to give the impression that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are proposing a solution, when anyone who can read knows that this Bill is anything but that.</p> <p>The Bill proposes a widespread and unlimited exemption from planning for peat extraction for use in the domestic horticulture industry until 2026, with a further possible extension to 2030.  In doing so, it completely ignores the outworking of the High Court ruling in 2019 and the advice from the Government's own Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning, Deputy Peter Burke, which was put on the record of the D&aacute;il this year.  The significance of the High Court ruling is that there must be a dual consent process in place, with planning permission granted under the Planning and Development Acts and licensing granted through the EPA.  In October, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, said that while he was not opposed to a single consent process, any such system must ensure full compliance with EU environmental legislation, including the carrying out of environmental impact assessments where required.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill before us today does not do this.  If it were passed and enacted, it would be challenged in the courts and in my opinion it would be struck out, as were the 2019 regulations.  If this Bill was legally sound, it would not be introduced by Government Senators but by the Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning, who came to the House a few weeks ago and gave us tea and sympathy.  I understand the Government took a decision last night not to support the Bill.  We now have the bizarre situation where a Bill being introduced by Government Senators from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is not supported by either party and will be withdrawn today without being pushed to a vote.  If that is not the definition of cynical gesture politics, then I do not know what is.</p><p>We all want to see the matter resolved and we want our horticultural industry to survive in a manner that protects jobs and workers&rsquo; rights.  The horticultural sector does not exactly have a stellar record in protecting workers' rights either.  I would like a debate on that issue as well.  We have to ensure the sector is fully compliant with environmental law and legally binding emissions reduction targets.  That can be done if the political will is there but it can not be done with this Bill.  Instead of playing politics with people's livelihoods and the environment, the Government should publish the report of the working group on horticultural peat.  It should outline how it intends to resolve the problems in a credible way that can be implemented and serves the horticulture sectors, serves the communities that depend on them and protects the environment and its biodiversity.  The Bill does not resolve the immediate issues at hand.  I would have loved the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to have explained to the House how it squares with the response he put on the record in October.</p><p>The one thing that is clear from today is that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il do not have the interests of rural communities or the rural environment at heart.  This is the kind of cynical political theatre that serves nobody and gives people false hope.  It only serves the Senators who have their eyes on D&aacute;il seats in the next general election.  It is pure political theatre and increasingly the electorate is seeing through it.  The electorate wants proper solutions that will protect our environment, see us meet our emissions targets and protect the horticultural sector.  It also wants to see less of the political theatrics.</p></speech>

I do not know if that is a reflection of what we are talking about when we speak of removing peat from the earth.  It is more suitable to say we are mining peat because it is not renewable in any relevant timescale.  It takes an enormous amount of time to renew peatlands.  We should start calling it mining.  I do not know how the public would feel about that but it is a useful word to put into people's minds.</p><p>Many of the points made in the debate end up being repeated but I want to talk about the legal question.  I have spoken to a number of people about this in recent days because I wanted to get a good background on the legal aspect of this.  I am open to correction by either the Attorney General or the Minister of State but there seems to be a strong belief that this Bill contravenes EU law.  One of the EU laws that people I have spoken to claim would be contravened is the one that was given effect by Deputy Bruton when he was Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Does this Bill contravene a law introduced in the previous D&aacute;il by a Fine Gael Minister?  It is also worth pointing out that we are not going to meet our self-imposed deadlines or those set by international agreements without converting jobs designed for peat extraction into jobs in areas such as bog rewetting and other vital climate measures which fit in with a just transition.</p><p>There is a lot of talk about whether sustainable alternatives exist and about how many people have access to them.  Again, it is important to highlight that there is an environmental impact to importing peat as well as a financial cost.  No one would say the <i>status quo</i>is sustainable.  We have this bizarre situation where peat is leaving the country, which is unsustainable and bad for the environment, yet people in Ireland who need peat are not able to access it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised a good point.  Is it because it is not profitable to sell that peat in Ireland?  What is going on?  Why do we have so much coming out?  Why are we importing peat?  We have to be honest; the best place for peat to be is in the ground.  We talk about the value peat has to the sector but the best value peat has is to our planet.  It is only two weeks since COP26, we are in the middle of a climate crisis and we simply will end up as a sizzling wasteland in the next couple of decades unless we get to grips with it.  The best place for peat to be for the planet is in the ground.  There is no question about the value of peat.  Peatland is one of the best carbon stores in the world.  It is better than all other vegetation on the planet.  We have very little time left to reach our climate targets.  Bogs are some of the best tools we have to absorb carbon into the earth.</p><p>I am not sure presuming on sustainable peat harvesting for two years is the best way to deal with this.  I agree with some previous speakers who pointed out that two years is not a pause.  It will make matters significantly worse for a generation of people and politicians.  I am sure there are a couple of people in this room who hope to be politicians in 2030.  Those people will be dealing with the consequences of not taking things like this seriously.  They are potentially creating a problem for themselves down the line.  </p><p>I welcome the Minister of State indicating the report on recommendations on how to proceed will be published.  It is clear that is what a great many people want.  It hopefully will provide a solution to this.</p><p>Is the temporary suspension of laws, particularly EU directives, the best way to govern, lead, legislate and make political decisions?  I do not know that temporarily suspending laws because we need to get to grips with them is the best way to do things.  I am not entirely clear in that regard.</p><p>Currently, large-scale peat extraction needs both planning permission and EPA licensing, with in-depth assessment of environmental and climate impacts under both regimes.  That is a requirement under EU law and this legislation proposes to not have that.  Having both, that is, the environmental assessment and others, is really important.  I do not have any objection to that.  I do not know that we should be trying to circumvent environmental protection objectives of key EU directives.  That would amount to a breach of, if not EU law, certainly our commitment to co-operation with EU directives.  That is not a particularly good look or vibe at the moment when we are dealing with a crisis.</p><p>I agree with Senator Boylan that it is frustrating that we have proposed legislation coming from Government Senators in this House that is not being supported by other Government party members.  It is not an effective way to do law or build cross-party support.  Those of us in the Opposition are looking on and wondering what is going on if they cannot get agreement amongst themselves.  It is not a good way to do legislation or proceed with things.</p><p>The main concern of our party is that this is not compatible with EU law, EU directives and certainly not with what we have agreed in terms of EU co-operation.  That is not a very good reason to pass legislation when there are so many questions over it.</p></speech>

Peatlands are the largest natural terrestrial carbon store.  They store more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined.  Damaged and drained peatlands are no longer a benefit or a carbon store, however; in fact, they become major emitters.  It is estimated that between 5% and 6% of all global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions each year come from damaged peatlands.  To be clear, when we allow the damaging of peatlands to continue, we lose twice.  We lose on the carbon we do not sequester and on the emissions that are going out.  There is a double cost to the environment from this measure.</p> <p>Worldwide, this is a disaster waiting to happen.  I agree we should be looking to the global implications.  We should not be importing from Sri Lanka.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We certainly should be supporting, for example, the Congo Basin to keep its peat in the ground rather than it being pressed to export it.</p><p>The restoration of peatlands has been stated as a priority, which we have heard mentioned many times.  It is one of the few cards Ireland has to play in terms it being a climate sink.  It is one thing we have said we will do.  To be clear, it has been calculated by the top peatland experts that we could reduce our greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions by 15% if we restored peatlands.  That is important because the European Commission has set a target of 2035 for net zero carbon on land use.  This is one of the most efficient, achievable emission reduction instruments we have at a time when not only the horticulture sector but every sector will have to change.  We are in a climate crisis and every sector will be making changes.  Just transition is about addressing every sector.  I support just transition but it is about supporting those in the industry, not about delaying the transition.  </p><p>The environmental information is clear.  The legal aspects are also extremely clear.  Let me address what the Bill provides.  It will give a derogation, which could extend to 2030, into the next two carbon budgets to 2022, 2026 and potentially to 2030.  If we say this is about the small horticulture businesses and not the big peat contractors, which, as we have heard, have exported 500,000 tonnes of peat last year and 900,000 tonnes of peat the previous year, but the alarm bell for peat extraction was sounded in 2019.  We have already had our temporary or emergency period for transition.  That happened in 2019 and that is a charitable interpretation.  The need to exit from horticultural peat has been clear since the 1990s and even in 2014, Ireland was being criticised by the European Court of Justice for its failure to designate special areas of conversation or natural heritage areas.  I hope the Minister of State will address the point.  I was in the Oireachtas after that 2019 ruling and instead of seeking address the crisis, perhaps by having Bord na M&oacute;na as the one extractive body whose actions we could control, we were seeking to de-designate new bogs.  That is what was being used as political capital.  The Fine Gael Party and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party put forward those motions and they were the parties in the previous Government.  I spoke about these issues.  It is not as if a sudden alarm has arisen about peat extraction.  </p><p>One of the most shameful pieces of political theatre concerns the 4,000 tonnes of peat that has been imported.  That has deeply discredited the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and others who supported that language.  How can we engage with them credibly on the climate debate, as we want to, if they have been putting out the figure of 4,000 tonnes of peat in terms of imports, while not discussing the export of 500,000 tonnes of peat?</p><p>Let us be clear, the Bill allows for the continuation of exports of horticultural peat.  Extraction is not limited for the purposes of only domestic horticultural peat.  The Bill also rewards those who have been recklessly extracting peat during the past year and half with full knowledge of the 2019 ruling.  Section 3(1)(b) of the Bill states "nothing ... [should be] affected by any previous unauthorised peat extraction ... or associated unauthorised development".  Again, we will reward those.  This legislation is the last chance saloon.  People will extract what they can quietly, the previous Government had a non-action approach to it and this Government is asking that we apply blinkers again.  This is effectively a nod and wink Bill to the effect that we should again turn our backs and a blind eye to the extraction that has been taking place.  </p><p>Clearly, this Bill is not compatible with the 2019 landmark High Court ruling.  Neither is it compatible with the environmental impact assessment directive or habitats directive  Crucially, I do not believe it is procedurally, legally compatible with Articles 9(2) or 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention.  Members of the public have a right to a say in environmental decision-making that affects their future.</p><p>The Bill is not legally sound and it will not stand up to scrutiny.  I urge that the Minister of State does not make unnecessary inappropriate concessions that tie our hands for the next five or ten years up to 2030.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we do so, we will send a signal to every sector that political theatre will be rewarded.

The purpose of any Second Stage debate is to do just that - to debate and to put forward facts, to put forward alternative facts, if one can use that phrase, to dispute items and to put forward concerns people have regarding the legislation.  It is important to put that on the record.</p> <p>On where we are, I will make a few points and the Minister of State might be able to confirm them or comment on them.  Could he confirm that there are no viable alternative mediums to peat for the horticultural sector that have proved to be available, affordable, sustainable and meet quality as well as environmental requirements?  Also, 0.12% of Irish peatlands is required for peat extraction for the purposes of horticulture.  That is what this is about.  This is not about large-scale extraction.  This is about what we can do to support an industry that is hugely important for food production and has a valuable role to play in employment as well.  As has been said, the Bill will reinstate for a temporary period the exemption from the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021 for peat extraction for the purposes of horticulture.</p> <p>It has been reported that the Bill is incompatible with EU law.  Is it the Bill that is incompatible, or is it the practice of extraction that is incompatible?  If it is the Bill, that is one thing.  However, if the practice is incompatible with EU law, how then is the harvesting of peat in the Baltic states, which is brought to Ireland, compatible with the same EU law, considering they are EU member states?  We, in government - I am sure the Opposition is doing so as well - are trying to convince everyone in society that climate change is real and that we need to change.  We are trying to bring people, in  particular, farmers, with us.  How can we convince them that transporting peat from halfway around the world to Ireland is a good thing?  How does that make sense if we are trying to convince a farmer to plant trees?  The farmers will say, &ldquo;You want me to plant trees and you are importing peat from halfway around the world&rdquo;.  I accept there are issues around why the horticulture sector cannot source peat here.  That is a valid question.  If it was able to source peat here, we would not be here debating this Bill.  That is a valid question and it needs to be answered.  In the absence of being able to source peat here, it is being brought in from other EU member states and from Asia.  That just does not make sense.  As I said, it creates so many issues with the message that we have to send to farmers and everyone else about the things they need to do.  I am sure the Minister of State sees where we are coming from.  I appreciate the Minister of State will have issues with other aspects but that is the principle here.</p> <p>The Minister of State may go to an IFA meeting with farmers and tell them that they need to do X, Y, or Z in terms of planting, habitats and reductions in nitrogen.  This is all worthy stuff, which we have supported.  However, they will throw it back and say &ldquo;Yes, but you are importing peat and are stopping Irish lads cutting turf."  That is what is being thrown back at us.  Those are the difficulties we face.</p> <p>There has always been a debate in this country about the ordinary turf cutter.  Many of us have done this, including my uncle, although he is not in the position to do it anymore.  He cut a few hoppers of turf.  There has always been that debate between those small-scale harvesters, if you like, and the Bord na M&oacute;nas.  I had many a debate with Senator Higgins in my previous role in the then Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on behalf of then Minister, Deputy Madigan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand that the wildlife legislation is still with the Department and may reappear.  That remains to be seen.  That is central to the debate.  It is about designating some of those State-owned lands, protecting them and ensuring that they are not harvested, and allowing some of the smaller farmers to complete the harvesting on some of their bogs, which have been damaged.  That is what that Bill is about.  There is a larger issue here regarding harvesting, turf and peat but this Bill is about protecting one sector.</p><p>If there is another method of ensuring that peat is sourced in this country for the horticulture sector, rather than the ethos of this Bill, then that needs to be looked at.  If there is a reason why the horticultural sector cannot get it, such as quality, it needs to be addressed.  If large-scale suppliers are not providing to the horticulture sector for price reasons, then that has to be debated.  Either way, we need to ensure that the growing media that they need are available in the short term, until research provides new media of growth for the mushroom and horticulture sectors.  That is what this Bill attempts to do.</p></speech>

I would like to put on the record that I have found the Minister of State to be very approachable.  He and I have had many discussions about this issue, through Commencement matters or whatever else.  I have always found the Minister of State amenable.</p> <p>I have listened to the debate.  We all have one thing in common in this House, which is the love for our climate.  Everyone has a responsibility to do all that we can to ensure that we reduce the carbon footprint, regardless of what element of society we come from.  If we are going to take the Irish people with us on this journey, the messaging has to make sense.  I have no doubt that if the messaging makes sense, the Irish people, especially the farming community, will do the right thing, as they have always done.  I say "messaging" because I would contend that the messaging about this issue is confusing.  We are saying to people that they cannot extract 0.1% of the entire peatland of the State for the purpose of horticulture.</p> <p>I refer specifically to the mushroom industry in County Monaghan.  The horticulture sector would use 0.12% in total and the mushroom industry would be much less than that.  Somehow, it is okay to import thousands of tonnes into this country every fortnight, coming from the Baltic states or wherever else.  It is okay for 200 trucks to drive round Latvia, pick up their cargo, take it to a port, ship it across thousands of kilometres to the Irish Sea and have it arrive at a port here, where 200 trucks have to load their cargo and drive up the boreens to deliver it.</p> <p>Creating jobs in this country is not easy.  Creating jobs in a place like rural Ireland is a much more difficult task.  We are fortunate in Monaghan that we have a strong agrifood business.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One sector of that agrifood business we are very proud of is the mushroom industry.  It is estimated that the mushroom industry employs 3,500 people out of the 17,000 mentioned here earlier.  Many of those jobs are located in County Monaghan.  Monaghan Mushrooms is the largest exporter of mushrooms in Europe and the second or third largest in the entire world.  There are loads of other smaller enterprises and small farmers with small mushroom huts that keep their families going.  What we are talking about here this afternoon is common sense.  We need a temporary, commonsense solution in order to sustain those jobs.  When someone from Monaghan Mushrooms knocks on my door and says we have a crisis I will listen because there are too many jobs at stake not to do so.  We are not saying this legislation is perfect but I hope it acts as a catalyst so the Government will finally act.  I am not pointing the finger at the Minister of State when I say that because there are more Departments involved in this decision-making than just his.  It is vitally important and we have gotten to a critical stage.  Somebody needs to grasp the nettle because there are too many livelihoods and jobs at stake in rural Ireland, where it is difficult to create jobs.  I ask that the Government act on this.  I have asked the Minister of State to do this several times.  I know he is doing his best but we need action and we need it now.</p></speech>

It was a great day for the region and all living around the River Shannon.</p> <p>Unfortunately I do not have too much time but the Acting Chairperson might be kind and give me a minute or two.  I do not think it is fair for any Senator to say that anybody who put their name to this particular Bill was doing it for any cynical reason.  I studied horticulture in college and my first job for a number of years was teaching horticulture.  I was involved in running a horticulture business for some time.  I certainly did not put my name to this for any cynical reason and I do not believe the Senators who put their names to it did that either.  What everyone has to realise is that we have been lobbied by a lot of genuine people who are seriously concerned about their future.</p> <p>Like Senator Gallagher, I have to say that any time I approach the Minister of State he is a gentleman.  He listens and he understands the crisis we have.  I want to acknowledge that publicly.  However, it is our job to fight, whether we are in government or not, for people who need that bit of support.  I have never lobbied for the big exporters.  Senator Garvey was right when she said that we need a debate.  We need to discuss what is happening.  I even heard a rumour that some of the peat that was imported from Latvia could have been exported again.  I urge Senator Garvey to share that information with us as quickly as possible.  I am sure she will.</p> <p>We cannot just return to what we were doing.  I am fully committed to what we have to do with our bogs and I am fully committed to what we have said we will do on climate change but we cannot have peat being imported from Latvia to serve Irish growers.  I am told that despite what we saved by closing down our bogs, this continuous importing of peat from Latvia will actually cost us an awful lot more in its carbon footprint.  We are defeating the purpose of what we are trying to achieve and that is a difficulty for the Government.</p> <p>I and the other Senators who signed this Bill are here for the right reasons.  To be quite honest, I am glad we do not say "Yes sir, no sir" or "Yes ma'am, no ma'am" just because our party is in government.  We will stand up for people and we have to stand up for them.  I am standing up or the small growers.  The Minister of State has a great understanding of small growers and he is concerned.  I have spoken to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Taoiseach and have mentioned this to the Minister of State.  Quite a lot of peat was extracted in the Mount Dillon area on the Roscommon-Longford border and has not been used.  That should be used for the horticultural sector.  It is suitable and I am sure that 80% of what is lying there in piles could be used.  It has been extracted and I do not think there is any point in putting it back into the bogs.  It would get us out of this situation.  We are only talking about the mushroom industry and other parts of the horticultural industry, which will be in crisis if we do not solve this problem.</p></speech>

It is the only thing I am concerned with.  I oppose the export of Irish peat to the UK and other places for horticultural purposes there.  They can get on with their John Innes compost or whatever else they have.  I am only concerned with the mushroom industry and the people whose jobs are at issue in the mushroom industry.  It is all very well to come into this House and blame parties for the errors that have happened.  Sometimes we should be honest - I hope the Minister of State will not take exception to this - and say the Administration in our country is to blame for much of the messing that goes on.  We only have to look at the messing going on the forestry business at the moment and the complete omnishambles of our failure to meet forestry targets.  It is no political party's policy that should be the case but it has just happened by sheer incompetence thus far.  It is not a party political point.  There is no point in attacking the Greens on this or the Greens feeling sensitive because it is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael's Senators-----</p></speech>

It is important that we do something practical now for the mushroom industry.  I have known about this from another aspect of my life, which I will not go into.  We have known for more than three years that this crisis was coming but nobody stood up to say they were going to deal with it and save the mushroom industry.  There is no point in coming in here and saying we need research into a different medium for growing mushrooms at this point because the industry will be wiped out while people in Teagasc try to work out whether gorse needles or something else can be ground up to produce a medium.  There is no point in doing that kind of thing.  We now have to have some derogation simply to produce extracted peat or mined peat, if you want to use that phrase, to supply that industry while we work on an alternative.</p> <p>I hope the Ministers in the various Departments, as it is a cross-departmental issue, are working on some kind of measure, which this Bill is trying to get at, that will keep the show on the road for all those people who are about to lose their jobs.  You can be in Friends of the Irish Environment and say your credentials are ultra perfect, that you stopped this and stopped that and you can make very obvious points about the science of it, which I accept completely, that peat is a hugely important carbon storage medium but in the end, let us be honest with ourselves, something has to give on this.  By way of example, when I was on the energy committee in the last D&aacute;il, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was on it with me, and a Bill was put forward by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith to stop all gas exploration.  I remember saying, "Hold it, we will need gas for the next 30 years."  The response was that we were going to have alternative means of producing energy, we did not need it and we must stop gas exploration now.  That was the imperative.  It is easy to pose on these issues.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, went to the Cabinet today, I think, to say we need two need gas stations, and will need them for the next 20 or 30 years as a backup.  I do not understand how it made sense to give up gas exploration in those circumstances and to render ourselves liable to Mr. Putin turning off the tap or gas prices shooting up in England.  </p> <p>The reason I mention that is that you can be as environmentalist as you like, but you must be truthful and practical and look at the consequence of what you are suggesting.  When Friends of the Irish Environment go to court to seek this or that declaration, it should say what its plan is for the mushroom industry in Monaghan for the next five years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A ban on exports of peat to the UK is no problem as far as I am concerned, but I am concerned about the people who are working in and running one of the most successful export businesses in this country.  They are entitled to the assistance of their legislators.  They are entitled to the backing of their Government and, from those who have a different view of where the balance should lie environmentally, they are entitled to fairness and some degree of hope.  I ask the Minister of State, who I know is a reasonable man - I have personal experience of that - to accept that the mushroom industry is walking into a crisis if we do not act now.  Something must happen.  If not this Bill, which will be talked out today rather than voted on, something must happen.  Something must give.  Something must be put on the table to keep the mushroom industry going over the next three to five years while other things happen.</p></speech>

It is crucial that we talk about peat, transition and climate change, but who is talking about people?  Who is talking about people and about jobs?  </p> <p>We are talking about peat.  I live in Ballinasloe.  Less than 10 km from Shannonbridge, there are seasonal workers who have lost their jobs.  I know people who have lost their jobs.  Roscommon has been hugely impacted by the loss of the Lanesborough facility.  We are in the midst of a just transition or, at least, we talk about being in the midst of a just transition.  How just is this transition in Ireland?  According to timelines, the impact of the closure of the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na was not planned.  They expected to be operational for another number of years and that there would be a transition plan in place.  </p> <p>We talk about the EU and the EU banning this and that.  That is not the case.  To be very clear, the EU supports a just transition.  It supports a transition to impact the social and economic status of families and people, particularly people in the west of Ireland who are affected.  In the west, we are already at a disadvantage.  In the urban centres we can talk about a just transition when we have access to public transport.  We can talk about a great transition when there are so many jobs in our city centres.  How many jobs are there 10 km from Ballinasloe or 40 km from Galway city when one is a seasonal worker?  What just transition is there?</p></speech>

It provides targeted support to help mobilise around &euro;55 billion over the period 2021-2027 in the most affected regions. </blockquote> <p>Frans Timmermans has stated, &quot;We must show solidarity with the most affected regions in Europe, such as coal mining regions and others, to make sure the Green Deal gets everyone&rsquo;s full support and has a chance to become a reality&quot;.  My region is a region in transition.  That means that it is not the same as every other region in Ireland.  It is not the same as Munster or the same as Leinster.  It is a region in transition.  We have less investment <i>per capita</i>in healthcare and education yet it is okay to say that we can lose jobs willy nilly.  There is no just transition for the people who have jobs in those areas and to support their families to make the change.  </p><p>We know that rural Ireland will be impacted more by the changes that we face.  We are willing to face that.  Our farmers are willing to do that, but it has to be fair.  There must be timelines and consideration about the impacts on areas of disadvantage.  Currently, that is not the case.  </p><p>We have many raised bogs in our area in the west.  We have the environments that we are trying to fight for under CAP reform.  Our areas, hedgerows and all the other things that we do, such as our extensive farming and eco-schemes, should be counted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Are they being counted in CAP?  Bord na M&oacute;na is now a climate solutions company.  That is fantastic.  People are changing their jobs and new roles have been assigned, but how many new roles are there for our seasonal workers?  The Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science heard today that the rate of lifelong learning in Ireland was 11%.  This means that older people in our communities, and I am guessing especially in the west, are not going back to further and higher education.  They will not be able to reskill or upskill and get new roles.  I ask that the Minister of State take this into account.</p></speech>

I am not in any way cynical.  I am here to represent the people of my area.  That is the job of every public representative.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill and am delighted to have put my signature to it.  I compliment Senators Gallagher and Doherty on their work on it.</p> <p>I am from Longford, which has seen the shutdown of the Lough Ree power station.  A consequence of that was the closure of Bord na M&oacute;na's Mountdillon site, causing significant job losses.  I am chairperson of the county tourism committee.  For many years, I have been one of the strongest proponents of developing what we term the mid-Shannon wilderness park as a natural amenity of 20,000 acres of rehabilitated bogland.  I support its development and believe it could be an economic driver for our community.</p> <p>The area of peatland that is relevant to the horticultural industry only represents 0.12% of total Irish peatlands and is a fraction of what we previously harvested.  The impact of imported peat undermines Ireland's commitment to global climate action.  A recent study by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine estimated that the horticultural industry was worth &euro;477 million, the fourth largest industry in terms of gross agricultural commodity output.  It also provides up to 17,000 jobs.</p> <p>A number of Members have met various IFA groups, farm interest groups and so on about this matter.  They acknowledge the situation but they are seeking emergency legislation.  They want the Department to explore the legislative avenues for the replacement of the dual consent system for large-scale commercial peat extraction by a new consent system similar to those in place in other EU countries, ensure that the just transition fund is available in the short term to compensate the industry, and provide funding to enable research and development to be carried out on reduced peat and peat-free growing media.  No one is against the route we are taking.  The farming industry and I politically understand the reason, but we need a dual system to get us to the point where our growing media can produce the horticulture that we need without having to use peat.  This Bill does that.</p> <p>Over the past number of months, we have had politicians from all parties and groups expressing their opposition to Ireland becoming dependent on imported peat.  The Bill complies with EU law.  To take up Senator Kyne's point, how could the Bill not be compliant with EU law if it is compliant for us to import from Latvia?  I cannot get my head around that.</p> <p>I give my full support to the Bill that has been introduced by the two parties.  I understand why there might be opposition to it, but it is a time-sensitive Bill that means to get us to the point at which we can find an alternative.  That is a workable solution.</p></speech>

I want to make two very quick points before I sum up.  First, the report is going to Cabinet with recommendations and a memo on it but that is not sparked by this Bill.  We have been working on this for a long time.  I assure the House that we have been working tirelessly for many months on this and if it were simple, we would have embarked on the legislative process already.  It is not so simple and we cannot do it.  The second point is that we must work together on this.  We have heard speakers from across the House outline the challenges facing the sector.  It is a sector that I worked in for many years as a landscape gardener and one that I truly value, but as an environmentalist, I also value our peatlands.</p> <p>To respond to Senator Doherty, who introduced the Bill and opened the debate, nobody is against fixing this.  We are all in favour of fixing it.  We have advice from the Office of the Attorney General around its legality and compliance with EU law.  There is also advice that the Bill itself should be subject to a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, which it has not been.  It is critically important to work within the law on this.</p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin spoke about the horticultural sector in County Kildare and I appreciate its importance there.  Senator Malcolm Byrne argued that there is no greener sector and I agree with him on that.  He mentioned the Dutch continuing on in this space but the Dutch are also on the same journey as us.  We all have to share that journey.  Many years ago when I joined the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, it was the Dutch who came in and bought Irish bogs to help to save our peatlands.  It is fantastic that we are on this journey but we have to do this together.</p> <p>I will not have time to respond to all of the points raised in the debate today before I make my closing remarks.  Senator Boylan raised the issue of the dual consent process and referred to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, in this House on 13 October.  Again, this is a wider issue than planning and an amendment to the Environmental Protection Agency Act would be required.  I reiterate that it is not that simple, which is why we are here having this debate.  Senator Boylan also mentioned bog rewetting and other climate measures as well as figures for importing and exporting peat.  We have lots of figures being bandied about but the picture is as murky as the peatland itself.  We do not know what the reality is in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Higgins quite rightly mentioned the fact that our bogs and peatlands are carbon stores.  Again, I go back to the conversations that we had at the very first peatlands pavilion at COP26 and the great respect for the work being done in Ireland on habitat restoration and bog rewetting.  This is something we can be leaders on and we are sharing our experience with our international partners.  Senator Higgins also noted the real risk of infringement proceedings if we seek to introduce a solution that is not compliant with EU environmental law.  We must take that seriously.</p> <p>Senator Kyne spoke about viable alternatives and we are exploring that area.  Senator Gallagher also referred to the mushroom sector.  I have spoken with him about that sector on numerous occasions.  We want to find a collective solution and I am appealing to all Members of this House to work towards that.</p> <p>In the short time remaining, I will go through my scripted closing speech but before doing so, I reiterate my belief that we can find a solution to this.  While I welcome today's debate, I must point out that the Government will be opposing this Bill.  In the context of interruptions to the supply of peat in the horticultural industry, the Government wants to protect jobs, livelihoods and our domestic horticultural industry.  I see where Senators are coming from and appreciate that their concerns are genuine.  I share those concerns and have been working with colleagues across government to address them for a number of months now.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why we have listened very carefully to the contributions here today.

However, while I believe that this Bill is well intentioned, as others have identified, any proposals that we bring forward to address these concerns must be in compliance with Ireland's obligations under the environmental impact assessment and habitats directives.  Otherwise, we will find ourselves in breach of European law, and potentially back in a situation where the legislation would not withstand a challenge in the courts.  That is not where any of us wish to be.</p><p>My Department has received initial legal advice on the Bill from the Office of the Attorney General, which has indicated that there are serious legal issues with the Bill in terms of EU environmental law.  We must take those concerns very seriously but we also have to work together to find solutions for the domestic horticultural industry.  That is what the Government is working to achieve.</p><p>Senators will be aware that I commissioned a working group, under the chairmanship of Dr. Munoo Prasad, to examine the potential of alternatives to the use of peat in horticulture.  This report will be brought in a memorandum to the Government very shortly &ndash; I understand it will be next week - accompanied by a series of additional proposals developed in a significant piece of cross-departmental work undertaken by the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and my own Department, which have been working together to identify a series of steps that can be taken to assist the industry in addressing these challenges.  On balance, I am of the view that we should proceed with the approach which will be brought to the Government in the coming days.  While I understand the reason for wishing to bring this Bill forward, I cannot support it.</p><p>We are all grateful for the value of our peatlands and the change in conversation.  A huge transition is taking place.  In many ways it is very exciting, but incredibly challenging and worrying for many who have worked in this sector.  Our relationship with peatlands is in a transformation.  It is something that people have had historically, culturally, socially and economically but it is in flux.  We want to work together as legislators to help the sector, but also to help peatlands, biodiversity and climate.  I again thank Senators for their valuable contributions here this afternoon.</p></speech>

I will have to leave the House at about 5.45 p.m. to go to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as I must introduce a Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will deputise for me at that point.  I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak with the House about the revised national development plan which I launched last month along with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p> <p>As the largest and most climate-focused national development plan in the history of the State, the NDP sets out a clear, overarching strategy of planned investment of &euro;165 billion for the coming decade to 2030.  This is an ambitious plan that will deliver the infrastructure required for a growing population and for a digital and green transition.  It is a plan that will provide more social and affordable homes for families and individuals.  In essence, it will transform our country and promote job creation, economic development and regional growth.  Balanced regional development is very much at the heart of this NDP.</p> <p>This NDP was drafted within the context of the ongoing challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit, and its design means it can endure uncertainty when future challenges occur, as they inevitably will.  This flexibility lies in its approach in outlining the investment priorities for the coming decade, under which individual projects, timelines and costs can be adjusted in response to challenges and externalities.</p> <p>It is important to note that my role, and that of my Department, in the review of the NDP was to engage with Departments across Government to set the overall capital allocations for each sector.  It is the role of each Minister to determine how his or her departmental allocations will be invested and what sectoral priorities, programmes and projects will be funded.  Given that this is a decade-long plan, it is important that there is flexibility in the delivery of projects while maintaining the overall objectives set out in the plan.  In this context, it is important to note that the NDP is not an exhaustive list of projects to be undertaken over the next ten years.  As part of the plan, I have brought forward policies to increase scrutiny and governance throughout the management process. </p> <p>This NDP is built on the foundation of evidence-informed analysis that has allowed the Government to navigate a path to deliver on our future infrastructure needs.  Well-targeted public capital investment can transform our infrastructure and increase the ability of our economy to grow in a fair and sustainable manner.  Public investment can also have a dramatic impact on the wider economy.  The NDP provides a clear signal to industry of the investment profile from the State over the next ten years.  This will, in turn, encourage investment and job creation from the construction sector in particular.  It is to be noted that we are sending a positive statement to the sector about the scale of the investment that the State is embarking upon over the next decade.  It is estimated that the investment in the NDP will create over 80,000 direct and indirect jobs in the construction industry alone.  It is also anticipated that just over &euro;100 billion of direct spending in construction generates a further &euro;60 billion in indirect output throughout the supply chain.  When one takes into account the wider economy outside the construction sector, the economic benefits of sustained capital investment from the State is crystal clear.</p> <p>The revised NDP is undoubtedly an ambitious plan, but the evidence base upon which the capital ceilings are set mean I am confident that it will support a more resilient, sustainable future for our country and improve the lives and living standards of all the people living here.  This year alone, the Government has allocated &euro;10 billion to capital expenditure, the highest annual level in our State's history.  At 5% of modified gross national income, GNI*, our investment is well above the recent EU average of 3% of national income.  This level of investment is set to grow under this NDP.  This investment is producing real results.  Some 20 major projects are expected to be finished this year alone, including the recently opened N4 upgrade to Sligo, the north runway project at Dublin Airport and, in recent days, we saw the completion of the runway reconstruction at Cork Airport.  Looking at the education sector alone, an average of 150 to 200 school building projects will be delivered every single year over the period 2021 to 2025.</p> <p>The revised NDP not only sets out investment levels over the next ten years, but also the manner in which capital projects are scrutinised to ensure quality delivery and value for money for the taxpayer.  Our plans to improve the project appraisal process and reduce the risk of project overspends, as well as initiatives to increase the capacity of our public bodies, are all well under way.  Enhancing the governance structure that presides over our public investments is imperative if we are to deliver much-needed projects on time and on budget.  I recently announced the implementation of a number of new initiatives designed to strengthen the assurance process for major public investment projects that cost in excess of &euro;100 million and to improve delivery.  The first of these is the introduction of a new external assurance process for major capital projects to provide independent projects scrutiny at two decision points in a project's lifecycle.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2173"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2173&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This will allow concerns to be addressed as they arise, which in turn will improve the delivery of projects and ensure that value for money is achieved.</p><p>To support the external assurance process, a new major projects advisory group has been established to further strengthen the management of public projects.  External experts on the group are being appointed to complement the public service leadership currently in place.  This brings Ireland in line with our international counterparts.  In addition, I have decided to bring an enhanced challenge function, expert knowledge and independent rigour to the deliberations of the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board by adding up to five external members to the board.  Again, this will be done through an open and public competition.  Tracking project progress more closely is another key element to successful delivery and the national investment office in my Department is working on a revamped investment project tracker that will be published with increasing frequency.  I reassure the House that all of these additional reforms and the strengthening of the external assurance and governance framework are not about delaying projects but about making sure we get them right and deliver them on time and on budget.</p><p>Increasing the levels of innovation in the construction sector through digital ambition supports will ultimately see public projects delivered to a higher standard using digital efficiencies.  Capacity, innovation and digital adoption within the Irish construction sector are increasing through the Government's collaborative approach and continued regular engagement with industry representatives via the construction sector group.</p><p>In early November, I announced that a consortium led by the Technological University Dublin was the winner of a &euro;2.5 million grant to deliver the build digital project.  This project is one of seven priority action points arising from the building innovation report, which drew upon an extensive consultation and international benchmarking process and an economic analysis of the causes of productivity trends in the Irish construction sector.  This funding will assist in the effective delivery of projects and ultimately will assist in us meeting our Project Ireland 2040 and NDP ambitions.  It is very important that the construction sector continues to reform, innovate and embrace new ways of doing business and all the technologies that are constantly evolving.</p><p>The supporting excellence action team report, published last month alongside the NDP, examined the capability of the public service to deliver large-scale capital programmes and sets out a number of significant recommendations to support the agenda of improved delivery capability.  The range of measures outlined include the development of the Office of Government Procurement's commercial skills academy to enhance procurement and introduce further legal and planning reforms.</p><p>I acknowledge that the delivery of the public works projects are being impacted by the recent surge in prices of construction materials and I have been working with my officials to consider the optimum means to bring greater certainty to future tenders in light of these cost increases.  In reference to future tenders, interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts will be introduced in December to help reduce the level of risk of extraordinary price inflation that contractors are encountering.  These will address the period between tender submission and awarding of a project, through limited indexation of the tender price.  They will also reduce the fixed price period to 24 months, while permitting mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15%.</p><p>This decade-long strategy of well-targeted public capital investment will have a dramatic impact on this country's employment opportunities, economic development and regional growth.  The NDP will deliver significant and essential infrastructural projects through increased levels of public investment of &euro;165 billion to support the ambitions set out in Project Ireland 2040, be they in health, housing, transport, arts, culture or our third level sector, to name just a few.</p><p>I have placed a particular focus on improving the governance and oversight of capital projects, as well as on supporting innovation in the delivery of these investments.  It is now about delivery and implementing the NDP.  We will have a significant underspend of our capital budget this year, as we did last year and Covid is one significant reason for that.  As we move into a new phase, it is critically important that the budget is spent and that all of our colleagues across government and all the spending bodies deliver on the ambitions and the NDP because funding is available to deliver many of the projects we all want to see.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators over the course of the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#MMM00200"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and for his work on the development of this comprehensive plan.  While I welcome his statement that this is all about delivery, it is also about ensuring value for money.  One of the problems with many major public projects is that the public accept the need for them but ask who is watching their budgets.  The national children's hospital obviously springs to mind in that regard.  I welcome the Minister's assurances that he is putting in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure we do not continue to have the kind of difficulties we had with the national children's hospital.  The governance structure is essential.</p> <p>The moves the Government is making to provide a little more certainty on planning times with An Bord Plean&aacute;la will assist.  In the case of major capital projects, whether public or private, the time An Bord Plean&aacute;la takes to make its decisions is completely unacceptable.  It is not about what the decision is but the time factor involved.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister's statement that this is a plan to deal with the digital and green transition.  None of us can really contemplate what the world will look like as a result of the convergence of new technologies at the end of this decade.  Transport infrastructure will probably involve hydrogen-powered automated cars.  We will have an education system that will make increased use of augmented and virtual reality.  It is estimated that up to 65% of jobs will either be made redundant or substantially changed because of automation, new technologies and machine learning.  It is essential that this plan prepares us for that radically different world.  The plan includes a significant element of upskilling and reskilling to assist us in meeting those opportunities and challenges.  We also have to be mindful of our research capacity so that Ireland can play a leading role in solving some of the global problems we face.</p> <p>I welcome the clear commitment in the plan to ensure that every school is modern and digitally enabled and the use of digital technology, teaching, learning and assessment will be embedded.  There is a significant strategy on higher and further education and I welcome the particular focus on the new technological universities and the contribution they will make in upskilling and reskilling us for this new world.  I particularly welcome the clear commitment on the technological university for the south east, with the expansion of the footprint of Waterford Institute of Technology as well as a campus in Wexford.  Investment in cutting edge research has to be tied to that.  The Government established the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science not as an administrative Department but to drive research and prepare Irish society.  It is important that it have a key role within the NDP.</p> <p>I hope the emphasis placed on cybersecurity in the plan is not lost.  I was conscious the Minister mentioned that the &euro;10 billion allocated in 2020 was the largest sum for capital expenditure ever announced by a Government.  While that is welcome, last week Grant Thornton estimated that cybercrime cost Irish business &euro;9.6 billion in 2020.  This year, we saw the largest cyberattack ever on a health service anywhere in the world.  In response to a Commencement matter last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, informed me that the ICT repairs alone had cost the State &euro;37.5 million to date.  This does not include the costs of delays to appointments and other disruption in the health service.  Our infrastructure will face further cyberattacks in the future.  This is an issue of national defence and security and, as such, it is right that it is placed at the heart of the NDP.  The plan places considerable emphasis on the National Cyber Security Centre and commits to increasing the centre's staff from 25 to 70 over a five-year period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I respectfully suggest that this number will be an underestimate in terms of the expectation of that centre.  Right across the Government, with all elements of infrastructure, we have got to ensure that the infrastructure is safe because there is no reason to think that were a malign state actor to decide it has a problem with the way Ireland voted in the UN Security Council on an issue, it would not decide to look at attacking some of our infrastructure.  Consequently, we have got to ensure that anything we create is as resilient as possible against that.</p><p>It is important, because often they are overlooked and the Minister mentioned the investment in arts and culture, to welcome the fact that our national cultural institutions are going to be a key part of our statement of Ireland as a society.  There is a clear commitment within the document to this matter.</p><p>Finally, I want to turn, as do most people, to the transport sector.  I specifically want to look at the key importance of Rosslare Europort.  We know that in the first nine months of this year alone, continental European trade volumes between Rosslare and continental Europe are up 378%.  This is where one talks about events.  That figure can be directly traced to Brexit but it was how Rosslare was able to respond to that.  Thirty weekly services now operate between Rosslare and continental Europe.  Our ports had to be prepared for Brexit and what happened there.  We have finally recognised the jewel that is Rosslare Europort.  It is the main Irish port for roll-on, roll-off traffic.  One thing that is key for that activity is entry in and out of the port and, therefore, we need the M11 motorway to be completed.  The project is not just regionally important; it is now of national significance in a post-Brexit scenario.  The project will also alleviate all of the villages from Oilgate and so on down to Rosslare.  It is essential that the M11 project is prioritised.  </p><p>I thank the Minister for his work.  The key challenge is around delivery but I am quite confident that he will lead that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#NNN00200"><p>I will be sharing time with Senators Dolan and Cummins.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his work on the national development plan.  It is important that we have a vision for Ireland in the years ahead and, more importantly, a commitment to capital infrastructure thereafter.</p> <p>I will be parochial and say that the people of Galway wait with bated breath at the possibility that Intel will come to an area of State-owned lands near Oranmore in Galway, which is the result of the foresight and vision of Galway County Council and its councillors to designate an area from Athenry to Oranmore as an economic corridor.  The land has been laid out with roads, car parks and adjoins or abuts the Galway to Dublin railway line.  There is huge potential for IDA Ireland to deliver the project for Galway.  Obviously the State will do all that it can to achieve that for Galway and Oranmore.  The potential in terms of investment by previous Governments in the Galway to Dublin and Limerick to Tuam motorways is there and is evident.  There is also great potential to extend the railway line from Athenry to Tuam and Mayo to bring people, should Intel decide to move to the location.</p> <p>One area that is lacking is the wastewater infrastructure, which was part of previous plans.  The Minister has said that this plan does not have an exhaustive list but the infrastructure was in previous plans in the form of the east Galway drainage scheme, which is east of the city.  I am sure that the project will cross his desk because it would be a major piece of infrastructure.  Galway has a young and growing population.  Moreover, as it has the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, and the new Atlantic technological university, the potential there for employees is also great.</p> <p>I often hear that Galway has been left behind other places such as Cork and Limerick when it comes to roads infrastructure and the Jack Lynch tunnel and the Limerick tunnel, and that progress for Galway has been bogged down by planning delays.  For example, previously the Galway city ring road and the Galway city outer bypass projects were with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a long time and have been delayed.  I am sure that both projects will cross the desk of the Minister, subject to planning approval.</p> <p>The Minister said at the outset that he had money unspent, which is always very difficult for politicians to hear because we have a range of projects on which we would like to spend money.  One of the projects that I have pushed, which is a general countrywide one, concerns community centres.  There are communities in Moycullen, Newcastle and Galway city that have planning permission and projects ready to go but that do not have money because there is no dedicated fund.  Unless a local authority has a sufficient rates base or whatever to develop projects, then there is no dedicated fund.  The Minister did put in place a fund, through the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, for upgrades of community centres but not for the establishment of new community centres.  If the Minister wants to spend money then there is potential for a sports capital-type project of a rolling fund every 18 months of between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million.  I am sure that there will be plenty of places that have new and growing communities but no community infrastructure, which is where there is potential and I ask the Minister to look at that in future budgets.  There is a lack of facilities and people say that there are houses but no amenities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#NNN00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Obviously the national development plan is exceptionally important for my own city of Waterford.  The ambition in Project Ireland 2040 to drive population growth within the south-east region and to have balanced regional development and interconnectivity between the regions is of critically importance.  I heard Senator Malcolm Byrne speak about Rosslare port and an essential part of that is the N24 link between Limerick, the mid-west region, the south-east region and onwards to Rosslare port.  It is one of the worst national primary routes in the country.  The Minister has his own interests in terms of the Limerick to Cork connection but the Waterford to Limerick connection is of critical importance to both regions.  In fact, it will connect the western seaboard across to the south east and link all five cities.</p> <p>The Government has earmarked &euro;110 million for the urban regeneration and development fund for the North Quays project in Waterford.  There has been very significant development across retail, apartments, office space and a transport interchange at the area.  Therefore, we need to see the project further developed along with investment in the new technological university in the south east and further investment in the University Hospital Waterford.  I will converse with the Minister separately on those projects and thank him for his interest in balanced regional development, which is very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#NNN00400"><p>I want to ask the Minister about hospitals, particularly in regional areas.  Portiuncula University Hospital is in the HSE's capital plan.  We have a 50-bed unit there that I hope will move on to the second stage of procurement and that construction will start in January or February of the coming year.  We have Roscommon University Hospital where there are many good things happening, such as the expansion of the rehabilitation unit that will be based in Roscommon.</p> <p>Ballinasloe has waited for 25 years for a primary school.  Planning permission will shortly be submitted and I ask that it will be part of the capital spend by the Department of Education.  Schools are crucial, particularly in regional and rural areas.  This particular school is a Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, level 1 school so it is an area of disadvantage.</p> <p>Finally, I wish to mention broadband and cycleways.  Broadband is an infrastructure that encourages people to live and work locally.  I ask that the broadband project is accelerated as much as possible.</p></speech>

It is an honour to have him in the House.</p> <p>On paper, the national development plan is the largest and greenest plan we have ever seen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has said that himself.  It is most welcome.  It is delivering on the Green Party commitments to future-proof the plan and deliver for climate, communities and equality.  It is not going to be an easy decade.  If nothing in the plan commences, this will leave us in a much worse off place.  It is important that we see action on this plan because on paper it is very good.  The plan shows commitment to supporting sustainable job creation and contributes to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of communities most affected by the transition to a low-carbon future.</p><p>I live in the middle of nowhere in west Clare.  Rural dwellers will be most vulnerable, not just through land loss from flooding and climate mitigation but also with rising fuel costs.  There is an unfairness there.  When I come to Dublin, I can get a Dublin Bike, DART or Luas.  There are lots of options.  I work with Cycling Safety.  There is pretty good infrastructure here in Dublin but down in Clare we are hard pressed.  Yesterday, I nearly opened a bottle of champagne because we had five bike lockers in the county.  There is a very different animal in rural areas.</p><p>I was looking at the figures.  One fifth of our carbon emissions come from transport alone.  The total emissions are 12 Mt.  Of that total, 8 Mt, or two thirds, comes from private car owners.  Given that private car owners in rural areas are responsible to a great extent for carbon emissions, when we talk about the national development plan and funding, we must make sure we see the financial backing to match that when we invest in transport.</p><p>We had a meeting with the NTA recently, but I was disappointed with its lack of vision about what needs to be done for transport in rural areas.  Thanks to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, we have a big increase in public service obligation, PSO, services and Local Link services, but not everybody has a Local Link or a PSO service passing their door.  There is a whole other piece around rural roads, speed on secondary and tertiary roads, and how we get to buses, which only stop in towns at the moment.  We need rural bus stops, bike racks on buses and proper vision in this regard because we have seen it work in other countries, where one can hail a bus and one does not have to go to one's local town.  Lots of rural dwellers might live 10 km or 12 km from a town or village, so how do they get there if they are supposed to be relying on expensive fossil fuels?  There is a huge piece there that we need to look at.  The State bodies will have to catch up with the reality of what we are facing in the next ten years.  Otherwise, the money will be badly spent.</p><p>Now is the time for significant investment in greening the country and the economy.  They go hand in hand.  Larry Fink, the billionaire, wrote to all the multinationals and said "climate risk is investment risk", and that they should not be investing their money unless it is climate resilient.  He said that climate resilience equates with economic resilience.  It is no longer just the green thing that we have been going on about as a party for 40 years.  This is the reality.  We can forget about economic growth if we do not have climate resilience.  What good is money if it does not stop the land from flooding?  The farming community is losing so much land.</p><p>That is another aspect of the matter that we must look at as well.  I refer to the type of flood infrastructure we are putting in.  Hard engineering alone costs four times that of catchment-based solutions.  It has not solved the problem, it just shoves it on somewhere else.  If we want to invest, we must do so wisely as well.  I urge the Minister to bring that point back to the Cabinet.  The OPW's old ways of doing things are no longer sufficient and do not work.  A woman contacted me yesterday who lives in Ballyvaughan, which is a beautiful village near the sea.  Looking at predictive maps, in 2050, it will be under water.  She asked me what the Government is going to do about that.  She knows she has to move inland.  This is not a green issue, it is about homes and farms as well.  The national development plan is good.  It is the greenest ever, but that is for a very good reason.</p><p>The western rail corridor has the potential to revitalise the entire west.  We talk about rural development.  Every time I speak, I will talk about what we need in rural areas.  There is a train to Ennis, once in the morning and once at 3 p.m.  The morning train at 6.50 a.m. is packed with students and people going to Galway, but we need more trains and there is a commitment in that regard in the plan.  If these projects are delivered, they will change the country and give us the protection that we need if we are to face climate change head-on and the economic threat it will bring.</p><p>The green transition fund will drive decarbonisation.  We had a very successful meeting with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, who has committed &euro;22 million to the SME sector.  I made a pre-budget submission on how to decarbonise and digitalise SMEs and he agreed to it.  I am also seeking that the Oireachtas committee would bring in people such as the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to speak about the circular economy and Seamus Hoyne, who is working hard on how we help small businesses survive the new challenge we face due to hikes in the cost of fossil fuels.  We can forget the carbon tax.  It is such a minor detail in the overall scheme.  Fossil fuel costs are increasing.  It is either a green future or no future.  That is how serious the situation is now.  For that reason, it is great that the national development plan is so green.</p><p>The digital transition is going to play a significant part too.  In Clare, we are leading the way on digital hubs to encourage people to have microbusinesses that are going green as well.  I am taking my seven minutes.  There is a huge piece there on the circular economy as well.  It is great that we have a Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who has responsibility for that area.  Some good work is being done in the area which will lead to so many more jobs if we take the circular economy seriously.  I met a great man today, by accident, who is designing and making bikes in Ireland.  We have a huge part to play in manufacturing.  We saw at the beginning of Covid that we could not even make our own masks.  There is something about us being resilient as a country and in doing so we will create more jobs and will be resilient as a nation.  I look forward to seeing the NDP rolled out and coming to fruition as soon as possible.  I wish the Minister the best of luck with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#OOO00200"><p>I say "Goodbye" to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  While I welcome many aspects of this plan, I am deeply disappointed, as we see major rail and light rail projects being kicked further down the road.  I will talk about Dublin initially.  The MetroLink and Luas connections to Lucan, Bray and Poolbeg are all stalled for at least another ten years.  Despite the rail line to Navan being the largest single issue raised during the strategy's consultation, a shovel will not be lifted this side of 2031.  Meanwhile, the DART underground, a project that was originally considered in a 1972 transportation in Dublin study, has been shelved altogether, but might be revisited after 2042.  That is a mere 70 years later.  To be frank, 70 years thinking about one project is unbelievable.</p> <p>I want to focus on a couple of key questions.  It is a pity I have just missed the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, but I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will do his best to respond to me as well.  My questions relate to the mid-west.  As the Minister of State is aware, the proposals on the M20 are now for an N-M20.  This is a major concern because, way back when I was in college &ndash; God knows that was long enough ago &ndash; Ed Walsh spoke about the Atlantic corridor, right beside it, as a balance against Dublin.  He called for proper regional development based on Limerick, Cork and Galway being linked together, one hour in travel in either direction from Limerick.  We need a motorway to make that happen.  An "N" road simply will not do it.  The Minister of State might answer one simple question for me.  Which is it going to be?  Is it going to be a motorway, which is what has been promised for more than a decade at this point, including by the previous Government, or is it going to be a series of N roads, which would be a very different proposition?  That is crucial, because people are travelling in both directions every day for work.  It is a hell of a commute.  I did it myself for a while.  It is not easy.  However, it is more important in terms of the bigger picture and creating a proper balance across the west coast to Dublin.  That was the vision Ed Walsh had, which many of us share, and we need to see commitment and delivery in that regard.</p> <p>That brings me to one of the key points about the national development plan.  There are lots of good things in it, but we do not know which projects are going to be delivered.  As the Acting Chairman, Senator McDowell, said a few weeks ago, it looks like a wish list.  None of us knows what is going to be delivered.  Some 18 months into the term of this Government, we are now waiting for a strategic rail review to tell us more.  How long is that going to take?</p> <p>I will give a practical example.  There are good references to local rail development in Limerick.  However, if we are serious about delivering rail in Limerick, we must make a double track between Limerick and Galway, which would mean there would be a spur to Shannon and that we could have regular services in both directions.  That is a big undertaking and investment.  The worst outcome would be some kind of half-hearted one whereby we would continue with a single track rail between Limerick and Galway and then an occasional train, perhaps on a spur, ten years or so later to Shannon.  That will not work.  Shannon Airport needs a direct link with a regular service.  That is the level of detail that we are looking for that we do not currently have.  At least the N-M20 is mentioned.  The northern distributor road, which is a central piece of architecture for Limerick city, has been dropped from the plan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That does not make any sense.  We have massive problems in Limerick at two ends of the city.  We have people backing off onto the motorway each way at the Mackey roundabout because they cannot get onto the roundabout.  It is not just private cars.  The future of cross-city public transport would be greatly enhanced by a northern distributor road but it has been dropped from the plan.  I noted a line in the Minister's speech when he said it is important to note that the NDP is not an exhaustive list of projects to be undertaken over the next ten years.  That is okay, but surely it is significant whether something is mentioned or not.  If it is not significant then it really is just an empty list.  To me, it is deeply significant and deeply worrying that the northern distributor road, which is a key piece of architecture we have been waiting for decades, is not even mentioned.  It looks like a case of Limerick being forgotten, again.  I must also mention the lack of a decent strategy on national aviation policy, which is going to be key, particularly in regard to Shannon Airport.  The existing national aviation policy is six years old and is not fit for purpose, particularly after all we have been through and this also has not been dealt with in this national development plan.  Again, it could be said that it has not been mentioned but we are going to deal with it, in which case, what is the value of the document?  We need much more detail.  </p><p>The other thing that really worries me is the lack of timelines.  We have a wish list of projects but we do not know when they are going to happen or how long they will take.  It does not look like the detailed policy document we need.  I can accept that the Minister will provide more detail but we need to know when.  We need to know when that strategic rail review is going to be completed.  We need to know the detail of the projects.  I mentioned before about the Ballybrophy line in Limerick.  This is a simple win for the Minister.  This is a line that is almost completed.  It has 8.5 miles of track that need to be upgraded to complete it.  At the moment it is scheduled to take another four years to do so.  If the funding was rolled up to get it done next year we could start increasing the speed on that service and adding additional services.  That is an easy win for commuters across Limerick and Tipperary.  I urge the Minister to consider that.  That would be a concrete project that we could see results from.  </p><p>Cycling infrastructure in Limerick is absolutely appalling.  As anyone who has cycled through Limerick will know, there is a cycle network, developed on a piecemeal basis, and lanes suddenly end in the middle of nowhere.  On Parnell Street, there are loading bays to the left of the cycle lane, so that trucks and cars constantly come in and out while people try to cycle.  What we have lacked for years is an integrated network.  Is that going to happen?  What we lack at the moment are details and timelines, and I hope to see those very quickly because otherwise it is going to be a wish list and we will end up disappointing people.  The problem with an NDP like this is, there are many good things in it but there is a lack of detail on when it will be delivered.  In particularly I would like an answer in regard to that Galway-Limerick train track.  It is essential that becomes a double track, that we get a spur into Shannon to support Shannon Airport and we start building commuter services between Galway and Limerick.  Let me emphasise, we need a motorway in Cork and I would like clarity in regard to that.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#PPP00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth for coming to the Chamber.  I also thank the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, for his presence earlier.  When the Minister, Deputy McGrath, came before the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach last week, he made a number of comments, some of which I would like to pick up on.  He highlighted that the national development plan sets out the broad direction for the investment priorities over the coming decade, that at its core, the national development plan is a high level financial and budgetary framework and that the national development plan is the largest and greenest plan ever delivered in Ireland.  Of course it is and you could not disagree with any of that.  If we look a bit further, we see this repeated statement that the national development plan is about aligning the Government's fiscal framework with the Government's climate ambitions.  Most of us in this House and indeed the D&aacute;il are clear on the absolute need to meet our emissions targets and cut emissions by 51% by 2030.  We are clear on the ambition and the targets.  However, it is telling that in the detail regarding retrofitting within the national development plan, there is a recognition that &euro;28 billion has to be spent on bringing our housing stock up to a sufficient standard over the next decade, and yet the Government is only committing &euro;8 billion in direct expenditure funding to that.  The Government has acknowledged that almost a quarter of our housing stock, that is, 500,000 dwellings, need to be retrofitted.  That is a recognition that housing accounts for 12.5% of emissions in the State and that it has a significant role to play in emission reduction.  However, the NDP indicates the overwhelming reliance will be on private households and landlords to stump up two thirds of the cost of retrofitting the housing stock in this country.  That is not good enough because it fails to recognise the extent to which many households do not have the spare capacity to invest in retrofitting.  They do not have the discretionary spend left over at the end of the week.  All of us here talk to young families who are paying a very large share of their income on childcare, to the person who has spent years saving to buy a house of his or her own or the older person living alone who depends on a small occupational pension.  It is not good enough because it fails to recognise the scale and pervasiveness of fuel poverty and households living in energy-inefficient homes throughout the State.</p> <p>This is an important issue to me because in the areas I am most familiar with in Dublin 1, 3, 7 and 9, there is a massive issue with energy-inefficient homes.  This imposes additional costs on those who own those homes and particularly on those renters who cannot do anything about the energy bills they are facing and those who are struggling to make ends meet.  We know from the data of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, data on domestic energy ratings based on the 2016 census that those living in Dublin 3, 6, 7 and 8 were the most likely throughout Dublin city and county to be living in a G energy-rated home.  If we think about that, the aspiration is to bring homes up to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 and yet in Dublin 7 alone almost one in eight houses has a BER of G BER.  As the Minister of State is aware, there is a world of difference in the cost of running a G energy-rated home relative to a B2 standard.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, estimates that the annual difference between running a two-bedroom apartment that is G-rated versus a B2-rated apartment is nearly &euro;2,500 while for a three-bedroom semi-detached house, the difference is &euro;3,200.  Not only is it five times more expensive to run a G-rated household, it also generates more than five times the level of emissions.  Going back to the national development plan, there is a commitment to put equity, inclusivity and fairness at the heart of the prospective national retrofitting plan and yet there is a major gap between the detail and the fine words in the climate action plan and in the national development plan.  We heard the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the D&aacute;il two weeks ago talking about how critical it is that the money this country had saved would have to go into the national retrofitting plan.  He is right.  Many households have saved money over the past year.  I acknowledge there are issues about dead-weight loss and that those who can afford to retrofit should be able to but what about the households badly hit by job losses and lost earnings and that now must start out again having been out of work for so long?  Where is the recognition for that?  When I read the national development plan, the repeated focus is on private finance and loan guarantee schemes to fund retrofitting.  I firmly believe that is short-sighted and wrong because it will ensure that fewer households than necessary will have their houses upgraded.  There are many households which simply do not have the means to take on additional debt, no matter how low the interest rate or over what duration it is spread.  They will need grants.  While the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme provides 100% grants, it is for social welfare recipients whereas for the Better Energy Homes scheme, applicants need to have money to be able to access money and support.  </p> <p>I will conclude on a more positive note and say that in my own area and right across inner city Dublin, there are many examples of people coming together to put forward proposals.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Phibsboro Village Climate Club has done enormous work in looking at the energy profile in the area.  It says that if we installed PV solar panels on 10% of the 7,800 houses in the in the area, we would be able to reduce the energy bill across the whole area by 20%.  The impact of that alone on people's lives would be enormous.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for listening.  As someone within both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, he has the wherewithal to put in place the sufficient supports and grants to ensure that those who want to retrofit can do so.</p></speech>

I will touch on some of the other environmental and climate aspects but retrofitting is one of the key issues here.  It is something we could get right but I am concerned that the mechanisms with which we are approaching it at the moment are not the right ones.  That comes down to questions like value for money and so on.  It is disappointing, for example, that &euro;49 million of the recovery and resilience funding we received from the European Union specifically for green measures as direct money - a grant, not a loan - went to banks to de-risk them giving loans for retrofitting, instead of going directly into the retrofitting of our public buildings and schools.  It could be argued that the banks will give larger loans but we should not need to be motivating the banks on this.  We should be making it clear that these are the investments that pay off for banks.</p> <p>At a macro level, we saw at the climate talks that one of the most dangerous narratives is the idea that states should pour all their money, or a huge amount of it, into de-risking private investment, which will then engage with those aspects of the climate transition that may be profitable.  That is something we cannot afford to do.  Many changes are going to be opposed tooth and nail but when there are positive changes that people want to make and are popular, like retrofitting, the State needs to lead.  That is not simply about private housing, although that is one issue.  I was concerned to hear the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications talking about schools taking out loans for retrofitting.  Our schools should be retrofitted by the State.  The State would then save on the energy costs in schools, as well as having the benefits for our children.  That is an example of why it is important how we do this.</p> <p>There are many positive elements in the Supporting Excellence report, which I have read.  However, while it refers to public private partnerships, public-public partnerships are still missing.  We have memorandums of understanding about public-private partnerships but not about public-public partnerships.  So many of the things we are trying to do as a State will require co-operation between public bodies inside the State.  Other governments are trying to do the same thing right across the European Union and the wider world.  We need to be looking at public-public partnerships as a way of driving forward new ways of developing and delivering national infrastructure and national services.  I urge the Minister of State to look to public-public partnerships as part of this piece.</p> <p>On value for money, I am concerned by the references to the balancing of environment with value for money and the balancing of quality with value for money.  Quality is about value for money.  The Minister of State knows this because we have engaged on this issue.  Quality is value for money.  It is not something you balance against value for money but something that means we are getting the best for the State from what we spend and that we are getting the benefits and dividends.  They may not take financial form but may take social or environmental form or may be in costs saved in other ways, such as costs saved in climate-related fines or costs saved in areas like health and so on.  This is where the dividends come through.  They may not fit within a financial model but they are value for money for the State.</p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware of my legislation.  It will move through slowly but a lot of these projects are going to be happening much sooner than that.  I urge that he consider one of the key proposals in my legislation, which is that any major public works projects over the &euro;5 million EU threshold would have a price to quality approach balancing both those things and a minimum of 50% quality.  That is how we avoid cases like the national children's hospital, which had a 75% price weighting, meaning that the lowest price was always going to do it.  I note the new proposals for the period between tender submission and award, but I respectfully suggest that the period in the design of calls for tender is the crucial one.  The design and decision within that about what approach will be taken and what weightings will be given is the crucial period if we want to deliver capital for the many millions of euro that will be spent in this plan.</p> <p>I will highlight three or four specific issues.  I have mentioned my concerns about retrofitting.  The piloting is inadequate and we need to be doing it on public buildings.  I urge that we also introduce a combined product of retrofitting for climate but also for universal design so that we address the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, obligations we have as a State at the same time.  When we design in a way that is more environmentally sustainable we should also be designing in a way that is more equitable because we have that obligation under the UNCRPD.  A combined retrofitting and adaptation grant would be welcomed by older people and people with a disability who spend more time at home and are more susceptible to high heating bills.</p> <p>I raised this next matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform just a week ago at the finance committee but it has moved along since.  The shadow price of carbon is being tracked, but does that include embodied carbon?  It is important that embodied carbon is measured.  France has now brought in regulations in that regard and it will have the EU Presidency so that is the direction of travel for the EU Commission.  Measuring embodied energy is about measuring not just the cost of construction materials but the emission costs of demolition.  If you demolish a building and it is going to take 65 years to get the savings back, those are the 65 years in which we need to act on climate.  We cannot afford a front-loading of emissions in that regard.  I urge that Ireland lead on that and that we include scope 3 emissions in the shadow price of carbon.  We know we are going to need to do that from Europe so let us get ahead of it.  It would also help if we looked at the refurbishment of construction materials as part of that more responsible approach.  That would address some of the costs of those construction materials because we know they will continue to expand.</p> <p>On the strategic rail review, I urge that the recommendation of the climate committee noting that we are doing cost-benefit analysis on rail wrong be taken on board because, frankly, the cost-benefit analysis on the western rail corridor was flawed.  It is regrettable that that was not included in the Europe TEN-T funding projects.  There is another round of TEN-T funding coming and Ireland should be submitting rail projects for that EU funding.  If we miss this window and push these a decade down the line we will have yet again missed the opportunity for EU funding for national infrastructure and rail infrastructure, as happened when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, was Minister for Transport.  I urge that this be addressed and that the issue of freight also be addressed as part of the rail review.</p></speech>

When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was speaking earlier, he emphasised the fact that the national development plan was all about deliverability.  Unlike sceptics who want to deride the vision for Ireland, I am a firm believer that we will see the very essence of this plan delivered and in doing so we will help the communities we all represent.  The plan sets out that large blueprint on where we want to go as a country.  When it comes to deliverability, which we all speak about, we know that the statutory agencies we have established on the ground across this country are key to ensuring that deliverability, whether that be in access to transport through the NTA, housing, the environment, planning through our councils and regional planning guidelines or through investment.  That is what turns the vision into reality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many schemes in this document will have cross-departmental advantages, in particular things like urban regeneration.  That is a substantial component that does so much.  Having identified swathes of dereliction in our towns that happened because of building on the outskirts, urban regeneration is good for our environment, helps our urban spaces and helps to consolidate growth.  It ties into the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's functions, new housing schemes, and bringing people back to live in our urban centres again.  The plan, unlike other plans, ties Departments together and achieves goals that we want to see, and which we talk and pontificate about, become a reality.  It is an incredible and honourable plan in that respect.  It involves investment in our food sector, which achieves what so many people talk about in terms of sustainability for our rural communities.  It would create employment in these areas, using the employment opportunities that exist and continuing to invest in them.</p><p>Some large-scale projects were mentioned here.  I am happy that there is a commitment to the Navan rail line on page 87 of the national development plan.  There is a commitment to fund the advancement of that.  By the time of the publication of the plan, I noted that it was contingent on the National Transport Authority endorsing it.  I go back to what I said earlier, that we need the statutory agencies we have established to deliver these things for us.  I did not come here to pontificate about it, or to grandstand and make speeches.  I bothered my ass to engage with the National Transport Authority over years to identify what it required from a planning point of view to make this viable.  We knew that what was required was identification of population growth in key areas that would justify the expenditure of &euro;1 billion to extend the line.  It was spearheaded by Meath County Council and its chief executive officer, Jackie Maguire.  A month later, when the NTA published the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, I was extremely happy to see that it "will" deliver the Navan rail line.  It did not state, "shall," "might," or "we will look at it in the future," but "will".  Of the 4,000 submissions received by the National Transport Authority, 2,000 came from the people of Navan, which showed the level of engagement by the public.  There is public hunger to engage with the Government and agencies when they work properly.  This shows the importance of aligning critical documents and people understanding the process, which we are all involved in.</p><p>I believe that we will see the delivery of this project and others far sooner than those who like to deride it think.  Planning is the most significant aspect.  When the Taoiseach visited Navan with me two weeks ago and stood on the platform, he said that if we get the planning process right, we will see things happen far sooner than people might think.  The Navan rail line can be delivered far more quickly than some of the more problematic projects listed in the NTA's strategy.  That is why I am confident that we will see that project, along with a host of other projects in the national development plan, delivered, operational, and improving the lives of the people we all represent.</p></speech>

The national development plan is important to all of us.  I regret what the plan states about the N20 and M20.  When Project Ireland 2040 was launched by the previous Government in 2018, it referred to the M20.  In this plan, it refers to the N20 and M20.  I cannot reiterate enough how important this road link is.  I recently met someone who had to go by ambulance from Limerick to Cork and it was not a pleasant experience.  The road needs to be built.  I welcome that much is said about the rail link.  One thing that is not given much emphasis is the rail link from Limerick to Adare.  The Ryder Cup is coming in 2026.  I know that a feasibility study is to be done about the rail link in Limerick, whereas it is mentioned that rail links will be built in other cities, including Dublin and Cork.  I would like to see a link to Shannon Airport.  I agree with Senator Gavan about the Ballybrophy line.  Many people travel to Limerick daily.  Eight miles of the line are left to be upgraded.  It does not make sense to upgrade it so far and then leave eight miles for the next time.  It would be beneficial if this could be committed to.  Regarding the Limerick 2030 plan, the Living City initiative is about getting people back into our city centres.  These are important things that have to be committed to under this plan.</p></speech>

Some 3.3 million people live in that part of the island of Ireland.  It is expected to be 4 million people by 2030.  It is paramount that high-speed rail becomes a key priority for that corridor.  That is what I will put in my submission on the strategic rail review, when I take part in a consultation process.  It should be a key priority because it is not just about creating jobs in Dublin and expecting everyone to commute there, but about having a two-way process.  It is about being able to attract people from Dublin to come to work in Drogheda, or people from north County Dublin to come to work in Dundalk.  It is also about encouraging people from Dundalk or that part of the north east to work in Belfast or Northern Ireland if job opportunities are provided there.  It has to be a two-way street.  If this project is meant to be successful by 2030, which I think it will be, it will be successful if we are able to balance the regions.  We are creating jobs in those regions but we have to make sure that jobs are easy for people to take and accessible from where they are currently living.  If we can do that, this project will be a total success.</p></speech>

I have two issues to raise.  I think that we should regionalise our energy production.  On the west coast, we had the finest wind speeds in the world, yet there is not a single pylon or wind turbine along the west coast.  If we regionalised the production of wind energy along the west coast, then we could move our data centres and big energy users to the region.</p> <p>Getting things done in this country, though we have all these plans and so on, is too cumbersome and slow.  If this Government did anything, it should streamline the public service and Civil Service when addressing issues such as planning.  A planning application that is sent in at the moment could take five years before the development is complete.  In this day and age, that is ridiculous.  It is too long and too cumbersome.  The Government should look at that.</p></speech>

As a Donegal man, it would be remiss of me to stand here without mentioning the approval of the mica scheme by the Government.  It is welcome and we will speak more about that another time.  I am somebody who has taken a keen interest in the national development plans.  The concept of the national development plan has come to the fore since the early 2000s.  I was always taken with the fact that Northern Ireland was always somewhat blanked out in our national development plans.  Similarly, in proposals in Northern Ireland, there was no connectivity in the thinking, mention of interdepartmental activity, or recognition of cross-Border infrastructural or economic needs.  I welcome the Government's approach, both in this national development plan and generally.  It has been driven by the shared island initiative, in particular.  The thinking has changed somewhat.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In my early days as a councillor, I used to occasionally travel to Dublin with a deputation to meet the then Taoiseach to discuss the N2-A5 road project.  It used to baffle me that we could not get the same recognition for the north west as other parts of the country enjoyed.  Motorways were built to Galway, Limerick, Cork and even to Waterford on routes that carried far less traffic than the N2-A5.  However, progress has been made and I compliment the Ministers, North and South, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, on their collaboration to move the project forward.  We hope to see progress on the N2-A5 in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>Similarly, with regard to the rail line and rail review which numerous speakers raised, I was delighted to learn from speaking to the Minister and the Minister in the North that collaboration is now taking place and terms of reference have been set for the rail review.  The shared island unit has brought the whole concept of speed rail to the table.  Initially, the M1 corridor, to which Senator McGahon referred, was very much on the table but, thankfully, the scope of the review has broadened to include that area of Northern Ireland west of the Bann that was neglected for decades during the Troubles.  This has been recognised by the inclusion of the Derry to Belfast line in the review, which is very welcome news.  I hope this will bring back the rail connectivity we once enjoyed in Donegal.  I never travelled by train to Dublin but some of those who went before me spoke about doing so.</p><p>This evening, at a meeting with a number of colleagues from the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, there was discussion about greenways.  There is a strong emphasis in the national development plan on the development of greenways, and rightly so because we have a great tourism trade and the Wild Atlantic Way has really taken off.  There are major opportunities for tourism in other areas to take off.  These include many regions along the Border.  I ask the Minister of State to take back to the Government my view that the local authorities need to take a joined-up approach.  There is a bit of a fight taking place to secure funding for different greenways.  A master plan is needed for connecting up the various greenways.  That would be the smart thing to do.  The Government needs to address this issue because there is no point in having nice greenways when there is no connectivity.  There has to be national approach to this.  I would like to see that approach taken by the Government.</p></speech>

I come from Longford and I have two major areas of concern with the NDP.  It commits to a funding ratio of 2:1 for public transport versus road projects, which means there will be significantly less funding for roads projects over the next number of years.</p> <p>I want to highlight the extension of the N4 from Mullingar through Longford towards Roosky and Leitrim.  Many Members of this House and the D&aacute;il are prioritising road projects in their local areas.  I would ask them to look at a map of Ireland and our road infrastructure.  We are seeking balanced regional investment across the regions.  Members will be struck by the missing link on the map, namely, the road to Sligo and the entire north west.  Significant funding of hundreds of millions of euro has been provided for works on the N5 from Castlebar to Longford and on the N4 between Sligo and Roosky and Leitrim.  However, the missing link is the Mullingar to Roosky piece.  This project went to preferred route stage in 2008 but was later removed from the national development plan.  It was included again when Project Ireland 2040 was announced by the previous Government.  The project is now at a stage of identifying, hopefully in January, a preferred route.  I want to see it prioritised because the entire north west deserves to have the same infrastructure as the rest of the country.</p> <p>As I said, the national routes run from Dublin to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway but the north west is the missing link.  That applies not only to County Longford but also counties Westmeath, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal.  I ask that this project be kept at the top of the agenda?  I will raise the matter in the House as regularly as I can for as long as I am a Member of this House.  I want to see that road operational.</p> <p>I will also point to another development in regard to the rail network which was identified in the NDP.  This was a project to upgrade the Sligo line, but only as far as Mullingar.  Longford town is probably the first commuter town for workers travelling to Dublin.  With the advent of working from home, significant numbers of people have come back to Longford and bought houses to work from home and travel to Dublin on one or two days a week.  We want to take cars off the road.  The proposed investment in rail will only go as far as Mullingar whereas, as I said, the first commuter trains travelling to Dublin on that route start in Longford.  That section of the route needs to be prioritised as well.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his time and ask him to bring the points I raised to government when these matters are being discussed.  The most important point is that the N4 route must be the main priority for the Government with regard to roads funding.</p></speech>

This is an important and ambitious plan for Ireland and, more importantly, for the regions.  In the context of what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, is trying to achieve, with a modal shift in traffic from cars, then this plan is to be admired and supported.  However, the M20, the Cork to Limerick motorway, is of gargantuan importance to the development of the region in the context of connectivity.  I impress upon the Minister of State, the House and the Government the centrality of the Cork to Limerick motorway because if that project does not proceed or if it is diluted or changed, it will cause bother for a generation from an economic and socialisation point of view and from the point of view of investment in people and in the region.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, I fully support what the Minister is trying to achieve with, for example, Bus Connects and a light rail service for Cork, but this motorway is of absolute importance.</p></speech>

Transportation and agricultural issues have been discussed but health is also a major issue.  If we take infrastructure in the so-called regions, the last time a public hospital was opened in the second largest city in the Republic was 1976, the year I was born.  That shows the significant deficit we have when it comes to beds and providing for our growing population.  The Cork hub has seen significant development and infrastructure such as a new hospital hub is important for the city.  It needs growth and potential.  The Cork University Hospital, CUH, campus, which Senator Buttimer knows more about than I do, has reached capacity and the site has no further development potential.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We now need to look at a greenfield site for a hospital so we can develop the services required for our population, which is, like all of us, going one way.  It is a very significant issue that we have to address.  It has been discussed for so long, some 40 or 45 years at this rate, that a new green site for a hospital is not appropriate if we are to have sustainable development, which will not be about making sure that Dublin has all the major hospitals.  If the second biggest city does not get a new hospital in the next five years then, unfortunately, regional development will stall very quickly.</p></speech>

I welcome all their contributions and Senators' ongoing engagement with the revised national development plan.  Some important issues were raised.  I welcome the opportunity to clarify and elaborate on these in particular.</p><p>Now that the NDP has been published, this is a critical time across all Departments in delivering on their strategic goals.  In saying that, my Department is now focused on a number of key areas in the process of project delivery.  Governance over our investment and ensuring value for money from our public finances in delivering on this NDP is key as we move into the implementation stage.  This is something that I have emphasised the importance of, and that my Department has focused on, since the revised NDP was launched last month.</p><p>Since the publication of the revised NDP, we have welcomed a framework of external scrutiny and appraisal through the external assurance process, which includes setting up a major projects advisory group and the announcement that five external members will be added to the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  These steps are essential in ensuring rigour in project assessment and progress of ongoing developments.  While we have put these safeguards in place, we must remain agile in the delivery of this plan when challenges occur, and be forward-thinking in our approach to delivery.</p><p>The national investment office in my Department is working on improvements in delivery capacity through the build digital project and implementation of the supporting excellence action team, SEAT, report with this strategic foresight lens.  This is a whole-of-government plan and one which will require ongoing investment beyond the lifetime of this NDP.  I acknowledge the high levels of engagement and commitment in the development of this NDP across all capital Departments.  It is also imperative that we continue to engage closely, and work in collaboration, with the construction sector to deliver on our Project Ireland 2040 aspirations.</p><p>The investment strategy we have laid out in this NDP will have a transformative impact on the future of our employment opportunities, economic development and regional growth.  It will not only deliver the infrastructure requirements for a growing population but will also sustain wages and jobs, modernise our construction sector and allow for regionally balanced growth throughout the country.  It will support Housing for All and create the infrastructure required to help us become a climate resilient society.</p><p>The purpose of the NDP is to give greater certainty and confidence to citizens of the State in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue to improve in areas such as housing, climate change, schools, hospitals and public transport.  It further gives public and private sector organisations confidence that funding commitments will continue over the next decade on an upward trajectory to allow them to plan and equip themselves to deliver.  The NDP sets out a clear long-term strategy of planned investments of &euro;165 billion over the next ten years.  It is an ambitious plan, one that will provide the infrastructure needed to accommodate a growing population and a digital transition of our economy, and will tackle the climate challenges we face as well as our housing requirements.</p><p>In response to concerns about specific projects and programmes that may or may not be mentioned in the plan, the NDP does not aspire to be a comprehensive list of every project that will be delivered over that period.  The Government will continue to work with our sectoral stakeholders in formulating sectoral plans for prioritising investments and developing projects for approval and implementation.  The NDP will provide this certainty to sectors to allow them to do this planning over the medium to long term.</p><p>I thank Senators for their views on ensuring that the NDP delivers value for money for the State and mitigates the risks of cost overruns.  The Government can and will continue to learn from the mistakes of the past.  The PWC report commissioned to investigate cost overruns in the national children&rsquo;s hospital highlighted shortcomings in the process and procedures that were in place in the planning, procurement and contract management of that project.  Two of the 11 recommendations were also the responsibility of my Department in order to provide a more rigorous assessment of risk and governance prior to projects being approved and to provide an external challenge function to project proposals.  As of late 2019, these reforms have been fully implemented in the updated public spending code, with greater focus on the project risks in Government for major projects of more than &euro;100 million, of which we will have approximately 50.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, this month I announced a further enhancement of the external challenge function for major projects, with the establishment of the new external assurance process, EAP, to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages.<b></b>In my Department, a new major projects advisory group has been established to further strengthen project management of public projects.  It is important to say that the public spending code remains open to ongoing improvement over time, and staff within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have a series of improvements in planning to further enhance its effectiveness.</p><p>One series of amendments involves updating the public spending code to reflect the enhanced climate ambition.  My Department has a full programme of works to ensure that the code is compatible with the climate action plan targets.  In the first instance, the priority will be on significantly increasing the cost associated with any release of additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  This will require primary research to estimate the marginal abatement cost that will be faced by Ireland to achieve an emissions reduction of 51% by 2030.  </p><p>In addition, my Department has commenced work with the OECD, funded by the EU Commission through the Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support, DG REFORM, technical support instrument, on evolving two further aspects of the public spending code.  First, work will be progressed on a new model for assessing the emissions impact of infrastructure investment, including the induced carbon demand brought by new investments.  There currently are no plans to address scope 3 or supply chain emissions at this point, but further enhancements to the consideration of carbon in the public spending code will continue to be progressed.  Second, the work will examine how the Government should consider and appraise investments that may be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and how best to protect infrastructure from the effects of climate change.</p><p>A significant increase in our climate action investments is planned in the NDP.  Some &euro;5 billion in additional carbon tax receipts over the period of the NDP has been allocated to increase capital investment levels in energy efficiency, including a retrofitting programme of 500,000 homes to building energy rating, BER, B2 standard.  In addition, &euro;360 million annually will be allocated to active travel programmes for walking and cycling infrastructure and greenways.  Major public transport investments are planned in each of the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, along with improved public transport in rural areas.  A strategic all-island rail review will be progressed over 2021 and 2022 to assess the priorities for rail with a focus on access in the north west.</p><p>Every Department was required to perform a climate and environmental assessment of every measure they put forward for inclusion in the revised NDP.  Seven relevant climate and environmental outcomes were selected by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Departments performed a qualitative self-assessment to determine the potential impact of every spending proposal they put forward may have on each one of these outcomes.  The seven climate and environmental criteria are: climate mitigation; climate adaptation; water quality; air quality; waste and the circular economy; nature and biodiversity; and just transition.</p><p>With reference to future tenders, interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts will be introduced in December which will, within certain parameters, reduce the level of risk of extraordinary price inflation that contractors will have to bear.  These will address the period between tender submission and award through limited indexation of the tender price, reduce the fixed price period to 24 months and permit mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15%.  Boosting delivery capacity in the medium term will also mitigate some of the resource pressures that are currently evident. </p><p>To deliver the ambitious NDP, the Government will continue to work collaboratively with the industry through the construction sector group and will offer support as set out in the building innovation report.  The recently published Housing for All plan further complements the drive to enhance capacity within the public and private sectors to allow Ireland to deliver its ambitious plans.  I am working with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and other Government colleagues to deliver this enhanced capacity.  In my Department, a &euro;2.5 million grant was recently launched to deliver the build digital project, which will be led by Technological University Dublin.  This will support the construction industry to deliver future public projects to a higher standard using digital efficiencies.</p><p>The capability of the public service to deliver the large-scale capital programme was also reviewed for the updated NDP.  The resulting report sets out actions to support excellence and improve co-ordination among various bodies, in addition to the quality and coherence of guidance provided.  A range of further measures to improve delivery include the development of the Office of Government Procurement&rsquo;s commercial skills academy to enhance procurement and introduce further legal and planning reforms.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank Senators for their discussion on the NDP.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#AAAA00200"><p>I want to express my appreciation to the Seanad for arranging this debate further to the discussions we had in the D&aacute;il Chamber last Tuesday and Thursday.  I reiterate my appreciation of the keen interest many Members of the Oireachtas have shown in this important issue.  The matters we are discussing are not easy to discuss but it is imperative we do so because survivors have waited a long time for an adequate response to the pain and suffering they have endured.  I know they appreciate the support of Deputies and Senators and their attention to these matters. </p> <p>As I have previously stated , the Government understands that there is no financial or service provision which could make up for what has been endured by so many people whose lives have been affected by the legacy of these institutions.  The shameful way that some of our most vulnerable women and children were treated in mother and baby institutions across the country has rightly caused an outcry.  Every day we learn more about the shocking treatment endured and how the effects of it continue to ripple through families today.  Every family has been touched in some way.  We witness the pain that is felt so deeply by those who have not been able to access information about their own origins, or who have succeeded in doing so but found the toll of the struggle to be substantial.  </p> <p>We recognise the importance of lifting the veil of secrecy and honouring those who suffered because their country cast them aside when they needed help and compassion.  The only acceptable response to this legacy has to be holistic and wide-ranging.  This is what the Government has committed to in its action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  Following the State apology last January for the profound intergenerational wrong visited upon mothers and their children in these institutions, significant progress has been made on a number of the actions in the action plan.  While we know there can never be enough put in place to make up for the decades of failure, the action plan represents the Government's sincere attempt to provide a remedy for the significant grief and anguish that exists.</p> <p>The plan encompasses 22 actions.  I stress that the mother and baby institutions payment scheme, while hugely important and the most significant scheme of its type in the history of the State, is just one element of the plan.  Consultation with survivors, including the consultation facilitated by OAK Consulting on developing proposals for the scheme, has consistently shown that all measures included in the plan are vitally important to survivors and their families.</p> <p>It is important to note that action 2 provided counselling support for all former residents.  That has been in place since before the publication of the commission's report.  The service has been strengthened with additional investment and an expanded out-of-hours service.  Work has also commenced under action 19 on establishing a patient advocacy liaison service for all survivors and I expect that to be in place next year.  The Department of Health is working with the Health Research Board, again under action 19, on a research project as part of The Irish LongituDinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, to identify the health needs of survivors.  This research will inform health policy and service provision.</p> <p>The Government has published the general scheme of a birth information and tracing Bill, which is currently the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny.  The proposed legislation will provide guaranteed access to an unredacted birth certificate and birth information for adopted people, persons whose births were illegally registered and other persons who have questions in relation to their origins.  It will also address access to records containing birth and early life information, provide a statutory basis for tracing services and provide for safeguarding of relevant records.  Consultation with survivors has shown that access to this information is the overwhelming priority need which has been expressed by people who as children were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family.</p> <p>In relation to institutional burials legislation and action 22, the Oireachtas joint committee submitted its report on its pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill in July and my Department is carefully reviewing its recommendations.  I hope to advance this legislation as quickly as possible to allow excavation of the site in Tuam to begin in 2022.</p> <p>Action 18 will see the creation of a children's fund to honour the memory of children who died in mother and baby institutions, through the provision of supports to children who experience disadvantage in the present day.  We have also committed to creating a national memorial and records centre and to memorialisation initiatives at local level, as well as the ongoing administration of a commemorative grant scheme in my Department to support survivor-centred advocacy groups in organising commemorative events.</p> <p>Actions 11 to 14 focus on education and research.  A number of education and research initiatives are also in train through the Department of Education, such as the consideration of how best to support schools in enabling students to learn about and understand this important and sensitive aspect of Ireland's recent history.  The Government has created a number of postgraduate scholarships in partnership with the Irish Research Council in memory of the children who died in the institutions.  These scholarships will cover research in the area of childhood disadvantage.  My Department has commissioned a team based in NUI Galway to conduct research on language, terminology and representation, which aims to highlight the stigmatising and labelling language that has been used in the past and to provide guidance on how to do better in future.</p> <p>Action 5 of the action plan allows for general data protection regulation, GDPR, right of access to commission records.  My Department has ensured that resources are in place to deal with subject access requests, SARs, in relation to the commission's archive.  We have already replied to over 300 survivor requests for access to this information.  I am aware that current constraints on access to health data contained in the commission's archive is causing distress to survivors.  I have engaged with the Minister for Health on this issue and he is now progressing new regulations that will allow for full access.  In the interim, there is an alternative option to receiving health data under GDPR.  My Department is advising applicants of the option to apply under freedom of information, FOI, to seek access to their health data and is providing support to survivors on this ground.  This is to ensure that requestors are made aware of all the options to access their health data and to provide data to requestors more quickly.  </p> <p>Action 8 of the action plan contains a commitment to enabling public access to original State files.  I have established a dedicated unit within my Department to lead on this work.  Through action 10, the Government has provided for the appointment of a dedicated archivist based in my Department to focus on the preservation of and public access to these essential records.</p> <p>Action 20 of the plan is the mother and baby institutions payment scheme.  Through the OAK-Ied consultation process and from my many engagements with survivors, they have made it clear they want a scheme that is non-adversarial, simple and based on trust.  The requirement for a low burden of proof was also a key issue raised.  This is what the mother and baby institutions payment scheme seeks to deliver in providing a general payment based on time spent in these institutions.  The scheme will provide a financial payment to all mothers who spent time in one of the institutions.  It will also provide a financial payment to those who were resident as children in one of the institutions for more than six months.  The payment is in recognition of the harsh conditions, emotional abuse and other forms of mistreatment, stigma and trauma experienced while resident there.  The scheme will provide an enhanced medical card to mothers and children who were in one of the institutions for more than six months.  These measures will benefit approximately 34,000 individuals to the value of &euro;800 million.  In doing this, the scheme goes beyond both the recommendations of the commission of investigation and the proposals of the interdepartmental group which was established to develop proposals for the scheme.  In moving beyond the broad redress measures included in the action plan, the Government has included proposals in the scheme to ensure that women who spent time in these institutions after 1974 are included, that all children who spent more than six months in one of the institutions, regardless of whether they were accompanied or unaccompanied, can gain access to a financial payment and that all women, regardless of the time spent in an institution, will be able to access a financial payment.</p> <p>While all  the work ongoing as part of the action plan is significant, I understand that there is a particular sense of urgency associated with the payment scheme.  The Government is committed to delivering the scheme as soon as possible and my Department is preparing a general scheme of a Bill as a matter of urgency.  In tandem, work is taking place to make arrangements to establish the executive office within my Department to administer the scheme once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas, in order that the scheme can begin accepting applications as soon as possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have committed to prioritising the applications of survivors who are most elderly and other survivors who are particularly vulnerable.</p><p>I would like to thank this House for its time this evening to debate this important matter.

At the outset, I thank the Cathaoirleach for inviting me to chair this session.  It means a lot to me and I am particularly pleased to be in the Chair.  Little did I think I would be here at a particularly important juncture like a debate on this topic.  I thank the House for the privilege.  I call on Senator Murphy from Fianna F&aacute;il.  He has five minutes.</p></speech>

It is nice to see him in the Chair for this debate.  I know how passionately he has spoken about this issue since I have come to the Seanad.  It is appropriate that he is in the Chair.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister to the House on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  We welcome this discussion today.  Even though it is just a discussion on the mother and baby institutions, it is so important that we use every opportunity to assure and to reassure the people that we are taking this matter seriously and that we are moving swiftly on it.  Sometimes when a Government comes into power, such matters are addressed and it says it is going to do this, that and the other.  However, in fairness, there has been swift action on this matter.  I am sure that will continue.</p> <p>Earlier this year the Taoiseach apologised for this terrible episode.  He said at that time that the State did not uphold its duty of care and thereby failed these women and children.  He acknowledged that an apology alone was not enough but only a first step.  The Minister said today, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte earlier this week, that there are no easy answers when it comes to providing a remedy to the significant grief and anguish caused to the women and children who spent time in these institutions.  My good colleague, Senator Warfield, and I were just discussing this outside before the debate started.  It is heartbreaking for the people who went through all of this.</p> <p>In many respects, it is not possible to replace what has been lost to survivors.  No financial reward or no service provision can take back the hurt, the loss and the distress that were suffered through decades of failure.  Nevertheless, the Government is earnest in its wish to provide an enduring response to the priority needed for all concerned.</p> <p>The Government made a number of commitments in January 2021 to respond to the priority needs and concerns of those who spent time in those institutions.  In the 11 months since the report of the commission of investigation was published, we have seen the advanced legislation to allow the exhumation at Tuam.  We have seen the draft legislation allowing access to birth and early life information and to open the commission&rsquo;s archive to more than 300 survivors.  As the Minister said, work is under way to establish a national memorial and records centre related to institutional trauma during the 20th century, as well as the creation of a children's fund to honour the memory of the children who died in mother and baby homes by providing supports to children who experience disadvantage in the present day.</p> <p>On 16 November 2021, the Government approved proposals for the mother and baby institutions payment scheme and published an action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby county homes institutions.  As said by the Minister, he will provide approximately 34,000 former residents of the institutions with a financial payment and 19,000 with an enhanced medical card.  It goes well beyond the recommendation in the final report of the commission of investigation.  In terms of estimated beneficiaries it will be the largest scheme ever of this type in the history of the State, valued at &euro;800 million.  People might say that there is a lot more to this than the financial aspect of it.  However, the financial aspect is truly important as well.</p> <p>I trust the Government will act swiftly to progress the legislation underpinning the scheme and will design it so that applications from older and vulnerable survivors will be prioritised.  Consultations with survivors highlighted that they wanted the scheme, as the Minister said, that is non-adversarial, simple and based on trust.  Adopting an approach that does not require applicants to bring forward evidence of abuse or harm suffered was the aim of mitigating to the greatest extent possible the risk that applicants would be retraumatised by engaging with that process.  To achieve this goal, the payments will be based on residency, as Members will know.</p> <p>Significant contributions will be sought from the relevant religious congregations towards the cost of the scheme, and I welcome that as well.  This is one element of the overall Government response to the needs of survivors through a variety of commitments, including counselling for all, access to information and records, memoralisation, financial payments, health support and other key initiatives.  The Government is committed to advancing those actions in a survivors-centred manner and to ongoing engagement with dialogue with survivors.</p> <p>This is an important debate.  It is important that we continue to discuss these things.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement this evening.  As I said earlier, I hope things will move swiftly for the sake of the people who have suffered way too much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#BBBB00400"><p>The Minister is very welcome to the House.  I thank him for the sensitive approach he has taken to deal with this specific issue.  The society I grew up in took young women who became pregnant - and they did not become pregnant on their own - and sent them off to institutions.  The society I live in today likes to blame those institutions for the way those women were treated.  The first time RT&Eacute; did a documentary on Bessborough House I got a phone call from a woman I knew as a young girl in Galway who, like many young girls in Galway, went away for a holiday.  Of course, everybody knew what the holiday was.  She rang me to tell me how upset she had been about the documentary the night before.  I said, "Instead of being with a family in Cork, you were in Bessborough and how horrible it must have been for you".  She said, "No, step back for a moment.  Actually I was treated very well there."  She said some people were treated terribly, but she was treated very well.  She said, "I had my baby and the only regret I ever had was that I had to give my baby up for adoption."  She was there for a number of months.  She said that some people were very kind to her and some people were very cruel.  We must take this on board.  This is somebody who was there.  We must understand that not everybody who worked in these places was brutal and that not everybody sent there was mistreated or ill-treated.  We must look back into ourselves and ask ourselves what sort of society were we that we allowed this to happen.  It is right and proper that the State steps forward and takes full responsibility for those who suffered.  In terms of the suffering I am talking about, yes, there may have been physical and mental abuse in these institutions, but the greatest suffering of all that they have had to live with all their lives is the loss of the child that they had.  We have heard stories of people who got married afterwards and the child they had had been put up for adoption.  The couple lost the child.  Not only did the child lose their mother and father, he or she lost his or her family as well.  That is something we have to take on board.</p> <p>As we progress through this, there are mothers in Ireland today who are petrified.  They have had a secret all of their lives.  Many of them are now elderly.  They have kept that secret from everybody, including their spouse, their children and their siblings.  Nobody ever knew they were pregnant.  Nobody ever knew they gave birth.  Those women today are faced with and confronted by the rights of the children they delivered.  That is something on which I know the Minister has worked very hard to try to reconcile the issues.</p> <p>I ask that the Minister remembers that the fathers who fathered those children have walked away scot-free.  Nobody will ever know who they were.  Many of them took up important roles in society.  Many of them went on to do great things.  The one thing they did, which is unforgivable, is they left the girl they impregnated and left her on her own.</p> <p>The society we live in today is not much kinder to a single mother than it was then.  The only difference now is that we do not chuck them into institutions, and we do not take their children from them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a huge amount to learn with respect to the treatment of mothers and the fathers who desert those mothers.  No woman should be left to bring up a child on her own.  These fathers who abandoned their girlfriends and sent them off to places and institutions around the country, not one of them will ever be called to account for their actions and for the most part, nobody will know who they were.  It is really sad that this has become a gender issue and that the people who will have to pay the price and confront the demons of the past are the women on their own. </p><p>The Minister pointed out that many of these women are now elderly and, as such, need to be compensated quickly and with as little pain as possible.  No amount of compensation can compensate for the pain of losing one's child so all we are trying to do is show that we care in some small way.</p><p>As far as I know there is a group of women who are not covered by the scheme.  These were the women who were sent to families and not institutions.  However, they suffered the same pain and suffering.  They lost their child and they will not see that child again.</p><p>Finally, we have stipulated a demarcation line of six months for babies and I really think that needs to be revisited.  If you were born into an institution your future was already set in train and you had no choice, so the six-month limit needs to be waived completely.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his sensitivity, kindness, hard work and determination to bring this matter to a conclusion.  There will never be a satisfactory conclusion because no matter what money is paid or what compensation is given, it will never make up for the trauma and absolute depravity with which some of these women have been treated.  The reality is that this trauma lives with them until the day that they die and that is the case for the vast majority.</p> <p>I acknowledge what Senator Craughwell said and agree that there are stories where people were treated with kindness.  One must be fair and acknowledge that not everybody who worked in these institutions were monsters.  Unfortunately, a significant majority of the women who have been in these institutions were abandoned by their families, by society, by their communities and by the State.  When these women became pregnant they were shipped off to these institutions where they gave birth.  In many cases, the way in which they were treated after giving birth was barbaric.  They were forced to breastfeed other children in order that they would not become attached to their own children.  They barely saw their children before they were put up for adoption.  Many of these women ended up staying for years in these institutions but for the rest of their lives have lived with the scars of how they were treated.  Many of these women are elderly and in poor health.  Is it possible for the Minister to hurry matters up?  The year mentioned is 2023.  These things take time but is there any way that the Minister could create an interim arrangement to support those women who are in poor health?</p> <p>In terms of the medical card, surely we do not want these women to go through the standard primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, system of applying, providing information and possibly being turned down so having to appeal and all of that.  Can the Minister put a dedicated team in the PCRS unit to deal with this matter?  It is a simple thing that would make a huge difference because these women have suffered enough and we do not need them to suffer any more.  I ask the Minister to put in place an interim arrangement for payments and to make it easy to acquire medical cards.</p> <p>As for the children, Senator Craughwell referred to the threshold of six months and while I do not disagree with his analysis, perhaps there is a rationale for stipulating six months.  I ask the Minister to look at the matter again.  We are committing &euro;800 million and it may not cost a huge amount more to do the right thing.</p> <p>I wish to mention the children who were boarded out.  These are children who were sent out as child labour - as child slaves if you like - to farms and into businesses.  The term used to describe boarded-out children was that they were "in service".  Some of them were treated with love and did get care but, unfortunately, they were in the minority.  There is a lacuna in the Minister's proposals in terms of how we deal with children who were boarded out after being born and so would not have met the six months criterion.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the Minister on how he might sensitively and appropriately address the matter.</p> <p>The Minister has had held meetings with and engaged with the religious orders.  I ask him to update the House on how those engagements went. Just over 20 years ago, there was an arrangement with the religious orders that quite frankly was a disgrace.  What they paid in a different context was a tiny fraction of what they should have paid and that cannot happen in this context.  The religious orders owe society but the Government owes it to the citizens of this country to make the religious orders step up to the plate and do what they need to do in order to address these matters.</p> <p>Finally, I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, on the work that she has done in terms of engaging with mothers and children.  Unfortunately, she cannot be here today and I am here to fill in for the Senator.  On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I note - as I am sure everyone else in the House would agree - that she has worked extremely hard with the Minister and in this House on this issue.  It is a privilege for me to represent her in this very important and sensitive debate.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his work and experience of these issues.</p> <p>At lunchtime today, I visited the National Gallery of Ireland to see a striking portrait of Catherine Corless, particularly ahead of the statements tonight.  Her portrait was painted by Paul MacCormaic as part of the portrait competition that has been mentioned in the press.  I want to recognise Catherine Corless, and all of the human rights activists and historians who have been relentless in their search for truth.  As I am not sure if I have done so before, I want to take the opportunity to do so tonight.</p> <p>The RT&Eacute; documentary entitled "The Missing Children" deserves a mention and the stories that it told are heartbreaking.  I thank everyone who took part in the documentary whether they did so in order to get justice or to remember and show respect for their loved ones who died or in order for society to grieve and wrap our arms around those who endured these institutions.  There have been many moments when people in this country have been brought to tears by the stories of survivors and their families.  The documentary is one of those moments where people in their homes across the country would have shed a tear.</p> <p>I will never forget an episode of "Questions and Answers", which was presented by John Bowman, in 2009 when a former mayor of Clonmel, Mr. Michael O'Brien, spoke about institutional abuse.  I do not think that many people in the country will ever forget that moment.  I was 17 years of age when I watched the programme and I was greatly moved by the testimony.</p> <p>I commend the Minister on the education and research initiatives being undertaken through the Department of Education on how best to support schools and enable students to learn about and understand this important and sensitive aspect of Ireland's history.  I commend the Minister on these extremely important initiatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> In these moments, we want to comfort survivors and give them our full attention.  These people are not to be messed with.  They are our fellow citizens.  They may be our neighbours, families or friends and I hope we can do right by them, particularly those who will not be with us for much longer.  With that in mind, there are significant issues in respect of the redress scheme as it stands.  The first such issue is the exclusion of infants who spent less than six months in a home.  The second is the exclusion of women who spent less than three months in a home from accessing the enhanced medical card.  The third is the exclusion from the scheme of children who were boarded out.  I would welcome a response from the Minister on those issues.</p><p>The Minister referred to the debates in the D&aacute;il last week.  I do not wish to discuss the other House, but several calls were made for the Government to do a number of things.  I will not go through the motion tabled in the Lower House as I do not have time to do so, but several calls were made on the Government last week.  As the week has gone on, has there been an update on any of those issues?</p><p>I am conscious the Minister has inherited these responsibilities.  He is not the person responsible for the commission of investigation.  He inherited this work from his predecessors, some of whom failed to deal with these issues, but I know he has the empathy required and would have the support of the Oireachtas in terms of making the necessary changes to the scheme.  He would have the full support of Sinn F&eacute;in in doing so.  I would welcome a response from him regarding any developments that have taken place since the motion in the D&aacute;il last week.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Labour Party grouping, I express my sincere sympathies to all survivors and their families. We have received, as has every Oireachtas Member, an enormous amount of communication on this issue.  We have met and spoken to survivors and affected persons and their families.  Even when walking through the corridors of Leinster House, I have stopped and spoken to people who have been deeply affected by this issue.  I want to put on record my personal thanks to those who have taken the time to speak to me and my colleagues about such a personal issue.  I thank them for being so generous to share their personal experiences in order to ensure their voices are heard and there is adequate redress for survivors.</p> <p>The proposals on the table in respect of redress were made in good faith by the Minister and the Department, and that work should get recognition.  I welcome many aspects of the scheme.  In particular, I welcome that the scheme will not require evidence of abuse or harm.  Instead, it will be a more straightforward and accessible process.  I also welcome that it will be a non-adversarial process.  It is important there will be no gagging clause.  That was a painful aspect for survivors of the residential institutions before the redress board was established.</p> <p>As all present are aware and as has been highlighted in the House, however, there are outstanding issues.  The scheme should be made more inclusive.  My D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock, proposed an amendment in February which would have given an entitlement to an enhanced medical card to women and children who spent any period in an institution. That entitlement would be without the six-month criterion.  I do not really understand why the six-month criterion is an issue.  I do not get why it is there.  On behalf of the Labour Party grouping, I ask that the Minister brings those who spent less than six months in institutions into the enhanced medical card scheme.</p> <p>Another issue for us is that of the six-month minimum term being a requirement to access the programme and the exclusion of children who were boarded out.  My understanding is that the measures are expected to cost approximately &euro;800 million but, obviously, there has been criticism in respect of the six-month figure being an arbitrary one.  Many would agree that it is perpetuating discrimination and excluding 24,000 children. I do not understand why it is being included.  The Minister may be able to give more reasoning on that.  The six-month deadline is arbitrary.  Any person who spent even a day in one of those institutions and who has to carry the trauma, stigma and societally mandated shame that came with being associated with one of them deserves our apologies, but also deserves redress.  Although the six-month deadline may be necessary from a budgetary point of view, I do not think it is appropriate in this case.</p> <p>When we talk about mother and baby homes, we are talking about one of the worst instances of human rights abuse in Irish history.  That system was cruel, unusual and torturous for many who survived it.  Although there are concerns in respect of the cost of managing a fund that would encompass all persons who were affected by the system, we have to realise that what we are trying to address is far more important than a budgetary item.  The deficit of compassion that existed in Ireland at the time of the operation of this system is the gap that we are now trying to fill.  It is important that we do so correctly.</p> <p>I will briefly address the issue of who will pay.  There is no point in beating about the bush on this one.  Religious orders and church authorities were highly culpable in the running of these institutions.  All present are conscious from the experience with the previous redress scheme that religious authorities have not always paid their fair share.  As such, I am glad to hear the Minister is planning to meet or may have already met the religious orders.  I may have misheard his remarks in that regard.  I hope that engagement was or will be fruitful.</p> <p>We have the opportunity to show the survivors of these homes the compassion and care that was so cruelly missing for decades.  We are a wealthy nation by any standard and have the opportunity to provide compassion.  This compassion will never erase the trauma with which many survivors still live but it could go some small way to easing the burden of that trauma.  I hope the Minister will be the champion of that compassion in government, at Cabinet and in his Department for those in need of this assistance and those who need someone to advocate for them, listen to them and elevate their voice.  That can be and is a role for the Minister.  Obviously, he is fit to meet that challenge and he will be bolstered by other sympathetic members of Government and, undoubtedly, unanimous support from the Opposition in both Houses.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to ensure we do not let this be the conclusion of this proposal,.  We must ensure that it includes children who were born in a home and those who were boarded out, that it deals with the medical card issue and that the Minister takes on board the concerns of affected survivors and goes back to Cabinet and the Department to find the means to make this truly an all-encompassing programme.  I believe that he wants it to be such a programme, as do all Members of this House and, most importantly, the survivors.</p></speech>

We owe them thanks because they have driven us to try to become a better State.  I thank them for that.  We owe them the absolute best response but, unfortunately, the scheme as it is set out now is not the absolute best response.</p> <p>It is very important that we resist the narrative of there having been good actors and bad actors within these institutions and the idea that people may have had a good or a bad experience.  The key thing is that this was institutional abuse.</p></speech>

With all due respect to the experience of individuals in Bessborough, let us bear in mind that in the 1940s Bessborough had a mortality rate of 68% for children.  That is what matters.</p> <p>As regards the redress scheme, the Minister knows that during the heated debate on birth information and tracing I and other Senators made clear that any redress scheme must have no gagging order, no indemnity and no waiver.  There is a waiver.  That is a problem.  The inclusion of a waiver contravenes international human rights, under which there should always be legal recourse in the courts and that should not  be precluded.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has stated that compensation must not be seen as a means of buying the silence or acquiescence of survivors.  Rather, it should be part of a comprehensive justice policy.  It should not be a replacement for justice, but part of a comprehensive justice policy.</p> <p>The inclusion of waivers is a mistake.  All present are aware that in previous schemes, such as that relating to Caranua, for example, a significant amount of money was left unspent because the waiver set the bar too high and operated as a barrier to people.  I do not think everyone eligible for the scheme will go for it when there is a waiver because people want their legal rights and their right to justice.  I have several specific questions on the waiver.  It was stated that there is no gagging order.  Can the Minister fully confirm there will be no restriction on anybody who signs a waiver speaking publicly?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The scheme is calculated on the basis of residence in a home rather than abuse.  In that regard, I presume the waiver will not in any way preclude somebody from taking legal action relating to abuse, since abuse is not covered and is not part of the calculation.  People need to be able to take action on that.</p><p>Will the Minister clarify whether signing the waiver will be required to access the medical card?  It certainly should not be.  This last point is crucial.  Will this be a waiver only for the State or for State and non-State actors?  If non-State actors are in any way protected by this waiver, that is an indemnity scheme and the whole scheme would just become another one of those.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.  I am hoping it is not the case.  As previous speakers have said, the contribution from religious orders and the pharmaceutical companies is outstanding and must be addressed.</p></speech>

They profited from this period, committed abuse and must be accountable if there is to be any sense that we are moving forward as a State.  With respect to the Minister, meeting the religious orders is one thing but other legal measures should be looked at if necessary.  Again, those who created shell companies to hide assets, not back in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s but in recent years, must be dealt with because that is a continuation of abuse.</p> <p>I have four other questions.  I am concerned about the matter of work.  Others have mentioned child labour and the labour of women who were forced to board out.  The phrase "work payment" is a dangerous one because it implies the State is paying for work.  It is of course not compatible with the working time Act.  It should not be a work payment.  This is a compensatory payment.  In the calculation grids I have seen it should be made explicitly clear this is not considered as appropriate payment for work done.  It must be framed as a compensatory payment for the inappropriate forcing of labour.</p> <p>I refer to the six-month cut-off for children in the redress scheme.  Over 30 clinicians have told us that is not how childhood trauma works.  It is arbitrary.  Ms Samantha Long, who has been an extraordinary spokesperson on this issue, has made clear that a two-tier scheme damages everybody.  I mention trauma within the period of two or three months.  How does that capture, for example, illegal adoption, separation or the possible death of a sibling?</p> <p>Another crucial issue is the enhanced medical card scheme.  As for cutting women off from that scheme because they spent three or six months in an institution when they went through birth, let us remember the testimony from Bessborough where women were not given an anaesthetic.  They were not given painkillers because they were meant to suffer.  That happened in the first week or day in these homes.  That is within the first three months.  Are we saying those women should be separated out and not given a medical card?</p> <p>I have a number of points but I will suspend them.  On information, I ask that the Minister please listen to independent experts.  Tusla's measure in bringing in the social statutory instrument from the 1980s sends a regressive message.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to the House to speak on the mother and baby homes.  I also welcome his decision to visit Tuam to meet survivors.  He and his team have engaged in in-depth consultation processes with many of the survivors and groups advocating on their behalf.</p> <p>This is a shameful part of our history which has left a tragic legacy.  As public representatives, it is we who must stand before people, answer for what happened in the past and rectify it.  In the report of the confidential committee we read about the lived experiences in the testimonies of the survivors.  Those testimonies are our history, which will stand in the time to come, of how women and children were treated in Ireland.  We are here now and as I think Senator Hoey said, we are a wealthy country.  It is a very different world now.  I do not know if we can even imagine the poverty in Ireland in the early years of the State.  We should consider the level of emigration in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.  That poverty led to the societal attitudes of the time and the State becoming intertwined with the church.  It led to a lack of oversight and so many other things.  The poverty of that period was shocking but we are fortunate to be in a better place now.</p> <p>As I pay tribute to those affected, I must mention that people are still suffering in silence and have been able to come forward.  There are still very many who have not spoken about this.  I highlight for the people who are listening to us that there are helpline numbers and counselling supports available.  There are telephone numbers in each county, available through the HSE, and also the Connect Counselling freephone service, which is available on 1800 477 477 from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.  Speaking about all this abuse is bringing many memories to the surface.  Many people care coming to us, including from other residential institutions, to speak about the suffering and abuse they endured.  Those counselling services are available for everyone who is going through this.</p> <p>The scheme is an action plan for how we will go forward and a commitment on behalf of the State to an overall scheme of roughly &euro;800 million.  The Minister mentioned that an estimated 34,000 people will qualify for financial payments and more than 19,000 will be eligible for an enhanced medical card.  As he said, those survivors who are vulnerable and elderly will be prioritised for payment.  I welcome that as it is absolutely crucial.  People living outside Ireland will be able to access this scheme and survivors will be free to speak about their engagement with it.  I welcome these measures.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned the postgraduate scholarships, in partnership with the Irish Research Council, for research into childhood disadvantage.  These will stand to us in the future in how we deal with disadvantage.  The Minister also spoke about a programme which will analyse stigma.  That stigma is very strong.  In the past, the worst thing in the world was to be an unmarried mother.  Society shunned unmarried mothers and families abandoned and put them out the door.  I sometimes ask where the stigma is today.  Who in our society is suffering from that level of stigma because I do not know if stigma totally disappears?  That is important.</p> <p>On the payment scheme, urgent access is indeed required.  The Minister mentioned that there will be an annual report to follow progress across eight themes.  Of the 22 actions, 13 of them are in progress.  Will the Minister speak a little about the patient advocacy liaison service?  How will this service support people who use it?  He also spoke about Tuam and the memorialisation service.  For people in counties Galway and Roscommon, the Tuam home is just tragic.  I do not know how to put things into words when I think of that home.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I begin by extending my continued solidarity to those who endured these institutions and who continue to campaign for justice, truth, support and redress.  I thank Senator Dolan for reading out the relevant numbers because it is important when we are having a discussion such as this that we are conscious of the fact that it can retraumatise.  It is important we sit back and listen and also reinforce the message that there is support out there for people.</p> <p>I agree entirely with the forensic questions posed by Senator Higgins.  I share the sentiment she expressed around the institutional nature of what went on in these places.  Without wishing to diminish any earlier points made by colleagues about particular individual experiences, there is a bigger issue at hand here and one we need to address from an institutional point of view, where our approach to this issue is concerned.</p> <p>I will make a couple of points.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This State and successive Governments, going back decades, have failed the women and children who were treated most cruelly and inhumanely in mother and baby homes, county homes and institutions.  It is time to respect the survivors and families.  It is time to do right by them and ensure the redress scheme meets their needs.  Survivors bravely came forward and told their stories because they needed justice and needed to see it done publicly.  Many feel betrayed and let down by the appalling way the scheme has been designed.  There is no recognition of the hurt and trauma experienced by children separated at birth from their mothers.  The payment scheme excludes people who, as infants, spent less than six months in a mother and baby or county institution.  I thought Senator Higgins made an interesting and important point about when we define the trauma as happening.  If a person was only in an institution for six months, did the trauma occur at the child's removal from his or her mother?  Was it on the loss of a sibling or was it during the abuse the child suffered, in whatever form it took?  Who came up with that arbitrary timeline of six months?  It baffles me.<br/><br/>The scheme has created a hierarchy of suffering.  In the North, speaking after the publication of the Truth, Acknowledgement and Accountability report in October, deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill MLA, said:</p><blockquote>	This is an important day of acknowledgement recognising the suffering inflicted on mothers and children in Mother and Baby institutions, Magdalene Laundries and workhouses.  This was a shameful episode in our history right across the island - women, girls and children were wronged by Church and State.<br /><br />I know from speaking to survivors that the trauma felt by people within these homes was further exacerbated by the years of denial and silence that they have faced.  The Truth, Acknowledgement and Accountability report published today is very clear on what needs to be done to deliver for victims.  Our task now is taking these recommendations forward, listening to the victims and ensuring they receive proper support, including redress and a full public inquiry.  I will do everything in my power to make sure their voice is heard and that these recommendations are implemented. </blockquote><p>In November, the deputy First Minister reiterated her position, stating:</p><blockquote>	Given the urgent need for a public inquiry into Mother and Baby Homes, Magdalene Laundries and workhouses, I have proposed that the Executive Office take responsibility for a public inquiry into Mother and Baby Homes and its findings.  Victims and survivors should not have to wait a day longer for the public inquiry and redress.  I am calling on the DUP to back this proposal without delay to ensure that victims and survivors are properly supported. </blockquote><p>What engagement has the Minister had with his colleagues in the Executive in the North about the redress scheme?  The church certainly was not organised or operated on a partitionist basis like the two states.  Many women and children were moved north to south and south to north.<br/><br/>In recent days, my colleague in the Assembly, Linda Dillon MLA, has welcomed the move by the health minister in the North to make it illegal for mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and workhouses to destroy the personal records of women and children who lived in them.  The Government here needs to genuinely listen to the survivors and urgently review the redress scheme in terms of the time-based criteria; the exclusion of so-called boarded-out children; access to enhanced medical cards; the proposed payment rates; the proposed time limits; the failure to include all mother and baby and county homes institutions, agencies and individuals involved in forced family separations; and the legal waiver attached to the scheme.<br/><br/>The Government must also seek immediate recourse from religious orders and pharmaceutical companies to the redress scheme.  It must ensure that all time limits are reversed and that boarded children are included in the payment scheme.  Those boarded children, now adults, must be included in the enhanced medical card.  The hurt and trauma for the mothers and children involved in unlawful forced separation must be recognised by the Government and investigators.  After decades of abuse inside the mother and baby homes, decades of neglect by the Government and religious orders and those in society entrusted with protecting the most vulnerable, those affected are making the most reasonable and moderate demands.  The Government needs to end the drip feed of misery and act decisively and conclusively to ensure the needs of those affected are met to their full satisfaction.</p></speech>

Before I call on the Minister to reply, there were several mentions of the name Catherine Corless.  That was a common theme.  I would like to acknowledge, as I am sure everyone here would like to acknowledge, that, as was covered in the press, Ms Corless received a Red Cross lifetime achievement award two days ago for her work in Tuam and her advocacy around this whole area.  We acknowledge that and wish her well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-30a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021113000002#FFFF00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson for his ongoing contributions and his often wise words in this area.  I thank all Members of the House for their contributions on this issue.  It was valuable of Senator Dolan to call out the numbers for the support schemes.  That is important and I echo her reminder that those supports are there for all survivors of institutional abuse.  Victims of mother and baby institutions get priority access to counselling.  That is free counselling and it is available during the day and out of hours.  The Senator called out the number for the out-of-hours services but there are also services available during the day and survivors get priority access.  It is important that the scheme is in place and has been since the start of this year.</p> <p>Senator Dolan noted that back then Ireland had a deep level of poverty, a poverty we will never know.  It was not only material poverty.  What we are now dealing with was a poverty of kindness that existed in these institutions.  I agree with the point Senator Higgins made that irrespective of individual positive stories, of which there are some, we are dealing with mass institutional failings by these institutions, the congregations that operated them and, ultimately, the State that oversaw the situation.  That was why the apology by An Taoiseach was made on behalf of the State.  The action plan sets out 21 other actions that come in behind that apology to demonstrate that it is not just words but a set of actions in response.</p> <p>Senators raised issues with elements of the institutional payment schemes, including some of the criteria to be used.  That was also the case in the D&aacute;il and some survivors and advocacy groups have also raised issues.  I acknowledge that those concerns have been raised.  I have received approval from the Government to bring forward legislation on the basis of the scheme I have laid out in this House and the Lower House.  There will be a legislative process and an opportunity in both Houses to debate and discuss the various elements of the scheme.  I will address where we are coming from on some of those points as I go through it.</p> <p>I absolutely recognise what a number of Senators have said about the need for speed and the need to ensure that we can start making these payments at the end of next year, in light of the age of a significant number of the survivors and their need to access the wider range of services that the enhanced medical card will provide.  That is why it is important for us to implement a single application process for both the medical card and access to the payment scheme, when it is proved that the person concerned spent the requisite six months in an institution.  That is the proof required to access the medical card.  It will not be the usual process for a medical card.  This is a different statutory scheme and I hope that will speed up the process of delivering the medical cards.  I know that was an issue raised here.</p> <p>A significant number of Senators raised the issue of engagement with congregations.  At the time the commission report was published, I wrote to all the congregations and informed them I would be seeking to engage with them on an apology, their contribution and the provision of records they may have.  We made a determination that the most important issue was to design the scheme and commence the drafting of the legislation.  I have subsequently written to the congregations seeking meetings and I will meet all them in the coming weeks.  This will be the start of a negotiation, I have no doubt, and I am cautious and will not discuss specific approaches here, as I think everyone will understand.  It is essential that the congregations make a substantial contribution to this scheme.  In the same way the Taoiseach's apology will not be seen as more than words if it is not followed through with a range of actions the Government will bring forward, the apologies from the congregations, which I acknowledge a number of them have made, will count for little in the eyes of survivors if they are not followed up by a demonstrable contribution to this scheme.  It will be on that basis that I will be engaging with them.</p> <p>Senator Higgins raised some issues about the waiver.  I can confirm there will be no gagging order.  Survivors will be fully at liberty to disclose the financial payment they receive, should they wish to do so.</p> <p>Wider questions were also asked about the waiver.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The waiver will be signed at the end of the process, survivors will know what they are being offered, including financial payments and medical cards.  They will be able to make a determination if they feel the protection of their legal rights is better achieved through litigation against the State.  We will provide them with financial support to access legal advice at that point.  They will get legal advice to assist them in making that determination.  That is an important element of the design of the waiver scheme.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred to my engagement with Northern Ireland.  I have had a number of engagements with the Executive, including the Minister, Robin Swann, and I met Judith Gillespie late last year.  Following the publication of the commission's report, I met the then First Minister, Arlene Foster, and the deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill.  We discussed the commission of investigation's report.  Subsequently, at meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council in its health configuration, which have continued although the other councils have not, this issue has been discussed.  The most recent one was about a month ago.  We had a substantial discussion about the truth panel that the Senator spoke about.  There is continued engagement.  We have committed that it will be a specific item at the next health council, to look at opportunities for increased North-South co-operation.</p><p>A number of Members spoke about access to information, which is a fundamental issue for many adopted people in this country.  Since a judgment in 1998, we as a country have been unable to grapple with it.  A pre-legislative scrutiny report on the information and tracing legislation is being negotiated by the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which has done fantastic work.  A number of its members are in this House and have committed themselves to this.  I believe that this legislation will address the issue of people having a legal right to unredacted copies of their birth certificates, birth information, early life information, medical information and any items that may have been left in an institution for them.  That is the element that we have focused on.  This mechanism deals with those whose births were illegally registered in St. Patrick's Guild.  There will be a clear statutory basis for a tracing service to enable agencies to provide better tracing.  It also provides for the protection of records.  A significant number of records are still in private hands, which is dealt with in the legislation.  This legislation will allow us to finally grasp an issue that has evaded Governments for more than 20 years.</p><p>As Senator Conway said, it is right to acknowledge that there were mothers in these institutions who kept that secret.  It is not for me or anyone else to speak as to whether that was right or wrong.  It was what they felt they needed to do.  Some of them are concerned about the prospect of that unredacted information going into the hands of their children who were subsequently adopted.  We are looking to get that balance right.  We have decided, and I think everyone in this House agrees, that people's right to know their origins is central and it cannot be undone or undermined any more.  We have to ensure that the manner in which that information and the legal right to it is provided to those who were adopted, subject to illegal birth registration, or boarded out, is done in a way whereby it provides some recognition of the other set of rights.  In situations where a mother does not want her identity to be known, there are two sets of rights, which are the right to identity for adopted people, which has been denied for too long, and the right to privacy for the mother.  We are trying to do that in a respectful way in the information and tracing legislation.</p><p>A number of Senators spoke about Tuam, about Catherine Corless, and her contribution to revealing what happened in Tuam and, as such, starting this conversation about mother and baby institutions.  I know there is real frustration in Tuam that the remains of those infants continue to lie in that tank.  I share that frustration.  I acknowledge the groups, and Catherine Corless, are frustrated with me as Minister that this has not been addressed yet.  We brought forward the draft of the certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) Bill in January of this year.  It underwent six months of pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas joint committee.  It was right that a delicate Bill was given real consideration by all members of that committee.  It sent a report to my Department at the end of July.  It was a challenging report that sought substantial changes.  We have engaged with that, with the Attorney General and with other Departments.  I hope to be in a position early next year to bring forth the final draft and introduce it into the Houses on Second Stage in order that we can begin the process of passing that legislation.</p><p>I believe that we can get the agency that would be created by that legislation established next year and that we can start the excavations at Tuam next year.  We all need to understand that the exhumation and identification of the remains will be a lengthy process.  We have to be honest about that but I want to see that started next year.  There is a provision in the budgetary allocation for my Department for the initial costs of that agency.  A number of Senators have been to the site.  I have read about it and seen the documentaries.  Senators have spoken about how the impact is only felt when people are at the site and realise that the remains of hundreds of children are just under their feet.  They were treated in a way that none of us believe is acceptable.  Irrespective of whatever our religious or philosophical views are, I do not think that anyone believes that what has happened there is acceptable.  We need to move quickly to address that.</p><p>A number of Senators raised the issue of people who were boarded out and I will make a number of points in this regard.  Any child who was in an institution for more than six months and was subsequently boarded out from that institution will be able to apply under this scheme for the time in that institution.  They can apply for the medical finance, medical card and the financial payment.  Children who were boarded out are not excluded from this scheme.  They get their financial payment and medical card if they were in a mother and baby institution for more than six months.</p><p>On the wider issue of those who were boarded out, I have met some individuals who were boarded out.  They told me stories of the severe physical and sexual abuse that they suffered.  They have publicly stated their disappointment that this scheme does not address the time for which they were boarded out.  This scheme is designed around the investigation into mother and baby institutions.  That investigation took five years and looked in significant detail at each of the 14 mother and baby homes and four of the county homes, then drew conclusions on the other county homes as a result of that.  As part of that investigation, the commission met those who had subsequently been boarded out.  Some of them told personal accounts of great brutality.  Some had different experiences of being boarded out and were adopted or brought into those families.</p><p>Our scheme is designed to deal with the trauma, the harsh institutional conditions and the stigmatisation of mother and baby institutions.  If people were in these institutions for a period of time, they get a payment.  As I have explained previously, that has been done to make this simple and easy to access.  The type of individualised assessment that we would need to do for people who were boarded out and their experience does not meet what we are doing with this scheme.  It is my view and that of the Government that the needs, understanding and experiences of those who were boarded out do not match what we are trying to do with this scheme, which is to have it be simple and easy to access for survivors.  It does not require proof of abuse, testimony or cross-examination; all the problems that have been raised with previous schemes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=30"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is for that reason that this scheme does not propose to specifically address the time people spent boarded.  As I said before, however, those who were boarded out will be able to qualify if they spent six months or more within one of the institutions.</p><p>I have tried to address a number of the issues raised by Senators.  I have no doubt that there will be significantly more debates in the context of the ongoing legislative process with the legislation on which this scheme will be based.  I look forward to hopefully bringing in other key legislation as well, namely, the birth information and tracing Bill and the institutional burials Bill.  I know that there will be great interest in those Bills in this House.  I look forward to continuing to advance the other actions proposed.  The range of actions is listed on the website and there are copies available so I invite Senators to look at that.  If they know survivors or groups in their own areas, they may be able to link them to items that we are advancing as part the wider suite of actions.</p><p>I am always happy to come to this House to discuss these issues and update Senators on our progress in respect of this important work.  I thank the Senators for their engagement today.  I recognise the survivors, their support groups and their families.  I acknowledge that the Government still has a very substantial amount of work to do in this field but we are looking to advance each of these issues through the 22 actions.  Those actions, combined with the State apology, are important steps towards genuine repentance by the State for what happened to women and children in these institutions.</p></speech>
