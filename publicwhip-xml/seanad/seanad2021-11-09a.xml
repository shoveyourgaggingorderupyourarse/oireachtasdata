There was a considerable amount of shock across County Clare when the announcement came last week that the Coast Guard at Doolin was to be stood down, effectively, or as is referred to in the business as "off the board".  That has upset many people, particularly those whose loved ones have required the services of the Doolin Coast Guard.  It is one of the best known coastguards not just in County Clare but right across the country because it has had such a high profile in search and rescue operations on so many occasions.  Sadly, it has also played its part in recovering the bodies of people who have ended their lives off the Cliffs of Moher.  It is really a difficult and sad position.</p> <p>We understand there were some internal human resources issues within the group.  That is not any different from any organisation, office or business, and of course issues will arise between people.  It is really the job of management, specifically at the national level in the Coast Guard, to address such an issue.  Efforts have been made along the way and, unfortunately, they have not been good enough to resolve the problem.  If this happened in the private sector, the matter would be resolved and brought to a head.</p> <p>I appeal to the Minister of State to involve at the earliest possible opportunity some independent external expert in human resources to try to find a resolution.  Standing the operation down and suggesting the Coast Guard based at the Aran Islands or some other location will fill the void is just not feasible.  There are currently 12 volunteers on the base and perhaps there is a way to get them up and running as a service.  They certainly have the capacity to do some of the work.  I do not want to be prescriptive but the Minister of State and the Department must intervene and bring in an external and independent expert.  I hope such an expert could meet willingness on both sides to engage.</p> <p>Other efforts are being made and we must be careful in this respect.  I appeal to the Minister of State to address this at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#B00600"><p>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I agree there was shock and sadness in the whole of County Clare last week when we heard the news the Doolin Coast Guard was to be stood down.  Much progress had been made, with Doolin getting a pier and a first-class and state-of-the-art rescue centre a number of years ago with the efforts of the now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  The equipment is good and the facilities are excellent.  Unfortunately, this problem has been bubbling for some time and it must be resolved.</p> <p>There is no other way around it but for it to be resolved and it will require the intervention of the Minister and the Department.  There is no faith in the Coast Guard directly resolving this problem and, to a large extent, the Coast Guard is seen as part of the problem.  As urgently as possible, the Minister must appoint an independent mediator to go to Doolin and engage with all parties because all of the parties involved have worked hard.  Some of the past and serving members have given most of their volunteering lives to the Doolin Coast Guard, rescuing many people and recovering many bodies.</p> <p>We owe it to those people who have volunteered, both in the past and present, to resolve the matter.  We owe it to the people they have rescued.  We owe it to the families of the loved ones whose bodies have been recovered and brought home by the Doolin Coast Guard.  We owe it to the people of County Clare and those who visit the county.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Most of all, we owe it to the people who use the coast to give them confidence that the superb Doolin Coast Guard is there if they get into trouble when fishing, surfing or swimming.  When people get into difficulty, there is great confidence that the Doolin Coast Guard has the expertise and experience to come to their rescue.  They have the equipment, determination and focus.  There is a problem there and it is up to the Government to resolve it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senators for raising this issue.  The temporary standing down of the Doolin Coast Guard unit operation is a proportionate response, having regard to significant ongoing attempts by the Coast Guard to address the unfortunate differences that have existed within the unit for a number of years and their impact on the unit.  However, attempts to resolve the situation to date have not been successful and I believe there is a role for an independent person or mediator to be appointed to the Doolin unit with a view to resolving the difficulties.  I intend to meet with officials in my Department shortly to discuss the next steps in the appointment of such a person.  To be clear on the rationale for the action of standing down the Doolin unit, the key objective is to ensure the safety of the volunteers.</p> <p>The action is being taken in compliance with search and rescue assurance obligations set out in the national search and rescue plan and I have been advised that contingency plans are in place.  I am in regular contact with Department officials on this matter.  As Senators know, the Inis O&iacute;rr Coast Guard unit, which falls under the direct management of the Doolin unit, shall continue to remain fully operational and in the interim, the Coast Guard is liaising with other search and rescue stakeholders in the area to provide full cover for services that otherwise would be provided by the Doolin unit.  The Coast Guard is currently deploying various contingencies based on an assessment of risk within the area and, in particular, Kilkee and Killaloe Coast Guard units.  All other Coast Guard units, shoreline and cliff rescue services remain in place, along with the four search and rescue Coast Guard helicopters.  The RNLI community rescue boats and the Naval Service will continue to assist, particularly in those areas of greatest risk until the issue has been resolved.</p> <p>Doolin Coast Guard unit is unique compared with the majority of units in the country in that it has had several years of significantly unresolved, internal, interpersonal difficulties.  The Coast Guard and my Department have taken these unfortunate differences between the Doolin unit volunteers extremely seriously and have consistently met and engaged with the Doolin unit over the past number of years to try to assist in the repair of the breakdown in relationships that has occurred within the unit.  A review was conducted in 2019 by an independent human resources company to examine and consider the root causes.  Follow-up actions have included dignity and respect training for the Doolin unit, the facilitation of group and one-to-one sessions with the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, management and the Doolin unit members.  An intensive support package was also put in place with coastal unit sector managers to monitor and assist in supervising the situation.  The Coast Guard also very much acknowledges and recognises the strenuous efforts and leadership displayed by many members of the Doolin unit, its management and other stakeholders to address these difficulties.  I assure members that the Coast Guard is committed to supporting the 900 volunteers who helped to provide the important life-saving service of the IRCG and ongoing consultation with the volunteers is key.</p> <p>The Coast Guard volunteers have for some time had a representative body called the Coastal Unit Advisory Group, which represents Irish Coast Guard volunteers and provides advice and input to the Coast Guard under agreed terms of reference between management and volunteers.  I intend to meet with the Coastal Unit Advisory Group this week.  I am also open to meeting other volunteers.</p> <p>In 2018, the Coast Guard completed a review of the volunteer code of conduct.  This review was conducted with independent, expert input from a human resource consultancy in order to ensure that Coast Guard processes and procedures were fair and fit for purpose for an organisation of its type.  The review also involved a consultation process with the volunteers which was managed by the Coastal Unit Advisory Group.  That group has also been reviewed with a refreshed structure and terms of reference.  My key focus is to ensure we have a process that works and that the concerns of the volunteers are heard and addressed at the highest level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#D00100"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  That is as good a response as Senator Conway, Senator Garvey, who is in the Chair and whom I know is committed to addressing this issue, and I could have got.  On the Minister of State's commitment regarding the appointment of an independent arbitrator, since it is not just a question of the issues at the station and since it involves the wider issue in the context of the Coast Guard, I ask her to consider appointing as mediator Mr. Kieran Mulvey, who has shown a phenomenal capacity to resolve many disputes over the years, including, most recently, a dispute concerning staff in the Irish Aviation Authority.   I ask the Minister of State and her Department to consider Mr. Mulvey's name in this regard.  I do not know whether he would be available.  I have not spoken to him on this occasion so it would be a bolt from the blue for him.  The development on mediation is welcome.  The Acting Chairman, Senator Conway and I certainly welcome it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#D00200"><p>I concur that Mr. Mulvey is certainly a name that one would hope would attract a lot of support and agreement.  Regardless of the mediator appointed, I very much welcome the Minister of State's commitment to appoint one.  The mediator has to be independent of the Coast Guard because the representative organisation operates under the auspices of the Coast Guard and all the HR staff hired to deal with this were paid for by the Coast Guard.  This matter needs to be addressed by the Department.  The Coast Guard must not have anything to do with it because its role has been the nub of why a resolution has not been found to date.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the arrangement will be independent of the Coast Guard in the first instance.  Second, she might give us a timeline as to when she hopes to meet her officials and make an announcement on the appointment of a mediator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#D00300"><p>It is important to acknowledge that the units continue to actively recruit members from within their communities.  They are very keen to enrol volunteers.  Once enrolled, volunteers enter a training programme to assist their communities with the search-and-rescue response.  In the past two years, there has been no exception.  Despite the challenge of Covid, units have been able to enrol new members and advance existing team members in key training requirements.</p> <p>The number of volunteer grievance cases remains low.  They represent less than 0.5% of the total volunteer cadre.  Given the number of volunteers, amounting to over 900 in total, the percentage is very low by comparison with that in similar organisations.  I assure the Senators that it is my priority, and that of the Coast Guard and Department, to ensure Doolin Coast Guard unit will be returned to operational readiness as quickly as practicable.  A plan is being put in place to ensure this.  There is a role for an independent person or mediator to be appointed to the Doolin unit to resolve the difficulties.  I intend to progress that as a matter of priority.  I will also be continuing to engage with volunteers.</p></speech>

The Minister of State understands the enormity of the issue.  I acknowledge completely that she, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and their Department have offered support at every level.  There was no shortage of funding for training or mediation.  It has not worked to date, unfortunately.  This is a serious conflict-resolution issue in respect of which we need to bring in experts on conflict resolution.  We have to find a way.  The individuals concerned are adults.  We need to get adults to start adulting in order that we can move forward and get this Coast Guard unit back up and running.</p></speech>

We had hoped the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media would be able to do so, but I understand her Department has provided a written reply.</p> <p>With the vaccination rate at such a high level, it is clear there is a strong appetite among people to get on with living their lives as safely, but as fully, as possible.  While many of us are looking at the increasing Covid numbers, or the trend over recent weeks, with a degree of trepidation, there are many who do so with the determination to ensure those working in hospitality, including musicians and staff in pubs, restaurants and nightclubs, will get an opportunity to eke out a livelihood again.  The prospect of their having to remain out of work for any longer than they have had to cannot be countenanced.</p> <p>In the past few weeks, new regulations were introduced to allow for the reopening of the night-time economy.  The roller-coaster that the nightlife sector has been put on indicates a shambolic approach.  Time and again, we have seen a failure to engage in contingency planning for the various Covid scenarios.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not here, however, to go over what has happened but to ask about the review of the guidelines introduced on October 22.  A commitment was given then to review the situation within three weeks.  We wish to know if that review will commence this Friday, who is going to conduct it, what its scope will be and when its findings are expected to be published.  I have talked to nightclub operators, DJs, promoters and bar owners and the key issue that keeps arising is when will they be included in the conversation about the safe operation of their sector.  This is important because many of the regulations introduced on 22 October cannot be complied with and are unenforceable.  What respect and trust are being shown to this sector?  The operators are seeking this review because they want to be able to have some input into the process that will determine how their sector will continue to trade and to survive this winter.  </p><p>It is important to acknowledge that we have had a trend over several years, in Dublin but also around the country, where we have seen the closure of pubs and nightclubs and we cannot afford to exacerbate that longer-term problem.  The operators also want to have a level playing pitch.  Again, we have seen coverage in recent days of the patchiness with which vaccination certificates are being requested at certain premises and also of where they are not being requested at all.  Operators want to have an input into this process because they want to demonstrate that their sector is safe.  Frustratingly, from what I have seen and from what I have been told by those I have spoken to in the sector, we had much media and PR coverage of the pilot opening of nightclubs conducted on 30 September.  Antigen testing was used at that pilot event, but since then, however, we have heard nothing about what was learned from the pilot opening.  Interestingly, suggestions about using antigen testing at nightclubs seem to have disappeared off the radar.  </p><p>The other critical reason that we need to see the detail of this review is because community dance halls hosting social and big band dances believe their model of operation is going to be decimated because they are now being forced to sell tickets in advance to allow people to gain access.  It totally goes against the grain of how they operate.  To summarise, I would like to hear the concrete detail about how this review will be conducted, when we are going to see it published and who will be involved in that process.</p></speech>

In its decision of 19 October 2021, the Government agreed that the remaining areas of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy would reopen with the full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the Covid-19 pass.  This represents an important next step towards the full reopening of our economy and society.  As we move forward, however, it is more critical than ever to ensure that we are doing everything we can to minimise opportunities for the transmission of the virus.</p> <p>The night-time and live entertainment sectors have been particularly hard hit during this pandemic.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and her officials have been engaging with the various sectors to address some of the challenges faced during the past 20 months, in the run-up to the Government decision and also following it.  The extensive stakeholder engagement has resulted in the production of an updated set of guidelines entitled, Updated Guidelines for Nightlife and Entertainment, to provide for the safe operation of the sector as Covid-19 is still circulating in our communities.  Tourism and hospitality sectoral guidelines, aligned with the Work Safely protocol, have also been developed collaboratively to assist businesses to apply the guidance to their operations.  The guidelines are informed by the latest Government public health advice and regulations carefully tailored to specific tourism and hospitality sectors.  The operational guidelines aim to support business owners and management every step of the way as they work to stabilise and recover.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The guidance, which is updated regularly, contains a range of advice on areas including ventilation, hygiene, management structures and face coverings.  As we are still in the middle of a pandemic, and in light of the epidemiological situation which has emerged over recent weeks, it is imperative that we carefully manage reopening.  There will inevitably be nuances and differences in how we do things.</p><p>The Department of the Taoiseach hosted a meeting today with the hospitality and live events sector.  That was attended by officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Health.  It has been emphasised in advance of that meeting and continuously that their co-operation is critical if we are to avoid a further deterioration in the epidemiological situation.  This was emphasised strongly again today, and it is clear that the sectors' representative groups are very conscious of their role in driving compliance and reinforcing the behaviours that will help to keep us all safe.  Today's meeting provides a very important context for the three-week review that was signalled at the outset, and we will continue to engage with the sector bilaterally after the meeting as part of that review process.  The review will, of course, be critically informed by the wider public health situation.  In addition, official engagements will take place this week with the live entertainment sector.  Subsequent to that, an update will be provided for consideration by Cabinet colleagues.</p><p>The Government's aim has been to allow as many businesses as possible to reopen in the safest possible way.  This is why we need certain regulations in place as well as robust guidance to assist businesses to reopen safely and, importantly, to stay open.  Central to these guidelines is a commitment to adhere to best practice in infection prevention control measures, which are necessary to protect individuals and society, and to support our continued progress towards a full return to operation of various sectors.  Compliance with these measures should not be considered best practice but rather the minimum standard required to protect our communities.  Individual businesses need to risk-assess proactively their premises to calibrate mitigating measures in a bespoke way for their business.</p><p>We know that countries across the world are working through the challenges of reopening society while the pandemic continues.  These countries are all different and the way they develop their reopening plans will be different from ours.  We have to try to balance a welcome reopening of businesses with the protection of public health.</p><p>I have run out of time.  The rest of the reply is in the written statement circulated in the Chamber.</p></speech>

The question was what the scope of the review will be, who will conduct it and when we will see it.  Unfortunately, we have not heard from the Department today an answer to any of those questions.  We hear there will be bilateral engagement and that the Cabinet will be updated.  To be frank, whoever wrote this script was trying to lecture those of us who take the nightlife sector very seriously.  The sector takes its responsibilities very seriously in opening as safely as possible in the context of this pandemic.  That does not need to be said.  What it needs to be clear on, however, is that it will be involved in the review, that there will be an outcome to the review and that it will not be an interminable process with no detail.  I ask the Minister of State to relay back to the Department that there is a failure to answer the questions we have sought in this regard.</p></speech>

It is now due to be held on 3 April 2022.  In April of this year, the Central Statistics Office estimated the population at 5.01 million. This means that the population has risen above 5 million for the first time since the 1851 census, when the comparable population was 5.11 million, or more than 6.6 million for the island as a whole.  Some of the reasons for the increase in population are more Irish nationals returning to live here, with 7,300 more than those who left, and births exceeding deaths by some 22,800 in the year ending April 2021.</p><p>With population changes come the dreaded boundary revisions and reviews.  This can exercise voters.  When county boundaries are breached, in the case of D&aacute;il elections, people feel disenfranchised as has happened previously in Leitrim, Carlow, Cavan and Tipperary and as is happening at present in Meath, Mayo, Donegal, Roscommon, Laois and another part of Tipperary.</p><p>It is speculated that on foot of population changes, a constituency boundary commission will established and that it may report in 2023 in advance of a possible general election in 2024 or 2025.  Will the Minister of State advise on timelines for this, when a D&aacute;il commission might be established and when it might report?  What are his views regarding the breaches of county boundaries, which are particularly worrying and annoying for many constituents when small numbers of district electoral divisions, DEDs, are excluded from the county and put in with a larger county or set of counties?</p><p>Considering that the next local elections and European Parliament elections will take place in 2024, does the Minister of State feel that there will be insufficient time to hold a boundary review of council electoral areas in advance?  Is it his view that there would be a boundary review in advance of the next local elections or would the timeline be too short for that?  I am not urging one way or the other, but as the Minister of State is aware, politicians like to know what the boundaries would be.  What is the view regarding the number of seats in the EU Parliament?  Ireland currently holds 13 seats.  Is this set in stone for the new elections to the Parliament in 2024?</p><p>For sitting politicians and would-be candidates for parties and for Independents, having advance or timely notice of these things is extremely important for their campaigns in the context of boundaries and configurations.  Timely decisions are hugely beneficial to all in terms of preparation.  I would appreciate a response on this issue, which perhaps might not exercise the general population a huge amount but which is extremely important for politicians in the context of their jobs and plans over the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#G00200"><p>I agree.  This is an important issue, certainly politically for candidates but also for the right of constituents to exercise their vote in their areas and DEDs.  It is critically important.</p> <p>Article 16 of the Constitution sets out clearly and distinctly the overarching requirements that apply to the membership of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In addition, and complementary to the constitutional provisions of Article 16.2 in particular, Part Il of the Electoral Act 1997, as amended, provides for a review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies following each census of population and establishes, among other things, the terms of reference for a constituency commission in respect of the undertaking of such reviews.</p> <p>In very broad terms, the publication of preliminary census results triggers the establishment of a constituency commission under section 5(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 with the commission required, under section 9(1) of that Act, to present its report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies to the chairman of the D&aacute;il within three months of publication of final census results.</p> <p>The timing for the publication of preliminary census results and final census results are matters for the Central Statistics Office, which is responsible for organising each census, but typically these publications have taken place within approximately three months and 12 months, respectively, of the holding of the census.  In September 2020, on the advice of the Central Statistics Office the Government decided to postpone the 2021 census due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The next census is now due to take place on 3 April 2022.  Against this background, the next review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies will commence following the publication of preliminary census results.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This will be undertaken in compliance with our constitutional requirements and will be completed in accordance with the statutory timeframe currently set out under the Electoral Act 1997.</p><p>Unlike the position for D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies, there is no constitutional or legislative requirement for the revision of local electoral areas at a particular point in time, such as following the publication of preliminary or final census results.  Nonetheless, section 23 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, empowers the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to divide a local authority area into local electoral areas and to amend those areas.  In advance of deciding to make an order under section 23 of that Act, the Minister must in accordance with the provisions of Part 5 of the Local Government Act 1991, as amended, request a boundary committee to make a report having regard to such matters as may be specified by the Minister.  The Minister must publish the report of the boundary committee and must have regard to the report of that committee when deciding to make an order on any amendment to local electoral area boundaries.</p><p>As matters currently stand, no decision has been taken on the review of local electoral area boundaries in advance of the next scheduled local elections in 2024.  The Senator will be aware that earlier this year the Government circulated the general scheme of an electoral reform Bill to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for pre-legislative consideration.  The general scheme addresses a number of commitments in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, including the establishment of a statutory electoral commission.  The electoral commission will be independent of Government and will report directly to the Oireachtas.  Following its establishment it will, among other matters, take several existing statutory electoral functions from the outset, including the work currently undertaken by the Constituency Commission and local electoral area boundary committees.  </p><p>I also wish to assure the Senator that we have had very good pre-legislative consideration of the electoral reform Bill.  In our discussions around the early establishment of the commission, we probably think that it will be established in the second quarter of 2022, once it obviously goes through its legislative journey.  It is critically important that among its early tasks will be looking at those electoral events, the most immediate of which will, hopefully, be the local and European elections of 2024.  </p><p>I will not give any specific views on the seats in the European Parliament but I certainly believe that it is important that the boundary review would take place to give us sufficient time to prepare for local and European elections in 2024.

Based on his reply and the census that is taking place in April, one can therefore say, again, depending on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that the preliminary results will be published in the summer of 2022.  The electoral commission, if it has been set up, would have 12 months after that to report, and for this to be confirmed within three months of the publication of the final census data.</p> <p>On the local elections, I again urge that timely decisions are made on these because we cannot have a situation whereby a commission is organised or has decided to review boundaries that leaves the minimum amount of time for candidates, sitting councillors or would-be councillors, to prepare for them.  It is important that those decisions are made in a timely manner in advance of the 2024 elections, which we know are taking place on that date.  The general election may be slightly different as we obviously do not know when exactly that will take place but we know the date of the local and European elections.</p></speech>

If one looks at where we are now, it is going to be a very short time once the commission is established.  As I have said, it is going to be tasked with quite a significant body of work from the outset but this part of that work is going to be critically important, given that there will be an electoral event in 2024 and, we hope, a general election in 2025.</p> <p>It is important that political parties and prospective candidates have certainty as to where they are running.  I certainly know that many of the political parties are all very active in this space in beginning to put candidates forward, or certainly in having electoral area representatives already active on the ground.  We need that certainty to give an opportunity, particularly to new candidates, for a run-in to the local elections in 2024.  From my own perspective we will be doing all we can to ensure that the commission is in place by the middle of next year and that among its early tasks will be to give due consideration to electoral boundaries and all of the other associated work that requires to be done there.  I thank the Acting Chairman.</p></speech>

It relates to an ongoing challenge facing west Wicklow and my own area of east Wicklow, in the uplands area.  The figures speak for themselves.  There is tuberculosis, TB, in one in every six herds in Wicklow.  Some 4% of herds nationally have TB and have had restrictions placed on them whereas this figure is 18% in Wicklow, four times the national average.  Some 5.4% of the cattle herd in Wicklow are reactors.  The figure nationally is only 1.8%.  These figures come from the Department.  As I have said, this is an ongoing issue.  Some 16% of the deer population carry TB.</p><p>I will quote a farmer in west Wicklow, Tom Stephenson.  He has said:</p> <blockquote> 	Farmers in this area have been completely abandoned.  There is what can only be described as a plague upon us and we have no way of ridding ourselves of this scourge.  We can restock time and time again after a lock-up but the same thing just happens again.  It&rsquo;s a heart-breaking way of operating which just can&rsquo;t continue. </blockquote> <p>We all know that the number of deer in Wicklow continues to increase.  We see them grazing farmers' fields every day.  Coming from one of the most scenic areas of Wicklow, where I have the pleasure of walking the mountains, it is quite frightening how close we, as humans, can come to the deer population.  The deer will not move even if people come within 1 m or 2 m.  In my own valley of Glendalough, we are now feeding deer by hand outside the hotel.  This is frightening because it is not a natural occurrence.  It is having a severe impact on the lives of farmers and their families.  I will now give way to my colleague, Senator O'Loughlin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#J00500"><p>I thank Senator Casey for giving us those very stark statistics regarding the impact of deer in Kildare and west Wicklow.  As somebody who lives in Kildare, I have ongoing engagement with the Irish Farmers Association branches covering Kildare and west Wicklow.  This issue has come up quite a number of times.  Only recently, about three weeks ago, there was a consultation meeting on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in Kilcullen and farmers from west Wicklow brought up this issue.  At a subsequent meeting last week, I asked about one of those farmers and was told that he had lost 25% of his herd to TB the week before because of the overrun of deer in the area.  That is absolutely shocking.</p> <p>I am really concerned that the Government has no long-term plan to protect the lands and livelihoods of those who live in this area and that the deer population will be allowed to remain unsustainable.  There is no doubt that the surge in the deer population is impacting on our grasslands and our crops and aiding in the spread of bovine TB.  The implementation of the wildlife control programme in Wicklow by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not to the standard required.  The Minister of State committed additional resources in the budget to the wildlife control programme for next year.  Will he assure farmers in Kildare and, particularly, west Wicklow that this money will be fully utilised in providing the staff resources necessary to implement a timely and effective wildlife control programme on the ground?  This is very important.  Senator Casey spoke about deer coming right up to the hotel.  There is no doubt that they are encroaching further each year and mixing with cattle, thereby contributing to the level of TB in the herd.</p></speech>

I thank both Senators for raising this really important issue.  While the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department licenses the hunting of deer and actively manages deer on its property, it does not own the deer population nor is it responsible for cordoning it into specific areas of land.  Deer populations are mobile by their nature and have home ranges that are not constrained by land ownership boundaries.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These home ranges are normally defined by physical landscape features such as mountains, lakes, rivers, built-up areas and the availability of suitable habitat within that home range.</p><p>Deer on any lands can be controlled by the landowner, once that control is in accordance with current legislation - in this case, the Wildlife Act.  During the annual open season, deer can legally be shot under licence.  The season operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  My Department has received over 5,800 applications so far this season for deer hunting licences under section 29 of the Wildlife Act.  There were some delays in 2020, due to Covid, in terms of the licensing, but we have made significant progress in the processing of licences this year.  We will endeavour to move a lot of the process online, which will make it more efficient to issue licences.</p><p>In terms of private property, landowners may apply to my Department for permission, under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts, to cull deer outside the annual open seasons, where it is deemed necessary.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case-by-case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Applications are investigated by local staff to determine if serious damage is being caused and, if so, the most practical method of stopping or controlling the problem.  Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and I have been in communication in recent weeks regarding the re-establishment of a version of the Irish Deer Management Forum, where it is planned that many topics on deer management will be discussed.  I am really keen to see this initiative progressed.  Our officials are currently working together to establish the structures of such a forum.  Further details will be made available in due course.</p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, is committed to the active management of the deer species within State-owned national parks and nature reserves, and as part of its regular ongoing management operations, the NPWS carries out regular surveys, censuses and reports on deer on our sites.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual counts, or where it is evident that damage is being caused by deer to habitats, particularly woodland, culls may need to be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  Such culls are undertaken by NPWS staff.</p><p>The Department does not permit hunting on its State lands, with the exception of areas where the NPWS does not control, or fully control, the sporting rights.  Culling is a regular and ongoing management operation within the national parks.  My Department is aware of the economic damage deer pose, particularly in County Wicklow.  To that end, specific arrangements have been put in place for the area.  My officials also contribute to the Wicklow Deer Management group.</p><p>In summary, I have met with the Irish Deer Commission and other interested parties regarding this issue.  I am very keen, as I know the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is, to see the establishment of a forum to deal with these issues.  It is critically important that we understand and appreciate the scale of the challenges that we are facing regarding deer management from a biodiversity point of view, and the spread of disease.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  In all fairness, it is a bit repetitive.  I could refer the Minister of State to the joint approach to deer management of 2010, the County Wicklow deer management project 2018 and a number of pilot schemes in between.  None of them are addressing the situation.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the largest landowner in the Wicklow Mountains because it owns the Wicklow Mountains National Park.  The second largest owner is another State body, Coillte.  The Department therefore has the ability to manage and cull the deer herd.  There is no natural predator for the deer.  I am not proposing to rewild the Wicklow hills and introduce wolves, but if we did so, the deer population could be controlled.  There is no natural predator to manage deer in Wicklow, so we have to do it.</p></speech>

It is good that the licences have been given out and that the Departments are looking at re-establishing the Irish Deer Management Forum.  Those actions are important.  The Department within which the Minister of State is based must take responsibility for deer when they are associated with a TB problem.  I accept that farmers can go so far in terms of licensing and hunting, etc., but when there is a TB problem and it is impacting on the national herd that we hear so much about, it is vital that the Department and the Minister of State step in.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Minister of State to step in and meet the farmers of Kildare and west Wicklow to discuss this matter.

During the summer we spent a bit of time on the Wicklow Mountains after some of the fires with Wesley Atkinson and his team.  It is critically important that the deer population is sustainably managed on which I am sure we all agree.  This initiative will take hold.  The streamlined issuing of licences is critically important and we have issued a significantly larger volume of licences this year so we need to do that.</p> <p>In terms of meeting IFA representatives from counties Wicklow and Kildare, correspondence has come into our Department on the matter.  Certainly, I know that officials will be more than happy to meet.</p> <p>There is a responsibility from our perspective and that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of TB.  We give a commitment here that this forum is the best place to address these issues.  We also give a commitment, and I know this from speaking to my officials, that we want to address the issue because, as I said, it is not just an issue that both Senators have spoken about in terms of TB - it is also an issue for biodiversity because there has been significant damage, particularly to forestry.  We have seen the impact in the national parks where deer have caused significant problems when we have tried to regenerate native woodlands in this country.  I give a commitment to both Senators that certainly we want to work collaboratively to address the range of issues that we are dealing with in terms of deer management in Ireland. </p></speech>

Yesterday, 8 November, was Equal Pay Day.  Women in Ireland are effectively working for free for the final 14.4% of the year, according to research published today by WorkEqual.  It is always important that we note Equal Pay Day because closing the gender pay gap is extremely important.  Although legislation has been introduced in the form of the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021, it only goes so far.  We have made progress but there is much more that we need to do.</p> <p>I wish to raise an unusual situation.  The football match between Portugal and Ireland is on 11 November and all present hope Ireland will do well in it.  A person who wanted to buy two tickets for her partner and her son contacted me.  She was seeking to buy the tickets on the website of a very well known organisation that sells these tickets.  The prices were &euro;120 for the adult ticket and &euro;25 for the child ticket.  That was all well and good and the woman was willing to purchase them but she was not able to buy the child ticket and ended up paying &euro;240 for two tickets.  That is bad enough in itself.  She contacted me approximately three weeks ago and I suggested that she go back to the organisation from which she purchased the tickets.  To date, she has had no reply whatsoever from the organisation and neither have I, having taken the matter up on her behalf.  She has gone to the FAI.  I hope it will do something.  This is completely wrong.  We want to encourage young people to play sport.  The excitement of going to an international match is important in people's lives.  This is an issue we need to keep an eye on.  We need to send a message that it is not good enough and that we will be watching and raising it.  </p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of work permits, as I have previously, in the context of certain industries.  The Minister said another quota would be fixed in respect of work permits.  That was all well and good but I am aware of a company that sent in all the relevant information at midnight on the night of the announcement.  Its application was returned and the company was told that applications will only be sought and received 28 days after the Minister made the announcement.  That is not good enough.  I have been told that the working group that examines these particular areas only meets twice a year and there is only one person from industry on it.  Again, that is not good enough.</p> <p>The final issue I wish to raise relates to Monasterevin day care centre, which was started in 1996 by a group of volunteers doing incredible work.  In 2014, it was ordered to close by the HSE to facilitate essential work that was needed.  The centre relocated to a local football club. which has been wonderful in sharing its time and space.  This saga has gone on and on.  Planning permission was granted again on 27 May 2020 but nothing has happened.  There is a cohort of people involved and a very central and decent location that they could be in.  We need to call this out.  I ask that the Leader to contact the Minister on the issue.</p></speech>

On the one hand, I will compliment the board and, on the other, I will criticise it.  To first deal with the criticism, while I acknowledge that significant resources have been applied to the strategic housing development, SHD, process and new legislation will come before the House tomorrow in that respect, it cannot be at the expense of other developments, particularly infrastructure and housing projects.  I am aware of two cases in this regard.  One of them involves Waterford Airport, which applied for the lengthening and widening of a runway in July 2020, some 16 months ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A decision was due to issue in February of this year but it is now November and no decision has been made.  Likewise, a decision was supposed to be made in respect of a 91-unit housing development in May, but we are awaiting a decision on that too.  As my party's housing spokesman in this House, I find it frustrating when developers and people who drive projects must await decisions in that respect.  I would appreciate if we could write to the board to have the matter expedited.</p><p>By contrast, I compliment An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the decision it made yesterday with respect to the 1,592-apartment development on the grounds of Clonliffe College.  The project represents an investment of &euro;602 million in the north inner city of Dublin.  While I, of course, respect people's right to object to developments, it galls me to see the likes of Deputy Gannon and the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy McDonald, openly oppose housing developments while, at the same time, they claim their parties are supportive of housing and resolving the housing crisis.  One of the few matters people agree on with regard to the housing crisis is that one of the main issues relates to supply, yet the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in somehow believes building 1,592 for-rent apartments would make the crisis worse.  What sort of logic is that?</p><p>At this stage, I have heard all the excuses, whether the developments are supposedly too high, too large or too small, in the wrong place, with too many private units, whether they should be built using a certain delivery mechanism or whether it is the wrong tenure type.  The list is endless, but I ask when politicians are going to stand up, acknowledge there is a housing crisis, and not just diagnose the problem but rather do something about it and support housing developments, even when that is the unpopular approach.  Every housing unit, whether for owner-occupiers or people to rent, has a positive impact on resolving the housing crisis.  It has a circular effect.  If somebody moves into a build-to-rent apartment from having lived in a house, that house will be freed up for a family to move into and that has a positive impact.  Anyone who says otherwise is either codding themselves or trying to fool the public or does not understand the issue.  I am sick and tired of hearing the false platitudes from some in respect of the housing crisis, and I ask them to stand up and be counted when it comes to resolving it.</p></speech>

It is vapid and commits us to nothing but the delivery of MetroLink at some point in the ten years following 2031 and of the BusConnects programme.  Apart from those two pledges, there is a virtual standstill on Luas developments of any kind, with all of them postponed, under consideration or whatever it is, while the other projects have been simply put back to being dealt with in the period starting in 2042.  I like to be positive, and one good aspect of this draft strategy document is that sanity has prevailed on its authors in their decision to drop the ridiculous idea of cannibalising the Luas green line and turning it into a MetroLink for a portion of its route.  They have dropped that and stated challenges were involved in that.  The first challenge was that it would have involved abandoning that line for two years while it was being upgraded, but in any event the expense involved would have been massive.</p><p>Moreover, today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>reports that the estimated cost of implementing this programme has increased, although it is very modest in the context of what we are doing now, from &euro;10 billion to &euro;25 billion.  That is pretty horrific.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The time has come for a proper consultation on this.  The NTA has had its way.  It has bullied the Minister, Deputy Ryan, into abandoning the entire south west of Dublin completely.  The people of Tallaght and Rathfarnham and such places are being told that they will get some kind of transport from 2042 onwards.  That is not good enough.  If we are serious about what is not happening, we should address it now.  We had a discussion here about transport strategy last week.  We did not see this document at the time.  Now we have seen how absolutely naked the strategy is and how everything is a matter of we will consider this or we might consider that or we will evaluate this and study that and the work that has gone into studying this will not be forgotten and all the rest of it.  Hundreds of millions of euro have been spent on planning certain projects and they are simply not going to be delivered.  </p><p>The last thing I want to say is the present management of Dublin city seem to be intent on sequencing traffic lights so as to create traffic jams to discourage car usage.  I was amused on Saturday afternoon to see traffic jams the whole way out to Clonskeagh because of this.  That is not the way to treat citizens.  It does not advance anything.  It does not make cycling or walking any easier.  It is just a futile ideological approach.  I hope I do not sound too negative but we need a discussion of this document because one third of the people of Ireland live in the area to which it applies.</p></speech>

I beg the Leader's indulgence because I do not know how we resolve it but it is becoming an issue that needs to be addressed.  We are all very happy to see some degree of a return to normality and that is manifest in some big, important events.  On Thursday evening, the Ireland soccer squad will take on Portugal in what I understand is a sold-out match at the Aviva Stadium.  About five minutes before that match is due to wrap up, the port tunnel is going to be closed.  This is not the first times this has happened.  It has the potential to impact any person travelling to the match from anywhere like Buncrana or Belfast or Malahide.  I do not mean to be facetious about this, but it has happened several times when major events have been taking place in the city and there has been this clash.  It has impacted on people getting home in a timely way.  It shows there needs to be joined-up thinking in regard to these events, and when necessary work needs to take place, it is done in a well thought-out way.</p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the welcome news from the Leader last week that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will join us next week for statements on the protocol.  Calling as I have over the past couple of weeks for statements relating to the protocol, I did that with the very sincere intention of trying to cut through some of the noise and some of the heat being generated about this issue.  We have seen that manifested on the streets of my own city in recent days and weeks.  We all joined together last week to send out a clear message that some of the rhetoric and the nature of some of the statements need to be reflected upon and toned down.  I want to take the opportunity to do that here again today.  It is a welcome opportunity.  We should all, across this House, take the opportunity during those statements next week really to lean in to the positivity that is available as a result of the protocol, the insulation it offers to Ireland, North and South, but indeed the opportunities it affords to businesses, North and South, as well.  We are at a critical time and I do not want to add any further rhetoric into that mix other than to appeal to people to reflect over the coming days and weeks on their approach to this issue and the implications this could have. If we are not at a critical juncture, we are approaching it very soon.  We all need to work to ensure the protocol and the protections for Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement remain steadfast and we do not see any escalation in what have been up to now, thankfully - not to diminish them - fairly minimal incidents on the streets of Belfast.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not wish to diminish them, nonetheless.</p></speech>

I would like the entire House to support me with this and I ask the Senators to reach out to their contacts in other countries about it.  In particular, we lost many good people to Canada, Australia and England.</p><p>As a Government we have committed &euro;4 billion per year to build social and affordable houses and we will not be able to do that without tradespeople.  They are like the new national treasure.  Every tradesperson I know cannot keep up with the demand for their work.  The Government reckons there will be demand for 55,000 construction workers over the next 30 years and earnings in the construction sector grew by 8.2% annually in the second quarter of 2021, which is one of the highest increases in any sector in the country and well ahead of the average earning increases of 3.9%.</p><p>Tradespeople were not given the value or appreciation they earned before.  Without them we would have no houses in which to live or any infrastructure.  We need a global call-out to the diaspora.  I have spoken to the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora about this, as well as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We need to do a call-out to our people all over the world to ask them to come home and help us to rebuild Ireland.  We must build 300,000 affordable and social houses and we must retrofit 500,000 houses.  We do not have enough tradespeople in Ireland now.  They are earning good money, the wages are good and demand is high so now is a very good time for us to call them back.  I want the House to support me in this global call-out, perhaps with the help of the <i>Irish Post</i>and our contacts overseas.  We must tell our Irish tradespeople they are welcome home and there is much work for them.  We need them to help rebuild this country.</p></speech>

We are both asking that it be made fit for purpose as quickly as possible.  The day care centre was closed by the Health Service Executive estates in 2014 on health and safety grounds, and since that time Monasterevin Gaelic Football Club has kindly allowed the day care centre to rent its pavilion and continue the service on an interim arrangement.  The day care committee and the town of Monasterevin are deeply grateful to Monasterevin GFC for the use of its premises, but as the Leader might appreciate, this arrangement will cause more problems for the local GAA club, as with reducing Covid-19 restrictions, it is hoped the club will need its facilities more.  This could limit the time allocated for the day care service.</p> <p>Planning permission for the refurbishment and development was granted 18 months ago, as has been mentioned, on 27 May 2020, and in further good news the fire and safety and disabled access certificates were approved in April this year.  In a recent reply to a parliamentary question to my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, the Minister advised the project is continuing to progress to tender stage and all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, including planning and design, before a firm timeline or funding requirements can be established.</p> <p>The Monasterevin day care committee is a voluntary organisation trying to fulfil a need in its community with the help of the HSE.  Its founding members established and developed, with the help of the HSE and its estates section, the day care centre in 1996, which is 25 years ago.  Over the years the centre acquired a very special place in the lives and affections of the community.  It was a great shock and loss to the community when the centre was closed in 2014 and that loss is still felt very sorely.</p> <p>The community of Monasterevin looks forward to the reopening of the Monasterevin day care centre.  I know many of those who attend the day care centre daily or twice weekly in Monasterevin and their lives without it would have a large void.  For many it is their only social outlet.  As already sought, I appreciate any assistance the Leader could provide with the project.</p> <p>A second matter I raise with the Leader today is the lack of GP and out-of-hours services.  Like many colleagues, I am sure, I am getting calls from people who are waiting weeks for appointments and hours or even days for a call back.  I understand all our GPs are so busy at this time and I know how much work they carry out daily in our communities.  However, I am sure the Leader agrees this is a developing and worrying trend.</p> <p>I am also getting calls about the availability of GP services for so many new people who have moved to south Kildare to make the location their home and raise families.  Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Health on our GP services at the earliest opportunity?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be welcomed by many people.</p></speech>

The initiative relates to mental health.  I commend that association and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, which also held a training seminar on Saturday, the emphasis of which was mainly on mental health and included a briefing from the director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  The focus on mental health for public representatives and the wider community is welcome.  I commend the LAMA for its initiative which will involve the funding, from its own resources, of up to six one-hour confidential sessions with a qualified psychotherapist.  That individual is the Olympic silver medalist Kenneth Egan.  He is a councillor and a qualified psychotherapist.  The association is willing to provide that resource.  Anyone can email a confidential email address.  Only Mr. Egan will know that somebody has contacted him and the LAMA will fund the sessions.  It is a welcome initiative.  Many people may only require a half-hour session or a single session.  Perhaps something is getting to someone who does not know where to go or turn.  It is a welcome initiative from the LAMA.</p> <p>The seminar to which I have referred was the first since the LAMA cancelled a seminar in March 2020.  It is almost two years since the organisation had an in-person training seminar.  Since the local elections, there has only been one such seminar, which took place in Ennistymon in late 2019.  It is welcome that the LAMA has put this emphasis on mental health, not just because of the pandemic, although it has probably accentuated those challenges.  It is very welcome.</p> <p>I also commend the AILG on all it has done on mental health, particularly last weekend.  That is welcome and it is important for us to acknowledge that public representatives are also human beings and   have the same challenges as everybody else.  They are sometimes subject to trauma.</p> <p>I agree with much of what Senator McDowell has said.  I may return to that topic on another day.</p></speech>

It is great news for family members who will be able to travel to America for the first time in 18 months to meet their loved ones.  Some grandparents have not seen their grandchildren and so on.  It is a great news story.  The positivity from New York struck me.  New York, as a city, is going to be running the most aggressive marketing campaign in its history.  It will be spending more money than it ever has before on marketing its city internationally.  That brings to me to the question of tourism in this country.  We, as a country, should now be spending more than we ever have before to market our country internationally.</p> <p>With that in mind, I ask the Leader to request a debate on tourism and its marketing.  When 9/11 happened, the managing director of Dromoland Castle Hotel in County Clare had a board meeting and the board decided instantaneously to move all of its marketing budget from America, from where it got massive revenue over the years, to Europe.  Doing this saved the business.  It kept the hotel going, kept people employed and kept the rooms filled.  That was an example of an organisation acting in a flexible way.  We need a massive marketing budget to rebound tourism in this country.  We need to put together The Gathering and the Wild Atlantic Way into one enormous marketing budget.  We need to be flexible in terms of how we go about it.  A debate on that matter would be very useful.  What did we learn during the most recent recession in 2011, 2012 and 2013?  What was the first industry that really got going?  It was tourism.  It created a great feel-good factor and hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Tourism can have the same effect post pandemic.  </p></speech>

It is timely to remember that members of the Irish Defence Forces lose their lives, sometimes brutally, as they serve overseas.  Next Sunday in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and many other cathedrals around the country, we will remember the Irish who fell in the first and second world wars.  I hope to get to one or two of the ceremonies.  I encourage colleagues to do so also.</p> <p>Today I want to talk about Rescue 116.  The initial report into the crash of Rescue 116 took four years longer than it should have.  It is important in air accident investigations to get the report out quickly to learn the lessons.  It is timely that the report on Rescue 116 has been issued when we are to debate in this House the next Bill on air navigation and transport.  When debating it, we should take on board the fact that experts, particularly the pilots, sometimes know what they are talking about.</p> <p>The outsourcing of search-and-rescue, SAR, services over the past two decades in this country has been a high-risk activity.  Before the SAR contract was awarded to CHC Ireland DAC, it was clear that neither the Department of Transport or the Irish Coast Guard had the experience or expertise to assess the tenders, nor had they the ability to oversee the operation of the service once it was commenced.  For example, in 2009 the Future Helicopter Study Group recommended that the next SAR contract should include night-vision technology.  The contract was awarded without a requirement for night-vision technology, which resulted in the aircraft having to be retrofitted in 2013, at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;3.5 million before VAT.  One of the points that has emerged in the report on Rescue 116 is that the lighting in the cockpit was appalling.  I am no export and I have no idea what happened during the retrofitting of the lighting system but I am aware that night-vision technology requires low-level lighting in the cockpit.  I understand modern helicopters have a switch to turn night-vision goggles on and off.</p> <p>Following the crash of Rescue 116, the Department of Transport and the Coast Guard sought in 2017 a company to carry out the work they should have been doing, namely the overseeing of the operation.  I am aware that the Cathaoirleach is about to strike the bell, but this matter is important.  The company that was employed to oversee a &euro;1 billion contract is a one-man operation.  It is outrageous that this happened.  If we learned from nothing else, we should have learned from that.  One of the things we have got to do right now &ndash; I am begging the Leader to get this across to both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport &ndash; is halt the current tender process.  We must not go ahead until we have learned the lessons from Rescue 116.  We cannot have a company that was reckless in respect of safety-----</p></speech>

This is a significant concern given that we are talking about people operating in a kitchen environment and such a situation is not suitable for hygienic reasons.  Equally, however, there are also questions here concerning student dignity.  It is not acceptable to expect students to have to change in toilets and corridors.  I submitted a query about this issue to the management of the university, and the matter has also been raised by the students union there and by the &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il cumann.  This situation was broached with the management of the university prior to the start of the academic year, but frankly I do not think it is acceptable for those students not to have the appropriate changing facilities, especially given the nature of the work in which they are engaged.</p><p>The second issue I wish to raise concerns a lovely story covered in today&rsquo;s <i>Gorey Guardian</i>and syndicated on Independent.ie.  I refer to an interview with a young actor, Jayson Murray, conducted by Cathy Lee.  Jayson recently starred in a play in the Abbey Theatre entitled <i>What I (Don't) Know About Autism</i>.  The production raised a great deal of awareness of the positive contribution made to society by people with autism.  Jayson speaks in the interview about his own experience and the impact of the pandemic on people with autism.  As our society recovers from the pandemic, we must indeed consider the impact it has had on those with autism.  Jayson tells people to feel free to ask questions of people who have autism and to try to understand the condition, and the more awareness and engagement we can have, the better.</p></speech>

It is important and pertinent to the whole area of hospitality.  Given the high numbers of Covid-19 cases that we are experiencing now, we must reinforce public health measures and the requirement for vaccination certificates to be sought by people in the industry.  We have fallen away from doing that, and this message must be reinforced as we enter the Christmas period.</p> <p>I also highlight a boil water notice in force in my county.  It is the Longford central water supply line, but that encompasses most of the county.  A boil water notice has been in place for the last week.  I request that work in this regard be expedited and prioritised to allow the boil water notice to be removed.  As a parent, I sometimes find it difficult to get the kids to brush their teeth at night normally, but added to that now we must try to ensure that we have a bottle of water beside the taps in the different bedrooms as well.  This situation is causing a great deal of concern and I ask that this problem be addressed speedily.</p> <p>I welcome the clarity provided by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, following the raising of the issue regarding playing basketball and other indoor sports.  They are extremely important activities for our younger generation and I thank the Minister of State for taking on that matter and dealing with it so quickly.  I also highlight another sporting issue that has been in the media concerning referees of underage soccer matches in Dublin.  They have withdrawn their services due to the abuse they were getting from the sidelines.  Much of it probably comes from the parents concerned and not from the players themselves.  It is incumbent on all parents to remember that we need referees to enable our games to go ahead.  I was an umpire for 15 years at national level in GAA, but I only ever refereed one game and I would not go back and referee again.  It is important therefore that respect is accorded to our referees and to those giving their time.</p></speech>

Those are the Addameer prisoner support and human rights group, Al-Haq, the Bisan Center for Research and Development, Defense for Children International &ndash; Palestine, the Union of Agricultural Work Committees and the Union of Palestinian Women Committees.  All those organisations have now been labelled as terrorists by the Israeli Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That action has quite rightly been described as a brazen attack on human rights.  The designation came into effect on 3 November but was made public only on Sunday.  These bodies have a 60-day period to appeal this decision to the Israeli courts.  Israel is making declarations on NGOs registered in different states as to whether or not they are terrorist organisations.  It was harrowing to hear the fear in the voice of Irish human rights lawyer, Dr. Susan Power, who works for Al-Haq, as she spoke about the expectation of being raided and arrested by Israeli military forces.  These NGOs are also fully aware of spyware, which they have found on their phones, and their conversations being hacked and listened to.  I have been to the West Bank and I am proud to say I have worked with Addameer, the prisoner support group, which does amazing human rights work.  This morning I looked at its website, which tells me that Israel has 500 prisoners under administrative detention.  That is a euphemism for locking people up, detention without trial and internment.  There are 160 children interned without trial in Israel.  I ask the House to just think about that.</p><p>It is time we stood up to Israel.  Condemnation is not enough.  It is outrageous for Israel to label people as terrorists or anti-Semitic just for speaking out against what is happening in occupied Palestine.  I am proud to call for a campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions, as is my party.  I ask the question again: why do we have our seat on the United Nations Security Council if we are not prepared to stand up and speak out about issues such as these?  We need to see actions against the apartheid state of Israel.  How much longer must we see people being terrorised like these human rights bodies?</p></speech>

As a mother of young children who live for football and partaking in sport, I see a growing amount of violence on our football pitches.  We saw last month in Wicklow a so-called melee on a football pitch.  When does a melee turn into assault?  When does this violence turn into something real?  I do not want my sons growing up thinking it is acceptable to box or elbow someone on a football pitch and hurt them because it is on a football pitch.  The GAA, the FAI and all our other national governing bodies really have to sit back and examine how we are going to police - I do not want to use the word "police" - our football and sport.  There is no sport in violence or abusive language.  That is not sport, and we really have to start examining this because, otherwise, someone will get hurt very badly on a football pitch or other sports field.  We have to stand back and say "enough is enough".  As a parent, I would be mortified to think that our referees will not referee a children's football match because of abuse.  We have to learn to respect one another.  We all have to take a role in this and our national governing bodies have to take a really strong role in it.</p></speech>

He is a future corner forward for Tipperary.  Given the way Meath is performing at the moment, it would provide a good training session for him before the championship starts.</p> <p>On a serious note, I ask that the Leader get an update from the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, on the proposed Fethard primary care centre.  I brought this up as a Commencement matter last May.  In fairness to the Minister of State, she gave an outline of the progress that is happening and where it is, but it is a number of months later and, until work is on the ground, people will not really see the benefit of it.  We have been really lucky in Tipperary with a number of primary care centres that have come through over recent years, when Deputy Harris was Minister for Health.  I am thinking of Tipperary town, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel and Cahir.  The primary care centre in the latter town opened only a couple of weeks before Covid started.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In a lot of ways, it has been a blessing in facilitating people during Covid.  There is a lot of work going on at the moment in Fethard with funding that has gone into primary schools, which are right beside where the primary care centre would be built.  There is also a Fethard town park which is funded under the rural generation development fund.  The park is being built at the moment on the same grounds proposed for the primary care centre.</p><p>The HSE has designated this region as a preferred location for a primary care centre.  It will cover not just Fethard but also Killenaule and Ballingarry and a huge area of west Tipperary on the border of Kilkenny.  There are some 27 groups in the Fethard region who have all come on board around the project for Fethard town park and the primary care centre.  It is a very important project that needs to be speeded up from a departmental point of view if possible.  In her role as Leader I be very grateful if Senator Doherty could put a word in.</p></speech>

It is dreadful.</p> <p>Not so long ago I was outside Leinster House with activists and other campaigners commemorating the senseless and tragic loss of life of Savita Halappanavar that was caused by Ireland's restrictive abortion laws at the time and fears of legal responsibility.  We gathered to say "Never again".</p> <p>Outside Leinster House there was "Our Maternity Hospital" campaign, which is the campaign against church ownership of women's healthcare, and they co-ordinated the call, as they have done for a number of years now, to make our national maternity hospital fully publicly owned and built on fully State-owned land.  We in the Labour Party agree with the aims of the national maternity hospital campaign.  We believe that the national maternity hospital needs to be a fully publicly-owned hospital built on publicly-owned land.  We believe the Government must do everything in its power to ensure a fully publicly-owned hospital built on fully publicly-owned land, which is actually quite a mouthful to say.  This includes being willing to compulsorily purchase the land on which the proposed hospital is to be built.</p> <p>We repealed the eighth amendment, which was only half the battle.  Without ready access to abortion and other services, that repeal will mean very little.  With the new maternity hospital costing the State at least &euro;350 million, and set to be built on land owned by the Sisters of Charity and run by a board appointed by them, the promised access will be compromised.  I fail to see how it cannot be.</p> <p>The Labour Party supports the campaign.  We believe there should be no reliance on charity in the provision of healthcare.  I raise this issue here again today because there continues to be a concern about the influence of religious ethos on this hospital.  Healthcare should be informed by best medical practice and not by religious ethos.  I implore Government Senators to take these concerns seriously and to raise them with their party colleagues.</p></speech>

We have been a long time waiting for this.</p> <p>From the perspective of Navan and Meath, to read the line "The existing rail network in the GDA will be extended by the provision of a new rail line from the M3 Parkway [...] to Navan town" is just fantastic.  It is the first time ever that we have seen those words written down.  We have made it onto an actual transport policy for the State.  The words are "will be", not "may", and not "sometime in the future".  It will be extended.  It is such a huge thing for a county of 200,000 people.  It is a real testament to the spirit of the people of Meath, who are recognised specifically in the document by the officials on page 48 when they said that of the 4,000 submissions in total received for all of the projects in the GDA, 2,000 of those came from people in Meath "reflecting the scale of the campaign to deliver a rail service to Navan".  It is something else in terms of public submissions that nearly 2,000 of the 4,000 people who made a submission did so about the rail line to Navan.  I am glad that the NTA reflected the scale of the campaign in its document by actually committing and saying that yes it will be extended.</p> <p>I thank Meath County Council, the local authorities and the broader community for driving this and for explaining to people that it was so important to engage in the public process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We often talk a great deal in this Chamber about public process.

In recent weeks we have seen progress in policing in Ireland.  The visibility of policing on our streets has been a welcome change in the post Covid-19 reality and in particular in the night-time economy, which is an issue that has been raised here.</p> <p>Policing, of course, goes beyond the streets of Ireland.  Ireland is involved in Interpol, Europol and other international policing organisations.  Later this month, the annual meeting of the Interpol General Assembly will take place, and Ireland will have votes at the assembly.  The executive committee will be elected from that assembly and we will get to choose, as one of the constituent nations, who gets to sit on that committee which might be considered the governing body of Interpol.</p> <p>Interpol is an international policing organisation but the reality is that it has been abused by China in its use of what are called red notices to arrest people that China feels have committed crimes against it, which can be as minor as speaking out against China.  This measure is certainly applied to Chinese citizens, dissidents and refugees from, for example, the Uighur population who have fled China.  It equally applies to Irish citizens who are the subject of red notices, who can land in a country that one might otherwise think is normal and respects the rule of law but, because of a red notice, will have to arrest that Irish citizen at the airport and consider extradition to China.  </p> <p>The reality is that China has been abusing this system and has been using the red notices to operate a kind of long arm of Chinese quasi-law around the world.  This, in reality, is an abuse of its membership of Interpol.  We should consider sending a very clear message to the Minister and the Department of Justice that when we vote at that general assembly later this month, we are not supporting the candidacy of the Chinese candidate, Hu Binchen - who I believe is the name of the person that China is putting forward.  We should be putting down a very clear line that we do not support this kind of abuse of the red notices&rsquo; system within Interpol, which is otherwise a very important mechanism for entrapping international criminals but is currently being abused by China.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.</p></speech>

I welcome this afternoon the publication of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine report on the Irish horse racing industry.  It is an extraordinarily interesting report and I am one of a number of members on the joint Oireachtas committee.  The report has 11 strong recommendations dealing with doping, drug tracing in horses, corporate governance issues and also the composition of a board.  Given the very significant amount of public funds that go into this body, it is critically important.  It is a good piece of work done by members of all parties and none in the Oireachtas.  I commend the report to the House.  It was officially launched after 3 p.m. today.</p> <p>I welcome the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Bill 2021 which was eventually published yesterday.  It is a very important piece of work, particularly for those advocates among us who have been opposed to strategic housing developments, SHDs.  We know they have been a disaster and failure and have cost many citizens we have represented across this country in the judicial reviews they had to undertake.  I welcome the fact that we are hopefully transitioning from the SHD to a large infrastructure approach.  I thank the Leader and her office for organising a briefing for all Members at 5 p.m. this evening on what is a very important Bill.  I thank the House.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan is very welcome as to the Bill which will probably have some amendments from Opposition parties.  It is very important that everyone knows what we are trying to learn from this, which was that the process of SHDs, as we all know, was flawed.</p> <p>I have not seen the recommendations from the horse racing report published today but I hope that it addresses some of the issues that have been highlighted here and in the media over the past number of years.  I thank Senator Boyhan again for bringing that to our notice.</p> <p>Addressing Senator Ward, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the voting instructions from Ireland fully state that we will not tolerate the conduct he describes.  What is really interesting is why this has been tolerated up until now and why the rest of the members of the voting body of Interpol have even allowed such a system to be abused by China.  I will certainly pass on the Senator&rsquo;s messages to the Minister for Justice and the support that he has raised here today for that strategy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Everybody could hear the joy in Senator Cassells's contribution today.

Senator Hoey raised an issue on behalf of the Labour Party.  Many others would share the view that the new national maternity hospital should be independent of any authority other than State policy on the delivery of maternity care.  That certainly could do with updating, as we have all spoken about before.  I recognise that the Senator also supported Senator Gavan in his praise for Senator Black.  She raised this matter here last week and spoke eloquently for three or four minutes on the work that the groups do and on the unilateral decision made by the Israeli Government.  I thank both Senators for putting their support on the record today.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn looked for an update on the Fethard primary care centre.  I will happily write to the Minister today to seek an update and come back to the Senator.</p> <p>Senator McGreehan talked about what I can only call a lack of sportsmanship.  She was absolutely right in talking about this.  It does, unfortunately, stem from the sidelines and from the mammies and daddies who sometimes get overly exuberant.  However, when this exuberance drives them to display the lack of sportsmanship we have seen far too often on our football pitches, that must be taken to task.  The Senator is right to call on the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU to check themselves and to make sure we are sending out the right messages to create sportsmanship and develop the team element of these sports.  There is no pride in winning if one has to win a particular way.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy asked for a debate on tourism, as did Senator Conway.  Given that we have reopened our skies to American tourists and that American skies were opened to Irish tourists yesterday, it is really important that we go back to marketing our land, our hospitality and our welcome as far and as wide as we possibly can.  The Senator also mentioned boil water notices in Longford.  I have also heard other colleagues talk about Wexford in recent weeks.  It really is not acceptable or tolerable in a modern society that these notices should be in place for so long.  Accidents can happen and emergencies take place but to be here a week later and still scrabbling for a resolution really leaves a lot to be desired.  I wish the Senator a speedy recovery and hope the issue gets resolved very quickly.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about a lack of appropriate changing facilities.  I do not know if he wants me to write to the president of Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, to support him but I could certainly do that today.  I hope we will get a response very quickly.</p> <p>As he does week in, week out, Senator Craughwell brought up what is probably the issue most consistently raised in this House not only by him, but by anybody.  He talked about search and rescue and the men and women who fly our planes every day not only to rescue us off our coasts and inland, but also for commercial and national purposes.  The report regarding Rescue 116 issued on Friday.  The lives of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy and winch team members, Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith, were lost in this incident.  The report highlighted the tragic loss of those lives and the senselessness of how the incident occurred.  We are having a debate in this House next Thursday on the report on Rescue 116 and on the recommendations arising from it.  Let us be very clear; there are many State agencies that must learn from the multiple mistakes that caused the tragedy on that day which meant that those four people did not come home to their families.  One thing Senator Craughwell is right about is that the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 is at Committee Stage in this House.  We have a real opportunity to strengthen that Bill to make sure that no regulatory authority will ever again have to question whether it has a responsibility for air safety in this country.  I believe the Bill is not as strong as it should be as primary legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We will have that debate on Rescue 116 on Thursday week.</p><p>Senator Conway spoke about Ireland's marketing budget and the need for the amalgamation on it to ensure we sell our capital as much as we can.  I do not mean the capital city of Dublin; I mean the entire welcome and the wealth of beautiful scenery and hospitality we have in Ireland.</p><p>Senator Horkan talked about is a very welcome mental health initiative run by the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA.  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, did something similar a few years ago in 2017.  It is most welcome.  What is particularly welcome about it is the fact it is so discreet and anonymous, because for some reason, we still have an issue - pride, I suppose - in admitting people are vulnerable.  It is a welcome initiative.  I thank the Senator for raising it here today and for applauding those involved.  I challenge every other organisation that has members, of which there are many, to do exactly the same for their membership.  People are fragile.  Our children do not have the resilience they should have and that we probably had as kids.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure the people we care about and the organisations we are part of are inclusive and that we mind and look after each other.</p><p>Senator Wall and the Deputy Leader, Senator O'Loughlin, opened today's proceedings looking for an update on the Monasterevin day care centre.  I will do my best to find out what is causing the delay and I will come back to both Senators.  Senator Wall talked about the lack of GP services in County Kildare and is looking for an update from the Minister, which I will try to get.</p><p>Senator Garvey made a call-out today for the return of what probably is, unfortunately, tens of thousands of people who have left these shores, not just in the past ten years, but probably since we were younger in the 1980s and 1990s.  These are craftsmen we are crying out for now.  We all know that for those who do not have a husband who is handy, even those who want somebody to put up curtains in their house, the waiting lists are weeks long.  Those who want painting, decorating, extensions or plumbing done will be waiting for weeks.  That is because of the ambitious plans of Government to ensure we build, build, build.  However, we will not be able to build without the people to build.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue today.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile talked about the joined-up thinking we should have with regard to promoting sports activities and transport routes to get home.  I cannot believe that the port tunnel will close five minutes before the game is over on a night when we are bringing thousands of people into Dublin city.  It makes no sense.  I suppose it leaves an awful lot to be desired about the joined-up thinking we have in this country.  The Senator asked me to raise the issue with the Minister for Transport, and I will certainly do so.</p><p>Senator McDowell talked about the draft Dublin transport strategy that was published today.  I can only say how dismayed I am by it, and I know Senator Cassells is so delighted by it.  It is a week after we issued probably the most ambitious targets from a climate perspective.  Transport is one of the two industries that are very responsible for us achieving those targets.  The only way we are going to meet the targets is by getting people out of their cars, and not just walking and cycling.  Walking and cycling are great, but not everybody can do that.  We need to get people onto public transport.  Tinkering around with BusConnects is just not going to cut it for the next ten years.  I know that the problem is not money.  We must get to the root of what is causing the delay on the MetroLink, metro north and DART+ projects and what is causing us to say it will be 2042, when the Senator and I will be well retired, before we are getting around to do something for the southside.</p></speech>

It is just not good enough.  It is not from a lack of ambition, so there has to be some other plausible reason, and we need to feel our way through to get to the bottom of it.  The Senator has asked for a debate on the issue and I am glad he has.  I will certainly take pleasure in organising it.  We will in the next few weeks get to the bottom of what is going on, so that one third of the Irish population will be able to come out of their houses in the morning, will not have to get into their cars, and will be able to walk to a decent local bus or train service or even hop on a scooter if they are only going to travel a few kilometres up the road.  We need to have that conversation.</p> <p>Senator Cummins raised the issue of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and the upsides and downsides of the organisation.  We know, and I think it is not necessarily a criticism of the organisation but of the strategic housing development, SHD, process, that there have been months of delays in decisions that would have been made within six months a number of years ago.  There are people waiting for months on standard decisions that should be coming out of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Senator also highlighted the fact the organisation gave the green light to the construction of 1,592 new apartments on the northside of Dublin this week, which is most welcome.</p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin opened proceedings today with the welcome reminder that, as much as some of our male counterparts would like to tell us the gender pay gap does not exist, today is the day when some women in Ireland basically stop working because the boys get paid more than the girls do, and the boys will keep getting paid until the end of the year and the girls get paid less.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must all band together to say we need a society where a job is paid on merit and it does not and should not make any difference whether I wear a pair of trousers or a skirt to work.

This nonsense of the continuing practice in this country of paying women less just because they are women absolutely has to stop.  Much and all as I probably knows it galls people when we do this, we must raise this issue every single year and we will keep doing so until this practice stops.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#FF00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House to discuss the progressing disability services for children and young people programme and assessments of needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#FF00300"><p>I thank the Senators for their invitation to discuss one of the most fundamental reforms in the health services in recent memory, which is the implementation of the progressing disability services for children and young people, PDS, programme.  It would be disingenuous of me not to acknowledge that the HSE has had considerable challenges in implementing the PDS programme in parts of the country.  We would only be codding ourselves to say otherwise.  It is important as well to say that I am here as the Minister of State with responsibility for disability in the Department of Health and that I am not a spokesperson for the HSE.</p> <p>It is sometimes hard to defend the indefensible.  Unfortunately, the challenges faced in some parts of the country have resulted in delays for families in accessing much-needed therapies for their children.  I express my sincere apologies to any family experiencing such delays, and I am sure the HSE does as well.  Historically, children's disability services have been provided by a range of statutory and non-statutory service providers that delivered services based on a child's diagnosis or age.  The type and level of service provided varied widely throughout the country, with some children receiving an excellent service while others got little or none.  This variance may have been linked to diagnosis, age group or geography.</p> <p>The PDS programme, on the other hand, sees the reconfiguration of children's disability services across all statutory and non-statutory organisations into children's disability network teams, CDNTs.  These teams aim to provide equitable child and family-centred services based on the child's needs rather than diagnosis or where the child lives or goes to school.  As part of the PDS programme, children's disability services are changing from being based on diagnosis to being based on needs, so that all children with a disability or developmental delay have access to the right service based on their needs no matter where they live or go to school.  Our clear objective is to end the unacceptable inequitable access to therapeutic supports children with complex functional needs rely on to achieve their potential.</p> <p>The national policy on access to services for children and young people with disability and developmental delay provides a single point of entry, signposting parents and other referrers to the most appropriate service.  Senators may not be aware, for example, that the HSE primary care services provide supports for children with non-complex functional difficulties, while children's disability network teams, under the remit of HSE disability services, provide for children with complex functional difficulties.</p> <p>Under the PDS programme, children's disability services are delivered for those aged 18 and younger through these children's disability network teams.  This means we no longer have the inexcusable situation whereby a child ages out of early years services without ever having being seen by an early intervention team, only then to go to the bottom of another waiting list to be seen by a school age team.  A total of 91 children's disability networks are aligning to 96 community healthcare networks.  On full reconfiguration, every child with complex needs arising from his or her disability will have access to a children's disability network team.</p> <p>The Senators can see from the document I have provided that community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 has seven such teams and the reconfiguration there took place in September 2021.  In CHO 2, there are six CDNTs and that reconfiguration happened in October 2021.  Mayo will have three CDNTs, with the last to be established in December of this year.  A total of seven CDNTs are in place in CHO 3 and 14 in CHO 4, which covers the Cork-Kerry area.  We have huge issues in the Cork-Kerry area, as some Senators may be aware.  The reconfiguration there took place long before the situation we find ourselves in now, with many more teams coming into place.  CHO 5 has 12 CDNTs and they have been in place since September 2021, while CHO 6 has had its seven CDNTs in place since 13 September 2021 and CHO 7 has had its 11 reconfigured CDNTs in place since 20 September 2021.  In CHO 8, four CDNTs have come on board since 25 October and the last eight CDNTs will come on stream from November 2021.  The 12 CDNTs in CHO 9 have been in place since September 2021.</p> <p>It is important to recognise the mass reconfiguration that is taking place.  Leaving aside CHO 3 and CHO 4, we can see the flurry of work occurring throughout the country with this reconfiguration.  It is important as well to contextualise what reconfiguration means.  It means we are upsetting our apple cart completely.  We have lead agencies, which could be Enable Ireland or the Brothers of Charity, working with HSE providers.  They are all coming together to form teams.  Some people might never have worked as part of these teams before.  It is also important to say that many of the HSE teams, believe it or not, were working off paper records and were handing over paper files to some of the lead teams.  Looking at what we are handing over and what we are trying to pull together, therefore, it is vast and complex.  In addition, we never had real figures concerning this area until the true numbers started coming through now to the CDNTs.</p> <p>Enable Ireland, for example, is doing phenomenal work in CHO 4.  Talking to the CEO of the organisation one day, I asked about the number of cases the teams would be dealing with.  The figure the HSE had provided for one team was 872 cases, but the actual number increased to a total caseload of 1,800 for that team.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important to put it in that context so people will understand that when we talk about reconfiguration; it is not just about taking from one side of the table and giving to the other.  It is more vast.  We are moving staff around the place and expecting staff who have never met before to start working together for the first time.  We must also think of the families and children not getting letters, not knowing what is going on and the lack of information.  The process is in a state of flux but, for the first time, I can give dates and timelines for the reconfiguration.  I do not have a figure for each of the 91 teams, but I have outlined my objective.</p><p>The teams comprise a range of health service practitioners.  I have addressed that.  The services include universal, targeted and specialist supports, such as individual therapeutic intervention and access to specialist consultation and assessment when needed.  Supports will be provided when feasible in the child&rsquo;s natural environments &ndash; the home, school and community.  What cannot be disputed is the unprecedented level of additional resources that have gone into strengthening therapy services.  Since 2019, 285 therapists have been added to the teams.  At the same time, however, we are still short approximately 400 staff.  The staff in this labour market are predominantly women, and at all times our staff level seems to be down by 40%, for various reasons.</p><p>I am pleased to inform Senators that further investment is planned for 2022.  I will announce it in my HSE service plan.  There will be more staff.  I am glad to tell the House that I am going to ensure that there will be, for the first time ever, administrative staff because therapists are doing secretarial work.  There are therapists writing the reports and writing to the parents.  We want them delivering the services.  They need to be supported by administrative staff.  When we get to that stage of balance, we will have a functioning service.  I do not believe we have one at this moment.</p><p>On assessments of needs and the assumption of ministerial responsibility, Senators will have heard me talk about the matter more than once.  I am not going to rehash it, but it was good news that we cleared a backlog down to 500.  That was a story there and then but it is not the story now.  The story now, I must be honest with the House, is that I am disappointed to learn that, despite the phenomenal work of the HSE in recent weeks on clearing the backlog in the middle of the pandemic, the latest quarterly data from the HSE on needs assessments show how it has backtracked on its own progress.  The total number of children awaiting an assessment of needs, including those who make up the backlog, amounts to just under 4,000.  </p><p>We have spent a lot of time at committee meetings discussing how the SOP was supposed to work.  I was always led to believe that the backlog concerning the assessment of needs was under the old regime, whereby it could have taken up to 20 or 30 hours to get an assessment done.  Then there was to be the SOP, which was to be a direct intervention.  We should never have been in a state in September, October and November of this year in which there was a backlog.  I am very disappointed about it.  As I stated, I am not here to defend the HSE but to be very honest, open and transparent.  In being so, I have one for everyone in the audience in respect of the latest third quarter management report concerning the assessment-of-needs process.  It is important that the House familiarise itself with this.  I cannot in my ten minutes address the issues associated with why I am so disappointed that we have built up a backlog.  I have seen the letters that have been circulated and I have noted how disappointed Senators and, most important, the parents have been.  When Senators read the report, they will see how the parents are not getting responded to when they say they are not getting a service and that they are not getting a date or time.  The report states this clearly.  I look forward to contributing later.</p></speech>

It is refreshing to see someone of her calibre come to the House to share that information with us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#GG00300"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome to the House.  It is always good to have her here to discuss the progression of the disability services programme and the assessment of needs.  I welcome her robust and honest opening statement.  Robustness and honesty from a Minister are always welcome.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il very much welcome this debate.  We have always been advocates for people with disabilities, and we have worked to assist and worked towards a rights-based model.  I am glad the Minister of State is at the helm.  When she was speaking, it crossed my mind that there is a lack of movement from the Department of Health.  Could she give us an update on that?  That would be welcome.</p><p>It is excellent to have a champion like the Minister of State fighting for the rights of people with disabilities.  No one in the Oireachtas knows the challenges associated with meeting the needs of children with disabilities better than her.  She is acutely aware of the delays and discrepancies and their impact on children and their families.  Her constant availability and openness to meeting families and representatives of disability organisations are always welcome and appreciated.</p><p>The PDS is a significant programme of reform, which we hope will change the way we deliver services and supports for children with complex needs.  As we all know, children&rsquo;s disability services have developed in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner.  While some children have received an excellent service, others have received none.</p><p>The Minister of State highlighted that the provision of services is currently incredibly inequitable and varies depending on a child&rsquo;s disability and age, in addition to where he or she goes to school and lives.  This inequity is deplorable.  What was in place was not working.  We must now examine critically and constructively the proposed system and make sure it is flexible and will work.  We must ensure there are review mechanisms as we move forward with the programme because we cannot expect one strategy to fit all.  Arrangements may need to be amended, and flexibility will need to be written into the system to ensure it works for each community health organisation, CHO.  As we know needs differ from one CHO to the next.  We need a streamlining of attitudes across all boards.</p><p>Last year, the Government provided nearly &euro;8 million to address the backlog affecting assessments of need.  I am incredibly disappointed to hear there has been such a dramatic increase in the backlog given all the excellent work during a pandemic.  How did the HSE allow the assessment-of-needs backlog to build back up after the huge investment?  Is the SOP not working?  As I said, a constant review of all our actions needs to be taken.</p><p>There is a relationship between the intervention and the assessment of need.  As rightly highlighted, this needs to be far more cohesive.  Historically, there has been a difficulty because we have no standard way of performing assessments.  A clinician in one part of Ireland may carry out an assessment in an entirely different way from a clinician in another part.  This has led to the possibility of clinicians being very conservative and spending a great deal of time doing assessments.  As the Minister of State said, the PDS is an integral part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Could we have an update on the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms from her point of view?  I am aware that these are a key priority for her and the Government.  We must be positive about this.  We must be constructive and look to the future to determine how we can move towards the social model and away from the medical model.  The children are not sick; they just need therapy and to have their needs met.  Therefore, it is progressive that we are moving away from the Department of Health.  The children are not sick; they need help and therapy to be their best selves.</p><p>I am contacted regularly on the issue of waiting lists.  I will not elaborate on it because my time is running out.  I have a few more questions I would like to ask.  Has the HSE drafted a clinical baseline for each team to ensure it is not oversubscribed?  Has the HSE provided to the Minister of State a breakdown of the number of children assigned to each team?  What clinical oversight mechanisms does the executive have in place to ensure teams are not burned out?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Has the HSE considered any alternative measures, such as the use of technology, to tackle those terrible waiting lists?  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters this year, Dr. Cathal Morgan, head of operations, disability services, said:</p><blockquote>	There is an old phrase: &quot;Culture eats strategy for breakfast.&quot;  We can pour in all the resources we want, but if there is not a fundamental change in how clinicians work, there are no standardised norms in how we perform interventions and our system is one of assessments only, then we create a waiting list for assessment and then another for intervention.  That has to stop.  We must move to a scenario where children are on an intervention pathway from the get-go. </blockquote><p>How is that culture, that eats strategy for breakfast, changing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#HH00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her statement today and her continued work and commitment.  She is extraordinarily dedicated and shows a determination and will since taking up office that is to be lauded and praised, and I sincerely mean that.  Her office is super: if I contact her officials, I get an immediate response.  There is a sense that work is getting done and that they are listening, which is really impressive.  I thank her for that.</p> <p>The Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme is great in the services it will provide.  The way it will do so in an equitable and consistent manner is fantastic.  However, in the here and now, there is nothing but inequality and inconsistency.  I see incredible political will.  I saw it previously with my party colleagues when they were leading the Government.  I see it in our shared three-party Government.  We have committed eye-watering budgets to this, yet there continues to be a problem.</p> <p>As I have raised with the Minister of State before, one of the first representations I had was that of a mother with a newborn child with Down's syndrome.  She was in a scenario in which with each application she made, she had to prove that her child needed them.  I do not understand why we have not put a pack together that outlines what is in store for parents.  It should be cross-departmental in its provision of information.  It should ensure the supports available to them and the realities are reflected in it, and that it is made easy for them.  Children might be assessed but will they receive the services identified through that assessment?  If they live in Dublin 12, they certainly will not.  At present, in that entire Dublin postcode area, no child is receiving that service.  I have raised this matter with the Minister of State before.  There is a postcode lottery as to who, when and what services they receive.</p> <p>I get emails from parents who cannot understand why early intervention windows are missed or that someone has the gall to send them a letter that states they are on a waiting list for an occupational therapist, whose services they will receive in 2024 when their child needs it now.  Families have received letters for appointments that were due to take place this month, that have now been postponed for a whole year.  Families are resorting to accessing services privately.  The problem with that is that it is a question of whether a person can afford them or not.  In the lottery of life, depending on what family one is born into and whether it can afford it or not, a person will be set on the right course and be given the right opportunities to live his or her best life or not.  That is not okay.  There are situations in which the provision of resources allocated to twins is as though they are one person instead of two people.  These are individual citizens deserving of the rights of our State.  Parents who were assessed in January this year and require further assessments have been informed that they have been moved on to the progressive disability programme and they will have a 36-month long waiting list.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the Minister of State is not an apologist for the HSE.  I am venting many of the issues I have already put to her in emails and have spoken about with members of her office.  Parents are tired of advocating for their children and are worn out having to repeatedly fight.  If my child were involved, I would be chained to the gates of Leinster House.  It is appalling that people are sent to that level of distress when they are already worried about the forward planning for their child.  They hear of situations such as that in Donegal and wonder what will happen when they are no longer here.  Senator McGreehan referred to the disability matters committee.  I come into this House every Thursday each week and share what I have heard in that committee and the lived experience of people.  The testimony is that of paternalistic provisions, infantilising in our approach, the othering of people and ableist in our presumptions.  People do not come before the committee as storytellers.  They are there to say that they are here and they have rights, that they want to influence policy and decisions, and that they should be at the centre of decision making.</p> <p>Last week, one of the witnesses who came before the committee was an autistic woman with autistic children.  She spoke about cognitive behavioural therapy the objective of which is to mask the autism.  She used the term "eugenics".  I never thought I would hear that spoken about in this Oireachtas, something about which we should never hear in this State, since its foundation.  There is a feeling of the othering of people or not being a citizen or being entitled, and being someone who we benevolently care for which, when in fact we should centre our whole State and all our decisions around how we ensure everyone has a right of access, that homes are designed so that people can not only visit but can also stay over.  We know of people who have been unable to do that.  The Minister responsible for disability should not be a Minister of State but a full Cabinet Minister, such is the value of the statement we need to make.  We must give the Minister of State the autonomy to make all the decisions and command the power and budget that she deserves to bring home the determination and will that she has set out.  That is the direction in which we need to go.</p> <p>We must deal with sections 38 and 39.  There is a bleeding of staff from one service to the other.  If we rely on section 38 providers, we must ensure staff are retained.  I thank the Chair for indulging me.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister of State on her great work since then.  There are many broken issues and she has dealt with them with great stealth and passion, for which I thank her.  The Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People is a national programme which is changing the way services are provided, which is a positive outcome.</p> <p>As I am from Clare, I wish to highlight the figures released in February which state that 524 children across the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 3 region that covers Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary, are overdue an assessment of their needs.  This included and was not limited to those on the autism spectrum and those awaiting assessments.  On a personal level, I have seen first-hand what happens when people get early intervention and the difference it can make.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of that.  I support her and offer my assistance in any way I can.</p> <p>It seems every individual parent has to fight for services and rights for their children.  It is as though each individual kid becomes a whole new problem, as if there has never been a child with this issue before, and that is not fair on parents.  It is challenging enough to be parent, but it is even more so to be the parent of a child with special needs.  There is something wrong with parents having to launch a huge campaign for each individual child.  I am not saying this is the Minister of State's fault.  Sometimes people become numbers on computers.  They are not numbers on computers; they are our children and our future, and we need to support the parents and services in any way we can.  It should not be left to fundraising for the different services needed.  The State has access to money and there should be no issues in regard to services.  What is the Minister of State doing to progress this very challenging issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#HH00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for providing a copy of her statement.  It is great to hear her positive outlook for this programme.  I am hopeful there will be a positive future with high-quality, timely, much-needed services for the sector.</p> <p>I was distressed to hear the recent contribution from Senator Seery Kearney regarding the discussion at the Oireachtas disability committee when it was recounted that neurotypical persons were advised to mask symptoms of autism when in public.  I thank the Senator for sharing that story in this House this week and last week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we know what is really happening in the lives of people with disabilities.  If we in this House cannot share the direct experience of disability the least we can do is amplify the voices of those who do and share their stories.  I commend Senator Seery Kearney for doing so.  I hope that in the House we can bring much-needed attention to persons living with visible and hidden disabilities.</p><p>I also want to raise specific points from an organisation that represents those who will be affected by this national programme.  Down Syndrome Ireland will have listened intently to what the Minister of State said in her opening statement and to what she will say in answer to some of the questions people have.  Down Syndrome Ireland has highlighted to me the concerns and experiences of its members with regard to accessing care.  Progressing disability services for children and young people is a national programme, the objectives of which are to address inequity in therapeutic and multidisciplinary services, to have a national unified approach, to have a clear referral pathway and to have integrated care.  All of these are incredibly important.  As other people have highlighted, they have been sorely lacking until now in many areas.  Down Syndrome Ireland told me this is an admirable goal but, as we know, the reality is very different.  Families are reporting a complete breakdown in services with many receiving no therapy, sometimes for years at a time.  A survey by Down Syndrome Ireland of families prior to the pandemic showed that almost half of families with a child with Down's syndrome were offered no therapy in the previous year.  Those offered therapy averaged just five sessions, which is well below the level needed for best practice.</p><p>There are concerns about the communication on changes in the reconfiguration of services, with only 13% of families in the survey happy with the level of communication on reconfiguration.  A total of 95% of those who responded to the survey were either unsure about how their service would be affected or believed they would receive a poorer service, with only 5% anticipating an improvement.  This is not to be a Debbie Downer.  It is really worrying that the Minister of State is here today speaking about what I believe will be a very positive change but service users are very concerned about it.  They feel the progress and opportunities are not clear with regard to how it will work.  I wanted to give the Minister of State this figure because I believe it is important.</p><p>Down Syndrome Ireland also states that whatever way services are configured and communicated there is no denying there are just not enough therapy posts to allow meaningful levels of therapy for every child who needs it.  Families spoke to Down Syndrome Ireland about their frustration with inconsistencies in the service, staff turnover, short blocks of therapy with very long breaks in between and therapists being absent, on long-term leave or redeployed.  These factors, along with some concerns about communication, could be potential major stumbling blocks to accessing therapy for their children.  I wanted to share these concerns from this particular organisation.  I am sure these concerns might be echoed in a number of organisations.</p><p>In recent years, the most quoted line from the founding document of the Republic, the Proclamation, has been that on "cherishing all the children of the nation equally".  It has become the mantra of many a campaign and movement in Ireland and it is as relevant today as it was in 1916.  In part, this is because the same sense of fairness that informed the writers of the document still inform Irish sensibilities today.  Rather tragically, the same reality is true today as it was back then, which is that we are not all cherished, assisted and supported equally in Ireland.  We need only look at the rates of unemployment and attendance rates at further and higher education of people living with disabilities, and the indignity visited on some who have to calculate what opportunities they can pursue against the risk of how many State supports they would lose if they did so, to see things are still very unfair and unequal.</p><p>To go back to the matter at hand, the programme is about service delivery.  As stated, the programme seeks to ensure that services should be based on a child's needs rather than diagnosis and the services available where they live.  These are incredibly laudable and important aims.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and a reproductive rights activist.  We hear time and again from those seeking mental health, reproductive health and disability services that the two greatest barriers are diagnosis and geography.  Diagnosis is particularly important because people are spending, as has been highlighted, inordinate amounts of money going privately.  We know what therapies will help them.  We know what the children need.  We just need to get it to them.</p><p>I hope that progressing disability services for children and young people marks a turning point in access to services geographically and financially.  We have all heard the stories from friends, family, local people and colleagues about the battles that have to be fought to get services.  This is incredibly laudable and worthwhile and I wish the Minister of State the very best in getting the reconfiguration to where it needs to be.  We need to be realistic with regard to the amount of work that needs to be done.  I have highlighted the experiences of Down Syndrome Ireland.  It is not alone.  The jump from what is to what I hope will be is enormous.  I wish the Minister of State well with the task.  Many questions have already been asked, including on burnout, employment numbers and section 39 organisations.  People are exiting the sector at rapid rates.  How will the Minister of State marry this with what is an ambitious aim?  I wish her the very best with the reconfiguration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#JJ00200"><p>I warmly welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank her for all the work she is doing in this area.  I am very aware she works extremely hard and no better woman for the job.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, that there should be a full Cabinet Minister with responsibility for disabilities.</p> <p>As we work towards a national reframing of services for disabled young people and those requiring specific educational support through the progressing disabilities services programme, it is vital that we are ambitious and keep the principles of dignity and equality laid out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the forefront of all we do.  The progressing disabilities services programme offers an opportunity to create a level playing field for all families in Ireland no matter what their background or where they live.  We must guard against confusing equality of access to services for a one-size-fits-all approach as was sometimes done in the past.  The new national programme must be person centred and solidly grounded in an understanding of support services as a right that enables all young people to flourish, reach their full potential and participate equally in our shared future.  Long-term planning and multiannual funding will be needed to make sure services throughout the country have the expertise and resources they need to make sure appropriate support is available to all who need it in a timely manner and to put an end to families having to battle constantly for scraps of support that barely cover the basics.</p> <p>Trust was shaken by the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" revelations last year about the Department of Health compiling information on families forced to take cases to receive the support they needed.  We need to rebuild this trust with a real commitment to transparency and fairness and an end to the under-resourcing that treats families in need of support as adversaries.  As well as long-term financial commitment, it is vital that we make a commitment to transitioning the services and supports away from an outdated medical model view of disability towards a rights-based approach which puts families at the centre of decisions about their lives.  To do this, the voices of disabled young people need to be more clearly listened to in all stages of planning and delivery.  Disabled young people and their families must be consulted about how these changes impact their lives.  We must create a system that is responsive to their needs.  We must move away from harmful practices that seek to isolate or impose conformity on disabled children and instead support their diversity and ensure they have the tools they need to build towards the lives they choose for themselves.</p> <p>Our national disability framework action plan guarantees that access to services will be based on need and not on diagnosis.  This is an approach I warmly welcome.  I hope to see it expanded in the years to come.  However, all too often the insight of families on what supports their children require goes unheard.  They must rely on diagnosis to make their needs heard.  This is particularly the case as young people progress in education or as they make the transition out of secondary school.  The revised assessment of need standard operating protocol must include access to correct diagnosis for those who want one.  This will not only guard against a future of unmet needs but will allow young people to understand themselves better as they grow.  We must also address the regulatory and structural barriers that remain to ensure neither disabled people nor their carers risk poverty as we move forward together.</p> <p>I urge the State to ratify as soon as possible the optional protocol of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to show that the time of empty promises is past and that Ireland is committed to vindicating the rights of its disabled citizens and to creating a more equal society that values all of its people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We must not forget that long-term mental ill health is disabling and that these past years with the pressures of Covid, and I know this from the work I have done on the Joint Sub-committee on Mental Health, have presented new challenges which will require new answers.  I look forward to a renewed commitment towards ensuring mental health support services are available to all who need them as part of the progressing disabilities services programme.  A lot of work has been done in tackling the stigma surrounding an important part of all our health.  As we move more strongly towards a framework that treats people in crisis and their families with dignity and respect, it is important we embed appropriate mental health support for young people throughout the country as an essential foundation for their futures.</p><p>I reiterate what all of my colleagues have said and wish the Minister of State well going forward in this particular job.  I know how difficult her job must be and I thank her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1630" speakername="Catherine Ardagh" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#KK00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I thought her speech was very honest and informative.</p> <p>I wish to convey some positive news about the way we treat people with disabilities.  There are 12,700 people with autism and learning disabilities in the education system and &euro;9.2 billion was put into education funding in budget 2022 with additional special education assistants and teachers.</p> <p>Obviously there are a lot more obstacles for pupils and teachers when it comes to deciding who goes into these special classes and gets special needs assistance, so there has to be a framework.  I do not think these services should be part of the Department of Health but done in conjunction with the Department of Education because they are too important.  In general, taking children out of school or cr&egrave;che environments to go to therapies is a waste of time and eats into their educational needs.</p> <p>I thank the Government colleagues of the Minister of State, namely, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, for supporting the creation of Our Lady of Hope School, on which I and Senator Seery Kearney worked.</p> <p>There is some hope in terms of the Government listening to parents, and that should be noted.  Unfortunately, however, and I have raised this many times, there is a major issue with therapies and that is where we are at today.  The Minister of State hit the nail on the head.  The issue is recruitment and retention.  We are short 400 staff and 40% of the current staff are out sick.</p> <p>Is an assessment of needs approach the way forward?  Ultimately, parents just want therapy.  They do not want to wait three years for an assessment of needs but want their child to start occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy or psychology services immediately.  We need a discussion.  Are we wasting time getting a complex assessment of needs report or should we just jump into providing therapies for children?  Parents want their children to receive therapies and parents want to learn early doors how to support their children in a home environment.</p> <p>As many Senators have pointed out in the debate, parents who can afford to pay for therapies must pay &euro;60 for 30 minutes and sometimes they must pay that sum twice a week for some children, which is a huge amount of money.  It is so unfair because the children whose parents cannot afford to pay for therapies are not getting the early intervention while those who can are.  They are doing it by borrowing from family members and taking out loans.  Some parents have the opportunity to do this while others simply do not, rely on the State and have been very let down by it.  We hear all the time that early intervention is key.  Imagine the guilt of a parent who just cannot get that early intervention for his or her child.  Senator Seery Kearney said that some people have a mask, so to speak, and drop the mask on certain occasions.  The State is not giving our children these therapies just so that they can build up a really good mask and look like they do not have whatever complex needs or disability they have.</p> <p>The Mori community in New Zealand has a beautiful word for autism.  It is Takiwtanga and means in his or her own time and space.  It is a lovely way to characterise someone with autism or additional sensory needs.  It is incumbent on us to learn a little bit more about autism.  We are all learning about it but there is so much more we need to understand as parents, legislators and caregivers.</p> <p>As I said at the beginning, all services like occupational therapy and speech and language therapy should be delivered in preschool and education settings.  The idea of parents taking their children out of an education setting in the middle of a school day to attend a treatment session that lasts half an hour is nonsensical.  It is a damning indictment of the system.  It is also wrong that all of this money is spent on the assessment of needs when there are no therapies at the end.</p> <p>I cannot even look at the report that has been circulated because it is so upsetting.  Both I and Senator Seery Kearney live and work in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7.  The Department has produced statistics, and I know the Minister of State is sickened by them, that only 10% of people have commenced a stage 2 assessment and no one completed a full assessment in CHO 7 in the last quarter of 2021.  No assessments are being made and no therapies are being delivered in CHO 7.  Imagine how guilty the parents feel about being unable to access therapies for their children.  I find it hard to fathom such a situation and believe we need to do a lot more.  We need to analyse the viability of the assessment of needs framework given we do not have the staff to complete therapies.  Parents just want therapies and to learn how to help their children.</p> <p>The Minister of State is the woman for this job because she has invested a lot of time and energy and helped to clear pathways.  It seems she is swimming up current so she must be frustrated by this situation.  I commend her on doing great research on this issue and meeting many families.  However, we need to consider the assessment of needs in a different way because it does not work.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing her contribution because I had to attend a briefing provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage ahead of tomorrow's legislation.</p> <p>In advance of this debate I took the opportunity to read the discussion that took place at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters in May on the topic of the progressing disability services model and the withdrawal of occupational therapies from schools.  Much of this has been discussed here but it is apparent that there were a large and growing number of children on the waiting list for an assessment of needs, with many having waited for very long periods.  I know once-off funding of &euro;7.8 million was provided in June 2020 to address the issue.  Overdue assessments of need stood at around 6,500 in June 2020.  By September of this year, approximately 6,040 children had an assessment completed, so the backlog was reduced to around 520 cases.  While this process greatly reduced the waiting lists for an assessment of need, it was achieved by transferring many therapists away from conducting actual therapy interventions to conducting assessments of need.  While many children had their needs assessed, they have not yet received any of the therapies identified as needed in their assessments of needs, and the list of children to receive therapy interventions has grown.</p> <p>At the committee meeting last May, it was also stated that 40 children's disability network teams were up and running and the rest - 91 in total - would be up and running by the end of the second quarter.  I do not believe this commitment was realised.  I saw a question asked by one of my party colleagues, Deputy Pauline Tully.  In September, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, acknowledged that only 83 of the children's disability network teams had been fully configured and the remaining teams would be configured by the end of November.  I would be interested in hearing an update on that from the Minister of State present.</p> <p>The success of PDS was dependent on proper planning of the change and resources being made available to the new CDNTs set up around the country.  Neither has happened and confusion now abounds in the this area of children's disability.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh and Seery Kearney have spoken about the local experience.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Reports are coming into constituency offices throughout the State regarding ongoing issues with some CDNTs that have been established, such as insufficient staff, low morale, with staff finding it difficult to cope, constant turnover of staff, and many children not receiving the therapies they require.  Some children are being told they will have to wait two to three years for various therapies.  Although funding was made available for the recruitment of additional therapists, the HSE is finding it hard to recruit some of the professions, especially psychologists.  I call for the remaining CDNTs to be configured and resourced properly.  There is a need for a significant increase in therapists across all disciplines, as the Minister of State mentioned.  Psychologists are in particularly short supply.  There needs to be a ramping up of service delivery.  Children need access to consistent therapy interventions.  Training courses for parents are welcome in addition to access to therapy interventions but should in no way be used to replace face-to-face interventions from therapists. </p><p>Finally, the issue of the transfer of medical records to the national disability network teams needs to be sorted out as soon as possible.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and the opportunity to put on record some of these matters.</p></speech>

I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Seery Kearney and others regarding the Minister of State's personal passion and commitment.  There have been other Ministers who might be described as bluffing.  Maybe they tried their best but certainly the work of the Minister of State and the way she approaches it is peppered with sincerity.  If delivery does not happen it will not be for the want of trying.  However, I am convinced delivery will happen.  Universal access is needed throughout the country.  We cannot have a situation where in Senator Seery Kearney's area people are not being looked after.  They are not even getting their assessments, not to mention treatment.  In CHO 3, which is my area, access is patchy.  In some areas the system is improving, albeit from an extremely low base.  In other areas, the system is very poor.  As the Minister of State will be aware, early intervention is critical for young people.  If they receive treatment at an early age, their chances of living a fulfilled life increase, a life where they will make a valued contribution to our society.  Last week, I attended the launch of an employment strategy by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, by the T&aacute;naiste, which highlighted that 75% of blind and visually impaired people in this country are unemployed.  That is a shocking statistic.  What is even more shocking is the wasted resources that the country badly needs, yet the opportunities are not there.  That is extending as we move into 2022.  Compared with how things were in 1982, a great many people are now waiting for assessments and treatment.  If they were to get the assessments and treatments, imagine the contribution they would make to our society.  They could be Oireachtas Members or be involved in business or the professions.  We have a moral obligation to equip them to do what they should be able to do.  This is the challenge of our generation.  We need to step up to the plate.  I hope this structure works and creates universal access regardless of where a person lives, be it in a rural or urban area or any part of Dublin, in order that he or she can access the supports, facilities and therapies to give him or her the best chance in life to make a contribution to society.</p></speech>

I agree with others regarding her passion and indeed the frustration as expressed in her opening contribution regarding the present system which is not working to the satisfaction of families.  Families who have special kids are often frustrated.  They are very tired at the best of times.  It is a constant fight in many cases to get the services that they deserve, and require.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health, which received an email from Down Syndrome Ireland outlining how families are reporting a complete breakdown in services, with many receiving no therapies, sometimes for years at a time.  Surveys show that almost half of families with a child with Down's syndrome, just prior to the pandemic were offered no therapy in the previous year.  Those who were offered therapy averaged just five sessions, which is well below that needed for best practice.</p> <p>Regarding the reconfiguration, Down Syndrome Ireland carried out a survey, which found 95% of people are either unsure about how their services will be affected or believe they will receive a poorer service.  They believe there are just not enough therapy posts for the levels of therapy for every child who needs it.  They talked about frustration, inconsistencies, staff turnover, short blocks of therapy, long breaks in between, and therapists being absent on long-term leave or redeployed.  That is the reality.  It is a tale of woe unfortunately, but a reality for Down Syndrome Ireland.  I am sure the Minister of State is in communication with all services providers and advocates.  It is important to put those facts on the table as well.  Her predecessor initiated progress on children's disability services and talked about a person-centred approach, the excessive waiting times for therapy services, and children achieving their full potential, maximising their independence and living rich and fulfilling lives.  These are all words.  If they can be put in practice and if the improvements and changes can be put in place for the service users, the children, to get the service that they require and deserve so that parents can know what to expect and are not always fighting, although all parents will continue to fight for the education and well-being of their children, the parents will know they will get a service that is deserving of them.  I wish the Minister of State well in her role and in the plans she is progressing.</p></speech>

We are glad to have her here for this important debate.  I came across a quote recently and thought it worth sharing: "The human spirit is one of ability, perseverance and courage that no disability can steal away."  I want to talk about spirit in a number of ways.  The first is the Minister of State's own spirit.  She has the spirit of empathy, courage and perseverance.  I know first hand of personal interventions she has made to ensure that somebody can have the pathway they deserve, and in regard to the reforms she is bringing about.</p> <p>The HSE is a very big animal.  There are excellent people working within the HSE but all too often a Minister or Minister of State can be an apologist for what happens within the organisation.  In the first words of her contribution, she said she is not a spokesperson for the HSE, and that she is going to hold it to account and take it to task.  That is hugely important and refreshing.  We need to hear that here today.</p> <p>I am thinking also of the spirit of so many parents throughout the country who are battle weary from the constant fight they have had, either from when their child was born or from when they had a diagnosis.  The two dates can be completely separate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Spending many hours and getting pushback all the time is very difficult and wearying.</p><p>It is very important to try to keep alive the spirit of the parents and the spirit of the child with the disability.  I am privileged to have my brother who has such a shining spirit in our house.  One of my sisters described him as the Buddha in our house.  His ability to do so many things is celebrated by all of us and not his disability.  The Minister of State is tasked with finding that progressive strong spirit within every person she represents and the families and parents she represents.</p><p>We often talk about the culture within disability services and within the HSE, which certainly needs to change.  I know how hard the Minister of State worked last year to get that extra &euro;7.8 million to address the issue of overdue assessments of need.  It is wonderful that happened.  However, unfortunately, that has rolled on to the interventions, meaning families find they have now just moved from one waiting list to another.  They will then move to a further waiting list and so it goes on.  That issue needs to be addressed.</p><p>While the money is important, the most important thing is the outcomes - the difference the investment will make to that individual, to their family and to society in general.  It is related that the rate of poverty and social exclusion for people with disabilities is among the highest in the EU at 38.1%.  Ireland has the lowest employment rate of people with disabilities at 32.3%.  That must change and it is very much tied in with the progressing disability service programme and the assessments of need.</p><p>We also need to talk about social prescribing.  I appreciate that is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for listening to what the Kildare Down's syndrome group had to say about the programmes it runs on horticulture and literacy.  It is so important that once young adults leave school, they do not lose that level of literacy.  They need to keep it to be able to continue with their lives in their own communities.  The horticulture programme is very important.  The programme is linked in with the Tidy Towns.  The young people involved grow vegetables and fruit for local restaurants etc.  It is very important to think in a connected world.</p><p>Disability proofing cannot just stay with the Minister of State and her Department.  It needs to be done in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, and involves positive mental health and so many other areas.  We need disability proofing at budget time across every level.</p><p>As the Minister of State said, bringing in additional administrative staff is very important.  Our therapists need full support and they do not need to spend their time encountering red tape and writing reports.  That move alone will lead to a positive outcome.  The adequate and appropriate funding is very important.  The clear commitment across Government to equality funding is very important.  I wish the Minister of State well.  It is a significant task, but I have no doubt she will make a major difference to it.</p></speech>

I share her vision and desire, and the vision of Government and the HSE, that children's disability services be easily accessible, that they be fair, that the families and health services in schools would work together to support children, that services be based on a child's need rather than their diagnosis, and that children have services available wherever they live.  I knowledge the positive developments implemented by the Government and the previous Government in the disability services sector.</p> <p>I do not want what follows here to be viewed in any way as negative or a criticism of the staff who work tirelessly every day.  It is important to give an accurate reflection of the various matters that have been highlighted to my office.  Obviously, the roll-out of the new standard operating procedure to assess the needs of children more adequately and bring consistency to the assessment of needs process across all CHOs, which was due to be implemented by the HSE in 2020, is experiencing delays, as the Minister of State has acknowledged.</p> <p>Parents of children with additional needs consistently contact me.  They are exceptionally frustrated, tired, worn out and confused about the process and the reorganisation in the area.  There is a lack of consistency within the various networks.  Children who are on old waiting lists for intervention therapies are now being reassessed and put on a waiting list again.  While I acknowledge the issues with recruitment and retention within the sector - I think the Minister of State mentioned 400 vacancies in her opening statement - it is obviously very hard to explain to parents who are often at their wits' end.</p> <p>The vision for children's disability services states that services should be based on a child's need rather than diagnosis.  Unfortunately, from my experience that is not the reality in many cases.  Parents have repeatedly told me they are desperate to access services for their children, who may be non-verbal or require support with toileting, diet or social skills, but have not yet received a diagnosis owing to the waiting times.  Without such a diagnosis they obviously cannot access the various services.  In some cases, they cannot be accepted into autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classrooms at the onset of primary school.</p> <p>I do not want to seem critical because I know the Minister of State is committed to resolving the many issues in the sector.  I believe the reconfiguration is a step in the right direction.  I acknowledge her positive contribution in saying that specific administrative officers will be allocated in the area.  We need to improve the communication with families.  I ask the Minister of State to intervene to ensure children who have been on waiting lists for a considerable period are not just put on another waiting list to access therapeutic services.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with her.  I have frequently spoken to her about autism services.  She is planning to complete a non-statutory report into autism services.  When the Oireachtas committee which we discussed is established in the near future, I look forward to speaking to NGOs and families to feed into that report and finally deliver for those families.</p> <p>I know this relates more to special education.  I am concerned at a media report today that only one in five students from special schools accessed the July provision this year.  This needs to be looked at and we need to ensure it does not happen again.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The progress in disability services policy states that the aim is for children to receive health services they need as close to their home and school as possible.  That is something that I fully believe in, which is the whole-school inclusion model that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is working on and which was trialled in the CHO 7 area and was very successful there.  That is the model we need to invest in further and to progress.</p><p>The policy also states a children's disability network team of health professionals needs to look after the children.  That is where we have a serious problem, which is the actual number of health professionals, something I believe the Minister of State referred at the start, specifically the shortage of them.  The &euro;7.8 million that was put aside for this in the budget had to be fought hard for by the Minister of State.  In the greater scale of things, where we talk about delivering projects throughout the country that cost hundreds of millions of euros, it is disappointing we can only find &euro;7.8 million to deal with the backlog we have.  We owe it to the children to give them every opportunity in life and to support them.</p><p>I spoke about the 1916 Proclamation before.  It is 105 years since the Proclamation was read out and we need seriously to ask the question whether we are cherishing all of the children of the nation equally.  I think we are not.</p><p>More specifically, I want to ask a number of questions on my own area.  I spoke about the lack of people in positions, in particular in the Phoenix Care Centre in Longford, where there is a waiting list of more than 600 children.  My understanding as of this week is we are going to lose three speech and language therapists, one occupational therapist, OT, one physiotherapist and one psychologist and we already have 600 people on a waiting list.  I ask if the Minister of State or her officials could come back to me with a reply as to when these positions are going to be filled and this waiting list will be tackled.</p><p>I also ask in respect of St. Christopher&rsquo;s Special School, which is a school I know the Minister of State knows well and worked hard to provide funding for the staff there.  The fact is we have a state-of-the-art school yet we have no access to speech therapy in that school where we have two classrooms.  I ask that a proper assessment be done for the students in St. Christopher&rsquo;s and that a proper programme be put in place for the special needs assistants, SNAs, who are working there and are prepared to do this work.  I would greatly appreciate it if the Minister of State could come back to me with replies on these issues.</p><p>I re-emphasise what I said at the beginning that I have full faith the Minister of State will deliver for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

A great deal has been said but, personally, in the first instance, I pay tribute to the Minister of State and thank her so much for her own personal interest in the whole area of disabilities.  I know she visited St. Gabriel&rsquo;s School and centre in Limerick recently.  I was present and have been involved with that school for more than 25 years.  I know, from her initial visit up to her most recent visit, of the Minister of State's keen personal interest in this school and how much she brought to that whole visit together with the research she carried out herself.  I also pay tribute to the staff in the CHO 3 area, which is the mid-west.  St. Gabriel&rsquo;s School and centre working alongside it form a private school and centre, and they are supported by a great deal of private fundraising.  The Minister of State also announced two extra days for respite care, which is very necessary for families who are dealing with children with disabilities.  It was very clear the Minister of State met many of the families and I want to put my gratitude to her for that on the record.</p> <p>I know the Minister of State has hit the ground running since she took up her key role in disabilities.  I also welcome the fact the waiting lists have started to come down.  While I know they are creeping up a little bit again, I am sure the Minister of State will find a way of getting them back down.</p> <p>The one thing that greatly concerns me at times is where I was dealing with a family with three children not so long ago, two of whom were autistic children and one of them had very profound difficulties.  One of these children was 17 years of age and had still not been assessed within the whole system.  I was very shocked to find that this young lad had reached 17 years of age without such an assessment.  We made a representation and I understand he is to be called very shortly.  It is frightening to think a person would reach 17 years of age in such circumstances.  There are three children, 17, 15 and 12 years of age, and this concerns the 17- and 12-year-old children.  While the 12-year-old was in the service, the 17-year-old had been missed.  It just shows this can happen sometimes.  The fact is the family had taken those children for a private assessment but yet the private assessment was not recognised within the public system.  There needs to be some sort of a reckoning around that and perhaps it is an area that the Minister of State could look at.</p> <p>Going back to the Minister of State's visit to St. Gabriel&rsquo;s, we said there were a number of children on the waiting list who would very much benefit from the services.  Everything is on site for them as to the services provided in the school.  There are so many children there with such profound difficulties, but if the size of the school could be doubled, I know there would be enough children to fill it.</p> <p>This debate is very timely but I believe the Minister of State has made a very significant impact.  I also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, because I know that, on the whole education side of things, she has been doing a great deal of work on SNAs and the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units.  The two Ministers of State together are a force to be reckoned with.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State in the future in this area and I am sure we will be seeing a reduction in waiting list numbers.  I am looking forward to seeing her further announcements in the near future.</p></speech>

There is obviously a much better time system in Limerick, if I can be allowed to jest.  I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State to the House and to endorse what has been said about her very proactive approach.  I will take the liberty of throwing in a question myself now, which I ask the Minister of State to comment in answers, please, on residential accommodation for adults with disabilities, the amount of it, the lack of it, and where the Minister of State is at with regard to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#NN00500"><p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and everybody who took the time to contribute to this debate.  The contributions were fantastic and spread right across the country.  Every CHO was represented and I was just checking that aspect as we were going along through the debate.</p> <p>It is important to recognise we are all on the one page in that we all want to ensure we assist families, we do not want the fight to continue, and we need to ensure families have fair and equitable access to services.  That is exactly what progressing disability services for children and young people, PDS, was always supposed to be about, which was fair and equitable access to services regardless of geographical location.  Sometimes when you come from the west, you always think people on the east coast have more access to services.</p> <p>This is the whole idea of PDS, in that we will have 91 teams throughout the country.  I know Senator Warfield is gone from the Chamber, but at this time we have reconfigured 80 of those teams.  By the end of this month we will have 91 done.  The last three are being done in Mayo, where we are recruiting the managers there as we speak.  From there, it is hoped, the system will start to settle because what the Senators are receiving in their emails and constituency offices is the state of flux of the transfer that is taking place at the moment.</p> <p>I said at the beginning that much of this is paper and not technology-based, and where there is the configuring of the various lead organisations and team members working together who have never worked together before, this means staff have had to uproot as well make all this happen.  At the centre of all this is the young people and their families and giving them that access to service.  I pay tribute to the staff who have put in an inordinate amount of work.  We heard from Senator Warfield that we had 40 teams in May and now we have 80.  We have come a long way in that space of time, and by 1 December we will have the 91 teams.  Great strides have been made and a great deal of work has been done by all of the staff working right across the country.</p> <p>In my remaining time here I want to share with Senators what I expect from the HSE for the next 12 months, and perhaps when the House calls me back here again in a year&rsquo;s time, I would like to be held to account, and not just me but also the HSE.  We are funding this service so I have to hold it to account.  As Senators Kyne and Carrigy and others have said, parents are tired of battling.  I see my role as the advocate for that child and parent to ensure they have fair and equitable access to the service because that is the vision and the model we are funding.  That is the expectation, so what I want to do is to hold the HSE to account.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will share this with the House.  Some Members might be hearing this for the first time tonight.  From the start, on 1 December, every week I will be meeting with CHOs.  I will meet three CHOs in the first week, three CHOs in the second week, two in the next week and so on.  That is how I am going to do it.  Then, in the final week I will meet with the HSE director of services and all of the leads.  That is how it is going to be done every single month, month after month.  After that I will have met with the likes of Dr. Colm Henry.</p><p>In answer to the Senator's question of what is an acceptable key performance indicator when one has a team, we will look at how many speech and language therapists and how many children should be seen across all of the teams and what this means with regard to input, output and access to services.  We will ask what parents should be expecting and what I should see in the figures.  If 100 children are coming in, should a team be seeing 100 children or is that too much to be expected?  When we consider the team in Cork that went from 800 to 1,800, we must ask if it is a fair workload on a team when there are so many?  Is it a case of just putting people onto a team and they are never going to access services?  I genuinely cannot put people onto a team and send out letters saying that they will see somebody in five years' time.  That is not acceptable to me, nor can I stand over it.  I would not expect any of the lead agencies to stand over it, nor the HSE.</p><p>At this stage, I believe the HSE needs to be run like a business in relation to progressing disability services for children and young people, PDS, which is the reform piece within it.  Every time they have an assessment, parents should be able to expect that the assessment should be an intervention.  We need to move away from the practice of "we are all on an assessment".  Everything should be an intervention.  When a child or young person first goes in front of a therapist, that first meeting should be an assessment, as opposed to what the child is diagnosed with.  If there is a need for speech and language therapy or a need for occupational therapy, we must get on with that while the team is still working out what the diagnosis piece is.  Senator Ardagh spoke about this.  The family just want the intervention, be it speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy or behavioural management.  While we are working on the complex piece to put a name on the diagnosis at the very end, let us be getting on with the intervention.</p><p>I refer back to my opening contribution.  I will be honest with the House that I was very disappointed when I saw what was laid before me in the last week.  I was very disappointed.  Members will see that in what I have circulated.  I cannot accept that for three months in some CHOs in the State not only were no assessments done, but there were also no interventions.  That is not acceptable.  I will not stand over that.  I do not expect anybody working in the HSE to think it is acceptable.  I am not apologetic in relation to it.  I absolutely believe the culture has to change.  The culture needs to move from the assessment to that intervention piece.</p><p>Senator Cummins spoke about communication.  Communication is absolutely appalling within the HSE.  How we communicate en bloc, in a cut-and-paste manner, to parents is not acceptable.  We need to tell parents the truth, but there is a way in which one tells them the truth.  There is a way in which we bring people with us.  It is not acceptable to tell a parent who is wondering whether his or her child's speech and language therapy is going to be delivered that he or she is not going to hear from the HSE for four years.  If that is what the waiting list is when I get the final figures in the next couple of weeks, I will have to look at alternative methods of delivering service and intervention.  In the budget this year, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Deputy Michael McGrath, gave me &euro;10 million to spend on waiting list initiatives.  I must first get all of my figures to see how we are going to do that.  I am open to every suggestion around delivery.  When we did this with the assessment piece, and with &euro;7.8 million, we were able to clear a backlog of 6,000, and 92% was cleared in 12 months.  I believe we can do something similar with speech and language therapy, operational therapy and physiotherapy services.  It is a bigger challenge.  If we have to rise to it, then it has to be done.  Senator Carrigy has said that we have done massive development projects in this State but we still need to invest in our young people.  We need to give them the intervention required to give them the best chance in life and the opportunities to be the best they can possibly be.</p><p>We also need to work closer with education.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has a very good pilot project around the school inclusion model.  We need to see how that model can work with my PDS to ensure that children have access to therapies, whether they are closest to home, closest to the school or in the school.  Whatever works needs to be worked on.  This is a fresh model that needs to be given every single chance to be rolled out.  This is why we have 91 of them, so they are very close to all of our primary care centres.</p><p>As I said earlier, 12 months ago people were telling me that the standard operating procedures would mean I would never have another waiting list again, and I would be getting straight into my interventions.  Needless to say, having seen where we are in the past couple of days with the figures, I am open to all suggestions.  I am prepared to break it and fix it and break it and fix it until we get it right, as opposed to saying we will wait for it to work out.  That is not how we can work with children's lives.  That is not how we can work when a child needs speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or physiotherapy.  Parents are tired of fighting.  They are tired of the repeated fight to get access to a diagnosis, to get access to an intervention and to get the supports they need within schools.  It goes on and on.</p><p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach asked me a particular question on residential adult spaces.  There is always a shortage of residential adult spaces.  At this moment in time, there is emergency and critical emergency.  Between emergency and critical emergency, there could be 800 people waiting at this minute for access to residential places in the State.  I believe that the way the model has been to date needs to be reviewed.  Sometimes the key performance indicators for accessing the service seem to require the death of a parent or a sibling, which is the wrong model to be working on.  We need to do early intervention a lot sooner so we can support people to have supported independent living and accommodation.  We must move away from this idea of being reactionary so we can plan for building capacity into it.  The good news in the budget this year is that I have also created respite places for eight houses for children and eight for adults to start building up back that capacity.</p></speech>

As Senators will be aware, this is an important and urgent Bill.  Under Part 8 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, significant changes to the law on prescriptive easements and <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>are due to take effect immediately after 30 November 2021, in just three weeks' time.  Up to now, the 2009 Act has applied transitional provisions, allowing court proceedings, or applications to the Property Registration Authority, seeking to validate or register a prescriptive right to be decided under the old legal rules that applied before the 2009 Act.  That transitional phase will end, however, on 30 November next and new rules will take effect for all new claims from 1 December.</p><p>The 2009 Act was a major item of reforming legislation that repealed a large number of outdated laws and concepts and modernised much of our land and conveyancing law.  Serious concerns have, however, been raised by stakeholders, including the Law Society and the Bar Council, about the impending changes to the law on preceptive easements and profits under the 2009 Act.  In particular, the new legal rules on acquiring prescriptive easements or profits are causing legal uncertainty.  Second, the generally accepted view is that after 30 November 2021, only user periods starting on or after 1 December 2021 can be counted in claiming prescriptive rights that are not registered, even if they have been enjoyed for many years before that.  Third, the requirement for mandatory registration of prescriptive easements or <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>is not operating satisfactorily in practice.  It has not yet been possible to register many important prescriptive rights that appear to have been enjoyed for many years without dispute.</p><p>Stakeholders indicate these changes risk causing unnecessary court cases to protect rights that have been enjoyed for generations without dispute, resulting in stress and legal costs between neighbours.  The new registration requirement is causing widespread blockages and delays to conveyancing and problems for mortgage or farm loan approvals where a house or lands depend on an unregistered prescriptive right.  The Minister has listened carefully to these concerns and is satisfied that in these complex legal areas, the provisions of the 2009 Act are not working as intended, and that prompt action is required to avert the changes due to take effect on 30 November.</p><p>The Bill will address the most pressing need by repealing the major changes due to take effect on 30 November, thus removing that deadline.  It is essential that it can, with the support of both Houses, progress to enactment by 30 November at the latest.  The Minister has secured Government agreement to establish a time-bound review, in agreement with the Attorney General, that will identify any further changes that are desirable to the law on prescriptive easements and profits to ensure this area of law will be put on a sustainable, long-term basis.</p><p>The main changes to be made by the Bill are as follows.  Section 6 will repeal sections 33 to 39, inclusive, of the 2009 Act.  Consistent with the strong preference of stakeholders, this will repeal the major changes that were due to take effect after 30 November, thereby removing the imminent deadline.  The Bill sets out a number of new rules for the law on acquiring and validating prescriptive easements and <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>.  This follows extensive engagement with stakeholders, including the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Property Registration Authority and the Law Reform Commission.</p><p>In general, claims made after the Bill comes into operation will be decided under the judge-made law, known as the doctrine of lost modern grant, that applied before the 2009 Act.  This reflects the strong preference of stakeholders, which see this as the most satisfactory and familiar set of rules available, pending the more comprehensive review intended by the Minister.  Under the Bill, periods of long use that were acquired before or during the years 2009 to 2021, inclusive, will not be lost on 30 November where the prescriptive right is unregistered, as under the 2009 Act, but can still be counted in a claim made after that date.  Applications based on periods of use completed before 1 December 2009, the date on which the 2009 Act came into operation, will continue to be decided in accordance with the law that applied before that date.  The same is true of applications to court or to the Property Registration Authority to validate or register a prescriptive right that are pending when the Bill comes into operation.</p><p>Special arrangements are proposed in respect of State-owned land, including foreshore.  Under section 3, as under the 2009 Act, acquiring a prescriptive right against State-owned land after 30 November 2021 will require longer periods of use than are required in a claim against land owned by a private person.  Otherwise, the general rules I outlined will apply and, under the Bill, long use before 30 November 2021 will still be counted, unlike under the 2009 Act.  It will still be possible to validate a prescriptive right, either by applying to court or by registering it directly with the Property Registration Authority, but this will be optional, as it was before the 2009 Act, rather than becoming a requirement to avoid losing any rights acquired through long use.</p><p>I will now address the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 sets out the main rules that are to apply to a claim to have acquired a prescriptive easement or <i>profit &agrave; prendre</i>following the coming into operation of the Bill.  In cases where the prescription period was completed before 1 December 2009, the legal rules are those that applied before that date, as at section 2(a).  In cases where the prescription period was completed after 1 December 2009, the legal rules are the pre-2009 Act judge-made rules known as the doctrine of lost modern grant, as at section 2(b).  There is an exception to these main rules for applications to court or the Property Registration Authority that are pending when the Bill comes into operation, and these are dealt with under section 6(2).</p><p>Section 3 deals with claims to have acquired a prescriptive easement or <i>profit &agrave; prendre</i>over State-owned land or foreshore, other than pending applications or claims where the prescription period was completed before 1 December 2009.  The longer prescription periods, of 30 years for State-owned land that is not foreshore and 60 years for foreshore, were recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 2002.  They reflect the fact it is more onerous for the State than for a private owner to be aware of any easements or profits being exercised against its land, particularly regarding foreshore, which is submerged for much of the time.</p><p>Section 4 refers to the law on extinguishment of easements or <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill repeals the new rules due to come into effect under the 2009 Act and this section just clarifies that the pre-2009 common law rules on extinguishment will continue to apply.<br/><br/>Section 5 amends section 49A of the Registration of Title Act 1964 in respect of registration of a prescriptive easement or profit.  The amendments remove the condition that the authority must be satisfied that the claim meets the requirements set out in sections 33 to 38, inclusive, of the 2009 Act, and also clarify the conditions for registering a claim in respect of a <i>profit &agrave; prendre</i>in gross.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, section 6(1) repeals sections 33 to 39, inclusive, of the 2009 Act.  Section 6(2) refers to applications to court or to the Property Registration Authority that are pending when the Bill comes into operation.  It provides that they are not affected by the Bill.  Essentially, such applications will, therefore, continue to be decided by the law as it stood previous to the 2009 Act.<br/><br/>I wish to acknowledge the engagement shown by Senator Higgins in introducing a Private Members' Bill on this issue, together with Senators Ruane, Flynn and Black.  Their Bill essentially makes a single amendment to the 2009 Act, extending the 30 November deadline for a further period of five years.  We also considered this approach when developing the Government Bill.  However, after legal advice from the Attorney General and stakeholder engagement, the Government decided to go further and to address other aspects as well.  The Minister believes the Bill before the House offers the best way of ensuring that all the necessary changes are made in this particularly complex legal area.<br/><br/>I believe the care and consultation that has gone into the Bill is evident.  The importance and urgency of progressing the Bill for enactment before the legal cliff edge of 30 November is clear.  The Minister very much hopes that, with the co-operation of all sides, we can facilitate its swift passage through this House.  Time is short.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I thank him and his officials, as well as the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in her absence, for the swiftness with which the Bill has been brought to the Houses.  As a person who lobbied on this issue for some time and was notified well in advance of the potential cliff edge many people were facing on 30 November, I warmly welcome the move being made here this evening.  Although it is just a short amending Bill, I take on board and welcome the fact that there is a commitment to a comprehensive review of this situation.</p> <p>To be honest, this law is far too complex for a person such as me.  When one researches the issue and reads into the intricacies of what is involved overall, one realises it becomes very complex.  That goes back to our history, in that many of the smaller farms in rural Ireland initially came from the division of estates and larger holdings by the Land Commission.  It is not always possible in such situations for all involved to have road frontage or road access.  Agreements were made in respect of easements known as rights of way to allow people to access land.  Back in the day, in my father's time and that of his father before him, these were often gentlemen's agreements.  There is no formal documentation or registration of the rights of way and, as ownerships change and new generations come along, it is not always as easy to implement these gentlemen's agreements that have been in place for years as it was for the previous generations who were around when the arrangements were made.</p> <p>A major issue that was beginning to raise its head in recent months with the 30 November deadline pending was a slowdown in conveyancing, as the Minister of State noted.  Whether it was drawing down a loan, purchasing or selling land or working through probate or situations of intestacy, people realised that come 30 November rights of way would need to be registered and that was slowing down those processes.  As such, it became vitally important that something was done before 30 November.  The issue is addressed in this amending Bill, which I welcome.</p> <p>I hope it will be taken into consideration in the comprehensive review that has been promised post the enactment of the Bill that, since 2017, 70% of applications to the PRA have been rejected.  That is a fact that comes up when one researches this issue.  I do not expect the Minister of State to have an answer this evening in terms of the reasons for those rejections but I hope that this issue will be considered in any review relating to further legislation and that the pitfalls that seem to have arisen there will be addressed in whatever manner possible.</p> <p>I will not go on much longer.  It is noteworthy that the Law Society, the Bar Council and the farm representative bodies all welcomed the Bill and that it had the blessing of the Attorney General, the Cabinet and the Government before it was even introduced.  It is usually the case that legislation is introduced and at some stage during its passage through the Houses Members start getting phone calls or correspondence from stakeholders with an opinion on the matter.  In this case, they all came forward to set out their opinions before the Bill was even introduced.  For that reason, I do not see why I or any other Member present, certainly on the Government side, would have any issue with the Bill.  As I stated, it has received the blessing in advance of the stakeholders whom it mostly affects.</p> <p>I plead with the Minister of State to ensure that, whatever comes out of the review following the enactment of the Bill, an awareness campaign is put in place.  The reason we got so close to the deadline with so little action was a lack of awareness.  For many people who were aware that it was coming down the line, there is and was a big element of fear, particularly among the older generations who lived with the gentlemen's agreements.  They did not want that to change and believed that the fact it was being legalised might diminish or dilute their ownership.  They did not want to prevent their neighbour or whoever having a right of way, but were concerned their ownership could be diluted.  Nothing could be further from the truth, but it is difficult to explain that to a person who has lived with the previous arrangement all his or her life.  When we get to the final solution and this issue is moved forward, a serious awareness campaign will be needed.  We need people to know the ins and outs of it and what might be coming down the line.  I know of a person who was given a site on the family avenue and just assumed he or she could use the avenue for access, but when the next generation took over the farmhouse there was an issue in respect of whether the person was really allowed to use the avenue to access his or her house.  Sometimes situations arise that were ill prepared for, or of which people were not aware.  While this was a solution to such situations, in many cases it created more alarm bells than it offered the relief of a solution to a problem.  It is vital that when we move forward with whatever extension is agreed, and whatever comes out of the review in terms of future legislation, there is a good awareness campaign through the farm organisations, Revenue or whatever body has access to all those affected.</p> <p>I know other speakers will touch on the issue in the context of urban areas.  This is not just a rural issue but, from my perspective, it is a major issue in rural Ireland.  I have not mentioned access to bogs.  It can be a nightmare when there are several bog banks on one land bank and there is only one access route and one person owns it.  It is not just one neighbour allowing another across their land to gain access to other land or water for their animals or whatever; it can be 40 people using a lane owned by an individual.  This is about how that can be teased out and how to get to the bottom of sorting it out, legalising it and moving forward to a system that is more structured than the gentlemen's agreements that were in place previously.</p></speech>

I thank his Department and the officials in the civil justice legislation division of the Department for the very comprehensive briefing note provided.  It is very helpful.  As previous speakers have stated, it is a complex issue on which we need to tread softly and carefully.  The Minister of State mentioned the issue of the legal cliff edge on 30 November, of which all present are aware.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to legal uncertainty.  All Members, and certainly the many of us who have served on local authorities, whether they be city or county councils, are aware of the county development plan process.  We know that in some county development plans, including that with which I was familiar, that is, the plan for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, issues relating to public rights of way are marked out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some of them were originally old mass paths that ran up to Glencullen and near Enniskerry or that part of the county.  We had established rights of way or what people thought were public rights of way but then there were legal challenges.  History moves on.  In terms of the continuity of knowledge, the people who have the knowledge move away so people do not necessarily have the facts.  So much of this is assumed but when one digs down one discovers there is no real paperwork, which presents a problem.</p><p>The County and City Management Association is concerned about this matter.  However, when the association was asked by the elected councillors about this matter it was not well equipped to explain the issues and different bits of advice were given.  City and local councillors would be aware of county development plans so, clearly, they would be best placed due to being on the ground and would hear the concerns of residents.  I am thinking about the foreshore, in particular.  I have experienced a major issue with a right of way that took years to clear up.  Extinguishing a right of way is quite difficult, particularly now that everything has slowed down with Covid and trying to get the appropriate people to consider the matter.  It takes a long time to extinguish a right of way and sometimes people seek to exercise that to frustrate the development of a site or for various reasons.</p><p>I am conscious that this legislation is a stop-gap to get us over this current issue.  By saying that I am not being disrespectful just stating reality.  I will support the fast-tracking of this legislation.  It is important that the Department engages with the Minister who has special responsibility for heritage.  We have a huge problem with accessing heritage sites and dolmens.  For many years people have been able to access three dolmens located in my local authority area but now they have been told they cannot access them.  These are sites of heritage and importance so we need greater clarity about access.</p><p>We have the issue of the foreshore and its complexities, particularly where a harbour authority is transferred to a local authority thus leading to issues concerning the potential for development and the realisation of development opportunities along a shoreline.  In particular, I am thinking about renewable energy and the Maritime Area Planning Bill.  We need to be aware that there is a lot of duplication and overlapping so we need to be vigilant.  Rather than close down opportunities we need to open them up and realise what we can do in this area.</p><p>Clearly the Law Society and the Bar Council are in favour of this initiative, which is my view having perused their submissions on their websites.  I was very impressed by their reasoning and arguments that they set out.  I was also impressed with their level of engagement, and particularly with the Bar Council that has expressed a willingness to proactively engage with officials and legislators on this proposal.  So I am concerned about the foreshore and I have an issue with public rights of way, which we have discussed.</p><p>I understand having read both the briefing produced by the civil justice division of the Department and the briefing that we have received that the Bill will address the most pressing need by repealing major changes that were due on 30 November, as the Minister of State has said already.  I understand that the Minister and the Minister of State are committed to a more comprehensive reform of the area.  I think that is critical and I would like to think that during our debate on this Bill we would be told a definite or indicative timeline.  We are getting over this issue but we cannot move on.  I am not criticising anyone when I say that this matter should not have reached this point.  This is November and we are talking about the end of November.  I would like to hear assurances at some stage though not today.  What is the timeline for addressing all of the other issues that will follow as a result of our contributions?  It is abundantly clear that wholesale reform is needed, which has been accepted by the Minister of State.  I understand the Government has obtained approval to establish a timebound review, which the Minister of State has said, in the agreement and of course with the Attorney General.  It is important that we develop best practice.  What is the long-term view, in particular for the foreshore issue?</p><p>Earlier Senator Paul Daly mentioned the importance of bogs and established rights of way.  Therefore, rights of way are critical and contentious.  Irish people have a fundamental love of the land.  I mean we are territorial about land and will fight to the end to defend it so having greater certainty is important.</p><p>Today, the Minister of State confirmed that one can still register a property with the courts or the Property Registration Authority but this will be optional, as it was in 2009.  It is important that message is conveyed and publicised because some people still feel that they want to register.  This legislation does not prevent people from registering as was the case pre 2009.  People still have the option to register.  We need clarity and I would like if the Department undertook to share the briefing that we have received here today, or some version of same, with the city and county managers.  They are keenly aware of this issue yet seem to operate on a different basis.  The legislation is important but we must use every opportunity to dumb it all down and make it very simple.  I recognise the importance of the timeline.  The Minister of State has my full support, and that of the Independent Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in the passage of this important legislation.</p></speech>

C&eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; d&eacute;anach, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach agus n&iacute; fheicim aon f&aacute; ar cheart d&uacute;inn v&oacute;ta a chaitheamh i gcoinne an Bhille seo.  Caithimid taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&oacute;.</p><p>Senator Paul Daly, when he spoke earlier, was very self-effacing when he said that this is a difficult matter to understand.  I have practised at the Bar for 15 years yet I must sit down and read this legislation in some detail to have any idea what it is about.  I am grateful for the Department's briefing notes in that regard.  In fact, that is probably true for most members of the Bar, notwithstanding that experts from the Bar gave a submission through the Bar Council.  As a general rule, solicitors are more familiar with land law.  In fact, there is a standing expression that when it comes to land law most of us are at sea and that is the reality.  Land law is incredibly archaic and convoluted.  Even the terms used such as easements and <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>are archaic.</p><p>The Bill is technical but I recognise that it does something that is important even if it is late in the day.  I remember when the 2009 Act came through and back in the early 2000s steps were taken to reform the land and conveyancing laws.  These laws are archaic.  Many of the terms and bases on which the legislation is currently based, date back to the Middle Ages so it is appropriate that we reform the law even at this late stage.  I welcome the fact that we are bringing some clarity to this but, as has been said by other speakers, there should be even greater clarity.  What would be very welcome would be a streamlining of the law.  Senator Boyhan mentioned the need for simplification but I think even that would be an incredibly difficult project and a worthwhile one.</p><p>It is appropriate that ordinary people and ordinary barristers would be able to easily interpret the law to understand what it means, what effect it has and how it affects them or their neighbours.  Reference has been made to how this matter has a very significant impact on rural areas but, as has been said, it affects urban areas.  Senator Boyhan referred to the county development plan of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which I was part of in the past.  There are rights of way in that area and in many ways the communities are perhaps unaware of the extinguishing of some of those rights of way.  I am aware of a right of way at the end of Pottery Road, which is literally 100 m away from where I grew up, where a petrol station has de facto extinguished the right of way in order to make the plot of land more valuable and open to development.  The local community is unaware that this has happened.  Very often, in such cases, the local authority is not interested in getting down and dirty to establish these rights that benefit the local community.  I can understand why they are not because there is exposure and costs for local authorities.  In addition, they do not really get the support from central government that they need to be more proactive in preserving rights of way.</p><p>A right of way at my <i>alma mater</i>of St. Laurence College, Loughlinstown, runs right next to the school and almost across a playing pitch.  That makes it incredibly difficult for the school to establish a playing pitch.  It wanted to move the right of way.  We all hoped that there would be progress in that regard in the development plan.  As the right of way goes right past the school all day when classes are going on one could have people from outside the school, from the local community or from outside the local area walk right past the windows of classrooms and, possibly, disrupt classes or cause other mischief.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The sensible thing would be not to extinguish the right of way because it is an important route for people from the residential area to get to the N11, bus stops and so on, but to move it so that it takes a slightly different route, still preserving the right of people to cross that territory while facilitating the need of the school to have access to its lands.  It is a technical Bill.  It does something that must be done at the end of the day.  However, it is important to recognise that it also takes place in an information vacuum.  I say that in no way wishing to be critical of any organisation or individual.  Reference has been made to two tremendously important issues, namely a proper review of this area of the law to establish that we can change it in a way that makes it more accessible to everyone, but equally, a public information campaign.  People should properly understand the rights that are in play here and the fact that they sometimes need to take steps to protect their rights in a local community to facilitate them but in the first instance to let them know.  A public information campaign can only be properly successful when the law itself is accessible.  If the law is as dense as the current conveyancing law and land law generally is in this country, it is almost impossible to have an effective public information campaign that explains to people what is involved.  There is no realistic opportunity to talk to people about medieval land law and expect them to be either interested or engaged in it.  The two issues go hand in glove, one being the reform of the area of law but the other being that information campaign to let people know what is happening.  This Bill is a stepping stone, a stopgap and a necessary plug in the dam as it were, and on that basis the Fine Gael group and I have no difficulty in supporting it.  I hope it is the first step in a process that brings us closer to a more comprehensive and accessible land law system.</p></speech>

T&oacute;gadh an talamh uainn agus bh&iacute; orainn troid chun &eacute; a fh&aacute;il ar ais agus &eacute; a roinnt idir na clanna ar fad.  We had big challenges to get our land back and then it was divided.  Land is a hot potato as we all know very well and it is very important that we make this intervention.  It is a good intervention by Government.  It is an example of politicians listening to people, organisations and farmers and doing a good job.  I know from my own farm at home that my grandfather granted and received rights of way, which all happened in a lovely way long ago, but sometimes when it comes to dividing land and inheritance, it is a messy business.  When I read this first before the intervention was proposed, I was frightened as many people I know, including old people and farmers, have rights of way on land that they have not registered.  They have not gone down this legal route.  To refer to what the Law Society said, no application could be made to validate such rights for another 18 years if we had not intervened, even where someone had been exercising those rights for 50 years or more. It is very important, therefore, that we are doing this today.  Land is a big issue.  It is not going to go away just because of this one change that we are making today.</p> <p>Work is currently being done on a land use reform Bill by several Departments as they examine land use in Ireland, not just because of climate change but everything is changing.  Our land use will change as well, and access to land.  Land was compulsorily purchased in County Kerry for a greenway.  Nobody wants to go down that route.  We must look at how we are dealing with land.  Senator Hackett and myself several years ago wrote a farmers first policy on accessing land for the Green Party.  It is one where the farmer has to be engaged at the beginning because even to this day there are always major challenges any time we want to do a walking or cycling route.  Some farmers themselves want to do walking routes.  The Government has no set steps to be taken and no valuation.  How should the land be valued and how much should the farmer be paid?  If we have had that figured out, we would not be waiting ten years for a greenway in west Clare.  There are many issues relating to land use that this Bill brings up for me.  Land is precious.  Many families over the years have had wars over land use.  They have been blocking it, lying across it and gates were thrown over the ditch.  If we had not intervened today I do not know what would happen.  As previous speakers said, we must educate people.  When I read this legislation, I did not have a clue and thought the Government wanted to take away rights of way unless people went to the lawyers.  We have much work to do but we have Macra na Feirme, with ten thousand young farmers, and I do not know why we are not engaging more with them.  They are the future of farming.  They are the ones who comprehend these issues probably better than some of us and they can help us inform landowners about this.  We need to be clever in how we move forward when we come to reform.  </p> <p>The other issue then is insurance.  There is a fear among farmers about giving people access.  This country is so full of amazing wells and dolmens.  We have 200 castles in County Clare alone but there is great fear about giving access to land because of the claims culture and insurance companies ripping people off.  The courts sometimes support that as well.  That is a huge issue.  Until we resolve that I do not know how we will resolve our land use and land access.  I wanted to raise that as an issue while we are talking about this, but I welcome the work on this Bill.  It is important that it has happened before the end of November.  In future we must do much more to inform people so that the fear of God is not put into them about land rights and rights of way.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an seal agam c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; le linn na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta seo anocht.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 provided for fundamental reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law in this State.  At the time, the measures were broadly welcomed.  The 2009 Act was a combination of years of work by the LRC and the Department of Justice, Equality and Reform.  It repealed many old statutes, some of them as has been said from the Middle Ages.  An area the Act sought to reform was the law relating to easements and rights of way.  Unfortunately, the Act did not achieve that objective.  This amending legislation means that easements such as a right of way and rights to maintain water and sewage pipes on neighbouring land will no longer have to be registered with the PRA by 30 November this year.</p> <p>Rights of way are crucial for people to access, especially, although not exclusively, as has been said, in a country setting.  They can often allow access for homeowners to a home by foot or car while for farmers, they can affect access, drainage and many other issues related to farming.  Following the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Act 2019, as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 ,approval by neighbouring landowners is required.  In some cases, complex legal procedures must be undertaken to establish proper rights of way.  The new legislation has also given rise to issues with mortgages where banks ask for proof of access rights that are often onerous for property owners to obtain.  This legislation mandated that these easements need to be registered in the PRA or else by Circuit Court application.  This is time-consuming.  Sinn F&eacute;in called for the deadline to be extended due to the legal and practical complexities involved in registering rights and indeed the Covid-19 pandemic, which all have given rise to great difficulties for many people.  Otherwise many homeowners would have risked not having the proper access to their homes, which has the potential to flood the courts with cases.  The Minister eventually responded by extending the deadline through the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2021 and promising a review and new legislation for the area.  </p> <p>The Law Society was critical of the change required by the 2009 Act, although it largely supports the legislation.  This was because previously a statutory declaration by the user of the right of way was permissible, which essentially states that the issue is many paths and laneways are in fact, as has been said, on private land and frequently owned by a third party.  This particularly impacted on farmers looking to sell farms where access routes were in fact on third-party land.  Court proceedings and agreement to grant rights of way often pit neighbour against neighbour and, indeed, can be hard to establish due to infirmity or estrangement.  Sinn F&eacute;in wishes to see a tailor-made system that is non-adversarial and respects rights of access.  Any new enabling legislation will be welcome but Sinn F&eacute;in is keen for more comprehensive reform, which has been promised, to be brought forward.  I flag that at this early stage and look forward to working with the Minister of State, departmental officials and colleagues across the House because as Members have acknowledged thus far, and I am sure will after me, while appreciating this is a very complex situation and has been given a very complex response, it is one we need to resolve for the benefit of people out there, if you will pardon the pun, on the ground.</p></speech>

The Labour Party supports this Bill and its provisions, and the Government commitment in some of the communications about this to examine the wider area of rights of way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Before I discuss the matter, I want to speak on behalf of my senatorial colleague, Senator Higgins, who is attending COP26 in Glasgow.  She has been very active in pushing for this Bill to be introduced.  She was one of the first who realised the rights-of-way abolition would kick in on 30 November.  She raised the issues tackled by this Bill this time last year.  She identified significant problems arising from it and spoke to three separate Ministers over the past 12 months, namely, the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, the Minister of State with responsibility for planning and development and the Minister for Justice.  She and her Civil Engagement Group colleagues introduced a Bill to extend the provisions by five years.  That is a reminder of how Governments sometimes need to listen to points made by the Opposition in order that action can be taken in a timely manner.</p><p>This issue has been signalled to the Government repeatedly by stakeholders across society, including the Law Society and the Irish Farmers Association.  What we have had, however, was a Government that refused to acknowledge the important issues for people across the country until its hand was forced and a deadline was almost reached.  This Bill is being left until the last minute.  We could have avoided the need to rush through this legislation to prevent massive legal confusion after 30 November over registering private prescriptive rights of way and protecting rights of way, many of which have been used for generations.  This issue affects individuals, families and communities, and it should have been addressed long before now.  There are but two weeks until the deadline and there is last-minute, rushed legislation.</p><p>If we are to examine the wider issue, we need to consider how private prescriptive rights of way were earned through use over long periods and how they intersect with public rights of way, with a view to creating new rural and urban networks of connectivity.  As Senator Garvey said, our rights of way and rights to roam are very different from those in the United Kingdom.  It is important that we consider this matter again.</p><p>Rights of way present a great opportunity to create green networks.  We should bear this in mind in this legislation and local development plans, and we should ensure that we map all existing and new private and public rights of way with a view to creating new networks of connectivity, not only in rural areas but also in urban ones.  In an area such as mine, for example, connecting up laneways behind houses and bringing them back to life could be considered.  We could create safe walking and cycling routes in our urban environments.  In Spain and Portugal, for example, the network of laneways is used for walking and cycling, and initiatives such as the Camino de Santiago have been created as a consequence.</p><p>This is also about ensuring permeability in our cities in order that people can be provided with alternative routes where they intersect with public rights of way and create networks of connectivity.  I hope the Government commits to considering this as a wider issue.  I hope it considers it not just from conveyancing, rural and landowner-rights perspectives but also from connectivity, permeability, transport and environmental perspectives.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh chinneadh an Rialtais chun br&uacute; ar aghaidh leis an mBille seo agus &eacute; a chur tr&iacute;d an d&aacute; Theach roimh dheireadh mh&iacute; na Samhna.  The Minister of State is welcome.  I thank him for, and acknowledge, his work.  I acknowledge the work of the current and former Ministers for Justice &ndash; Deputies McEntee and Humphreys &ndash; on getting Government agreement to progress this Bill through both Houses by the end of the month.  The impending deadline has caused some concern within the law profession.  I have been contacted by several solicitors who have expressed concern regarding their workload and the impact of existing arrangements on conveyancing and the sale of properties.  It is important that we pass this Bill to provide the clarity required and initiate greater reform in this area.  We are aware of the trickiness of old rights of way, which can cause legal disputes.  Ireland has had many cases of people in rural areas claiming or having rights of way that others do not recognise.  There can be all sorts of developments as a consequence, including the putting up and taking down of gates.  Such actions can lead to neighbours falling out.  Somebody buying a new property may not be aware that others have rights in respect of it.  This has caused issues in the past.  It has certainly caused stress and imposed costs on people.  Disputes have ended up in court.  When buying land, it is important to know who has a right to gain access to it or cross it.  The Bill will deal with that issue.</p> <p>I am aware that the Minister of State has had considerable engagement with the Law Society, Bar Council, Property Registration Authority and Law Reform Commission on this subject.  It is complex.  It can relate to several issues, including rights of way across farmland or on a laneway running over a neighbour's land, the right to use water or sewerage facilities on a neighbour's land, and the right of support between adjacent buildings that are in different ownership.  If one is buying or selling, a considerable amount of money can be involved so it is important to get it right and to have no confusion over who has access, rights of way and easements.  It is important that we pass the Bill by the end of the month.  I acknowledge the work that has been done in the Department, and I wish the Bill steady progress.</p></speech>

I have been a Member for several years and I regularly see legislation introduced because we are approaching a deadline.  That is not a good way to engage with legislation.  Essentially, one's back is to the wall.  We have seen this every year with the Special Criminal Court legislation.  From time to time, we have technical legislation but this Bill is a little more than that.  It is extremely important because the amount of trouble and hassle caused by uncertainty over rights of way within communities, among neighbours, among people living along the same road and even within families is incredible.</p> <p>For years I was involved as a county councillor in making representations on behalf of people applying for planning permission.  It was often the case that a son, daughter and another son all wanted to apply for planning permission to build on the one road.  It is all great when everyone gets on but if there is a falling out in the family, it can be pretty scary.  That is why this type of legislation is important.  While we have to do what we have to do to sort this out by the end of the month, really and truly there has to be fundamental reform in this whole area.  Rights of way should be registered.  Local authorities should not be washing their hands of the matter.  I agree with Senator Ward that a local authority needs to engage on this and invest resources.  Local authorities need to establish offices internally to deal with this.  So much that needs to be done should and can be done.  The task is intricate, detailed and complicated but what is complicated can be simplified if there is the willingness to do so.</p> <p>I have one more issue to raise while I am on the subject of rights of way, land and so on.  I cannot understand why we have not embraced e-conveyancing.  When somebody buys a property or house, it can take weeks, and in some cases months, for the transaction to go through, simply because of the conveyancing required, the exchange of documents and so on.  We really need to embrace e-conveyancing.  If we have learned anything during the pandemic, it is the benefit of embracing technology in the health service, especially in administration.  There are general practitioners who would not have dreamed of emailing a simple thing like a prescription to a pharmacy until it was required of them because of the pandemic.  We really need to up our game.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When I was the justice spokesperson for Fine Gael, I had discussions with Senator Ward.  We visited the Law Society, which has made great submissions on e-conveyancing.  The Government never bought into it, but it is something that needs to be done.  I would welcome further engagement with the Law Society.  Perhaps Senator Ward and the other justice spokespersons in the Chamber might organise an evening in the new year when we can share ideas and learn from each other.  With that, I thank the Minister of State again.  I cannot see any reason this legislation will not go through the Houses, but I believe that a body of work needs to be done.  Given the fact that we have more than three years left in Government, this is the time to do it.  We were always wondering how long the previous Government would last.  This Government should last long enough to sort out the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#XX00200"><p>I read the name of this Bill and chills went through my veins, remembering my land law lectures with the late, great Deborah Wheeler, a barrister colleague, in the King's Inns.  Certainly, this legislation is timely and good and there is no reason we should not all support it.  I am sure the fears that went through rural Ireland, in particular, regarding it are something else.</p> <p>There are two matters I want to raise.  If there is to be a review and an examination of rights of way and private property rights, two urban issues need to be brought up.  One of them relates to communal waste pipes where there is an unfortunate homeowner in whose front or back garden the manhole is located and neighbours are misusing the pipes and putting wet wipes and other sorts of things into it.  If there is flooding, it happens in the homeowner's garden and they have to pay for the treatment of that.  If the homeowner contacts Irish Water, the staff wash their hands of it and say it has nothing to do with them.  I know of people who are on low incomes or who are elderly, and who are finding themselves responsible.  The answer that Irish Water gives them is that they need to go out and knock on the doors of everybody else on their street and get a contribution towards the cost of clearing that out.  That is not okay.  It is the opposite of getting a right of way onto other people's lands to access your own utilities.  It is where you become liable.  When I and my office have talked to Irish Water staff about such issues, we have asked them whether the person has the right to close the manhole and stop this flooding in their garden.  They do not have that right, but they have the sole responsibility for the fixing of issues caused by other people, over which they have no control.  That puts neighbours at loggerheads with each other.  It an issue that we must come up with some sort of legislative solution to or in respect of which somebody needs to take responsibility.  It is not reasonable that individual homeowners have to do that.</p> <p>The other issue I wish to raise concerns order 96 of the District Court rules, which provides a facility whereby people can go to court if their neighbours are causing noise pollution.  However, if a neighbour has a series of security lights that are making their front room unusable, there is no solution to that other than to take a case under tort law.  We need to amend order 96.  It is reasonable that people should have the peaceable enjoyment of their homes.  Again, we end up with neighbour disputes, where a neighbour goes in, puts up big security lights and others then end up having to put blackout blinds and all sorts in place just to enjoy their own home, if that neighbour is somebody who is unapproachable and will not co-operate.  We need to amend order 96 and move beyond noise pollution to include light pollution under that order.   The environmental health service and the council will not deal with it.  There is no solution there currently, other than taking a case under tort law.  </p> <p>I echo Senator Conway's point on e-conveyancing.  It is time we expedited it and got it done and dusted.  It is long overdue.  Other than that, I support the legislation and acknowledge the need for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#XX00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I acknowledge his opening statement, which was most informative.  This is an issue that has been debated in the Chamber over the past few months.  There was great fear of the deadline that is approaching at the end of the month.  In my area of rural west Cork, the volume of interactions I have had with the public, including landowners, farmers and solicitors, on this issue has been amazing.  One solicitor from Clonakilty told me a few weeks ago that it would take every solicitor and engineer in Ireland to go through every right of way in west Cork.  The task is insurmountable.  Considering the number of rights of way that needed to be brought in line with the 2009 Act, there was no way we had the personnel, the money or the practical ability to get it done.  This amendment is, therefore, really important.  It is far from an amendment; it is quite a significant Bill in its own right.</p> <p>The timelines are very important.  We must ensure this is in place by the end of the month.  That is important for the general community.  There has been great anxiety, particularly among the agricultural community, about this Bill and how it is going to impact it.  I was in contact with our spokesperson, Senator Ward, on a continuous basis about when this Bill was coming before the House, because it is a real issue for the agricultural community.  I have not experienced such a reaction towards any Bill from the agricultural community in the past few years.  The issue of rights of way and the number of rights of way that are under dispute, not registered or unclear is amazing.  It is a significant body of work.  It became obvious that the timelines in the 2009 Act were not going to be met.</p> <p>I support this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify the timelines in respect of when he is proposing that the Bill will be passed through the House.  Has he been talking to the Whips and the Chair to make sure that we meet the deadline?  There is significant anxiety around the issue, to say the very least.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-09a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021110900002#XX00500"><p>I thank Senators Daly, Boyhan, Ward, Garvey, &Oacute; Donnghaile, Moynihan, Kyne, Conway, Seery Kearney and Lombard for their contributions, which were welcome.  It is reflective of the fact that, despite it being an exceptionally complex area of law, the situation arising out of its need very much resonates on the ground.  I think of one particular situation in my constituency where an elderly farmer lived at the end of a laneway.  There were three houses on his laneway.  One of them was owned by an elderly lady who had dementia and was in a nursing home.  The next house was owned by the county council, and the house at the top of the lane was owned by someone who, let us say, was less than co-operative.  The farmer had become distressed about the situation and wanted to resolve it on behalf of his son before he passed away.  That case is reflective of what everybody has been experiencing throughout the country.  The Law Society and the Bar Council came forward to put very much a legal context to the issues.  Senator Lombard mentioned that every solicitor and engineer would be needed to resolve the situation just in west Cork alone.  A similar statement was put to me in that it would take 100 years to resolve it.</p> <p>In theory, the idea behind the Bill would be great if someone discovered new land somewhere and was starting from scratch.  Considering the nature of land in Ireland, it was going to be impossible to apply.  Senator Daly brought up the important point that a number of applications are being rejected.  In the initial stages, it was because all it took was for one person to object to the registration and the next thing people were heading off to court.  Any changes that are needed will require an awareness campaign to promote them.  As the generations move on, differences in opinions emerge and memories lapse, and more and more problems arise.   Many concerns relating to water services were raised, in particular, which we are not going to be able to deal with in this legislation.  I will certainly bring the issues to the attention of the relevant Departments.  I will speak to the Minister of Justice regarding access to important heritage sites and the loss of rights of way.  I can sympathise with Senator Ward.  I encountered a similar situation in Wexford in respect of access to an ancient site where the Normans built a church.  The right of way was being taken away and the landowner tried to engage the county council.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=09"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The local authority there eventually did engage.  I understand its fear was with regard to litigation.  If a city council does not engage in protecting a public right of way, there is almost nobody else that can do it.  It certainly is something that needs to be looked at.</p><p>Senator Ward brought up the importance of plain language when dealing with issues such as this.  It is hugely important.  It ties in with the points made by Senators Conway and Seery Kearney on e-conveyancing.  We can get land law and conveyancing law somewhat understandable and readable for ordinary people.  It is quite a complex area.</p><p>I acknowledged in my contribution Senator Higgins, who tabled legislation on this and did an awful lot of work on it.  She has engaged with my officials on this matter.  I know she would have liked to have been here.  She was quite positive on it.</p><p>A number of Senators raised concerns about agricultural communities and the legal profession.  All of the contributions were hugely important.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy McEntee, regrets not being here today.  She will be here for Committee Stage on Thursday.  The intention is to move this on as quickly as possible to put away the concerns of many people in the country.</p><p>A number of Senators raised the issue of public rights of way.  Obviously this is not dealt with in the legislation.  Senator Ward raised this matter.  It is something that gives rise to a lot of concern and something to which we need to bring further attention as time goes on.  Sometimes a more brazen attitude is taken by people with regard to removing these public rights in the expectation that nobody will challenge them on it or take them to court over it.  Many of these public rights of way are very ancient and lead to important historical parts of our country.  We need to find a way to ensure they are protected.</p><p>It is important legislation.  There has been much engagement on it.  It is a well-crafted Bill.  I look forward to it moving through both Houses as quickly as possible to quell the concern among so many people, in particular older people.  We look forward to the Bill progressing as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
