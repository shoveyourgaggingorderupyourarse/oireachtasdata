    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#A00200"><p>I have received apologies from Deputy Alan Farrell and Senators McGahon and Dooley.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss accelerating offshore wind, including fixed and floating offshore wind generation.  We will discuss the east coast and we are also very interested in the larger opportunity off the south and west coasts.  We will discuss supply chain and logistical challenges.  There is also the issue of green hydrogen and development of a green hydrogen economy.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Peter Coyle, chairman of the Marine Renewables Industry Association, MRIA.  I thank him for coming before the committee to discuss this very important topic.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read out the note on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction I give.  For witnesses attending from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present on the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind Members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In that regard, I ask all Members joining us online to confirm, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  I can see a number of members joining us online from their offices.</p> <p>  This part of our meeting will conclude at 11 a.m.  I invite Mr. Coyle to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#A00300"><p>I am delighted to be here this morning.  Presumably the clerk circulated a statement from me.  I am not going to read it out to the members; they would die of boredom at my droning voice.  I will just pick out the highlights.  The Marine Renewables Industry Association represents people across the island engaged in offshore renewable energy, including ten wind developers.  We have lawyers, researchers, manufacturers and so on as well.</p> <p>  To provide some context, there are two historic moments.  The first is 22 July 1929, the day the Ardnacrusha scheme opened in County Clare.  It was an extraordinary step forward for the new State and underpinned the economic development of the State in many respects for the following 50 years or so.  It was built with a capacity of 86 MW, which would be enough to light up Dundalk and Drogheda on a nice day in today's terms, but which exceeded national demand for electricity at the time.  In the early 1930s, we saw the start of the industrialisation policy, which took place during the Great Depression behind tariff barriers, quotas and so forth.  Ardnacrusha underpinned that policy and our economic life, such as it was, throughout the 1940s and 1950s.  It helped to create a body of managerial expertise and industrial skills that enabled us to go on to the next stage of development in the early 1970s when we joined the EU.</p> <p>  The second historic moment was 23 December last with the passage into law of the Maritime Area Planning Bill.  It is a monumental body of work and a great tribute to the legislators, policymakers, lawyers and those in industry who contributed to its creation.  Just two years ago, we really had nothing on the Statute Book or in policy in respect of any form of development at sea.  We were dealing with the Foreshore Act of 1933.  In practice, if one looks back at the Oireachtas debates of the time, it was all about dealing with fishing rights around large estates.  In the past two years, Ireland has put together a tapestry of legislation and policy which enables us to develop our offshore renewables, among other things.</p> <p>  Why should we develop our offshore renewable energy?  It is an extraordinary resource; we have Europe's most bountiful and available winds and the most bountiful waves in the world also.  Wave technology will come on stream in the 2030s.  The first reason to develop it is our enormous energy insecurity.  We are rated by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, as the fourth most insecure country in Europe.</p><p>We have had a very calm couple of years, which has meant the lights have been kept on most of the time.  More than half the load has been borne by the coal plant in Moneypoint in County Clare and by gas.  That coal comes from Russia and, to be blunt about it, there are not that many alternative sources of coal any more.  Currently, the contract is with Russia and Moneypoint continues to be absolutely critical to keeping the lights on.  The other big contributor has been gas, with half of our gas being imported, some of it from Russia.  By 2030, according to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, 90% of our gas will be imported.  We will be in an abject position by then unless we deal with our renewable resource.  That is before we even get to issues like EU targets and all the rest of it.</p><p> The immediate and most obvious challenge for our industry is to put in place the minimum of 5 GW of offshore energy that is called for by Government policy.  To put that in perspective, we have less than 5 GW of wind and everything else, including bits and pieces of solar energy and so on, on land at this time.  It is an enormous task and eight years is like two and a half weeks in energy terms.  These projects take a long time to plan, get permission, be built and all the rest of it.  The big challenge for us and for everyone else is to get that up and running.  For the Government, it is a question of getting the new machine in order, including the legislation, all of the policies and the new maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, which is due to open in Wexford in the first quarter of 2023 and will, we hope, be a great new addition to public life.  The next call in this area for the Houses of the Oireachtas will be marine protected areas.  That legislation is somewhere in the works and will be critically important to finding a way of having a harmonious and constructive relationship between the exploitation of our offshore resources and the preservation of our offshore environment.</p><p> As I am conscious of running out of time, I will briefly mention four strategic issues.  First, it is vital that our coastal communities are engaged in all of this.  There is provision to safeguard their interests under the new Maritime Area Planning Act.  There are community benefits that will, for many years, bestow millions of euro per annum on relatively small communities for community projects.  Nonetheless, we need to do more to ensure they are involved in, understand and are engaged with planning the offshore future of their communities.  There is a model of coastal partnerships in the UK that is working well.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has talked about setting up experimental partnerships here, possibly in Wexford and Donegal.  I certainly urge the Oireachtas to support the Department in this and prompt it to do so as quickly as possible.</p><p> Second, we now have a vibrant offshore renewable energy policy, which is first-class and on which a lot of work continues to be done in refining and developing it.  It is not yet matched, however, on the part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which needs to develop a very high level of determination to build a global supply chain in this area.  This will not happen between now and 2030 in the case of the stuff that is primarily going into the water, namely, bottom-fixed wind, principally on the Irish Sea, because that is ubiquitous technology and the home of most of the enormous jobs and income that were created as a consequence of that technology is Denmark, which has some 23,000 people employed in this area.  That is done and dusted in many respects.  We will, of course, have installation jobs and operations and maintenance jobs but most of our resource in the Celtic Sea and off the west coast will have to be exploited by floating wind and by wave.  There are no established players, nationally or internationally, in that field at the present time.  As a consequence, there is an enormous opportunity there.  The Department needs to get involved and engaged and must drive its renowned agencies, namely, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in which I had the privilege of serving for many years, to develop a policy to exploit that opportunity.</p><p> Third, we need to find a way in, in all our forthcoming provisions for offshore renewable energy, for floating offshore wind.  One of the reasons this is necessary is the industrial opportunity it presents in terms of the jobs and incomes that could be created for communities to which it traditionally has been difficult to attract investment, such as Arklow, Wicklow, Wexford and Bantry.  I spent much of my life trying to attract investment to those towns and, for reasons that somewhat escaped me, it never really happened.  It really could happen now if we get our act together.  It must be done not only for industrial purposes but also for the purpose of ensuring our offshore resource is properly exploited.  We need to find a way into our various support schemes for floating offshore wind.</p><p> Fourth, we need our legislative leaders to be at the forefront in this effort, alongside industry and officials, who are playing a blinder in this whole area and really are doing an extraordinary job in the difficult circumstances the Covid crisis has imposed on us.  We need members of this committee involved in explaining and communicating the changes that are going to come offshore for our coastal communities.  These changes will include, for example, the issue of port capacity.  We do not have the port capacity nor does anywhere else nearby really have that capacity because they have ambitions of their own, including in Wales, the south west of England, the west of France and the north of Spain.  We do not have the port capacity to work at scale in this area.  We will get by with what we have, plus some investments that are in the pipeline, particularly in Cork, to get to the 5 GW target, but the 30 GW target, which is the Government's aspiration for the 2030s, and the great dreams we have of developing offshore green hydrogen plants and so on can only be realised if we invest in ports.</p><p> Finally, I want to give the committee an example of the vision that is now surrounding this industry and which we need to continue on from the work that is being done on the Maritime Area Planning Act and other policy instruments.  The Danish coalition Government decided in June last year or the previous year to invest half of the &euro;35 billion required to build a new island 80 miles west of Jutland in the North Sea.  It is a true island that will have a harbour, people living there and a huge substation that will help to ensure an efficient distribution of electricity from the wind farms in the middle of the North Sea to surrounding countries.  We need that kind of vision and imagination for Ireland for the 2030s.  We could not only be self-sufficient in energy from our own offshore resources but we also could export electricity through interconnectors and have many beneficial developments such as islands out in the Atlantic and off the Celtic Sea.  The consequences in terms of income and job creation in this very labour-intensive industry are extraordinary.  I commend offshore renewable energy to the committee and apologise for talking for so long.</p></speech>

I am very happy that he framed it around Ardnacrusha and the really brave gamble the State took 100 years ago, a gamble that ultimately paid off.  It was a serious vision and a huge step for the State to take.  We are at a similar point now, when we can take steps as big as that.  I know Ardnacrusha very well as it is only up the river from my home city of Limerick.  I used to row up the tail race right up to Ardnacrusha.  I know it intimately and my grand-uncle worked on its construction.  Mr. Coyle is right to frame the challenge we now have around the success and achievement we had 100 years ago.</p><p>Speaking to that bigger challenge we now face, I am very mindful of the conflict happening on the other side of Europe.  When we set out these sessions, we were very much thinking of the climate crisis but now, of course, we have a security emergency and energy crisis as well.  It is timely if not coincidental that we are having these sessions now.  They are very relevant to the discussion that is happening across Europe at the moment.  There was a very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning by Dr. Hannah Daly, Dr. Paul Deane, Dr. Diarmuid Torney and others in which they talk about Ireland not only providing its own energy needs from its offshore resource but also contributing significantly to Europe's needs.  That is the vision we must have and it is one we can achieve.  Depending on who one talks to, there is a possibility of harnessing something like 50 GW to 70 GW, maybe more if we take into account the wave resource.  I am interested in Mr. Coyle's thoughts on wave energy.  I ask that he elaborate on the bigger vision and the industry's view on how that can be accelerated and expedited, accepting that the 5 GW target is a huge challenge as it is.</p><p> Officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are going to appear before us in the next hour.  This is an opportunity for Mr. Coyle to tell us what we should relay to them if we are to pursue and achieve that bigger vision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#C00200"><p>Far be it from me to criticise the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as I effectively worked for it for 35 years, but I will take the last issue first.  To some extent, we are a victim of the siloed aspect of Irish government, in that Departments are tribes in their own right.  To put it crudely, they are interested in their own territories and are not very interested in other people's territories.  This reflects the fact, which is an issue for another day, that there has been no fundamental examination of the public service since 1969 with the Devlin report.  It must be the only institution in the world that has not been examined in more than 50 years.</p> <p>  Some of the mechanisms that are being put in place behind the scenes, which to non-bureaucrats appear to be unwieldy and bureaucratic, are designed to get over that silo effect and improve communications.  There is no ill will between these people.  It is just that this matter does not feature as much on that Department's radar as it does on that of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I do not mean this to appear critical, but the latter has sucked in a great deal of the talent in the public service in recent times because of this very important issue, which is extraordinarily complex to address.</p> <p>  We have the two most renowned agencies in the development agency world in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  I have worked for both of them, so I am biased, but they are world renowned and the best in the business.  If they are given a political direction and a Civil Service direction to go big and have ambitions in this area, they can achieve great things.  They will not be able to do anything in the short term about bottom-fixed offshore wind energy, though, because it is an established industry.  It did not exist 22 years ago.  The first offshore wind farm was built in Denmark in 2000.  The second in the world was Arklow with its little 25 MW, which opened in 2004.  We did not take up that opportunity, though.  I am one of those who was responsible for not taking it up because, unusually and uncharacteristically, we in the IDA scoffed at offshore wind energy in the 1980s and, in particular, 1990s.</p> <p>  There are some excellent pioneers in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland working on this area, but I do not believe that the organisations have been given a vision or a demanding goal of making Ireland a global player in the provision of parts, services and so forth &ndash; it does not have to be full-scale rigs &ndash; in floating wind energy and wave energy going forward.</p> <p>  I will speak to a point that the Chairman did not mention, although he used the word in a different context, that being, security.  As an industry, we made strong representations to the Commission on the Defence Forces.  They are published on our website as well as the commission's.  Our offshore world has changed and we are going to become dependent on it for our domestic security and exports.  We need proper security provision.  The commission recommended the drawing up of a maritime security plan.  We back that and want to be involved in it.  There is ample scope for bad actors, not so much to damage particular turbines, given that we can remove and replace them, but to damage the big wire that goes ashore and the substation that pulls all of the wires together and steps up or steps down &ndash; I can never remember which it is &ndash; the voltage.  A substation is as complex as an oil rig.  It takes years to build and is not bought out of a box.  In many instances, a substation costs hundreds of millions of euro.  The cable that runs from the substation to the shore is extraordinarily expensive.  There are back orders of approximately two years, it is complex to lay, etc.  The Naval Service would not necessarily need to be significantly involved, but it needs to be given a clear mandate to make it responsible for pulling together the maritime security plan whenever that is drawn up, which I hope it will be urgently, and dealing with any contingency that might arise as regards the substations and the cables going ashore.  This needs to be done urgently because we will have 5 GW in the sea in eight years' time.</p></speech>

Let us speak about Ireland's energy security opportunity to go big and go faster.  Is there an industry perspective?</p></speech>

We have major facilities that were bought with money that was scraped up from all over the place and built in 2015 during the height of the recession for &euro;15 million or &euro;20 million in Cork.  They provide us with world-class test facilities for devices and help ports to test out their new facilities and arrangements.  They are probably the leading facilities in Europe.  We have expertise in underwater unmanned vehicles in Limerick.  There is expertise in Galway and Maynooth and considerable expertise in Belfast.  I happen to be fortunate enough to chair the Bryden Centre in Queen's University Belfast.  The centre is a leading light, particularly on the wave energy side.  There are facilities at Strangford Lough.  We have a major intellectual advantage.  We have many people who are good in this area, we have many facilities, we have resources and we have an opportunity.  There is a great deal happening, but we need to pull it all together and match it with a large industrial development opportunity.  There are indications that, if we can get beyond the installation, operations and maintenance and into the manufacturing and services area, there are significant job creation opportunities, particularly in terms of floating wind and wave energy.  We have a large wave energy opportunity as well.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  The wind energy industry frequently raises with me its concerns about grid connectivity and grid capacity.  Does Mr. Coyle have concerns about our ambition, planning and progress in terms of developing our grid?  Does he believe that we will have the grid infrastructure we require when we need it in order to fulfil our renewable energy potential?</p> <p>  Mr. Coyle mentioned marine protected areas and how it is important to get the balance right between preserving and enhancing our environment while promoting harmony with other stakeholders.  Given that the planning legislation is progressing much more quickly than the legislation on marine protected areas, are there challenges in getting the balance right if marine protected area legislation is not in place?  How will the industry ensure that the goal of protecting and enhancing the environment is undertaken at the appropriate time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#C00700"><p>I will take the latter question first.  As I understand the matter, there is marine protected area, MPA, legislation in the works.  I do not know what it contains, but bear in mind that there is an extraordinary ambition as regards marine protected areas.  At the moment, 2.5%, or a little less, of our huge maritime area is designated as an MPA in one fashion or another.  The ambition is to increase that to 10% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.  This is a huge issue.</p> <p>  There is a great deal of expertise and experience in this area.  Generally speaking, the relationships between this industry and the various experts in the field, such as the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, BirdWatch Ireland and others, are good and open.  They are experts and bearers of a great deal of scientific knowledge in this field.  As long as we talk to one another and there are reasonable structures, legislation and so on in place on both sides of the picture, we will find ways and means of getting along.  There will be individuals who object, of course.</p><p>There will be concerns in various areas but generally speaking, the MPA bodies, the NGOs and experts in this field, are positive and constructive and are trying to find solutions as we are.  There is good experience.  Let me give one instance.  At our annual forum, which is a big get-together, held a couple of weeks ago we looked at scientific research in Scotland, which was looking at what happens to seals.  The research was monitoring seals in an area in the Pentland Firth in the north of Scotland with underwater blades rotating under a tidal machine.  We do not have a tidal resource in the Republic; there is one in Northern Ireland.  There were no instances of collision between a seal and this underwater blade.  Similar experiences are being shown in regard to birds for example with offshore wind farms.  We are optimistic that wildlife has some sort of learning capability to stay away although there is still a road to be covered.</p><p> On the issue of grid, everything in this area is happening at warp speed by the standards of an extremely capital intensive and technically complex industry.  I am not an engineer but it is truly complex stuff.  Putting new grid in place takes time.  We believe there is more grid available than the 5 GW available to the offshore industry identified by EirGrid.  In various submissions we and other organisations advocate a fresh look at that situation.  In the longer term, grid is one of the most challenging areas for us to exploit our resource.  There are many ways forward in the 2030s, called non-grid off-takes, where you do not need grid.  You do not necessarily need grid to make hydrogen to, for example, make ammonia.  You could actually have a hydrogen plant offshore alongside a wind farm and just pump the hydrogen ashore.  Overall we need much more grid.  We are fortunate in having an excellent and responsive body in EirGrid.  While we of course have our rows and arguments with EirGrid, it is a terrific body by and large.  We are optimistic that we can find solutions but it is a challenge.  </p></speech>

People are perhaps slow learners, catching up with him in his vision for this sector.  Given his experience in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to what extent is this concept on their agenda?  He talks of a political direction but from my relatively long experience in that Department, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are regarded as the most professional and well-informed in identifying sectors where Ireland can become very competitive in the long term.  Political decisions did not lead to electronics, biopharma or some of these major sectors.  To what extent have the IDA and Enterprise Ireland developed their internal familiarity and thinking about the sector in order that they could sustain the case that this is not only a key opportunity in energy terms but also in industrial policy terms?</p> <p>  In regard to the national development plan, NDP, as recently revised, which represents &euro;140 billion investment over six or seven years, in Mr. Coyle's view, how would that need to change?  There is intense competition for resources between the climate challenge, retrofit and all the other issues, as well as the existing ambitions on the wind and offshore front, compared with education and hospitals.  On this issue of making room in the investment programme, in his view how much more room needs to be found to do the sort of things he has identified?  The Danes have done these things by state-led investment.  At what point does he see a floating wind segment in an auction?  The State is right to proceed by way of auction in order that every technology gets a chance to compete.  However it recognises that some sectors need a lead time.  While segmented pieces for floating wind is an acceptable proposal, how soon does he think that ought to be considered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#D00300"><p>To answer the last question first, there will be an auction of support because bottom-fixed wind even cannot compete with traditional forms of energy generation.  It is normal to provide support, which ultimately is paid for by the consumer through the public service obligation.  There will be one auction of support next year which will deal with the initial batch of projects which will be bottom fixed in the Irish Sea.  Floating offshore wind will not feature in that.  There will be a second auction, probably around 2025, and that conceivably is the last auction that will be held that can actually bring projects on board before 2030 which is vital.  Our view is that floating has to be incorporated in that second option.  Floating is vital to achieving the 5 GW target.  Much of the available grid for example is off the Dublin and Wicklow coasts.  It will be challenging to concentrate so much development there.  Another driver in this is the EU state aids approval, which only extends until the end of 2025.  Floating has to be involved in the second offshore renewable energy support scheme auction, ORESS 2, or it will not feature until well into the 2030s and we will not achieve our 5 GW by the 2030 target.</p> <p>  In regard to the question on the NDP, I am not particularly an expert on the NDP.  I would suggest that we have gone off the boil in regard to providing support for early stage developers in wave and tidal, in the new technologies generally.  There currently is not an appropriate grant scheme to help them along.  It is worth bearing in mind that of the 250 or so small companies in wave and tidal in the world, more than half are in Europe.  More than half the patents are held in Europe.  The European Commission has now set a target of 100 MW to be wave and tidal by 2025 and 1 GW, which is huge in terms of a new technology, by 2030.  We need to put money into supporting small Irish companies.  There are some excellent small Irish companies in existence.  A modest modification in respect of the NDP in that regard is called for, as is anything that can be done to gear up grid for domestic purposes.  We have to bear in mind the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications forecast for an increase in local electricity demand of 50% by 2030.  We have a huge growth envisaged in our domestic market but there are also opportunities for export and such things as hydrogen creation.  </p> <p>  In regard to how the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are gearing up, I am more familiar in recent years with Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has some excellent people now working on this, who have been working away for years.  It has a new department that will involve this area but I do not think it is where it ought to be.  I suspect the IDA is not either.  What is missing is a conviction being communicated to those agencies by their political leaders - I am not particularly talking about the T&aacute;naiste, I am not tying this into personalities - and by their Civil Service masters, particularly in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, communicating a vision or demand that we grow in this space.  The agencies have the ability and the people.  They can attract the resources but they need now to be given a remit to grow a big global supply chain particularly in floating wind, wave and tidal, and then they will get on with it.  They are not getting that, I suspect, at present.  Therefore their response is not at the optimal level.  </p></speech>

It is good to see the scale of ambition being talked about again.  Reminding ourselves of Ardnacrusha is a good way to start.  Some of my questions build on Deputy Bruton's.</p><p>In Denmark, these new energy islands are a state-led project.  They are approximately 51% state-owned.  We know, for example, that facilities like Ardnacrusha were huge State-led initiatives.  It seems we have a tendency in Ireland to wait or try to create market conditions in the hope the leap forward will emerge when, sometimes, the State perhaps needs to leave the leap forward and then industry will follow around that, which seems to be when we are making the level of change that is needed.  That is certainly what happened with Ardnacrusha.  It seems that countries like Denmark are now taking that same leap.  I would be interested in Mr. Coyle's thoughts around that level of State leadership and ambition so that the State is not simply, for example, facilitating the auctions or market but is, in fact, leading.</p><p> With regard to 2025, one of the issues we discussed at our previous session was the idea of a reserved 1 GW for floating wind.  Is there potential in that regard?  Again, it is an option of support - it does not have to be deliverable - to bring that forward from 2025.  We might look at that in the next round to consider a reservation and any way floating wind might be part of that earlier than 2025.</p><p> I would appreciate it if Mr. Coyle could also expand on the macroeconomic circumstances in that we may have more flexibility within the EU rules before 2025 than after 2025.  I am also very conscious that more fiscal rules are being suspended at the moment within the wider area of investment, which may not be indefinite.</p><p> I want to ask about the circular economy part of the supply chain, which we have also looked at as a committee.  I am aware of some innovation in UCC, which has been looking at perhaps 11,000 tonnes of waste from the earlier generation of wind turbines.  In a past committee, we also heard from people who were looking at recycled plastic being part of wind blades.  Can we get a sense of how we can engage with the supply chain around wind turbines and that industry?  I have one final point.</p></speech>

We have other fish to fry, if members will pardon the expression, between now and then and many things to get done.  It is just an indication of what could happen and what we should be thinking about going forward into the 2030s.<br/><br/>I am happy the officials, who, obviously under general political direction, oversee the running of this area, are taking quite a visionary approach to all this.  In my experience in recent years, they are people of considerable ability.  The challenge is they are trying to create in detail a system of governance from nothing in a very short period over a territory that is nine or ten times the size of the terrestrial territory of the State.  It is as if we took the land mass, which is only one tenth of the size of the total territory of the State, and created from scratch laws to do with everything from waste disposal, traffic management, building regulations, health and safety and so on.  That is what they are doing at present.  At the same time, they are trying to ensure we can get stuff in the water and working quickly.  Much vision and drive is taking place at an official level.  We need to start thinking about the 2030s and the 30 GW.  We do not need to do it next week but we need to start thinking about it in the future.<br/><br/>On the supply chain and circular economy side of things, it was interesting to watch the dismantling of the Kinsale offshore gas platform recently.  First of all, it was built and served its purpose.  It is now being dismantled.I would guess it cost approximately &euro;100 million to dismantle it.  It is mostly steelwork and it has gone straight back into furnaces to become new steelwork.  The good thing from the State's perspective is that the industry that built it paid the &euro;100 million for its dismantling.  As far as I am aware, the State did not incur any cost.<br/><br/>The same approach will apply to offshore wind turbines and wave and tidal turbines.  The State will have to post a bond from the outset, which will ensure it pays for the recycling of a particular device when it runs out of life.  Industry is moving in a recycling direction.  At present, and this comes back to one of my earlier themes, we do not have the local industry that can contribute greatly to the various components etc. that go into an offshore turbine or wave device.  One exception might be &Eacute;ireComposites in County Galway, which makes blades.  It is a very advanced plastics company.<br/><br/>To give the Senator an impression of the scale that is achievable given recycling, Siemens is at present building a factory in Le Havre in north-west France just to serve the south North Sea.  It is a half mile long and will employ 700 people.  It has done more or less the same and rebuilt the port of Hull for the northern part of the North Sea.  General Electric, GE, is building a huge plant, again with many jobs, in Teesside and another big one is going into Scotland.  Recycling obviously has to play a part in all this but the economic opportunities are huge.<br/><br/>On the issue of marine protected areas, this legislation will be as complex as the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  We have wonderful wildlife and an underwater environment and we have many people who are aware of what is out there.  We need to preserve it and ensure it lives well and in harmony with economic development.  I genuinely do not know a great deal beyond that.  A very good piece of work was published by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage last year on every aspect of marine protected areas.  There was a big consultation about it.  Our response is up on our website, <i>mria.ie</i>.  That will service as the basis for the marine protected area legislation.<br/><br/>On the 1 GW, I do not think it is possible to bring the second auction forward from approximately 2024 or 2025.  A huge rigmarole has to be gone through to get there, necessarily and rightly so, under the new legislation.  It is truly complex stuff.  The system is going as far as it can but the requirement is that there is specific provision in that auction for floating wind and, indeed, a small amount of support for wave in particular in order that we can get pilot devices up and working away.</p></speech>

I have a couple of quick questions.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled an Opposition Private Members' Bill that talked about the opportunity of offshore wind and the need for an industrial development authority for the sea.  In Mr. Coyle's experience, is it more a case that the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Enterprise Ireland have the capacity but it is about refocusing , repurposing or redirecting them?  Do we need a new agency?  Do we already have the agencies to deliver this?  Is it about directing them?</p> <p>  My second question is on the focus and co-ordination and the issue of capacity.  In Mr. Coyle's experience of the agencies he has dealt with but also in terms of the Civil Service and Departments, is the capacity there at this stage?  Is there a shortfall in that regard?  Co-ordination came up at our previous hearing on Thursday in response to a question from the Chairman.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il reference a cross-government task force on offshore wind.  Is Mr. Coyle aware of that?  How would he like to see it take shape?</p><p>Should it just be for offshore wind or should it be expanded, and who should be involved?</p></speech>

One has to go through extensive turf wars that go on forever and a good outcome cannot be guaranteed.  The agencies we have, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are superb.  It is just a matter of handing them the vision and the demand to do big things and be imaginative in this area.  By the way, a very important agency that is about to be created in the first quarter of 2023, preferably in January 2023, is the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, in Wexford.  Its smooth and effective functioning is going to be very important.</p> <p>  In terms of capacity, historically there were one and a half men and women, a dog and a blunt pencil assigned to this area.  That has changed radically in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in recent times.  It does not have enough people - we never have enough people in these areas - but I am satisfied that in that Department and in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which also plays a key role in this area, there are probably adequate numbers of people involved.</p> <p>  There is a concern across the industry that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is going to be the planning authority for a significant portion of the European Union's waters, and the planning is going to be very complex, has the number of people and the expertise available to it into the future.  There is real concern there.  We want to ensure that MARA gets up and running with extensive resources from the outset.  There was a good sign recently when I heard that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage apparently has rented a new block which is being built as part of a larger development on the waterfront in Wexford.  That is a good sign the Department is taking this seriously and putting resources into it.  MARA must be resourced.  Those are the two key issues - make sure MARA gets up and running quickly and that it is well resourced and make sure An Bord Plean&aacute;la is well resourced.  Of course, there are people in the background we have to think about as well, such as the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which plays a key role in this area.</p> <p>  On the Government task force, there was an effort in this area to get Departments to pull and work together in the past.  It did not really work.  However, the involvement of the Department of the Taoiseach in ensuring the legislation was put together quickly seems to have carried on.  I have heard about the cross-government task force and I am fully in favour of it.  It is important that people in the silos are pulled together and talk together.  We should give it a chance and see what happens.</p></speech>

The east coast is the priority area for offshore wind.  Given the events in Ukraine and the need for our energy independence, how does Mr. Coyle foresee the development application and subsequent permission for wind farms on the east coast?  I apologise if Mr. Coyle has gone over this ground already, but I am interested to hear his thoughts on it.  Our need for our own wind energy and how to utilise that have come into sharp focus now.</p></speech>

It is shallow and therefore lends itself to the technology that is available today, kind of from Amazon if the committee will excuse the expression, which is bottom-fixed wind.  There is grid available off Dublin and Wicklow and there is a big market in the Dublin-Wicklow area.  It is very important that we get the first offshore renewable energy support scheme auction away.  It will focus on projects that are quite well-advanced in terms of their planning off the east coast.  If that gets held up or hindered in any way, we will have problems achieving targets in the 2030s and we will lose credibility in the huge investment world that now surrounds offshore renewable energy.  Bear in mind that while 5 GW is enormous for us, it is fairly Mickey Mouse for other people.  Scotland has just approved 24 GW of offshore wind, of which 60% is floating.  Wales has a 4 GW target of floating alone.  This is business for big companies and big developers with big pockets and big credibility in the investment world.</p> <p>  The east coast is vital.  I live in the Deputy's constituency.  I can see a bit of the sea from my attic window.  I am conscious of the types of issues and objections that may arise about visual impact.  The developers who are candidates to build these farms off the east coast, particularly off Dublin and Wicklow, are putting a great deal of effort into community support.  There are all sorts of protections under the Maritime Area Planning Act to ensure people have a real say.  They might not think they have a real say, but they do.  There are considerable benefits that will arise for the community.  To take D&uacute;n Laoghaire alone, for argument's sake to illustrate the point, the community benefit provisions that are being made by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are such that just one wind farm off D&uacute;n Laoghaire would probably pour &euro;4 million per year for approximately 25 years into that community for community projects.  That is over and above normal Government expenditure, and there will be all sorts of safeguards to ensure that it is not a substitute.  There are those aspects.</p> <p>  I throw the issue back to the Deputy.  The challenge for him and other coastal Deputies, Senators and leaders around Dublin and Wicklow, because those are communities that will be particularly affected, although not exclusively, is that they must show leadership in this area.  They have to try to get communities to understand that we need to do this or the lights will go off.  We cannot continue depending on Russian gas and coal to keep our lights on.  It is absurd.  As a country which has the oil of the offshore wind and wave world - we are like Saudi Arabia or, as the late Brendan Halligan used to say, we are Europe's battery - we cannot mess it up.  However, it will require not just people like me and others in industry but also political leaders to get out in front of this and deal with the objections and issues that will arise.  That is not always going to be easy to do.  I am the first to admit that.</p></speech>

I welcome what Mr. Coyle said about An Bord Plean&aacute;la being properly resourced.  He made reference to Scotland and seals and propellers.  Is there similar evidence for cetaceans?

There is a lot of expertise in some of our NGOs, such as BirdWatch Ireland and the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, which are two I have dealt with.</p><p>They should be properly resourced and able to contribute to the debate in a meaningful way.</p><p> On the issue raised by Deputy Devlin, the waters of the Irish Sea are shallow.  There is also the small fact that the line of the exclusive economic zone is quite close to the coast and there will be MPAs in the Irish Sea, so our capacity to get 5 GW out of the Irish Sea is relatively low.  As such, we are going to need floating offshore wind energy generation immediately.  We will need it in the Celtic Sea and in the Atlantic.  We need to include it in this.  Our big ask of the system at the moment is to have that in ORESS 2 because if it is not, our targets and everything else will be shot out of the water.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Christal and Mr. Curran of Enterprise Ireland, while Dr. Alan Power is joining the meeting online.  Dr. Power is also part of the secretariat to the expert group on future skills needs.</p> <p>  Wind energy will be critical in enabling our transition to a low-carbon economy.  Meeting our national climate targets will require a significant increase in the deployment rates of renewable electricity, including offshore wind, compared with those achieved in recent years.  The development of offshore wind energy will bring significant economic and employment opportunities to Ireland.  The Department and its development agencies are active in further developing these supply chain activities.  I will briefly address three of these activities relevant to the deliberations of the committee.  These are: Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities in developing SME capability in offshore wind supply chains; research by the expert group on future skills needs to identify the future skills requirements for the offshore wind sector; and regional developments, including the regional enterprise plans and the Shannon Estuary economic task force.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been working with SMEs to develop their capability in the offshore wind sector.  It has developed an offshore wind supply chain cluster of 65 companies.  These companies provide a range of products, services and skill sets appropriate to the offshore wind industry.  As per its remit, Enterprise Ireland is primarily focused on helping Irish SMEs bring this capability to export markets.  By far the largest and easiest to access market opportunity is the UK.  The London office of Enterprise Ireland has been building connections between Irish SMEs and UK offshore wind project developers, original equipment manufacturers and tier 1 contractors to ensure the greatest possible penetration of the UK market.  By facilitating Irish SMEs entering the UK offshore wind industry, Enterprise Ireland is helping these companies to build the appropriate capability and offerings to industry that not only operate in the UK and globally, but are also going to be major stakeholders in the Irish offshore wind sector.  Securing reference sites in Ireland will be advantageous for these supply chains as these companies seek to win business internationally.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has organised several sector events in the past three years in the UK, including a market study visit to Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth on the east coast of England, an event to showcase Irish capability to Dutch tier 1 contractors and a showcase of Irish capability to the Norwegian energy company Equinor.  It also commissioned a scoping study for Irish SMEs, focusing on supply chain opportunities in the UK, Denmark and Norway.  Enterprise Ireland is currently planning an industry forum to be held in Croke Park in June to focus on export market opportunities, particularly in the UK market, as well as opportunities for the supply chain domestically.</p><p>A further event in Manchester is planned in late June, where EI will take the Irish pavilion to Global Offshore Wind, an industry trade show.</p><p> From a skills policy and employment perspective, the Department is committed to identifying and driving the delivery of skills required to deliver on the ambitious wind energy targets.  The expert group on future skills needs, the secretariat of which sits in our Department, has published its study on skills to enable the low-carbon economy to 2030.  As part of this study, the expert group examined the skills needs arising from offshore wind energy generation targets in the 2019 climate action plan.  It estimated the demand for labour associated with offshore wind development will increase from the low hundreds to 2,500 mid-decade and will fluctuate around this level to 2030.  The group's modelling was based on the five phases of offshore wind energy, namely, planning, development, installation and operations through to decommissioning.  Across these phases, the expert group identified a range of skills that are required in engineering, environmental science and humanities, construction and technical services, legal and professional services, transport and logistics, and emerging and niche occupations.  As well as ongoing industry engagement with Ireland's skills development system, the report recommended the establishment of training partnerships or responses for projects between the Government, industry and education and training providers.</p><p> The offshore wind industry has significant regional employment and the Department is involved in the development and launch of nine new regional enterprise plans to 2024.  In developing these, the steering committees in each region considered how to contribute to a carbon-neutral economy.  Some of the regional enterprise plans contain specific strategic objectives of relevance to the offshore renewable wind and supply chain.  For example, the mid-west regional enterprise plan aims to harness the potential for major offshore floating wind projects off the west coast and to bring users of renewable energy physically close to the energy source.   The west regional enterprise plan specifically targets the region's potential for enterprise and job creation in the renewable energy sector.  It includes a focus on the potential of green hydrogen in decarbonising industry.  The region will work with large energy users to demonstrate the demand for this form of energy.  The north-west plan targets the growth of the wind energy industry by diversifying its existing onshore wind industry into the offshore wind industry.</p><p> The Shannon Estuary task force is being established in response to a commitment in the programme for Government.  Given the Shannon Estuary&rsquo;s deepwater port and geographical position, it is expected to assess the potential for renewable energy projects.  Existing infrastructure such as Shannon Foynes Port and the Tarbert and Moneypoint power stations will be key to harnessing that potential.  Several renewable energy projects that either have been proposed or are in planning illustrate the region's potential to complete its transition to a renewable-based economy, and these are expected to inform the work of the task force.</p><p> Achieving the full potential of Ireland's offshore wind resource offers major opportunities for the development of offshore wind electricity and associated by-products such as hydrogen, ammonia, energy storage and transmission technologies and technology services.  Large international investors are engaged with indigenous companies in a range of joint ventures to progress some of these business opportunities.  The Department and its agencies are actively engaged in building capacity in the indigenous sector for these supply chain opportunities.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I will provide an overview of the significant progress being made to deliver on this objective.</p> <p>  The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 has delivered the legislative basis to enable regulation of Ireland's maritime area outside the 12 nautical mile coastal zone limit for the first time.  This was an important achievement and provides certainty for offshore wind energy projects, which involve substantial levels of upfront investment.  The legislation provides the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications with powers to assess the first batch of maritime area consent, MAC, applications from a set of qualified offshore renewable energy, ORE, developers.  The purpose of this assessment will be to ensure only developers with the necessary financial and technical capability can enter the planning system.  A consultation on the proposed MAC assessment criteria was recently completed and the Minister will shortly announce the date in April when the MAC application window will open for this first batch of applications.  This will be a milestone on the critical path towards delivery on our 2030 targets, boosting international confidence in the State's intent to deliver at pace.</p> <p>  These assessments and the awarding of MACs to suitably qualified developers will be completed in quarter 3 of this year.  Developers can then apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for development permission, which will involve a full environmental assessment and public consultation in respect of their proposed projects.  The granting of MACs will also enable the first offshore renewable electricity support scheme auction to open in quarter 4 of 2022, providing a route to market for these projects.  As part of these offshore renewable energy support scheme, ORESS, contracts, significant contributions to community benefit funds, amounting to millions of euros annually, will be required from each project.  The model for the management and distribution of these funds will shortly be finalised, following the completion of a public consultation exercise.</p> <p>  Given this first phase of projects alone will not deliver the full 5 GW, a second batch of projects will need to be progressed through the development pipeline.  Again, the overriding objective must be to ensure only the most viable and realistic projects gain entry to the planning system.  The Department currently has a consultation open, setting out a range of potential criteria to identify this pool of projects, including the possible inclusion of an innovation category for non-fixed wind technologies such as floating wind.  In tandem with the work being led by the Department, a range of initiatives are under way in many other Departments and State agencies to support the development of this new sector, some of which members will hear from today.</p> <p>  It is also important that work under way in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the marine environment units of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage be progressed at pace to ensure appropriate data are made available to inform the sustainable development of the offshore wind energy sector while also ensuring national objectives regarding marine biodiversity are attained.  Recognising the range of initiatives under way, the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change recently approved a proposal to establish a delivery task force for offshore wind.  Matt Collins, assistant secretary in the Department, will chair this task force with the aim of ensuring the alignment and co-ordinated delivery of all activities under way among Departments, State agencies and related bodies.</p> <p>  Work is also being progressed to establish the building blocks required to enable the full potential of our offshore resource to be realised beyond 2030.  The policy intent is to move to a plan-led regime whereby the State, in consultation with all maritime users, will identify the areas best suited for sustainable renewable energy development.  Work on the second offshore renewable energy development plan is in progress and includes assessment of the opportunities for wind, wave and tidal technologies.  In parallel, work to assess the economic opportunity is being progressed, examining how to connect potential sources of offshore energy with large demand centres in continental Europe.  The planned Greenlink interconnector will provide a 500 MW connection between Ireland and Great Britain, while the Celtic interconnector will provide a 700 MW link between Ireland and the European internal energy market by connecting Ireland to France.  Non-electricity grid-related opportunities, particularly the potential to use excess renewable electricity to generate synthetic e-fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia, are also being assessed.  These fuels can be used to help decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors and the transport sector, especially in the case of heavy goods vehicles, maritime transport and potentially even the aviation sector.</p> <p>  In summary, significant work is under way in a range of Departments and State agencies to deliver on our 2030 offshore wind targets and this work remains firmly on track.  My colleague Mr. Finucane and I will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I am the principal officer responsible for the ongoing development and implementation of the new maritime planning system, brought about by the Maritime Area Planning Act and the national marine planning framework.</p><p>The State has undergone the most comprehensive review and overhaul of marine legislation and governance since its formation.  The two primary pillars of this reform are the national marine planning framework, NMPF, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 1 July 2021, and the Maritime Area Planning Act, which was passed by these Houses and subsequently promulgated by the President on 23 December 2021.</p><p> The NMPF is the long-term forward plan for Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area to ensure the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources.  It is also intended to support the introduction of offshore renewable energy into our maritime area.  The Maritime Area Planning Act will be the cornerstone of the new marine planning system in Ireland and brings together and creates the legal foundation for forward planning, streamlined development management and enforcement.  All future offshore renewable energy applications will be consented through this Act.  The Act will also establish a new agency, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, the role of which will be to govern the occupation of the maritime area.  With these initiatives, and guided by the NMPF, our maritime planning system will move towards being a plan-led process rather than the developer-led system it currently is.</p><p> The NMPF is a parallel document to the national planning framework, NPF.  Both of these spatial plans are concerned with the long-term future of our land and sea area, identifying opportunities for protection, growth and development so that our land and marine areas can be managed in the best interests of the public.  The NPF recognises the importance of integration and co-ordination with the land planning regime at national, regional and local levels.  In future it will be equally important, in turn, that national, regional and local terrestrial plans are consistent with the NMPF, as will be required under the Maritime Area Planning Act.  The Act also provides for designated maritime area plans, DMAPs, which are management plans for a localised area of our sea, to be developed.  Any Minister or relevant public body will be able to bring forward a DMAP proposal for a geographic area or sector which will be subject to public participation, environmental assessment and Oireachtas decision.  Once approved, these DMAPs become part of the NMPF.  This ensures a joined-up approach to marine forward planning with binding considerations for decision-makers.  I fully expect that the enduring offshore renewable energy system will be led and supported by DMAPs and will manoeuvre the system away from a developer-led model and towards a State-led model.  I thank the committee members for their interest and am happy to answer their questions.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Fiona Ralph.  I am a principal officer in the climate unit in the Department of Finance and I deal with national and international climate priorities as well as sustainable financial services.</p> <p>  The EU taxonomy for sustainable activities is an extremely important piece of work.  In a nutshell it defines what is sustainable for almost 40% of economic activities that are themselves responsible for up to 80% of our total emissions.  We know that Ireland and the rest of the EU needs to substantially increase sustainable investment over the next decade.  This investment cannot come solely from governments - private investors must also crowd in.  The taxonomy will encourage and guide investors to identify and channel money towards genuinely green investments.  I will comment on the purpose of the taxonomy and its relevance to today&rsquo;s topic before turning to the state of play in its development.</p> <p>  The taxonomy is a classification system developed at EU level.  It aims to specify technical, science-based criteria for assessing whether specific economic activities make a substantial positive contribution to climate change while doing no significant harm to the environment and simultaneously meeting minimum safeguards.  The taxonomy will evolve over time with more activities being added.  It will also reflect technological advances.  The Commission&rsquo;s website offers a useful taxonomy compass tool, which can be used to check the requirements sector by sector.  For example, the taxonomy sets out the conditions that a variety of activities related to the renewable energy sector must meet in order to be deemed sustainable, from electricity generation, storage, manufacture, transmission and distribution to solar, wind, geothermal, renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuel and bioenergy.  It is primarily aimed at large companies and the financial services sector to guide and mobilise investments in activities to achieve carbon neutrality. </p> <p>  Although it is voluntary for companies to spend or invest in taxonomy-aligned activities, certain companies in scope must report on the extent to which their business is aligned with the taxonomy&rsquo;s standards.  The EU and its member states are also working with other countries to agree a common set of standards that can be applied globally.</p> <p>  The taxonomy should be beneficial in a number of ways.  Investors will be better able to identify opportunities and confidently invest in projects and companies that have a substantial positive impact on the climate.  Corporates and financial services firms will improve transparency on sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities due to the taxonomy and other complementary transparency legislation.  These factors should help to shift investments to where they are most needed for the transition to net zero, while helping citizens, corporates and governments to keep an eye on where the money is going.</p> <p>  I will now outline the state of play in its development.  The overarching regulation came into force in 2020 and set out six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.  To be considered sustainable, an activity must make a substantial contribution to one or more of those six objectives and do no significant harm to the other objectives.  It must also meet minimum social safeguards and comply with technical screening criteria related to the objectives.</p> <p>  The detailed requirements for these objectives are set out in a series of delegated Acts, one of which came into force on 1 January 2022 and covers climate mitigation and adaptation.  A complementary Act, covering the requirements for natural gas and nuclear power, was adopted by the Commission on 2 February and, unless rejected by the Council or the European Parliament, will come into force next year. </p> <p>  Reporting requirements for firms in scope of the taxonomy are also in force as of this year.  These reporting requirements are complementary to those already existing and under development under some other notable EU legislation, such as the sustainable finance disclosures regulation and the non-financial reporting directive, which is currently being amended to become the corporate sustainability reporting directive.</p> <p>  The Commission has indicated that an additional delegated Act, covering the four remaining environmental objectives - water and marine, circular economy, pollution prevention, and biodiversity - is expected later this year.  Consideration is also being given to expanding the taxonomy to cover intermediate, or transitional, environmental performance and social objectives.  </p> <p>  In addition, under the European Commission&rsquo;s 2018 action plan on sustainable finance, we are now negotiating a regulation for a European green bond standard that could come into operation in 2024 and aims to set a gold standard for green bonds to raise funds on capital markets.</p> <p>  As taxonomy alignment reporting beds in for corporates and becomes increasingly relevant for the public sector, it is reasonable to expect that Ireland&rsquo;s public expenditure should increasingly demonstrate alignment with the taxonomy.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I might ask a few quick questions.  I hope our guests can be succinct in their answers.  My first question is for Mr. Owens and relates to the EU taxonomy.  While it is not decided yet, the European Council and the European Parliament need to make their decision.  The concern in this committee is that labelling nuclear and gas as green energy in Europe could send a signal that stifles development by diverting attention, opportunity and investment away from Ireland.  We would think there is now an opportunity, especially considering the current security and energy crises, to seek to decarbonise the energy systems in Europe as quickly as possible.  Ireland is well placed in that regard and the concern is that the taxonomy might pull against that opportunity.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. McCabe from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage relating to MARA and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A guest who was before the committee prior to this session said that a concern for the industry is that both of those institutions may not have the necessary human resources to deal with the number of applications and the level of opportunity that exists.  Are we confident that the resourcing plan is sufficient to realise as quickly as possible the opportunity that is there?</p><p>Does Mr. Owens want to take the first question?</p></speech>

It is a compromise.  The Commission has worked through looking at how considerably more than 20% of electricity in the EU is generated using nuclear energy.  Not all of the alternatives are in place.  The timing of divestment from gas and nuclear technology will have to be carefully considered.  The approach of the Government has been to seek to have a slightly higher standard applied on the gas side of taxonomy.  However, we remained agnostic on the nuclear side, given that the Commission had worked hard on trying to find a compromise.  Many member states had different views for different reasons.  There are different stages of development and we judged that it was not unreasonable for the transition, at least, not to rule out any investment in gas or nuclear.</p></speech>

Significant money is looking for renewable energy opportunities at present, both domestically and internationally.  I know from previous experience working with some of the multinational development banks that they are extremely interested.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, is Europe's climate bank in which there are considerable opportunities.  There are also significant pent-up savings in Ireland that can be used to meet some of these goals.  In short, I hope it will not slow down the development of our own resource.</p></speech>

Proposals from An Bord Plean&aacute;la have been accepted and approved around the creation of a new marine unit within its organisational structure.  We remain in ongoing discussions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure that new unit is appropriately staffed.  We have to remain agile in that space because many of these are new skills for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it needs access to those as well.  We will work closely with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on this in the short, medium and long term.</p> <p>  We are on course to have the new agency, MARA, established in the first quarter of next year.  An establishment unit has been created within the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government, the sole purpose of which is to get that agency up and running.  Part of that will be to identify a proper workforce plan very shortly.  I am confident that the right resources will be in the agency ahead of applications being accepted.  There are statutory limits on those applications in terms of how long they take to process.  These have been set out in the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  The agency will have to react to that but I do not have a concern.  I am quite confident we will be ahead of that situation.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the concerns the Chair raised on the EU taxonomy.  What sort of risk analysis has been done on the provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty to which Ireland is a signatory?  The Department of Finance officials said it was an evolving process and gas may change over time but once an investor comes and is set up, the investor will be protected for the duration of the investment.  Has a risk analysis been done by the Department on the impact of the Energy Charter Treaty and investments that may come into the country on the back of the EU taxonomy?</p></speech>

The cost of renewables came up in our earlier session in terms of the delivery task force for offshore wind.  Will that have a cost dimension?  We are an outlier in terms of the cost of renewables.  Are auctions and the potential of further auctions to deliver further high-cost electricity within the Department's mandate or area of focus?  What is it doing about that?</p> <p>  Grid capacity is related to cost.  EirGrid has outlined a schedule of works or areas of the grid that will be rated up or upgraded.  However, it has given no indication of timelines or when those works will be completed.  Will all of them be delivered?  It could be June, July or August of 2029.  Has EirGrid given the Department an indicative timeline for those projects in the shaping our energy future report?  If it has, will the Department officials share that with the committee?</p></speech>

The one thing about the long-term delivery of renewable energy is, especially as we look to develop the offshore sector, that it is a relatively new sector in Ireland.  Many work streams are ongoing in different Departments, agencies and regulatory bodies.</p> <p>  The main job of the delivery task force will be to co-ordinate and pull together all of these aspects.  A key part of that will be to ensure we are able to develop an enterprise and skill-development strategy alongside that and as the projects start to move from planning phases into construction phases and, in turn, into operation and management phases, we will have the skilled people ready to work with those projects and Irish companies available to take part in the construction and ongoing operation and management of the projects.</p> <p>  All of this is critical to ensure that projects have more certainty in terms of development.  That is a key plank to enable them to bid in the auctions in a very competitive fashion.  The support system that the project will come into is quite a competitive option scenario.  They will bid against each other which will also be a good control on cost coming into the market for us.</p> <p>  We published an offshore grid policy last April which showed that would centralise the offshore grid in a single offshore transmission system operator.  This operator is EirGrid which is working very closely with ESB networks to ensure that the development of an appropriate offshore grid strategy fits, in a timely and appropriate fashion, with the development and strengthening of the onshore grid.</p> <p>  Another of the Deputy's questions related to the grid capacity and the timing of works.</p><p>Shaping Our Electricity Future, which was published recently by EirGrid, looks at the development of the entire grid network up until 2030 so it takes on board not just the advent of onshore and offshore renewables and different technologies such as onshore wind, solar, biomass and offshore wind, it also looks at growth in demand and traditional gas and other generation units on the system.  It does this because we need to take a holistic view of grid development.  EirGrid and ESB Networks work very closely to ensure that new technologies can be taken on board; the grid is strengthened in the areas that require it, particularly around the greater Dublin area; and that ongoing replacement measures-----</p></speech>

There is a list of 48 grid reinforcement projects.  Has EirGrid given the Department a timeline for when they will be completed with dates and, if so, can Mr. Finucane share them with us?</p></speech>

The early works would be scheduled and have timelines in place.  Some of the later projects strengthening towards the mid to end of the decade probably do not have firm dates.</p></speech>

In that, we outlined several options we were considering for the final auction terms and conditions.  We looked at whether or not we would index link part of the bid prices.  All of these have impacts on how the companies will structure their bids ultimately for the auction.  Together with our financial advisers, we are working through some of those options and the responses to the consultation.  We are looking at the individual components companies put together when they are formulating their bid prices so we are looking at the different areas within that.</p></speech>

While my colleague spoke about the auctions in the short term, we recognise that to develop offshore beyond 2030, an economic analysis needs to be undertaken given that we are not as readily connected to the European Continent as other countries so there needs to be a clear pathway for how we can build and make best use of our offshore capability so that analysis has been initiated as well.</p></speech>

It is impressive to see the amount of progress that is being made and the establishment of the plan-led approach, the task force, enterprise and skills and the cluster.  My central question would be if the political system seeks to lift our efforts on offshore renewable opportunity to a higher level, what would the witnesses recommend should now be done because it seems they have put in a framework and it is hard to criticise what is in it?  Given deteriorating energy security and increasing urgency, what would the witnesses recommend we think about to take it to another level?</p> <p>  What is the scale of the employment cluster and the witnesses' ambition in terms of its future?  Are we talking about a very significant employment cluster within Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland or is this part of a comparatively middle-of-the-road opportunity from the perspective of the enterprise sector?  </p> <p>  I have studied the taxonomy and think it is a very useful tool.  My central question concerns the degree to which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has taken this on board.  We have a new national development plan and &euro;140 billion.  The impression I get from people who come before this committee is that public procurement is still running pretty much as it always did and if there is not a very strong demand from the procurer to a create the most sustainable path for procurement, nothing much happens.  There has not been that decisive shift.  Whoever is commissioning the work is the primary driver.  A taxonomy is not being applied by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to force those commissioning work down a more sustainable path.</p></speech>

We estimate that the offshore component of that will increase from the low hundreds to about 2,500 by the middle of the decade and should remain there for the remainder of the decade.  The construction component in terms of getting these developments off the ground will be a strong component of that.

We developed this scale offshore network with over 65 companies in it.  They have a range of capabilities in the offshore wind industry.  A group of the companies involved would be heavily involved in the industry and are currently working in the UK.  They would be working in the North Sea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the east coast of the US and so on.  We also have a group of companies in there that are involved in the on-shore piece - basically cable landing, substations on shore and grid engineering to bring that power on to the grid.  The third group of companies are in the broader marine engineering space and would have capability to move into offshore wind.</p><p>We have a growing capability in the sector.  Certainly all the companies that we have are tier 2 and that will be the case in the short to medium term.  We see significant employment growth in those companies.  We also see them buying new vessels for survey work for geotechnical and geophysical applications, for example.  We see a number of companies also buying crew transfer vessels, which are effectively the buses of the industry.  We see significant interest from overseas tier 1 companies and developers, particularly those in the UK.  The developers and tier 1 companies in the UK are the ones that will come to Ireland to develop projects here.  Our approach is to get as many of our companies in this cluster as possible into the UK industry with a view to them building their capability in that industry, making connections there, working with these tier 1 companies in the UK and then bringing that capability back home subsequently to maximise the local content in the supply chain for the Irish projects.</p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. Curran's points about piggy-backing off the UK's industrial heritage and economy.  However, we need to look to the likes of Germany and Netherlands where there are significant players who do want to be active in the Irish market and are knocking on the door.

Bringing them together under the delivery task force will enable that connectedness and alignment to ensure that we are progressing at pace across all different areas.  From a whole-of-government perspective, it would be good to raise the profile of our need to attain our biodiversity targets in tandem with delivering on offshore renewable energy.  The work has been initiated in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on marine protected areas.  We would like to see that accelerated so that we are de-risking the process for offshore energy projects as they move through the new planning system.  That would be an important area.  We certainly believe there is scope for both sets of targets and objectives to be met.  It is an area that could have greater focus.</p></speech>

We in the Department of Finance have not done a risk assessment on the Energy Charter Treaty.  I cannot speak for others.  It is a voluntary standard and I think the standard is higher for gas than anything that is in place at the moment.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Bruton, I will not speak for my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform except to say that I know in the national development plan it has been climate tagged.  They have gone through the projects and done some work around that.  Under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, from memory I think 37% must align with the "do no significant harm" elements of the taxonomy.  It is not full compliance but it is in line with that. </p> <p>  We also have two other sources of green funds, namely the carbon tax, which is fully hypothecated for green purposes and underlies a great deal of the climate action plan, and the green bond.  The National Treasure Management Agency, NTMA, has raised closed to &euro;7 billion, all of which is allocated for green purposes.  There is an annual allocation report, which is independently verified by a third-party company.</p></speech>

The first is achieving our own national ambitions, which are aiming at 5 GW this side of 2030.  We have outlined the different frameworks for that.  Before we have even gone to the first auction and processed the first batch of projects ready to build, we have put out a consultation looking at the next batch of projects, which closes tomorrow.  We are developing a flow of projects as we go forward to ensure that industry and all the different players have time to get their order correct so they are able to be operational by 2030.  On the second part of it, we are looking at the potential opportunity beyond our own national requirements.  In the programme for Government a figure of up to 30 GW was identified as potential for either the export markets or going beyond where we are.  We are working very closely with the European Commission in respect of the Trans-European Networks for Energy, TEN-E, programme.  The new programme has a new focus on cross-border connections and potential hybrid connections where generation can link in to traditional electricity interconnectors.  Ireland this year is chairing the North Seas Energy Cooperation where with a group of North Sea countries we are looking at speeding up the process of infrastructure and market development to get offshore wind moving at a quicker pace than is possible at the moment.</p> <p>  The unfortunate events in Ukraine and the energy response to them have very much put a new focus on engaging with the UK at national and Commission level in co-operation talks and building on the post-Brexit trade and co-operation agreement discussions that are under way with the UK in respect of cross-border energy trading.  That process will definitely be speeded up as a result of this.</p></speech>

It is not about whether gas or nuclear power exist or are invested in, but whether we are tagging them as climate renewable and sustainable.  On their attempted inclusion, the European Investment Bank has said it will not accept it.  Many institutional investors of more than &euro;50 trillion, I think, in investment funds, have said they will not recognise that.  Ireland should not be agnostic on this issue.  It is about the credibility of investment in this area and the rerouting of it.  We should move from being agnostic to being believers in really pushing green hydrogen and renewable energies such as wind energy and wave energy, which we heard about from earlier witnesses.  If Ireland is in a neutral position on this, we should champion this because there are tensions between continuation of gas and green hydrogen.  Germany now has a green hydrogen strategy.  If we could just come to where Ireland could get ahead of industry in this-----</p></speech>

On illustrating the demand for green hydrogen by partnering with big companies, it seems we need to have a State level push on green hydrogen.  We hear about keeping the lights on, but I am a bit concerned that the strategy for the western seaboard seems to involve large energy users, which I imagine are data centres, being the drivers and in control of the agenda.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the State-led approach in terms of energy security, green hydrogen and renewables.</p><p> On the issue of Designated Marine Area Plans, DMAPs, for marine protected areas, MPAs, I was concerned that the representative of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage spoke about DMAPs as an area, when every other witness that we have had from industry has talked about the MPAs as being core to the State-led approach.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the MPAs as part of the core approach and indeed, increasing the State's capacity for environmental surveys and sensitivity mapping as part of how we interpret.  There will need to be environmental assessment of projects, not just of areas.</p></speech>

The delegated Act covers those conditions that investments in natural gas and nuclear energy have to meet.  Ireland is not likely to object to this delegated Act, as it stands at the moment.

I might address some of the questions she asked around the State approach.  As I said in my opening statement, the intention is that the work that we are doing on the offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP, will inform how best we move forward with the State-led approach.  We want to move from the current project or developer led approach to the State actually identifying the best areas for offshore energy in consultation and using an evidence-based approach and data from many other sectors, including data on the environmental sensitivities.  National parks and wildlife and MPAs are all important, but they are not the only aspects that are being looked at.  It is much broader than that.  Once we complete that national assessment, the OREDP, the intention is that we then identify the best areas to move into the DMAPs that our colleague in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage referenced.  Just to be clear, there are environmental assessments to be carried out at every level of the process.  At a plan level, we are carrying out a strategic environmental assessment, an appropriate assessment.  When we get down through the DMAP, similar exercises will be carried out.  Further down, at a project level, there will be environmental impact assessments and so on.  It is very much a holistic approach that we are taking.  The framework and the legislation which the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has established is very much providing the overarching framework within which we are working.  Moving to that State-led approach will offer a lot of advantages for the State, but also for other maritime users.  It will enable the protection of biodiversity and also de-risk the process for developers.  It really is the optimal route, long term.  However, there is work to be done to get there.  We are working through that transition at the moment.</p></speech>

I think it was hinted at in the existing Climate Action Plan, but I think he is going to firm it up in the next version of it, which is due at the end of the year.  There will be work, including a potential public consultation on it in advance of that by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I also asked about the issue of partnering with large energy users.  How do we ensure that there is local energy security for keeping the lights on if renewable energy is tied very closely to specific customers, such as large energy users?  I know that I am out of time, so I am happy to receive a written answer to that question.</p></speech>

That was very much part of the reason why EirGrid produced the Shaping our Electricity Future report.

That is very clearly outlined in Shaping our Electricity Future.</p></speech>

Mr. Owens referred to the carbon tax and the fact it is fully ring-fenced for measures.  Is it not that case that it is only the increase in the carbon tax that has been applied that has been ring-fenced?  I am not sure of the exact percentage, but a significant proportion of carbon tax is not ring-fenced for carbon measures.</p> <p>  I have a question for the representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The seafood-offshore renewable energy working group was to be set up by 2021 to act as a stakeholder body.  I am wondering whether there is a progress report on that.  There are some concerns that there have been delays with it.  It is fundamental that those discussions are happening between different stakeholders to ensure that we get the right response in answer to our renewable questions.</p> <p>  I am not sure if any of the witnesses can answer this question, but I am wondering if there are any plans to dial up Ireland's preparedness to harness our natural resources in light of the events in Ukraine.  It has been a very quickly evolving situation.  There is quite a high level of risk that energy security in Europe and Ireland over the short to medium, and perhaps long, term could be impacted.  Are there any discussions within the Departments about speeding up our response to ensure that we have renewable energy in place to give us that resilience?</p></speech>

I hope that this week we will be advertising on our website for a chair of that group.  I am delighted with that progress.  We have met separately with stakeholders in fisheries and renewable energy around the formation of the group.  We have not been inactive.  It is important to note that the Bill took all of our resources.  It was an incredibly complex and difficult piece of legislation to get through.  To tie this back to Deputy Bruton's question around what can be done, I think the legislation and the framework really showed what the State can do when it puts it mind to something.  Right across a number of Departments and the political apparatus, people really got behind the legislation and got it through.  We spent 22 to 24 hours at Committee Stage alone, but everybody had a very similar vision and objective, even though there might have been disagreements around the contents of the Bill.  That really showed that when we all focus, we can get things done.  We need a similar focus now, going into the future.  We will be bringing forward a marine planning policy statement over the coming months.  We will be laying a draft before the Oireachtas.</p><p>Similarly we would like to focus on that as it could set a clear direction for all marine planning into the future.  We want to lay down exactly what are our priorities in this respect.  That covers the questions that may have come our way.</p></speech>

A key aspect is increasing the rate of deployment of energy efficiency measures every bit as much as demand and supply side measures.  There was an emergency energy Council meeting in Brussels last week and the International Energy Agency met at ministerial level last week looking at these matters as well.  The entire European energy system is really looking at how it can response by dialling up delivery of the Fit for 55 packages.  I expect we will see measures put in place in the short term to speed this up as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

In the submission from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, it spoke about significant community gain but what exactly does that mean?  What communities is the Department speaking about?  There are licences for legacy projects that should be first to be allowed go ahead.  Will that be the case or is the Department talking about other new projects in the submission rather than these legacy projects?  I am very interested to hear what the Department has to say about moving to a more State-led approach.  When might that happen?  Will it happen on time or will we end up in a position where the developers will lead the development or renewable energy when they choose to invest in something?  How will the State ensure something happens if a developer decides not to invest in it?  Our aim for 2030 is very ambitious, given where we are coming from.</p><p>In the submission from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it speaks about the Shannon Estuary economic task force and the role it will play in delivering renewables.  We and the Government parties have a concern that liquefied natural gas planning permission might be awarded.  Even the Chairman's party has put a Bill forward to stop this happening in the future.  How would it affect plans for the Shannon Estuary economic task force if the Shannon liquefied natural gas planning application was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>My final question is on the EU taxonomy, as it flies in the face of everything we heard from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that we would even consider relying on fossil fuels and nuclear power in future given how frightening the report was.  What I really want to get at is the impact of the war on Ukraine and whether it will hurt our climate targets?  Will it allow for massive importation of liquefied natural gas from the US?  I read an article in <i>The Washington Post </i>about such gas flowing from the US when it previously could not export it.  Most of that is coming to Europe.  How does that look for us?</p></speech>

It is something we are looking at in respect of how the system will operate for the offshore wind projects.  We are conscious any community benefit payments from offshore projects will be significantly bigger in volume and nature than any of the smaller onshore projects would be.  We are looking to put a structure in place so we can ensure the relevant communities would benefit from the large-scale projects as they become operational.</p></speech>

The first batch of projects that will be coming through the new regime have already significantly advanced works under the previous foreshore regime.  They will have spent many years in several cases conducting surveys, including bird or environmental surveys and so on, to provide them with the detailed information they have in order to be able to move into the planning system.  A protocol was agreed two years ago between the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to enable those projects to transition over to the new regime.  This provides many benefits for the State in that we have a much more streamlined and progressive regime that will be used to assess these applications.</p></speech>

Some of them go back a number of years and some are more recent than that.  The point to make clear is that these projects will be fully assessed under the new regime.  What they have agreed is entry into the new system.  When they come before the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in order to apply for a maritime area consent, if they are deemed viable developers in that they have the financial and technical capability, they will give up any foreshore lease they already have in return for being granted a maritime area consent.  That will then give a gateway to the planning system, allowing them go before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The projects would have to be fully assessed from all environmental considerations along with planning.  Public consultation would be part of that.  Essentially, they are moving from the old regime to the new but will still be fully assessed.</p> <p>  As we mentioned, there is also an open consultation now on how we might best identify the second batch of projects.  In order to meet the 2030 targets, the projects need a number of years to be developed - it is typically seven or more years - and we must get projects into the pipeline as soon as possible.  That phase 2 consultation is currently open for everyone to contribute, thinking of how we identify the most appropriate projects to move into the new system.  Again, the intention must be to ensure the most viable projects get into the planning system so we do not clog that system with projects that are not realistic.</p> <p>  On the question of a State-led approach, we must move forward in order to meet the 2030 targets and get these projects into the development pipeline at the same time as developing and figuring out the best approach to that State-led regime.  We are doing work this year on the offshore renewable energy development plan, looking at opportunities and constraints, and we aim to have that completed by the end of this year or January 2023.  That information will be available and used as part of that second batch of projects progressing through the development pipeline.  To move a fully State-led approach will take a number of years and it is important to acknowledge we are trying to do both in tandem.  We are trying to make the approach to assessing projects as they go through the system as robust as possible in the short term while the plan-led approach is being developed.</p></speech>

On the west coast we will not be looking at bottom-fixed as we are in the Irish Sea.  We will be looking at floating units.  We could potentially use the Shannon Estuary as a fabrication base for that industry in fabricating units.</p><p>It has a number of key advantages.  It is sheltered.  There is deep water and a significant land bank.  It is ideally placed to float those units out and subsequently tow them into place off the west coast.  Shannon Estuary has a number of key advantages that would be relevant for the industry.</p></speech>

I know the question of the development of ports is a matter for the Department of Transport.  To get our ports ready generally, whether Shannon Estuary or other ports, is an enormous infrastructural task.  Does the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment see it as an urgent task or will we be into the next decade before we see delivery?  The reason I ask is because I think it is something we can expedite.  It would be important for the Department to seize the opportunity that could be delivered sooner rather than later.  It would also be important for that Department to liaise with the Department of Transport to develop the infrastructure that will be necessary to realise the resource.</p></speech>

We have had a series of meetings with the Department of Transport in recent years.  The ports are all privately owned and independent but we would see this as a key area where the delivery task force will need to zone in on to ensure we have all the different strands in place to expedite these developments.</p></speech>

In the very short term, one of the options to be examined is increasing the transport of liquefied natural gas that may otherwise have gone to the Asian market or other global markets to the European markets.  That would be an immediate response to the Ukrainian crisis as opposed to a long-term plan.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022030800002#A00400"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to present details of the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide the necessary funding for the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme within the energy transformation programme of my Department.</p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the impact of the rising cost of living on households, including the rising cost of electricity and gas prices caused by international conditions.  Wholesale natural gas prices have been increasing since the second half of 2020 and current indications are that these higher prices will continue for the foreseeable future.  These higher prices feed directly through to retail electricity prices, as gas is used for electricity generation.</p><p>To address the growing impact of rising costs on vulnerable households, the Government increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5 in budget 2022.  There were also increases to the qualified child payment and the living alone allowance, and an increase in the income threshold for the working family payment was introduced.  In addition, there were adjustments to basic welfare, pension rates and income tax bands, which were introduced primarily to cater for the cost of living increases driven in part by energy prices.</p><p>Since then, however, the continuing rise in the cost of living has further significantly impacted citizens' lives.  Recognising this on 10 February, as part of a suite of policy measures designed to support households, the Government announced an increase in the electricity credit from &euro;100, excluding VAT, to &euro;200, including VAT.  The total cost of this scheme has been set in the relevant legislation at &euro;400 million.  This will allow for the payment of the electricity credit to all domestic electricity customers registered on an agreed date, including pay-as-you go customers, from this April.  Approximately 2.25 million account holders will benefit from the scheme with a one-off exceptional payment to their electricity accounts.</p><p>This scheme is part of a range of measures being taken by the Government to mitigate the impact of rising energy costs, including a fuel allowance lump sum payment of &euro;125, a drug payment scheme reduction to &euro;80, a front-loading of the working family payment, a 20% reduction in public transport fees from the end of April until the end of the year, and a reduction in caps for school transport fees.</p><p><b></b>The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, which provides the legal basis for the scheme, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 2 March.  The scheme will be operated by the distribution system operator - ESB Networks - and electricity suppliers and will be overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.</p><p>Based on the number of domestic electricity accounts, ESB Networks will make payments to the individual electricity suppliers who will then credit each domestic electricity account held with them.  ESB networks and suppliers will be required to make all books and records relating to their functions under the scheme available to an auditor to be appointed by my Department.</p><p> The Revenue Commission has advised that VAT must be applied on the bill balance after the credit has been applied.  On that basis the credit of &euro;176.22 is being applied exclusive of VAT on each account.  Inclusive of VAT, the total reduction on each household electricity costs will be &euro;200. </p><p> The total cost of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is estimated at &euro;400 million.  The cost of the scheme is being funded by my Department through a reallocation of &euro;128.6 million from subhead B4 &ndash; residential and community retrofit programmes to subhead B11 &ndash; electricity credit, along with additional Exchequer funding of &euro;271.4 million being made available by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this Supplementary Estimate.</p><p> My Department is maintaining the planned delivery outputs for the residential and community retrofit schemes by allocating &euro;267.2 million in capital funding to the programme in 2022.  This is comprised of &euro;184.2 million, including capital carryover, from the Vote and &euro;83 million of funding from the energy efficiency national fund.  This is the highest ever allocation for the programme and will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes to a building energy rating, BER, of B2.  This nearly doubles the number of homes delivered to B2 standard in 2021.</p><p> In the longer term, the best protection from rising prices is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and to improve the efficiency of our homes.  The 2021 climate action plan has set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a BER of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of 2030.  The national retrofit plan, which was published last November, is designed to address barriers to retrofit, identifying a range of measures aimed at driving demand, expanding the size and capacity of the supply chain and making retrofits more affordable.</p><p> New initiatives launched last month to deliver on this plan include a new national home energy upgrade scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard and a special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation.  These new initiatives will be funded by the national development plan financial allocation for residential retrofit of &euro;8 billion to 2030.  Over 60% of this funding, equalling &euro;5 billion, will be from carbon tax revenue.</p><p> Government also recognises that for many homeowners, even with enhanced grant rates, there will be a need to access finance to fund their upgrade.  For this reason, my Department is working with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Finance, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the European Investment Bank and financial institutions to design a new low-cost loan scheme for retrofit.</p><p> I am very happy to take questions from the committee on this Supplementary Estimate, which will provide the necessary funding for the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme payment.</p></speech>

I know the Minister does not have a crystal ball and none of us do but given the seriousness of the geopolitical situation we are in, does the Minister agree that energy costs will continue to rise, and rise severely?  Does he believe that this &euro;200 subsidy to each household will be enough?  I would argue that a lot more will need to be done for long-term alleviation of the problem.  Has the Minister thought about looking at methods that other countries, such as Poland and Spain, have brought in?  Those countries have capped the prices of energy.  Has the Minister considered looking at the profits of the energy companies?  My understanding is that the profits of the companies to which we pay our bills have been handsome in recent years.  Are there ways to retrieve anything from those companies to alleviate the hardship on people?  I am sure the Minister will agree this is a very challenging and serious situation and it will worsen over the coming period, given what is happening on the planet.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, she is also correct when she says that the likely prognosis is for ongoing high energy costs.  We had thought, prior to the invasion and war, that energy prices would start to come down because they were already very high.  That is now less certain.  For the immediate future, this year and probably next year, there will be no relief.  For that reason, the Government is looking to see are there additional measures it can take.  We said clearly that we thought additional measures unnecessary and that we would wait until the budget in October before further reviewing the situation but we will have to act quicker than that.</p> <p>  We will not be able to cover the full cost and cushion the full blow.  The price of gas, oil and coal has risen to unprecedented levels.  They may vary slightly.  To take the example of the cost of gas, it will not decrease immediately or significantly because even if there were an immediate resolution of the war, Europe would look to increase gas storage and that would see an ongoing demand.  We will need additional measures.</p> <p>  There is another core solution we must consider that might take slightly longer but which must be centre stage, that is, we need additional measures that reduce our use of fossil fuels.  We must look at radically accelerating energy efficiency measures across a whole range of different sectors.  I am working on that in my Departments, as well as working with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and, critically, with the European Commission on its toolbox, which it is going to revise and update in the next two or three days.  A united European approach is best.</p> <p>  With regard to the example of the Spanish and Polish price caps, I think every country has different circumstances and I do not believe our circumstances would allow for those mechanisms to work.  Taking Spain as an example, there are many complex reasons its market is particularly exposed because of the way the market is designed and so on.  My understanding is that much of that cap applies to companies that do not have any fossil component but may include a large nuclear-powered generator that has experienced no real cost increase but has benefited from the market price increase.  None of our suppliers are characterised in that way.  All of our main generators are typically using a mix of fuel.  In the case of the ESB, that mix comprises coal and gas and most other suppliers are supplying gas, albeit they also have renewables.  The increase in the price of coal and gas has hit most of the large generators and, therefore, there is not the same extent of supernormal profits that one might see, for example, in the case of a nuclear generator.  We do not have those.</p></speech>

That happens, for example, through dividends to the State.  The ESB has a critical role in the roll-out of new renewable generation, which is how we will reduce our dependence on Russian fossil fuels.  It also has a critical role in the building out of the distribution grid, the smart metering network and the energy efficiency measures that we need to deliver.  ESB has a massive capital programme and its profits in comparison with that are actually very small.  The ESB recently launched a new company strategy with ten core objectives which were hugely ambitious and to the benefit of the Irish people.  Its ability to invest in that plan is critical to our energy security and climate ambition.  It is also crucial in helping to shield householders.  The smart metering programme, for example, would allow us to introduce time-of-day pricing and so on so customers can start saving money by using power when the wind is blowing and energy is cheap rather than at peak times.  We need to strengthen and support ESB's ability to invest.  Most of the other energy companies are private.  Bord na M&oacute;na is doing a remarkable job of transforming from brown to green.  It has an enormous investment programme, particularly in renewable generation, that is showing real success.</p><p>I see our semi-State companies, in addition to other operators in the market, as having a role in helping us out of this crisis rather than being the cause of it.  The cause of it is Mr. Putin.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022030800002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement and update.  We are here to discuss the transfer of &euro;128.6 million from subhead B4 - residential and community retrofit - to subhead B11.  We discussed this move previously but were not clear about where and to what level the funding would be moved and where it would come from.  The Minister acknowledged that transfer but said the Department will maintain delivery outputs.  How can the Minister make that claim?  It seems contradictory to take &euro;128.6 million while still expecting to maintain delivery outputs.  It begs the question as to whether the Department's delivery outputs were too low in the first place or whether it over-allocated in the budget.  How can the Minister make the claim that delivery outputs will be maintained?</p> <p>  My second question concerns the degree to which this transfer has been energy poverty-proofed.  For example, &euro;62 million was approved for the better energy communities scheme in the revised Supplementary Estimate.  That figure has now been reduced to &euro;43 million so &euro;19 million has been taken from that budget.  That scheme has a specific role in energy poverty reduction, as acknowledged by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the Government's environmental assessment in 2020.  We are supporting this legislation and the transfer of this funding but at a departmental level, how was the decision made to identify the funding?  I would have thought areas of the Department's expenditure that were not specifically allocated to energy poverty reduction could have been more ideally targeted.  The Minister's figures for deep retrofits last year show 1,800 of those deep retrofits were achieved by the addition of solar PV, which is great.  This indicates that the houses that are benefiting from that were already cosy and well-insulated compared with others that might have a D, E or F building energy rating and need more significant work.  Within the range of options and funds available to the Minister, was there not more appropriate funding that would not impact on energy poverty reduction initiatives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022030800002#C00400"><p>Regarding the inflationary effects of energy price rises, particularly the rising cost of gas, which is driving up the cost of electricity, it was clear in most of the second half of last year that we were going to have to do something.  It relates to one of the measures we had in mind in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was to use some of the carryover we had, which I think was some &euro;57 million, as a result of an underspend last year because a lot of retrofitting could not take place last year due to Covid.  We decided to use some of that carryover - the &euro;128 million that has been transferred in the way described by the Deputy - to recognise that we would probably need it for some fuel price support measure.</p> <p>  The issue of the balance, social protection and energy poverty proofing must be taken into account in the wider context than the national retrofit plan, which was launched last November, and the very specific details announced two weeks ago.  I think it was a &euro;267 million package.  The design of that was very much done with addressing fuel poverty in mind.  I think something like &euro;118 million of that &euro;267 million is in the warmer homes 100% grant targeted at those on the lowest incomes.  There is also an allocation of &euro;85 million within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage targeting social housing retrofitting.  If we take those two sums, of the some one third of &euro;1 billion between the various measures, two thirds of it is targeted at energy poverty measures.  It was appropriate that the Government made the decision, particularly given that we had to act fast and did not want a further measure that was more universal in nature because even with all the planning as regards social welfare increases and the targeting of roughly &euro;200 million at social housing, there are people who fall through the gaps.  The benefit of a &euro;200 credit is that it gets to everyone quickly.  I believe that was the correct approach.  I think there was a call for that mix.  </p> <p>  In respect of whether we are reducing ambition, if at the end of this year, we find that the demand for and level of public interest in the retrofitting scheme is such that we are coming to the end of our budget and are unable to meet all demand, I am very confident I will be able to go back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, particularly in these circumstances when everything has to be focused towards energy efficiency and burning less Russian oil, coal and gas, and get a further Supplementary Estimate if we find demand outstrips supply.  Our biggest problem in recent years has been the opposite so I am confident.  This &euro;267 million programme is huge.  There has been massive expansion.  If that is not sufficient, I am confident we will be able to look for further funding because this is a significant priority for Government - not just for climate reasons but for energy security and fuel poverty reasons.</p></speech>

We will no doubt spend a lot of time in the months and years ahead tracking that and ensuring it gets delivered.  However, it does not address the decision to move &euro;128.6 million.  The better energy communities scheme has been identified as one that must reduce its spend in the year ahead.  To what degree is fuel poverty reduction prioritised in the decision-making process at departmental level?  Some of the options available to the Minister have a greater impact on reducing fuel poverty than others.  Notwithstanding the big spend, when the Minister made the decision relating to this scheme, what level of importance was given to fuel poverty bearing in mind that there has been a &euro;19 million reduction involving a transfer to a scheme that is universal?  That is acknowledged as a weakness across the board.  There has been a reduction of &euro;19 million relating to the better energy communities scheme, which is specifically targeted, at least in part, to reduce fuel poverty, and that money is being transferred to this universal scheme.</p></speech>

We must have a just transition, which is why it involves two thirds of spending going on those sorts of 100% grant-aided schemes.</p><p>However, it is not that alone.  It goes back to the budget in October, which was specifically designed in that way.  The decision to not only target the fuel allowance but include a mix of qualified child allowance, living alone allowance and the working family payment was based on a detailed analysis of how not to leave gaps.  If we were just relying on the fuel allowance or the warmer homes or community homes schemes, we could miss some people.  The blend of social welfare increases and the budgeted mechanisms are the key.</p><p> Another benefit of this universal scheme is that all those households benefit from this too.  It is important because for households on low income, the energy crisis represents a much higher percentage of their bills.  This is centre stage in our thinking.  There will have to be further measures.  What we are experiencing is an unprecedented challenge.</p></speech>

The CSO data on housing and energy use show a clear pattern where some areas with older buildings have very low and poor energy systems.  Is enough being done to have focused, area-based initiatives?  The retrofit programme is admirable in many of its intentions, particularly its focus on anti-poverty measures, but it seems to rely on sustainable energy communities to develop that area-based approach.  Otherwise it is individual applications to the one-stop shop.  Should the Government not try to go in with a focused offer to some of the more poorly insulated areas that could easily be identified on a map?</p> <p>  Is there greater clarity now on the low-interest loan?  The concept is that deep retrofits could be funded by loans that would be paid down from the savings from the energy bills.  That is a really important aspect of this if it can be made work.  Is the Government clearer on the rate?  Will it be 3%?  When can it go live?</p> <p>  I am conscious that there are 620,000 homes with smart meters but to our knowledge only 40,000 have access to options that could help them reduce the cost of energy by using electricity when it is cheaper or when renewables are on the grid.  Could initiatives be taken to activate those smart grids at this time of acute difficulty?</p> <p>  An issue that is arising again is our gas security.  Can the Corrib field be drawn on to supplement our supply at this time of very great difficulties or is its output fixed?  Is the traditional position of opposition to LNG up for review in the context of energy security or is it unchanged?</p> <p>  What is the Minister's view on the short-term contingency measures that may have to be prepared for in the context of the continuing conflict in Ukraine?</p></speech>

One way we will do that is with the new applications to the warmer home scheme   We will do that once we have cleared the backlog, which will be done quickly, of 7,000 houses that built up during the pandemic.  We are looking at the pre-1993 houses because the building regulations were changed in 1991.  Houses from 1993 tend to be above a BER D+ standard.  We are right to target those in that way.</p> <p>  The energy communities are the right way to do that.  It is up to 600, I think, so it is starting to take off.  That is a good mechanism but the Deputy is correct that we need to go further.  The one-stop shop system will allow companies that are operating as such to do exactly what the Deputy is suggesting, namely to go in and aggregate and market this to a community as something where they can provide a community solution or aggregated response.  Houses on an estate tend to all have the same fabric and energy structures.  The one-stop shop is geared towards that kind of aggregation of response, which is the right way to go.</p> <p>  On the loan, I was really hopeful that we would have something like 3.5% which would be a remarkably low interest rate in the current circumstances.  We do not have final confirmation of that.  </p> <p>  One reason for the summer-early autumn date is that it is unprecedented that the EIB would be involved.  It has never dealt in a loan system that is directly customer facing.  We have to tick all the boxes, dot all the i's and cross all the t's in the European mechanism.  It is on the edge of new, innovative financing.  I am confident it is going to work and will be hugely beneficial.  Even for people starting their work now, I am confident that it will be there in time for many who want to use it.</p> <p>  I agree about the potential use of smart metering as a mechanism.  As I mentioned in reply to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, pushing the time of day pricing and ensuring it is used is one way in which we can reduce our use of fossil fuels, allow households to save money by their management of energy use and benefit from the investment we have made in the smart metering programme.  That is the sort of measure we can look at.  The Government will probably look at two steps.  One is a more immediate response around the price issues we have now but beyond that the Department is looking at further ways by which we can accelerate or support energy efficiency measures.  That type of example may be one where we would work with the CRU, ESB Networks and others.  We can see if we can fast-track measures that we projected we would do in future and respond to this emergency crisis situation by advancing some of them now to help out householders.  I would not rule that out.</p> <p>  I would have to check the technical aspects but I think that the Corrib field is halfway through its lifetime.  It is the natural pressure from the field.  Corrib is not a very large gas field.  It was a fluke geologically.  It had a salt cap on it and it does not have any neighbouring fields.  It is a relatively simple pipeline connection into a processing centre.  My expectation is that the pressure from the field would drive the output.  It is not that easy to ramp up output and give us further supply. </p> <p>  We have other mechanisms.  Some of our power stations are adjacent to our oil stocks, which are often in the form of distillate that can be burned in power stations.  There would obviously have to be a connection.  Poolbeg is one example where we have a combined cycle gas plant adjacent to some of our strategic oil stocks.  That gives us some flexibility and capability.  In addition to the national reserve, the other power stations also retain some fuel.  We can change switch from gas to distillate and some of our oil reserves.</p> <p>  Even if we made a decision tomorrow on LNG and Shannon it would be a five- to ten-year delivery for anything and it would not address the immediate issue.  The wider strategic issue there is looking at what is advancing increasingly rapidly across European countries, which is the conversion of renewables particularly, offshore wind, through electrolysis for hydrogen.  I understand from the ESB is that it is very confident that any new power generation at Moneypoint, not as it now configured, or all new gas-fired power generation, will be hydrogen.</p><p>Those are some of the strategic questions we will have to look at.  However, that will not address the immediate crisis.  We have an immediate issue.  We are in a better position than most other European countries as we were only reliant on Russian gas for 2% to 4% of our gas supply.  We are more reliant on oil, at about 8% to 10%, and are now less reliant on coal.  The Moneypoint contract with Russia has concluded and further coal will come in from Colombia or other locations.  We are going to have to look at all those strategic matters but the more immediate issue is how we manage this and pushing efficiency and renewables as the immediate response to what is a fossil fuel induced crisis.  Dependence on fossil fuel is our core weakness at the centre of this crisis.</p></speech>

My first question follows on from Deputy O'Rourke's points about poverty-proofing and the use of departmental funds for the universal electricity rebate.  There have been talks about excise duty rates and a swing mechanism being put in place for that.  Has the Government had any discussions about VAT reductions?  Hitting the VAT and tax would have been a much more efficient way of doing it.  The premise behind the electricity rebate was that it was to be universal and quick but it could be six months before this measure actually hits people's bank balances or electricity accounts.  It certainly has not been quick and is not meeting people's needs now, whereas a reduction in VAT or excise would be an immediate reduction that people could feel.  It would also mean that the budget of the Department was not impacted by the measures.  As part of its toolbox for dealing with the fuel crisis, the EU has specified that VAT is one of the tools that should be used by governments.  Has the Government had any specific discussions with the EU on whether a penalty-free derogation could be applied, just because of the crisis we are in, when it comes to VAT measures?</p> <p>  On the swing mechanism that has been talked about for excise, what I have seen reported is that it will apply to the increase, so if there are any further increases in the price of fuel, the swing mechanism will come into play.  Does that mean the Government is essentially setting a cap at where we are at the moment?  Where we are at the moment is completely unacceptable and is putting huge pressure on families and businesses.  I am concerned that the Government thinks it is only the future increases that need to be dealt with through excise measures. </p> <p>  Regarding the one-stop shops and retrofitting, I understand that the portal is open and a number of applications have been made.  The last time I heard the Minister speak about this, he said the process should be complete this week.  Is that still on track?  When does he foresee the announcement of how many companies have registered under the one-stop shop process?  Will that be available shortly?</p> <p>  On just transition and ensuring we help the people who need it most, were there any conditions put onto companies registering as a one-stop shop?  Were there any conditions stating that they needed to be targeted in their approach?  As Deputy Bruton mentioned, that aggregate approach is the quickest and most efficient way, as someone could deal with all the houses in an estate in one go.  Is there a requirement on these companies to be targeted so they do not just pick the lowest-hanging fruit or the easiest and cheapest houses to retrofit?  It should be done on a socioeconomic basis or based on the age profile of the house.  Is there a requirement on these companies to provide a certain number of apprenticeships?  One of the problems we will face as this ramps up is the skills shortage and we need to address that.  If there was a requirement on these one-stop shops to provide a percentage of apprenticeships, that would be very positive.  Is that condition on them as well?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, it will be coming out with further revisions to the rule book and there are a variety of different mechanisms being used across Europe.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned some of the price caps.  Other mechanisms, such as revenues from the emissions trading system, ETS, and VAT, have been used.  There are a variety of different mechanisms, including excise duty.  We have not finalised any measures.  The Minister for Finance has a key role working within the European context and we will do further work in that regard.  I would not rule anything out.  Nothing is finalised.  There has been media commentary about a swing mechanism around excise duty, which has real advantages in terms of smoothing out and what happens if there is an excise cut and prices go up further.  However, there are difficulties around that legally so it may not be possible.  With regard to tax, we have to use legislation and make sure it is all legally correct.</p> <p>  While we are looking at additional measures, they will not protect fully from the scale of price increases.  We should be clear on that.  The increases are beyond compare.  If we did try to fully protect everything, that would have immediate effects on the other budgets the Exchequer has to fund, such as for education or social welfare.  We will have additional costs as a result of this crisis.  The &euro;500 million package, on top of what was done in the budget last October, was the right response.  We were not intending to do anything further until October but the war has changed that.  As I said, whatever mechanism is used will not be just on the tax side, on excise or VAT.  It will also have to be the mechanisms I was discussing with Deputy Bruton on the efficiency side as well.  If the State were to try to reverse all the global increases in coal, oil and gas prices, that would burst the budget.</p> <p>  With regard to the one-stop shop, aggregation and apprenticeships, we are on track.  I had a meeting with the officials yesterday and got an update on this.  We are on track to start announcing double figures in the next week.  My understanding is that the numbers already going through the process to get up and running in that timeframe are as we would expect.  We have a certain advantage in that we, and the SEAI in particular, have been working on this for 22 years.  The SEAI has been given very significant additional resources.  As well as the &euro;22 million the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science put in place for the green skills action programme in last year's budget, recognising those sorts of apprenticeships, we have a number of mechanisms in place.  The SEAI and the industry have built up expertise over 20 years of learning by doing, making mistakes and adjusting, so we are well placed to hit the ground running on this.  Not only has there been an incredible domestic response but we are hearing that the phones have been ringing off the hook at those apprenticeship schemes in recent weeks following that announcement.  That is encouraging.  We are well placed and will be able to deliver that sort of innovative use with the one-stop shop.  These companies will have to be good at getting the apprenticeships up and running and helping them find work but also targeting households and aggregating them. </p></speech>

With the remaining housing stock, we must get to every single house in the next three decades at the latest.  We must accelerate that.  It will not be targeted to the level of a particular company going to a particular house and another company going to different houses.

I will take the opportunity in the few minutes that remain to ask a few questions.  I apologise for perhaps straying from the Standing Orders and away from the Supplementary Estimate.  The energy crisis we have, and the cost of living challenge as a result of it, are inextricably linked with transport costs.  The Minister has two roles here as the Minister for energy and climate, and for transport.  It seems to me that in trying to address the cost-of-living challenge, we should look to the transport cost challenge people have.  If we are ambitious and radical to pursue aggressively modal shift in our cities in particular, and in rural areas if we can really ramp up the level of our bus services, these would seem a very realistic and effective way of addressing the cost-of-living challenges people have.  I expect that all across Europe these kinds of measures will be introduced and it would make sense we would do so in Ireland also.</p><p>My second question relates more to the Supplementary Estimate.  Maybe it is a question for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Will the Minister tell the committee anything about the windfall that has accrued to the State on the increase in energy prices?  Essentially, the &euro;200 rebate is the State paying back to people the extra tax it has received.  I accept this may be more of a question for the Minister of Finance, but the Minister, Deputy Ryan, might wish to comment.</p><p>My third question is around Europe's role in the more medium to long term.  The joint committee had some very interesting sessions this morning where we talked about the much bigger potential in Ireland to provide clean energy for our own needs and to contribute to Europe's needs.  There was a very interesting article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>by Dr. Hannah Daly, Dr. Diarmuid Torney,  Dr. Paul Deane, and Dr. Olexandr Balyk that really spoke to that.  It is a medium to long-term prospect, but with the energy and security crises on the other side of the Continent, we should be talking at the European level about accelerating as much as we can the opportunity Ireland has.  Perhaps the Minister will speak to those points.</p></speech>

One of the things we have been working on, and which we have agreed in the Cabinet subcommittee, is the establishment of new delivery task forces that would accelerate key areas for our climate ambitions, such as just transition, climate communications, and land use review, and in the three more immediately specific areas of the development of offshore renewables, the development of our domestic heating strategies, including what we are talking about today, and sustainable mobility.</p> <p>  The establishment of those teams, which are cross-cutting and bring officials from different Departments together, along with outside agencies and international expertise, means we recognise for the lifetime of this Government, which is the next three years, that we have an immediate delivery issue up to 2025.  We must accelerate key elements of what we need to do.  For example, in the offshore wind area we need to get phase 1 and phase 2. With phase 3, as the Chairman has said, we must give a clear direction to Europe that Ireland is the place to come for offshore wind.  Similarly, when it comes to retrofitting, we need to make sure we deliver on our ambitions for a scale of retrofitting, and we need to look particularly at district heating as well as retrofitting, including existing projects such as taking heat from the incinerators to heat some parts of the Dublin Bay area.  All of those projects will have a rapid three-year acceleration timetable, which these delivery task forces will monitor, manage, and oversee.</p> <p>  In sustainable mobility, while we will not be able to build the metro in the next three years, we have a good bit of the Cork metropolitan rail project done.  We can accelerate the active travel and BusConnects projects, especially in our five cities, and the Connecting Ireland rural bus transport system.  One of the delivery task forces is within the Department of Transport.  The leadership group there will look to see how we accelerate.  This is all the more important now given what is happening with the rising cost of fossil fuels and the energy security issues.  As it happens, today the Cabinet has just approved the decision on phase 1 for the BusConnects project for Dublin.  For example, we got a three-year timeline.  BusConnects was originally designed to take much longer, but there are some elements I hope we can accelerate to get the sustainable mobility shift the Chairman has spoken about.  The real project with my job in the two Departments for which I have responsibility and in working with others is delivering an accelerated programme of works in those areas.</p> <p>  On the energy prices question, the Chairman must ask that of the Minister for Finance.  I will be asking the Minister later this afternoon about what exactly is the windfall gain to the State.  To be honest, that is slightly false accounting in a way.  Yes, it does get State revenue, but we must remember Ireland is 90% dependent on imported fossil fuels for energy.  When the cost of energy goes up like that, the balance of payments situation for the State disimproves.  That money is going out of the country.</p> <p>  I will give a vivid example of that.  Prior to the immediate and recent invasion, Russia was getting in revenue from Europe in the region of &euro;350 million per day from exported gas, oil and coal.  An equivalent of this is that the United States of America has delivered a package of support to Ukraine of &euro;350 million, which is not insignificant, but that was a one-day receipt for the oil, gas and coal revenues for Russia.  Since the price escalation, that &euro;350 million figure is probably an historical figure and is now probably closer to &euro;1 billion per day, every day, day in, day out.</p> <p>  This is why in Europe there is an absolute clear determination.  I recently attended a meeting with EU energy ministers and an International Energy Agency meeting.  The real focus there is that we must stop that flow of money.  It will not be immediate sanctions on oil, gas or coal because this would further exacerbate our problem and put prices up.  The European Council will continue to look at that issue.  The underlying strategic imperative on divesting from fossil fuels has never been stronger.</p></speech>

The Minister's predecessor, Shane Ross, in one of his last acts as Minister introduced emergency legislation to facilitate the roll-out of active travel infrastructure in particular.  We are in a similar situation now.  Does the Minister, Deputy Ryan, believe there is merit in an emergency response?  Obviously, we will try to increase the level of active travel development in the next few years.  Ireland has an ambitious programme in that regard.  There is, however, an acute crisis now right now with regard to energy.</p><p>Facilitating active travel is certainly one of the solutions.  If we can develop active travel networks quickly using light infrastructure in all our towns and cities, we can make people far less dependent on driving and on expensive fossil fuels.</p></speech>

We need to act in education.  How will we deal with some of the people coming in?  I agree with the Chairman about sustainable mobility.  Where that worked during the Covid pandemic was through the local authorities.  This must be something that comes from the bottom up.  We need to be really flexible and fast but we cannot ignore local authorities bearing in mind their interest and knowledge of how we do that.  I agree that we should be looking at fast-tracking and accelerating, but it also needs to come from the bottom up.  I will have a meeting with representatives from Limerick City and County Council this Friday and that is the message I will give them.  I will ask them if they are up for it and what we could do if we were really thinking outside the box.  The benefit of that is not just in reducing usage of fossil fuels and taking on Mr. Putin at the pump, as it were; it is also helping us with a better environment and better climate, and making it a more attractive place for everyone to live.  It cannot be forced; it also needs to come from the bottom up.</p></speech>

There is concern that there is an issue with supply of transport fuel and home heating oil.  Is that the case?  I am hearing different things in different places.  It is important to hear what the Minister has to say about it.  I appreciate the difficult context we are in.  In the days, weeks and months ahead, how will the Minister ensure we avoid profiteering or hoarding of fuels?  Does he have plans to regulate the market to ensure fair distribution of fuels?  He indicated there would be specific Government measures in October but in light of recent events, decisions may need to be made in the near future.  When will they be made?</p></speech>

We have supplies to meet normal demand.  They are slightly nervous about that sort of profiteering or storing and that is why they have introduced some measures to discourage that, as reported in today's newspapers.  If everyone keeps their head and follows proper processes, we will have sufficient supply.  As I said, Russian oil represents only a small percentage of our imports and Russian gas represents a very small percentage.  Therefore, we are probably in a better security situation than others, but we will keep it under review.</p> <p>  What was the Deputy's second question?</p></speech>

He mentioned what was reported in the newspapers.  My second question related to the timeline for decisions from Government to mitigate the problem.</p></speech>

We will look at further measures but it cannot be a cure-all because the price rise is so large.  I will also be looking at a range of efficiency measures in the coming weeks to help people reduce their usage.  That will be the key one.</p> <p>  I should have mentioned that I was at a meeting of the International Energy Agency last week.  There was a call there for countries to contribute towards a release of emergency reserves.  We were happy to sign up to that as part of a solidarity response to what is happening in Ukraine.  I believe we will be releasing approximately 227,000 barrels of our strategic reserves as part of that united International Energy Agency effort.</p> <p>  We will need to continue to review and monitor this.  We will not be able to protect against all the impacts, but we will do everything we can to try to minimise then.  Government is reviewing this.  There is a meeting of Secretaries General every week.  Cabinet has a separate line item on the monitoring and managing of the crisis.  This is unprecedented and we will need to be flexible and keep an eye on every aspect of it.</p></speech>

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via MS Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.</p><p>Please note that, in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue wearing face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others.  We ask them to please be respectful of other people's physical space.  They are also asked to adhere to any public health advice.</p><p>I remind members that, should a vote be called, they must physically come to the committee room in order to vote.</p><p>Before we resume our consideration of the Bill, I advise the Minister and members that two supplementary amendments have been added in the name of Deputy Cairns.  These are amendments Nos. 352<i>a</i>and 359<i>a</i>and have been grouped with amendments Nos. 117 and 146 for discussion.</p><p>A revised grouping list was circulated to members by the Bills Office and hard copies are available from the secretariat.</p><p> To remind myself more than anyone else, but also anyone watching, we will move and discuss a group of amendments together.  The proposers will have time to discuss that, the Minister will respond, there will be a discussion at that point and a further chance for the Minister to respond, after which we will put the question.  At each point where there is a grouping of amendments, that is the opportunity to discuss all amendments in that grouping and all of them must be discussed at that point.  However, amendments will still be considered for voting one by one.  There may be an amendment that we are discussing that we do not get to vote on until later today or even the next session, depending on how we go.  If there are procedural issues, we can pause the meeting and go into private like we did previously.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 77 removes the ambiguity around language.  A person's medical information is the person's personal data and the person has a fundamental right under EU law to access that data, and not merely information contained in a record for which a person may apply.  GDPR law makes it clear that medical data should be released, not information contained in the data.</p><p>Amendment No. 167 seeks to amend the unacceptable constraint on affected people's access to personal data.  Items of this nature which were left with an adoption agency or an institution are highly unlikely to have been provided for anyone else's benefit.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 173 to 179, inclusive, are very similar to amendment No. 77.  They again remove ambiguity around language.</p><p>The last group, amendments Nos. 196, 219, 252 and 257, seeks to remove the restrictions on what medical data is shared.  Basically, we have proposed these amendments with regard to vital medical information being shared.  They are all very similar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#G00300"><p>I propose these amendments for the same reasons.  Amendment No. 77 is important.  It just shows the power of language and what is meant in this Bill.  The substitution of the word "records" for "information" is vital.  Information implies that whoever is the holder of the record can decide what is released, and that is the crux of the problem.  We are going to have a situation where that is going to have to be challenged and go through that whole process before it can be decided whether somebody has not released the full information.  That is wrong.  It should not be in this, particularly when we are dealing with a group of people who have had everything that the State has done against them to this point.  We should be making it easier for them now.  It shows the importance of language and of a simple word like that.  For that reason this amendment should be accepted.  I do not see that it would impact significantly on the legislation.  It would remove a lot of the burden of complying with the legislation as well, because rather than having to decide which information one does or does not want to release, the assumption is that one would release everything.  That is important.</p> <p>  In summary, the other amendments are the same.  They seek to change and put in words and I am happy to support them.  We will also be opposing a section at a later stage.  I cannot remember what number it is, but that will be included as well.</p></speech>

It is an important departure, providing proactive responses to the rights of adopted people.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#G00600"><p>I thank the Deputies for the amendments.  I will take amendments Nos. 77 and 173 to 178, inclusive, and speak to them first.  Then I will speak on the other amendments.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 77 and 173 to 178, inclusive, seek to replace the word "information" with the word "records" in respect of the provision of medical information.  The goal of the amendments appears to be to ensure that where a person applies to receive his or her medical information, he or she is assured that he or she will receive actual copies of the relevant documents where such records are available.  We cannot accept the text of the amendments as submitted here because of consistency grounds.  As they are here, they will remove the fundamental entitlement to medical information.  That is just the way they are drafted.  However, I am in full agreement with the spirit of the amendments.  The intention of this provision was always that an applicant's medical information and the records on which the person's medical information is held would be released directly to the applicant in full.  As such, I am happy to accept amendments Nos. 77 and 173 to 178, inclusive, in principle and I will table amendments on Report Stage to reflect what is provided for here.  This was an oversight in this section.  It should have provided for access to both the information and copies of the records on which this information is based.  It is because this section was originally combined with others and it has evolved over time, so I will bring forward amendments to reflect that on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It is very helpful to hear it.  These amendments were clearly put forward in the spirit of ensuring that adopted people would have access to full records, not to information about records.  What all of us who were engaged in the hearings during pre-legislative scrutiny heard from adopted persons and organisations representing adopted persons was the real hunger to have access, as should be their right, to the original records about their birth, not to any types of secondary sources for information about them.  I welcome the Minister's indication that he accepts the amendments in principle.  That is very helpful.  It will help to ensure the Bill is changed constructively to reflect more precisely not just the right to information about records but the right of access to records, which is what we all want to see enshrined in law.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 79, 80, 165, 166, 168 to 172, inclusive, 226 to 228, inclusive, 258 and 260 will be discussed together.</p><p>I move amendment No. 79:</p><blockquote>	In page 12, to delete lines 16 to 25. </blockquote><p>I will speak to amendment No. 80 at this stage.  Others may also wish to come in.  It provides for a broader definition for a &ldquo;provided item&rdquo;, moving beyond &quot;another person involved in the provision of care&quot; to &quot;another person connected to&quot;.  Amendment No. 226 removes a clause which could be interpreted as restrictive.  Amendment No. 227 again provides for a proactive measure to oblige the relevant body to locate the data controller for the items being sought.  This is about granting every mechanism to facilitate adopted people and other relevant people in accessing information.  Amendment No. 228 removes the restriction on adopted people being permitted access to specific items.  Amendment No. 260 is similar to No. 227 in that it facilitates persons in accessing information.</p></speech>

The Minister has refused amendments based on the likely unavailability of information or even the existence of such information.  This restriction falls into that category.  In this case, the provision of items is dependent on knowledge of the motivation behind the leaving of the item with the relevant bodies, which seems to be an unnecessary obstacle.  Amendment No. 260 is similar to No. 227 in facilitating persons' access to information.</p></speech>

The whole purpose behind this legislation is to provide adopted people with information.  We have discussed the various categories of information.  However, its purpose is also to provide them with provided items.  If anything was left for them by their family members, they should be entitled to it.  That is why we have drawn this broad definition.  It is not a random definition or something that was concocted quickly.  It has been worked on and thought about in the context of this legislation.  That is really important to state.  Every definition here has been thought about in a lot of detail to ensure it interacts properly with the rest of this legislation and also with other legislation.  Where we have recognised that the definitions we have do not square with everything, as was the case with the last amendment, we are happy to admit that and bring forward changes.  However, we do not believe that the changes Deputies have proposed here are appropriate.</p> <p>  As it currently stands, the definition sets out the different items that may be contained within records that must be released in all cases.  The types of items included in the definition are letters, photographs, mementoes or any other documents or objects.  The list provided in the legislation on page 12 is not exhaustive.  That is really important.  It also provides for the different types of people who may lodge a provided item.  This includes parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles and first cousins.  Both items placed on historic files and items provided through the contact preference register that will be established under this legislation are provided for.</p> <p>  I cannot support amendment No. 79.  As I have said, the definition of a "provided item" is central to ensuring clarity and consistency and guaranteeing the release of items and it provides an important mechanism through which historic items can be shared with the person to whom they relate and family members will be allowed to share contemporaneously provided items.</p> <p>  Again, I cannot support amendment No. 80.  The definition of a "provided item" was carefully considered in the drafting of the Bill and the list of persons who can deposit provided items was carefully considered in that drafting.  To make it clear, the ability to lodge a provided item with the authority under section 39(1) is not the only way in which a person can share information.  The robust statutory tracing service established under Part 8 of this legislation provides for information to be shared or requested while maintaining the level of contact a person is comfortable with.  It is important that the tracing service allows the person initiating the trace and the person on the other end of the trace to have the final say with regard to the degree of contact they want.</p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 165, 166, 168 to 172, inclusive, 226 to 228, inclusive, 258 and 260, I again cannot support the amendments.  In terms of the threshold for the release of information, it is important to note that, as it stands, the section does not stipulate the threshold of proof required to fulfil the criteria in respect of a specified item or provided item for the purposes of being made available to the relevant person.  I will be publishing policy guidelines in respect of that.  We discussed the issue of the provision of policy guidelines when we discussed similar amendments last week.  These guidelines will confirm the ability of the bodies to release provided items.  In the future, any provided items lodged under section 39(1) will fall under the criteria of specified items or items provided for the purpose of being made available to the same person and their release will not require any degree of discretion.</p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 168 and 172, while I understand the intention behind these amendments, it is important to note that the application process is important for a number of reasons, the most significant of these being that relevant persons have complete control over the categories of information they are seeking and wish to access.  That is important.  We want to maintain that process.  </p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 171, 227 and 260 seek to place an obligation on both the agency and the authority to seek out records that they do not hold without any certainty that they exist.  Again, the whole purpose behind this legislation is to require the authority or the agency to release all information it has.  It will not have a choice or discretion but must release that information.  These amendments ask the authority or agency to go looking for information that it does not have and that it does not even know exists.  We have spoken about division of resources and the need to allow these agencies to focus on the delivery of what will be, in the initial years, a significant amount of information.  To ask them to go looking for information when they do not know whether it exists is not a good use of the resources of either the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, or Tusla when large numbers of people are on waiting lists whose information is available and there to be released.  There is also the question of how we would ever know whether this obligation has been fulfilled.  How do you ever know if an agency has done all it can to find information that you do not know exists?  This provision is not workable and, as such, I cannot support it.</p></speech>

Again, this speaks to the concern that we touched on at the end of our discussion the last day, the sense among many adopted people that there was a culture of not releasing information.  When you look at the history in this area, there was definitely such a culture in the past.  As I stated the last day, we are doing two things to address that culture, beyond this legislation which clearly provides for a legal basis and legal obligation to release information.  One is the establishment of the implementation group, headed by my Department, which brings together Tusla, AAI and the Department to talk about the approach to be taken.</p><p>Officials from my Department have met those who will lead the implementation of this legislation and both agencies to talk about the change in culture.  I know Mr. Bernard Gloster has appeared before this committee and members have spoken to him.  It is very clear that he realises the need for a change in culture particularly in Tusla regarding its culture of release of information.  Beyond that there is also the publication of guidelines.  If a future Minister believes that the changing culture is not being manifest, those guidelines can be tightened and refined to ensure that we get full release of all information.</p></speech>

It is incorrect that any institution that was established or operated for the purposes of providing care to children in residence may be added to the Schedule because section 5 states that only the Minister may add to the Schedule.  This means a significant number of the 182 institutions, agencies and individuals involved in separating unmarried mothers from their children will still be exempt from the legislation.</p><p>Amendment No. 107 seeks to expand again to include any individual or organisation that operated in this State for the purposes of care to children.  Amendment No. 108 changes the connotation making it irrelevant whether the State had regulatory inspection function.  Amendment No. 357 again seeks to expand the remit of the Bill to provide a mechanism for adopted people and mothers to access the administrative records of institutions, agencies and individuals involved in forced family separation.  We know that this was widespread and the people affected by this practice often feel they have no right to ask for information.  It is therefore imperative that forced family separation is included in the Long Title of the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendments numbers 93 to 101, inclusive, expand the definition of secondary information source to include the very wide range of actors that we know were involved in the adoption process.  The current list does not make explicit reference to any persons or organisations involved in facilitating adoptions, the care of adopted people and family separation.  Given the realities of the adoption process, it is important for these amendments to be made to make specific reference to these persons as potential sources of information.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 96 to 101, inclusive, introduce reference to any Roman Catholic Church or Church of Ireland bodies or organisations as secondary information sources.  Obviously, given the scale of involvement of those bodies in the adoption process, it is crucial that they are explicitly referenced as secondary information sources.</p></speech>

It is vital to expand the list to include those.  This goes back to what we were saying on the last grouping of amendments about the need for people to be assured that the legislation will provide for all those bodies to be included.  This ties in with GDPR and the information available for people to request.  I fully support these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#K00050"><p>The context is on page 13 of the legislation where we have the definition of prescribed secondary sources. This definition includes a list of bodies that, on the enactment of the legislation, are immediately designated as secondary information sources.  These include the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the data controller of the Access to Institutional and Related Records archive, AIRR, the HSE, a registered adoption society, and an accredited body.  Importantly, the definition also allows a Minister to designate a secondary information source under section 43 (2).  The power of the Minister, that is me or any future Minister, to designate other groups as a secondary information source under this legislation is a key element.</p> <p>  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 93 to 101, and 107 and 108.  They seek to expand the list of secondary information sources within the legislation itself.  Again, I do not believe this is necessary because the power is already included under section 43(2), to designate other bodies, and any body so designated would be classified as a secondary information source.</p> <p>  Section 43(2) empowers a Minister to prescribe additional information sources.  The proposed addition of amendments Nos. 94 to 108 is unnecessary.  Importantly, it would also generate obligations on an unclear list of people.  It is unclear who would come within the definition of an organisation involved in the care of a relevant person.  That would appear to potentially engage every organisation that has provided a health or social care service at every stage of a person's life.  What is being proposed here is an absolutely vast array of coverage, which goes far beyond the focus of what this Bill is trying to achieve.  The list currently included in the published Bill was carefully considered through consultation with stakeholders and organisations that are currently operating in the area of adoption information release and tracing, or that hold specific sets of historical records.</p> <p>  Additionally, secondary information sources are relevant only in their obligation to safeguard relevant records under Part 7.  This is very important.  We are talking about the safeguarding element here.  The legislation already provides a catch-all requirement for any person or organisation in possession of a relevant record, to safeguard it and to inform the authority that it holds that relevant record under section 46.  There is already a catch-all provision there under section 46.</p> <p>  I intend to make regulations designating further relevant bodies and secondary information sources.  Private entities, church bodies and religious congregations can be so designated.  It is important in designing those regulations that they are carefully constructed to clearly and accurately identify the relevant holder of records.  For example, Tusla now holds many of the institutional records, which people may believe are in the possession of religious congregations.  As we are aware, a huge amount of the information that was held by the congregations, especially those who ran mother and baby home and county home institutions, has already been transferred over to Tusla.  At different dioceses or parish levels there may be baptismal records, which would be highly valuable for relevant persons.  Again, we are using the regulation power under the legislation to design it carefully so we can have regulations that target exactly the relevant record holders, so we can deliver records to people, rather than the extremely broad brush approach proposed here that brings far too much potential information far beyond what this legislation is designed to cover, and which causes real difficulties in the future.</p> <p>  I wish to be clear that there are mechanisms set out in the legislation, primarily the ability to designate a secondary information source under section 43(2), and separately, the ability of the catch-all subsection in section 46 to address issues of concern here.</p></speech>

There may be some confusion, and perhaps we could get clarity on this.  The Bill defines early life care information as the information gathered from birth up until the age of 18.  Section 2 (2) states that a person's early life care information only covers the period after the birth only until the time the child is adopted.  Perhaps we could get clarity on that.</p></speech>

It is included for accuracy and precision in the terms of drafting.  The reason I cannot accept the amendment is because it would delete the section entirely and offers no substitution or alternative for it.  In the case of an adopted person, this time period ends where they were adopted.  In the case of someone who was the subject of an illegal birth registration the period ends at the time their social parents took over responsibility for them.  </p><p> The legislation that we have here is primarily aimed at supporting relevant persons to exercise their right to identity through access to information relating to the origin of their birth and early life and for individuals affected, this can only be fully inserted and achieved through clear access via statutory pathway to the information that is on the historic files.  We know this information will guarantee that for the first time.  The amendment, however, seeks to remove this focus and instead extend the period until the relevant person is 18 years old.  It is important that this amendment will have no practical purpose because if a person is adopted at the age of 12 years there will be no further information held by adoption agencies about them because they will now be with their adopted parents.  Saying that there will be early life information about them and extending that up to the age of 18 years would not work in this situation.  There will only be early life and care information about them for the length of time that they are in an institution.  That ends at the time they are either adopted or, as we know in certain cases, the subject of an illegal birth registration.  That is why we do not feel that this is correct.  If this amendment is followed through, a lacuna will be left open for no valuable purpose.  </p></speech>

The definition of incorrect birth registration is purposely constructed so that a person who is the subject of an illegal birth registration will always come within the scope of the definition even after the correction to the birth register.  Therefore on the grounds of accuracy, the amendment simply removes the redundant words &quot;or has been&quot; to this reference to persons affected by an illegal birth registration.

If I leave and return, that is the reason.  I was afraid that we might get to this section after I had to leave so I am glad that I have the opportunity to speak because this is one of the key sections.  It is one of the key contentious issues.  If you took everything else away this might be best described as the red line.  It relates to the mandatory information session.  People feel very strongly that if a parent registers a no contact preference that they would then be asked to attend a meeting.  Regardless of whether it is with a social worker, in an in-person meeting, over Zoom or a phone call, people feel very strongly that they do not want it to take place.  It should not inhibit them getting access to their birth certificates and other information.  People feel that there is an attitude that the State knows best.  It is something that arose a lot at our committee hearings.  The committee did recommend the use of registered post and that has since been discussed in the D&aacute;il and so on.  I feel very strongly that it is an alternative we should look at putting in place.  This is one part of the Bill that I would not be able to accept at all.  We need to go back to the drawing board on the whole area of a mandatory information session.  It is not right or fair on individuals looking for their birth certificate.  There is a fear about what exactly will be said at these meetings.</p><p>From the State's point of view, I do not really understand why it would not be better to have a registered letter because it is there in black and white and nobody can say that something was said at a meeting that was not said.  It is a lot more straightforward.  I know there will be many arguments as to why that is not the case but I feel very strongly about it.  I know people are very upset about it and they wanted us to communicate the view that they do not want a mandatory information session in any way, shape or form regardless of whether it is just a phone call, which might not seem like a big deal to people but really is.  It is important that their rights and wishes are respected and that this is changed.  </p></speech>

It is quite telling that with the exception of Deputy Pringle, the only people here really speaking on the amendments are women and now we are all going to speak on International Women's Day so it is bad timing in terms of the schedule.  I think the Chairman and everybody else is really aware of the highly contested issue around mandatory information sessions that we heard time and time again throughout pre-legislative scrutiny.  People find it really insulting and upsetting and I do not think anyone understands why it is still there.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 145 concerns the information sessions for young people aged 16 to 18.  The same arguments against mandatory information sessions in general apply to them.  Amendment No. 208 relates to a reference in section 19 to the mandatory information session, which the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Counsel identified as a real barrier in accessing information.  It seeks to remove reference to the session.  We hashed all these arguments out in the D&aacute;il Chamber and in this committee and there is broad agreement around the mandatory information session.  I really hope it is reconsidered.  </p></speech>

It is amazing when you read it because all this information can be accessed from other sources anyway and people have been doing that.  To single out adopted people and tell them they must go through this process is completely wrong.  I would even have doubts about using a registered letter to them outlining the responsibilities or the fact that the information is there but I think this is really wrong, cannot be contemplated and should not be in this legislation.  These people must be the only people in the State singled out and treated differently regarding access to birth certificates, which is completely wrong.  I could be wrong but I would like to be proven wrong.</p></speech>

My amendments in this grouping are Nos. 119 to 122, inclusive; Nos. 123 to 126, inclusive; Nos. 132 to 137, inclusive; and No. 144.  I have other amendments in the next grouping as well, all of which relate to the mandatory information session, which as we have all heard and know, is the most contentious issue in the Bill as it currently stands.  We know the long history and that what is being proposed by the Minister and Department is an improvement on what went before in terms of conditions on access but nonetheless requiring a information session means that access remains conditional.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, all of us devised an alternative arrangement involving a registered post letter, which we believed would have answered the arguments made by the Minister and Department about some sort of communication and would have been infinitely preferable to requiring an information session.</p> <p>  There are two key points.  What happens if an adopted person refuses to engage or does not wish to engage in the information session?  I know the Minister talks about untrammelled access to information but the reality is that there is that condition that the records cannot be released unless the information session is engaged in and there does not seem to us to be any recourse to be had if a person does not wish to engage in that information session so it is a condition on access.  I cannot see how it could not be.  These amendments are designed to remove that condition on access.  Amendment No. 199 in the next group will replace it with a registered post provision similar to the recommendation in our report.  </p> <p>  The second point, which was made by Deputy Cairns, is that we took the view that registered post would also be a safer option from everyone's point of view because it sets out in writing any issues whereas the content of a phone call can be very problematic.  It can be very difficult for somebody in a vulnerable position to take a phone call and it can be very difficult to establish what was said in a phone call or have any clarity or record of what was said in a phone call.  To require mandatory information sessions and say it can be done by phone still amounts to a condition on access to the data, records and actual life information of the individual.  It also seems to be less safe and secure than the registered post option we suggested to meet the constitutional argument that was made by the Department to ensure there would be free right of access to information and birth records.  </p></speech>

This section is central to this legislation and is central to us being able to ensure that if this legislation is challenged, it will be found to be constitutional.  That is a very real risk.  Many of the difficulties adopted people face in this area are the result of a constitutional challenge about the release of information in the case of  I. O'T <i>v</i>. B.  I know there are many criticisms of the way in which it has interpreted by courts, successive Governments and State agencies but nevertheless that case has had a massive influence.  That was a situation where a parent challenged the release of information so we are not talking in the abstract here.  Because of the fraught history of adoption in this country, the secrecy around it and the need for secrecy that is still experienced by some adopted people and, in particular, some mothers, this is a fraught area so we must design legislation that is not at risk of being found to be unconstitutional.</p><p>We are trying to balance two sets of constitutional rights here.  Much of our discussion at this point has been about the right of the adopted person to their identity.  This is a right that successive Irish Governments and legislation have failed to vindicate.  We must say this upfront.  Adopted people have been failed when it comes to the vindication of their right to identity.  The right to identity is now recognised by the courts as an unenumerated right and a constitutional right and it is recognised under EU law as well.  With this legislation, we are seeking to vindicate that right.  However, there is another set of rights holders in many of these cases.  This involves a parent seeking to exercise their right to privacy.  Again, it is important for us to realise that we cannot make any value judgments about the decision of a parent to exercise that right.  If a parent wishes to remain anonymous from a child they gave up for adoption, that is their right and that is an exercise of their right to privacy.  We may think it is terrible that they must feel that need, and it is something I personally feel, but it is not my decision to make.  It is their exercise of their privacy right, which is a constitutional right.  It is important that we balance constitutional rights in this situation.  </p><p>One of the amendments here proposes to delete this section in its entirety - this balancing section set out by the information session.  I very much wish to put on the record that if this section is deleted in its entirety, this Bill will be constitutionally flawed because there will be no recognition of privacy rights and this will be easily struck down by any future court.  </p><p>In terms of how the balancing mechanism we are bringing forward in this legislation works, an adopted person seeks access to their information.  The agency looks at the contact preference register.  Where a preference accepting contact is put on the contract preference register or there is no entry in the register, all information is immediately provided to the adopted person.  Nothing more needs to happen.  All information is released through whatever mechanism the adopted person wants.  If they want it sent to them in written or photocopied form, that is fine.  If they want it in an email, that is fine.  If the agency finds that there is a no-contact preference, which is something a parent will have proactively do following the introduction of the three-month public information campaign that will follow the passing of this legislation, and the parent has decided they want it registered that they do not want contact, the agency will call the adopted person or undertake an online or in-person meeting.</p><p>It is important to remember that it can be by way of a telephone call as well.  In that telephone call, three elements will be discussed.  First, the designated person, who no longer has to be a social worker because we took on board people's concerns about a social worker, will inform the adopted or boarded-out person of the entitlement of the relevant person to obtain his or her birth certificate and birth information related to him to her, as the case may, in accordance with this Act.  Second, &quot;that the parent concerned has stated, in accordance with this Act, that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person&quot;.  The third element is the &quot;importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights of the parent and the preference of the parent referred to in <i>paragraph (b)</i>&quot;.  That is the content of the telephone call as set down clearly in legislation.  I have heard the concerns that adopted people have expressed about the content of that telephone call.  I propose to bring forward an amendment to section 17(2)(c), which we will have an opportunity to discuss later on.  <br/><br/>That is the process.  After the telephone call has taken place and those three points have been conveyed to the relevant person - the adopted person - the full information is provided for.  We are going from a situation where a statement by a parent that he or she wanted to exercise his or her privacy rights meant an adopted person got nothing to one where, when a parent exercises his or her privacy rights, the above mentioned elements are conveyed to the adopted person by way of telephone call and the adopted person gets everything.  That is the scale of the change we are talking about here.  It is important to understand the scale of that change because that is a huge limitation on the privacy rights of the parent.  The balance has entirely shifted from one that favoured the privacy rights of the parent in almost every situation, and led to adopted people being so restricted for so long, to a situation where the privacy rights of the parent are restricted.  Parents cannot now keep their names from the adopted person in any situation.  All they can do is, through this process, have their no-contact preference conveyed to the adopted person.  It cannot be enforced.  In previous drafts, the adopted person was asked to sign a statutory undertaking, which later changed to a non-statutory undertaking.  In one of the earlier drafts, there was a criminal prohibition on the adopted person contacting the parent.  All of that is removed.  All that has to take place now is this meeting.  <br/><br/>Why have we chosen the idea of an information session?  It is important to reference that this is not something that came from my Department.  Rather, it this is something that has been discussed as a means of balancing those sets of rights.  I will refer to a couple of documents from outside of my Department.  In their analysis of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 introduced by former Minister, Katherine Zappone, a group of academics brought forward an opinion on the Irish Constitution and EU general data protection regulations.  The academics are people well known to us, including Dr. Conor O'Mahony, Dr. Fred Logue, Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, Dr. James Gallen, Dr. Eoin Daly, Mair&eacute;ad Enright, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Ring, Rossa McMahon and Dr. Laura Cahillane.  They did a detailed analysis on the previous legislation.  It is a lengthy piece, with which, I am sure, members are familiar, but I would like to cite paragraph 30.  It states:</p><blockquote>	Thus, in order for legislation in the area of adoption information and tracing to be deemed unconstitutional, it must be shown that the law is arbitrary and lacks an objective basis.  It is on this basis that we submit that the Constitution does permit the Oireachtas to legislate in the manner proposed by several Senators earlier this year: providing automatic access to identifying information for people who were adopted in the past following an information session, and accompanied by a fully resourced voluntary National Adoption Contact Preference Register and voluntary tracing service. </blockquote><p>Again, the concept of the information meeting is set out in that detailed piece.  I refer also to the draft Bill, namely, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2019, that was put forward by the Adoption Rights Alliance in 2019, which was an effort by that organisation, which has been very active in this area, to seek to balance the conflicting rights, the privacy right of a parent with the right to identity of an adopted person.  I will set out sections 25(1) to 25(3), inclusive, of that draft Bill:</p><blockquote>	(1) An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir shall on an application made in the prescribed manner by an adopted person, a record of whose birth is kept by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and who has reached the age of 18 years supply to that person on payment of the prescribed fee (if any) such information as is necessary to enable that person to obtain a certified copy of the record of his/her birth. <br /><br />(2) It shall be the duty of the Independent Information Service to provide an information session to the adopted person, the format of which shall be prescribed in consultation with the Adoption Advisory Group.  The information session shall serve the following purposes:   	(a) To inform the adopted person about the records held by the Independent Information Service about them; <br /><br />(b) To provide the adopted person with information on how to read and understand adoption records;<br /><br />(c) To inform the adopted person of the existence of the tracing service provided by the Agency;<br /><br />(d) To inform the adopted person of the existence of the National Adoption Contact Preference Register.  (3) An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir shall not supply a person who was adopted before the date on which this Act was passed with any information under subsections (1) and (2) of this section unless that person has attended an information session as prescribed under subsection (3) of this section. </blockquote><p>It is important to make the point that in terms of this effort to address issues with the previous legislation - I regret Deputy Bacik is leaving because I am about to cite her - Deputy Bacik stated:</p><blockquote>	the Minister could make provision for an option, such as that provided for in Averil Power's Bill, that those who do not wish to sign an undertaking could have an alternative option, such as a meeting a social worker or counsellor, as provided for.  Provision of such a meeting would have to ensure that it would not become unduly burdensome on those seeking to avail of the option, but this is a simple and practical way to get around this difficulty. </blockquote><p>Two years later, Deputy Bacik and colleagues brought forward an information session almost identical to the information session provided for in this legislation.  It is important to put that on record because there is a sense out there that this is some crude mechanism that is being introduced to inflict further injury and insult on adopted people when it is a mechanism that has been suggested by a range of highly knowledgeable sources to address that really difficulty and tricky situation we are grasping with, namely, how to reconcile those two sets of privacy rights.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#N00200"><p>If I may, I would like to come in on that point before I have to leave to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It is a case of unfortunate timing.  The Minister is quoting back to me, as I had anticipated.  I have been measured in my comments.  I acknowledge that this is a far preferable option that the Minister is presenting us with as a means of balancing rights.  A few years ago, when we proposed the information session as an alternative to the signing of the statutory declaration and so on, that would have been preferable but things have moved on.  Just as incremental change becomes embedded and then more radical change is necessary, so too with the journey of this legislation, if I might put it that way.  It started out with a whole series of different conditions being placed on access to records.  </p><p>At the point I put forward the information session, I was working very closely with the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, to try to achieve a compromise in order that we could get the legislation through.  That was the intent.  That was everyone's desire at the time, most of all adopted persons.  We did work on different methods of doing that but at the time, the information session was opposed by the Attorney General as being unduly protective of the privacy rights of the birth mother.  The reality is we could not get that passed.  Clearly, things have shifted at the Attorney General's Office, but so too have they shifted in terms of our understanding of the rights of identity or of privacy rights.  The I.O'T <i>v. </i>B.case is now even more dated.  There is no specific right of privacy in the Constitution.  We are still relying on that interpretation in I.O'T <i>v. </i>B. and, clearly, the Attorney General's view has changed over the years.  It is fair to say that in terms of what would have been acceptable and preferable some years ago, the understanding has moved on.  That is the spirit in which I offered these amendments.  It is the spirit of our consensus in the pre-legislative scrutiny in terms of the registered post option put forward in the report.  I hope to return to the meeting.</p></speech>

We had that conversation around the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and law.  There is a recognition now that GDPR applies here, therefore, people have a right to this information.  Saying there is a constitutional barrier is ridiculous.  There is no constitutional barrier to people accessing their information.  It is also acting like this Bill is doing them some kind of favour.  Ultimately, it is worth questioning whether we even need this Bill and legislation.  If we just acknowledged people's rights to their information, we would not be sitting here having long debates about these things.</p><p> The other false narrative that is continuously spun, to the point where even Opposition Deputies are saying the same lines, is that we must balance the right of the parent to his or her privacy with the right of the adopted person's right to information.  That is not based on any kind of reality.  What we heard at committee during pre-legislative scrutiny was that more people are registering a no-contact preference who are the adopted people, and not the parents.  There is this constant narrative that what the Government and this legislation is doing is trying to protect the parents who have a right to privacy.  Where has that come from?  We hear these constant lines that are based on no reality, as far as I can tell.  After what was a long process of pre-legislative scrutiny with different representative organisations and people appearing before the committee, of course, we had loads of personal engagement with individuals who have been affected by this.  The narrative creates this feeling of trying to protect parents from their children.  It is unnecessary and untrue.</p><p> Finally, the Minister made a point at the end of his contribution about section 30.  He referenced people like Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Dr. Fred Logue and suggested that an information session is a must-have.  That is really the opposite of what we heard from experts.  He said it has been recommended by many reputable sources.  We heard it refuted by many reputable sources at committee that we do not need that mandatory information session.  That seems to me like cherry-picking information to argue for something that is unnecessary and which people have highlighted repeatedly.  It is insulting for them.  As Deputy Bacik said, the suggestion, which the Minister cited, came from years ago when people were still trying to get this legislation moving.</p><p> We have come a long way from there, and not only we in the Oireachtas but the whole country, in terms of saying enough of these different barriers and things being put in place, and these kinds of narratives around people's situations.  It is not necessary and often also not true.  The Minister has done much work in this area since he took office.  If there is one thing he could change in this legislation, this seems to be the thing that means so much to people.  Will he please consider it?  I do not think we have to stick to it.  That is what we heard from many experts in this area at pre-legislative scrutiny.  I am pleading with the Minister to reconsider this provision</p></speech>

Deputy Bacik asked a question earlier, which I do not think was answered.  What happens if somebody cannot take part in this information session for either mental, physical or personal reasons?  He or she will lose his or her right to this identity again.  That is the point I wanted to make.  I call on the Minister to reconsider this again.</p></speech>

With regard to GDPR, was that in place at the time this was going through the Seanad?  The GDPR obviously has an impact on this, which supersedes the court case to which the Minister referred.  It is a right for people to access their personal information.  That must have a bearing on the Supreme Court case as well.  That should be taken into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#O00400"><p>In response to the question by Deputies Bacik and Ward, if somebody chooses not to participate in the processes set out in the legislation, he or she continues to have the right to submit an essay or application under GDPR, as anybody has.  That right remains with them but the right of access to information under GDPR is not absolute in the same way it will be under this legislation.  A balancing test under Article 15(4) of GDPR still applies.  We are providing for the absolute right to access information in all situations in this legislation.  To address Deputy Cairns' question, that is why we are having this legislation.  We are taking away that discretion of the data controller to refuse somebody access to his or her information.  That is why this legislation is necessary.</p> <p>  It is really important that we address the argument in terms of what Deputy Cairns said, which is that this desire to protect the constitutional rights of parents is not based in reality.  It is based in reality.  Right now, we have a national adoption contact preference register.  Approximately 4,500 parents whose children were adopted have signed on to that and the vast majority of them are seeking contact with their children.  Only 1% or 99 people have signed a no-contact preference on the existing national adoption contact preference register.  I take the number of parents who do not want contact with their children from that and that is not all; that is a portion of people who have signed this.  It is tiny.  They are still rights holders, however.  Each of those 99 people still have a right to exercise their constitutional right to privacy.  If they decide that they do not want contact with the child they gave up for adoption, that is their right.</p> <p>  Deputy Cairns asked where this came from.  She said many different groups came in and spoke before the committee.  Absolutely, and I have spoken with them too.  However, these women do not want to be known.  They are not going to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee for whatever reason because that identifies them.  Again, it comes back to the history of adoption in this country and the secrecy that surrounds it.  These women continue to exist in secret.  We must remember that the information session will only apply where a parent has signed a no-contact preference.  Based on what we are seeing from the existing national adoption contact preference register, it will only be a tiny proportion of the overall number of applications under this legislation where an information session is required.  In those situations, however, it is an exercise of a constitutional right.  It is the exercise of an individual who has proactively decided that he or she wants to provide some protection of his or her anonymity.  The fact is that they do not come into the Oireachtas joint committee or form advocacy groups.  We cannot let their desire and need for secrecy eliminate them from this conversation.  They do exist.  Their existence is demonstrated by the existing no-contact preference register.  I have received letters from women who have set out their concerns to me as parents.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  We are trying to achieve a recognition of their constitutional right to privacy but doing so in such a way that in every situation, the adopted person gets full access to his or her information.</p></speech>

We heard at committee that there are more adopted people who want to exercise their right to privacy rather than their right to information than there are parents.  All we hear from the Government, and now again from the Minister, is the parent's right to privacy.  There are more children, many of whom are now adults, obviously, who want to exercise that right.  Nobody has an objection to people exercising their right to privacy.  That is not what I am getting at.  I am talking about the weight the Minister is putting on that versus all the other rights we are dealing with in this committee.</p><p>We are talking about 1% of relatives.  How is so much of the focus on this when we are also dealing with all of the other rights that have been disregarded for decades?

I am just saying the narrative is unnecessary.  The Minister saying he is trying to protect the privacy rights of the parents.  What about the privacy rights of adopted people?

The relevant person will be kept informed and will be consulted throughout the course of the investigation.&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 117 and 146.  These amendments are linked.  Amendment No. 117 inserts a new provision to the effect that where there is no entry present in the register of births, the authority has the power to seize all records relating to the relevant person's adoption and open an investigation.  We believe it is important to ensure that any anomalies in a person's records are properly investigated.  </p></speech>

These amendments would insert a clause into sections 6 and 10.  The amendments require that where no information is available, upon application by an affected person, the authority must seize all records and conduct an investigation into what transpired.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept these amendments.  Under section 63 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, a person can apply to the register to correct a record and under section 65 of the same Act, the Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheoir is empowered to conduct an inquiry to correct registration of a life event.  What is being provided for here does not need to be undertaken, especially on a mandatory basis, where a person may not wish for further investigation.  An adopted person subject to an illegal birth registration may not wish for such an investigation.  A person who was the subject of an illegal birth registration may not wish their parents - the people they have seen as their parents all their lives - to be subject to an investigation, which would be mandatory under this provision.  It is completely out of the ordinary when compared to what we have been looking at - the idea of a mandatory investigation without any understanding of its size and scope, what it would do and what its consequences would be.  I cannot support this amendment.</p></speech>

I do not think the relevant body should specify the information concerned or how it is conveyed.  I am recommending that is removed and that the information should be provided.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Pringle, the line that amendment No. 127 seeks to delete gives the body to which these applications will be made the ability to construct the form through which the applications will be made.  If that body will not set the application form, I do not know who will.  As this amendment seeks to take out the most basic of administrative elements, I oppose amendment No. 127.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, concern the requirement for a person to provide explicit consent to the use of their information when applying for birth information.  The manner in which the original draft of the legislation provided for the use of consent, as was flagged by some advocacy groups, was not fully in compliance with the proper reading of the GDPR.  Amendments Nos. 114 to 116, inclusive, which have already been agreed to, also dealt with that issue.  Amendment No. 130 deletes section 9(2)(c), which requires that the application is accompanied by the applicant's written consent to process his or her contact details.  We are removing that because it would not be fully compliant with GDPR.  That is just a piece of housekeeping but it is important nevertheless to ensure the legislation is compatible with GDPR.</p></speech>

It is to give effect to the recommendation we made in the pre-legislative scrutiny report to replace the mandatory information session with a requirement that the authority sends a registered post, or other recorded delivery, letter to applicants setting out the relevant information.  I apologise because I had to leave in the middle of the debate earlier to go to statements in the D&aacute;il.  It was terrible timing.  I am sorry I did not hear the full response the Minister gave.</p> <p>  Without labouring the point, as I said we have gone through many different iterations with this legislation as we all know.  There have been many different attempts to achieve the balance between constitutional rights of identity and information versus the right to privacy.  As I said earlier, things have moved on.  The advice of the Attorney General has changed over the years in successive iterations of the Bill.  We are at a point where a mandatory information session should no longer be required as a condition of access to identity information, even if that mandatory information session is in much preferable format now to what it was and even if it may be carried out by phone and not by a social worker and all of the welcome improvements that have been made.</p> <p>  The committee, having heard the evidence and having heard from stakeholders, still believed there was a preferable means of achieving the balancing of rights and that this was through a prepaid registered post mechanism.  It is an acknowledgement there is some need to balance rights.  It is also an acknowledgement that the understanding of privacy and identity and conflicting rights has moved on since we last debated this type of Bill.  We should be able to move beyond a mandatory information session in any form.  I have tried in one amendment to set out as best I can a way of delivering on the recommendation we made.  I know we have had the debate already but I believe this would be preferable to the current mandatory information session.</p></speech>

I have set forward the reasons I believe, and more importantly why others believe, the information session and the provision of the conveying of the preference of the parent to the adopted person is the best way to go.  We discussed with the Attorney General and counsel the option of a letter.  It is not that we did not consider it.  The issue has been considered.  There are practical issues with a registered letter, particularly in the context of the amendment tabled by Deputy Bacik that everything would then have to be done by post.  The issuing of information would have to be done by post because it would have to contain the registered letter and the bundle of information.  Plenty of people want their information via email.  This means two sets of information would have to be sent out.  There are practical issues for data controllers in all of this.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that the balancing mechanism has gone through various iterations.  Each iteration has brought the balance more in favour of the adopted persons and their right to identity but at the same time has lessened the privacy rights of the parent.</p><p>If that balance continues to move over, there comes a point where the privacy right will no longer be recognised by a court as a proper defence in terms of proportionality.  I hope we both agree on that.  In term of what is essential here, the no-contact preference is the final protection of the privacy right and that must be conveyed to the adopted person.  Is the best way to convey that a registered letter, where we will never know if the person actually read it or saw the line about the no-contact preference?  If there is a phone call, a physical meeting or an online meeting, we know the preference has been conveyed.  I am making changes and I will speak to them in a moment but that is the core element of what is necessary to ensure the right to privacy is sufficiently present and balanced in all of this.  When a no-contact preference is stated by a parent, it must be directly conveyed to the adopted person.  That is not the case with a registered letter.  While we considered the registered letter, we believe direct conveyance of the no-contact preference is the correct way to go. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#S00200"><p>We are agreed that there have been lots of variations of this and that the understanding of how best to balance rights has changed and developed.  The problem remains that the mandatory information session strikes many adopted persons as an unduly paternalistic approach.  It is still balanced too much on that side.  It harks back to when the view was taken that we could not give people access to information and there had to be conditions.  It is still a condition on access.  In a previous debate on this, Professor Conor O'Mahony talked about privacy rights trumping identity rights.  It still seems like that is what is happening with the mandatory information session.  We must trust people.  We trust people who receive a court summons by registered post.  There is a point where you have to trust people.  The Minister raised a couple of practical issues around email or registered post.  Those are very easily surmountable because the provision I have set out simply states that the statement of information will go by registered post.  All the other information can go by email or any other means.  It is very easy to get around that problem.  We have other protections for privacy rights.  We have the age limit and the contact preference register.  We have built into this statutory framework other protections and recognitions of that right.</p> <p>  I will come back to the two practical points I have raised, which also go to the kernel of the issue about an information session.  First, what if an adopted person does not wish to take the call?  Will they simply not have access to their identity information?  It is a condition on their access and it is not possible to see it any other way.  Granted, it is a much reduced condition compared to what was in previous versions of the Bill.  Second, what happens if there is a dispute or disagreement over what was said in the phone call?  A written statement setting out information, however it is delivered, is far clearer evidence that that information was delivered.  I am concerned that issues could arise around the manner in which information is conveyed in that phone call and the lack of any evidentiary back-up for it.  Those are two issues we discussed in the committee and it was one of the reasons all its members, including Government representatives, agreed on that recommendation.  That is what I am trying to give effect to in amendment No. 199.  I would love to hear the Minister's response to the point that it is this a condition, albeit a more minimal one, and as to what would happen if there were some disagreement over the phone call. </p></speech>

I fundamentally disagree with the mandatory information session.  Even setting it aside from the point of view of principles and what is right, from a practical point of view for the State, having this meeting in preference to a physical letter opens up a whole can of "he said, she said".  We all know the idea of registered post is that if somebody signs for it, he or she has received it and if that person does not, it gets sent back.  I do not think there is a responsibility on the State to ensure the person has taken in that information.  Someone could go to a meeting and put his or her hands over his or her ears and not take in what has been said.  If something is sent in a letter and somebody signs for it to say he or she has received it, surely the State's obligation in relation to privacy is fulfilled.  No matter what way it is said, anything else will always be interpreted by people who are adopted as the State being distrustful and saying it knows best.  It is very difficult for anyone to understand it in any other way.  I feel very strongly on this.  Deputy Bacik made a lot of good points and I support what she said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#S00400"><p>We do trust people.  We trust adopted people.  That is why they are being provided access to all information.  Nothing is held back any more.  We trust them with the name of their mother, and of their father if it is on record, and the names of all their relatives.  In the past they were not trusted with that.  We trust them and this legislation provides access to that information.  They do not have to sign anything.  There is no criminal prohibition if, having heard the no-contact preference, they decide to ignore it.  There is no consequence set out in this legislation.  I do not believe they will do that but there is nothing there to prevent it because we trust people.  It is right that we are discussing the sense, belief and understanding of the adopted person.  However, we have to recognise there is a set of people - it is a very small set but they are there - and mothers who desperately want to maintain their secrecy.  They exist.  We have to understand that, through this legislation, we will be revealing their names to their children and for a small set of people, primarily women, that will be deeply distressing.  We need to recognise that we are dramatically limiting their privacy rights.  The question is how we ensure that their privacy rights, though limited, are still somehow present in this process.  The State has a responsibility here because, inasmuch as we have a responsibility to provide access to the right to identity, which we are doing under this legislation, an Irish person's privacy right is a constitutional one and the State has to protect that as well.  We have an obligation on both sides to protect rights and we are balancing those two sets of rights.  That is difficult but we believe this is the best way to do that.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised concerns about disagreements about what is said and the information.  There is not information in the call.  What the call will involve is the list of points set out in section 17(2).  That is what the call is, and nothing more.  The information will be conveyed separately, either by post or email, after the information session has taken place.  There does not need to be any dispute there because all the designated person is conveying to the relevant person are the points set out in section 17(2).  That will be the end of it.  The information session will then completed and the adopted person will get full access to all information.</p> <p>  Deputy Bacik also asked about what would happen if an adopted person decided they did not wish to engage with this process.  That is a right.  As I said earlier when the Deputy was not in the room, adopted persons continue to have their rights under the GDPR and can make an application for information under Article 15.  However, the issue there is that Article 15.4 still applies and the balancing that has to be undertaken under the GDPR will still apply.  What is so important about this legislation is that the balancing does not apply.  The adopted person gets full access to all information in all circumstances. </p></speech>

I will bring forward these amendments to change the text in respect of the information session.  Currently, the three points of which the designated official will inform the adopted person in the information session are:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) the entitlement of the relevant person to obtain, in accordance with this Act, his or her birth certificate, or birth information relating to him or her, as the case may be, <br /><br />(b) the fact that the parent concerned has stated, in accordance with this Act, that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person, and <br /><br />(c) the importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights of the parent and the preference of the parent referred to in <i>paragraph (b)</i>.  </blockquote> <p>Having listened to contributions from groups during the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, process, I understand that section 17(2)(c), in particular, and the fact that in an information session an adopted person will be told of the importance of respecting privacy rights was felt to be condescending and that the adopted person was being spoken down to.  I hear that and we have sought to change it.  In what we are bringing forward now, section 17(2)(a) remains the same, but we will delete section 17(2)(b) and section 17(2)(c).  Instead of those, we will put in:</p> <blockquote> 	(b) the fact that&mdash;   	(i) the parent concerned has exercised his or her entitlement under <i>section 38(11) </i>to state that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person, and <br /><br />(ii) the making of that statement by the parent constitutes an exercise by him or her of his or her right to privacy.  </blockquote> <p>There is now no language proposed and the information session will not contain any language where the adopted person is told about the importance of respecting the parent's privacy rights.  It is a further dilution of the information session.  However, I can understand there was a concern that it was seen as paternalistic, particularly in the context of the designated person speaking to an adopted person.  We have sought to improve and address that by the changes brought forward, recognising the importance that the information session has for so many people.</p></speech>

He is here to listen to the witnesses and the members.  He said he was coming to listen to the Chairman but I am not sure about that.  He is very welcome.  It is very important we have people from secondary school who come to Leinster House on work experience.</p> <p>  I welcome from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, Mr. Martin Marjoram, president; from the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, Ms Clare Austick, president; from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, education sector group, Mr. Karl Byrne, chairman; from the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, Mr. Frank Jones, general secretary; from the Irish Research Staff Association, Dr. Andrew P. Allen,  chairman; and from F&oacute;rsa, Ms Stella Griffin, assistant general secretary with responsibility for higher education.  Mr. Byrne will make an opening statement on behalf of the ICTU education sector group, followed by the other union representatives.  Ms Griffin will take part in the questions-and-answers session.</p> <p>  The witnesses are here today to discuss the further funding of higher education.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Marjoram to make a brief opening statement, followed by Ms Austick, Mr. Byrne, Mr. Jones and Dr. Allen.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee and there will be an eight-minute slot for each member's questions and the witnesses' replies.  As participants are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements to the Oireachtas website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I also remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.</p><p>If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be requested by the Chair to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that they comply with such a direction from the Chair.</p><p> Unfortunately, we have apologies from a number of Senators, for various reasons.

The issue of funding of higher education has been a complex one for many years but has come to the fore especially since cutbacks of the last decade, combined with rapidly rising student numbers, and the publication in 2016 of Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education, which hereafter will be referred to as the Cassells report.<br/><br/>It is important to note that in 2021, Ireland only spent 0.9% of GDP on tertiary education, compared to 1.4% in the OECD.  The ratio of students to teachers in Irish tertiary education is also significantly above both the OECD and EU averages, and has risen dramatically from already unsustainable levels in the past year.  The funding deficit, even aside from anything to do with Covid-19, will get worse in coming years as, mentioned in earlier hearings of the committee, student numbers are expected to rise by almost 30,000 in tertiary education in this decade.  Even without an increase in student numbers over the next decade, the third level budget is 40%, approximately &euro;100 million, off where we were ten years ago, according to <i>The Irish Times</i>in January 2020.  The Cassells report made clear that &euro;600 million was needed by 2021.  However, we are now in 2022 and little has changed.<br/><br/>The European University Association, EUA, has reported that public funding of third level education in Ireland, as a percentage of GDP, fell a shocking 62% between 2009 and 2019.  In the same timeframe, student numbers rose by 28% and staff numbers fell by 8%.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has found that between 2007 and 2016, real expenditure per student at third level education decreased by more than 34% in nine years.<br/><br/>The TUI believes that third level education, as part of the social contract, should be funded from Government revenues; that is, from taxation.  Whence that taxation comes is then the issue.  For its part, TUI has made the serious proposal that a 1% levy should be applied to corporation profits to generate a dedicated fund for higher education.  Why, we may be asked, should corporate profits be levied in this manner?  For the very simple reason that to do so is fair and provides those corporations with an opportunity clearly to demonstrate what they claim to have, but what is little in evidence, which is commitment to the society in which they base their enterprise.  These corporations benefit hugely from having available to them a very deep pool of graduate talent in this country &ndash; supplied courtesy of the Irish taxpayer.  In 2015 for example, the levy we suggest would have yielded some &euro;550 million, an investment that would have done very nicely indeed in terms of resuscitating the exhausted and gaunt figure that is the Irish third level education system.  Investment in the further education and training sector also needs to be addressed.  Priorities in the programme for Government can only be adequately addressed if accompanied by additional funding.  Areas such as Youthreach, adult literacy, post-leaving certificate programmes etc. have for too long been a Cinderella of the system.  The committee has acknowledged the need for additional funding of the further education and training sector in its hearings of 1 March.<br/><br/>It is important that all institutes of technology have the opportunity to become technological universities if that is the wish of the community concerned.  It is imperative that the two remaining institutes of technology, the Institute of Art, Design and Technology and Dundalk Institute of Technology, are expedited into the technological university sector.  TUI members in both institutes have communicated to management, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, their wish to move towards technological university designation.  This position is supported by the TUI nationally.  Dundalk Institute of Technology is currently being assisted by the HEA in this regard.<br/><br/>The HEA has found that 15% of graduates from institutes of technology attended schools participating in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, compared to just 8% of university graduates, and that 7% of institute of technology graduates attended fee paying schools compared to 13% of university graduates.  According to Richard Thorn, the institutes of technology have 22% of their students registered as flexible learners - part-time, distance and e-learning - compared to 17% for the universities.  The distinction comes in terms of socioeconomic class, in that 31% of students in the institutes come from the non-manual, semi-skilled or unskilled groups compared to 21% in the universities.<br/><br/>The TUI would like to make several recommendations to the committee.  The size of SUSI grants and eligibility criteria for same should be significantly expanded.  The TUI welcomes the current ongoing review of SUSI.  Exchequer funding of higher education must be dramatically increased.  This could be partly funded by a one percentage point increase in corporation tax with the proceeds ring-fenced for funding higher education.  Staff-student ratios need to be reduced urgently.  Apprenticeships should have greater support and visibility.  Funding models must take account of the unique role the institutes of technology-technological universities sector plays in higher education access.  Greater recognition of, and visibility of, the further education sector is vital due to the essential role it plays in supporting under-represented groups to access levels 5 and 6 of the national framework of qualifications, and also frequently then accessing levels 7 and 8 of the framework.  Additional staffing of guidance services in schools, further education colleges, higher education institutions and in the adult guidance services would be helpful.  The points system needs to be reformed.  More progression pathways should be recognised.  Additional support in the form of funding and staffing is required for student mental health support services in higher education institutions, HEIs, as well as for employee assistance programmes.  Further funding is required to support access programmes in higher education institutions.  Strong consideration should be made to extending a DEIS-style funding model to the higher education sector.  All institutes of technology, IOTs, should consult staff in relation to seeking a pathway to technological university status.  Emergency remote teaching and learning is, by definition, an emergency response to a crisis situation.  It cannot be seen in any other context.  Additional education needs students should have additional supports maintained if they attend further or higher education after leaving the post-primary system.  Currently when they leave second level, their support is effectively cut off and then needs to be re-established by the relevant further or higher education institution.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, may have a role to play here, especially in the further education, FE, context.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for listening to this opening statement.  The TUI is more than happy to answer any questions that members may have.  The TUI would also like to direct members to the more extensive written submission that we made to the committee in February, which provides more detail on the issues I have just outlined. </p></speech>

I am the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, which is the national student representative body for students in third level education.  Our core mission has always been to protect access to third level education.  At every single opening I give, I must remind people that education is a right and not a privilege.  However, the continual marketisation of education threatens how it is viewed and has only served to heighten existing barriers to third-level education.  I must emphasise how much USI welcomes that future funding of higher education is being looked at and reviewed.  For far too long, many students have been priced out of a third level education and did not get to excel in the ways they should have.  We can certainly change how the future funding of higher education goes, going forward.</p> <p>  To fully begin the conversation, we cannot overlook the largest barrier in student access to education, which is the student contribution charge.  We want to see an immediate reduction in the fees, with a commitment to sustainably funding the higher education sector through a publicly funded higher education model.  If we really value our education system so much then we must act on our words. The State must be responsible for funding the system to the levels required to ensure high quality education for all students.  To highlight just how bad it has become, I note that approximately 50% of the funding of Irish universities is private funding.  This is the highest in the European Union and is the second highest in Europe.  According to the OECD, Ireland invests just 0.8% of GDP in tertiary education, which is well below the 1.5% of the OECD average.  How can Ireland prides itself on its education system when it is way below average?</p> <p>  In addition, the current student-staff ratio in Ireland is among the highest in the EU, and a minimum investment of &euro;147.48 million per annum is required to bring Irish higher education institutions in line with international best practice of a ratio of 15:1.</p> <p>  The USI strongly believes that publicly funded education is the most equitable way to ensure that this increased funding is delivered. The onus should not be on existing or future students to prop up a crumbling sector, rather the State should provide support to the future workforce of our country.  The future expansion of technological universities certainly poses logistical challenges.  As institutes of technology across different geographical locations merge, investment in public transport links is crucial.  Students must be able to access all buildings, resources and supports in campuses across the country.  We must address the lack of public transport infrastructure available in rural areas in particular.  Post merge, technological universities must also be supported, as the entire integration process can take a long time.  They should be supported in building affordable, purpose-built, student accommodation.</p><p>Universal design for learning, UDL, played a critical role in online assessment and teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, outside the Covid-19 classroom, UDL serves as an important tool to help combat barriers students with disabilities face in both learning and social environments.  UDL is critical in increasing awareness of barriers to participation and supports that a student may need.  USI believes that the Government should provide funding to higher education institutions for training on UDL principles and guidance on a national framework to try and support colleges to integrate those principles into the entire teaching and learning environment.</p><p> Equity of access to higher education is a core component of the work of USI.  Existing financial support structures are not optimal and they are not fit for purpose.  There have been significant cuts to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant over the last decade.  We fully believe that the student grant scheme is a huge opportunity to support students to access education and to progress their entire learning journey.  We welcome the review that is being carried out, but funding must be provided to fully implement the recommendations that emerge.  It is important to note the knock-on effect of a stagnant student grant scheme that is deaf to inflation and higher costs of living.  It affects many people, such as disadvantaged and low-income families, engaging in part-time or full-time employment which may lead to students being unable to complete their studies satisfactorily.  Similarly, international students experience many financial hardships, as they are often seen as cash cows to prop up an underfunded system.  We cannot ignore postgraduate students either.  We must ensure there is a national stipend in line with the living wage for research postgraduates, which would enhance engagement in research and encourage the involvement of more postgraduate researchers of diverse backgrounds.</p><p> Finally, I want to touch on student mental health and well-being supports.  Student mental health and well-being is a fundamental element to the overall student experience.  Worryingly, student mental health has worsened in recent years, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We call for the implementation of the recommendations of the student mental health and suicide prevention framework.  Sustainable core funding must be invested annually in support services for student mental health on campus.</p></speech>

The congress group comprises a range of unions representing staff across all levels of the sector, including IFUT, the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, F&oacute;rsa, SIPTU and Unite.  It is our view that equal access must be a cornerstone of our education sector as a whole, otherwise we will simply exacerbate divisions and inequality in Irish society.  A 2018 UNICEF report showed that teenage children of lower income parents in Ireland harboured little or no ambition to attend third level.  Meanwhile, a 2019 HEA study revealed that children from affluent backgrounds were ten times more likely to score high CAO points than those from less affluent areas.  An overriding goal of official policy must be to remove all barriers and impediments to access, and the further and higher education sector can play a crucial role in this process.  However, this can only occur if the critical issue of funding is resolved in a sustainable manner, in order to maximise educational opportunity and participation for all.</p> <p>  There is broad consensus on the value of investment in higher education and the fact that the returns on the investment are public, political, economic and social.  Indeed, the OECD has pointed out that as countries across the globe respond to the challenges of digital, technological and environmental transition, higher education has become pivotal to progress, given its key role in the formation of intellectual capital.  Similar conclusions were reached by the Nevin Economic Research Institute in research carried out for the congress education sector group.  This stressed the role of higher education as "a producer of increased skills and capacities in the population, and as a site of research and development".  The Nevin institute warned that cuts to spending on higher education were self-defeating, as lower investment has a negative impact on long-term growth and living standards.  Given the consensus around this issue, the question arises as to how we have arrived at a situation where we have the highest cost barriers to student participation in the EU and among the lowest spend per student.</p> <p>  These barriers include fees and significant increases in the cost of living for students and working families, and in particular the failure to deliver on secure and genuinely affordable accommodation.  The core of the problem lies in the sharp fall in official funding over the last decade.  Thus, between 2012 and 2016, total State funding for higher education fell by almost 15%.  This reduction is in contrast to comparator states, where funding has always been consistently higher.  In 2014, the spend on third level here amounted to 1.1% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of 1.5%.  If we strip out private funding sources, Ireland's public spend on third level was just 0.8%, while the OECD average was 1.1%.  It is now six years since the expert group on future funding for higher education delivered its recommendations and these trends have worsened since then.  In 2019, the Parliamentary Budget Office concluded that funding per undergraduate student - full time, part time, remote and FETAC - was 50% lower than in 2008.  In our experience, the funding shortfall has contributed to a worsening of employment conditions and a rise in precarious work, with research by TASC and NERI strongly suggesting the problem is most acute in the higher education sector.  It has also sparked a creeping privatisation, and a more dominant role for private funding in our universities, a trend that undermines higher education as a public good.</p> <p>  In conclusion, equality of access must be the cornerstone of our entire education system.  Education is an essential public good and must be funded accordingly.  This includes a properly resourced and publicly-funded higher education sector.  Crucially, this must be accompanied by engagement with all stakeholders, in order to develop a coherent and shared vision for the future of the sector.  Indeed, the necessity for engagement is a key lesson from the experience of the Covid pandemic in the sector.  I stress that this should be the first step, not the last one, once a decision is made on future funding.  The annual cost of attending college has become almost prohibitive and there should be a full reassessment of the grant system to ensure it covers costs and that grants are awarded where they are most needed in a fully transparent manner.  Part-time work and temporary work have a legitimate role at third level, but widespread insecurity of employment will harm teaching and educational standards.  This applies to academic and support staff throughout the institutions, all of whom play a key role in the delivery of education and the proper functioning of the sector.  I thank members for their time.  We are more than happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Jones" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#C00400"><p>IFUT welcomes the opportunity to take part in the discussion on this matter that is of the upmost importance to our entire membership.  IFUT represent thousands of members, all of whom work in higher education.  Our membership includes lecturers, tutors, librarians and researchers.  In our submission to the committee we outlined our concerns in relation to the increased reliance on the sector to secure alternative sources of funding, as the public funding is inadequate.  We referred to reports from the OECD and others that provided statistical evidence to support our case that Ireland is performing badly with regard to publicly funding the higher education sector when compared to others within the OECD.  We must consider why this is the case and make every effort to remedy the situation.</p> <p>  Higher education in Ireland has been underfunded for decades.  While Government spending has slowly increased since 2014, the spend per student is still lower than the levels that were in place in 2011.  Then, the State spent around &euro;8,500 per year on each student in higher education, while today that figure is below &euro;8,000 per year.  Currently, we are ranked 20th in the OECD with regard to our spend per student.</p> <p>  During the period since 2011, the Irish universities slipped significantly in international rankings.  In the late 2000s, two of our universities were ranked in the top 100 internationally, with one in the top 50.  We now have no institutions in the top 100.  The fall in rankings is directly linked to the reduction in spend.  Cuts to core funding have resulted in a reduction in staff numbers.  The employment control framework of 2010 to 2014 appears to linger across the sector, prohibiting HR departments from recruiting academic staff on the agreed and established contracts.  The most obvious way in which the underfunding manifests itself is through the student to staff ratios across our institutions.  According to the OECD, Ireland's student to staff ratio is at 23.4:1, far out of line with the OECD average of 15:1.  Addressing this ratio must become the number one priority for the Department and for all of us involved across higher education.  In an effort to address the need to have student-facing staff, universities have engaged occasional or hourly-paid lecturers.  This committee must note that these employees are not, in the eyes of the institutions and universities themselves, lecturers, as lecturing staff are defined as those contracted to undertake a range of academic duties encompassing teaching, research, and contribution and scholarly activity.  Given an opportunity, I will expand on this point.  Across the universities, different job titles or terms that are used to describe those engaged in this manner include part-time teaching assistants, part-time assistant lecturers, occasional lecturers etc.</p><p>Those engaged in this manner are usually on short fixed-term contracts, only paid for their teaching without any of the other benefits associated with being an employee of a university in a position funded by the State.  Our members in these grades do not have the opportunity to engage in research work.  Being research active is core to the role of a lecturer and the university.<br/><br/>Some employers have failed to afford the terms of the public sector agreements to those engaged in this manner.  The precarious nature of their engagement is further compounded by the fact that there is no sectoral engagement on industrial relations, IR, matters across the university sector.  The education oversight group has not met since before the Covid-19 pandemic.  While these workers are represented by trade unions which are members of the ICTU higher and further education group of unions, the employers will not engage sectorally on IR matters, either through the Irish Universities Association, of which they are all members, or through any other employers' umbrella organisation.  Historically, the rationale for the universities&rsquo; refusal to engage on IR matters sectorally was, according to the universities, because to do so would interfere with the institutional autonomy they enjoy as a right, a right that we respect.  However, UNESCO recommendation 20 from 1997 addresses this point.  It states that autonomy should not be used to limit the rights of higher education staff and teaching personnel.  The same document, in recommendation 27, provides that:</p><blockquote>	Higher-education teaching personnel are entitled to the maintaining of academic freedom, that is to say, the right, without constriction by prescribed doctrine, to freedom of teaching and discussion, freedom in carrying out research and disseminating and publishing the results thereof, freedom to express freely their opinion about the institution or system in which they work ... </blockquote><p>I ask the committee to consider how a precariously employed part-time assistant lecturer would be expected to exercise this entitlement without any certainty of employment into the future.  We in IFUT know the answer.<br/><br/>In IFUT, we believe the failure to fund higher education adequately has given rise to a situation whereby our universities have become over-reliant on precariously employed staff and this has impacted on the quality of our higher education institutions and their global rankings.  We need to address the student to staff ratio by engaging these academics, and others, on contracts agreed through local level or sectoral bargaining.  Failure to address this matter will have a detrimental effect on the sector and society in general.  <br/><br/>I thank members for their attention and welcome the opportunity to discuss these points with them.</p></speech>

Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#D00200"><p>I am the chair of the Irish Research Staff Association, which represents salaried research staff in higher education.  T&aacute;im br&oacute;d&uacute;il as a bheith anseo inni&uacute; chun labhairt ar son daoine at&aacute; ag obair i r&eacute;imse an taighde in &Eacute;ire.</p> <p>  Research is an investment that consistently makes returns that are greater than what we put in.  Studies from Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, Indecon and University College Cork estimate that for every &euro;1 invested in research, society reaps a benefit of between &euro;3 and &euro;5 to the economy.  Research staff bring funding into universities, contribute to internationalisation of higher education, help to inform evidence-based policy and, although this is often under-recognised, contribute to teaching as well.  Strategic investment in research is of benefit to various regions across Ireland and investment in research capacity across our universities, new technological universities, institutes of technology and other higher education institutes, HEIs, across all regions will be a great local, regional and national economic stimulus.</p> <p>  Research careers in HEIs are currently characterised by precarity, with research staff generally being employed on fixed-term contracts tied to specific research grants.  The high turnover of research staff within the HEI sector means that experience is often lost from this sector.  Research staff can also end up devoting a significant amount of time to chasing research grants where only a small number of candidates will succeed.  Ireland has a demonstrable track record in producing long-term research, such as the study on which I am employed, the intellectual disability supplement to The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA.  Given this track record, we should avoid precarity becoming part of policy.  </p> <p>  Coming from a background in psychology, I am glad to see that mental health is on the agenda.  A systematic review and meta-analysis found that job insecurity is associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.  Precarity reduces the health and well-being of research staff, and their productivity with it.  It harms not only individual researchers but research groups and programmes that have higher levels of brain drain as a result.</p> <p>  In order to inform any policymaking decisions regarding research and innovation, it is first important to develop an accurate method of data collection regarding the numbers of research staff, a method that is universal across all HEIs on the island of Ireland.  Data on gender, ethnicity, international or national status, level of seniority and contract type should be tracked over time and should include the career outcomes of the researcher.  Where there are aggregated data, they should be made easily available, to the greatest extent permitted by data protection law.  Research staff should be able to communicate with large numbers of their peers quickly and easily in order to maximise the potential for collaboration and avoid duplication of research effort.</p> <p>  In terms of policy, research career frameworks are important for research staff.  A number of policies have been proposed that take an "up-or-out" approach, whereby research staff have to progress to a higher level within a relatively short period of time or exit the system.  Why is this problematic?  Let us look at the "up" part of the up-or-out approach.  Career progression is good but there is a lack of funding in place for research staff to progress, which means they use increasing amounts of labour hours, paid for by the taxpayer, chasing increasingly competitive grants that they are less likely to get.  Research staff who are generally least able to absorb risk are the ones who take on the bulk of the risk.</p> <p>  What about the "out" in the up-or-out approach?  Some researchers may wish to stay within a particular role at a given level, drawing on years of experience to perform high-quality research, but risk being pushed out of the system when we take an up-or-out approach.  The higher education research group proposed a funded research framework in the late 2000s.  This is a model we should bring back.</p> <p>  A possible solution to enable research staff to continue contributing to academic research is for funding agencies and HEIs to put in place staff scientist positions and equivalent positions for arts and humanities, thereby creating alternative attractive career progression routes within academia.  A report from the National Research Council, for example, recommends raising the salaries of research staff to "appropriately reflect their value and contribution to research".  Unless the career prospects for early career researchers are improved, we risk losing the talent that will be essential for our future progress across all areas of research.</p> <p>  Alternative career paths, where research staff segue into roles more focused on other areas such as teaching or professional services, are to be encouraged, but they should not be seen as the necessary goal of all research staff.</p> <p>  I am here today to advocate not simply for research staff but for a sensible policy of investment that benefits everyone.  Given the return to Irish society evidenced by research, we know that investment in retaining research staff is a win-win.  I look forward to participating further in this process.

I also welcome Alex, who I hope finds this session interesting.  I thank our guests for their opening statements, each of which spoke to what we need to do with the future funding model.  My first question is for Mr. Jones from IFUT.  He highlighted the impact that underfunding has had on the ranking of our institutes of higher education.  In this committee, we have been slow to call out the impact that years of underfunding have had on performance.  We know that because of the work of members of IFUT, other high standards have maintained in extremely difficult circumstances.  However, it is important to accept that even with this great effort, we are inevitably being outperformed by better funded colleges.  The student-staff ratio is much higher here than the OECD average.  That will lead to a very serious impact on education and research output.</p> <p>  Mr. Jones also mentioned that the employment control framework extended from 2010 to 2014 and that it is still curtailing HEIs from offering full contracts.  Perhaps we could examine that a little to see why that is the case and ask why, if the framework was to run from 2010 to 2014, it is still having an impact.  We must also consider what is needed beyond adequate funding for the sector and what needs to be put in place to ensure, if and when the Government brings forward a sustainable funding model, that funding is reflected in better working conditions.  The worst thing that could happen would be for us to have a new model but retain precarious working conditions.  We need to make sure we bring change with us.</p> <p>  In his opening statement on behalf of ICTU, Mr. Byrne mentioned creeping privatisation, which is a very important point.  Privatisation does not always happen in one big sale to a private company.  It can happen, and has happened, over time and we have seen the impact of that.  Do our guests believe we need a step change in how we fund higher education to protect and restore the public nature of third level education?</p><p>One of my great fears is privatisation, because it is a quick fix.  We have seen it happen across the board in essential services, including healthcare and housing.  Now we are seeing it in higher education.  How do we collectively stop that?</p><p> My next question was sparked by the IRSA's submission.  Over the last ten years, the higher education sector has been underfunded but one exception to this is Science Foundation Ireland.  SFI sets up centres in colleges and works on specific projects or research areas.  Has the SFI model impacted on the working conditions in the higher education sector?</p><p> In its submission, the TUI called for a 1% levy on corporation profits to adequately fund higher education.  Is there a specific reason for applying this levy on profits rather than expanding the levy on payroll that currently exists for the National Training Fund?</p><p> Ms Austick said the relationship between student accommodation and adequate funding for higher education is vital.  I agree with her on that.  We have not had an update on the student accommodation strategy since 2019 and the housing crisis means accommodation is the single biggest barrier for anyone who needs to travel to third level.  I am concerned about the rising cost of fuel and the impact that will have on those who have been forced to travel long distances.  Do we need a new student accommodation strategy, focused on public ownership and affordability, to go along with the new funding model?  There were a lot of questions there.  Each witness will have about a minute to answer but maybe they can expand their answers later on.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned rankings.  The student to staff ratio has a direct impact on the rankings but it affects much more than that.  It affects the entire student experience because it affects the ability of lecturers and other staff to deliver on their contracts.  It is very clear that this has a negative impact.  The employment control framework I mentioned was in place for very good reason between 2010 and 2014.  In 2016, Michael Cush SC conducted a review of precarity, short-term contracts and the use of fixed-term and part-time contracts for lecturers in universities.  He made seven recommendations, one of which is that the employment control framework be lifted, allowing the universities the right to hire lecturers directly when necessary, so they would not have to go to the HEA or other organisations for approval.  That is fine and dandy if they have the money to hire but they do not.  That is why they do not hire lecturers but hire these hourly-paid staff on very poor fixed-term contracts of employment and they renew the fixed-term contracts, leaving us with very little option as trade unions-----</p></speech>

Is it purely a matter of funding?</p></speech>

The problem is that when people such as part-time teaching assistants are employed on these types of contracts repeatedly, they secure permanency in their positions under the fixed-term work legislation but they are permanent in a job they should not really be doing.  They should have the full lecturing experience.  That will make the situation even more dire into the future.  It is a big job.  There is a huge task to be done here, not just in saying that from now on we will have no part-time teaching assistants and will only have lecturers.  I like that the USI has put a figure on the student to staff ratio.  That is important because we need figures and costs to aim for.  It will also take time to tackle this.  ICTU's submission stated that this should be the start of something and I agree with that.  We should not just address the student to staff ratio by putting a load of hourly-paid, precariously engaged teaching assistants into a university because that will not sort anything.</p></speech>

It is not a desire to attend college or awareness of it that is lacking.  It is due to the cost of attending higher education, that is, the cost of student accommodation coupled with the fees, the cost of living and the hidden course material costs.  It is everything together.  The TU Dublin cost-of-living guide estimates that it costs &euro;10,000 to attend one year of college.  It differentiates between people attending college in Dublin, Galway, Cork or Letterkenny.  We need a new student accommodation strategy that commits to tackling the student accommodation crisis in the most effective and efficient manner possible and has short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals.  It has to be accompanied by making higher education accessible and reducing the student contribution charge immediately, if not abolishing it.  We want the Government to provide support to colleges to build their own student accommodation that is affordable and based on a cost-rental model.  We need a new student accommodation strategy and we need to tackle the financial aspect and the cost placed on students to attend college.  Otherwise, we will not get anywhere.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me a direct question about privatisation.  ICTU did a report that shows nearly 50% of money is now from the private sector.  There has been a huge drop in public funding from what it used to be.  It was close to 80% or 90% previously.  That is why we are saying this should be the beginning of the discussion.  When the report comes out we would love to come back to the committee and have a discussion because at that stage we can answer the questions on how to deal with what is being put in front of us.  A number of the people here, including us and the representatives from the USI, IFUT and TUI, as well as SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and Unite, are part of Education Futures, the campaigning group we put together to try to deal with future funding.  We had three pillars, which are the metrics by which we should be measuring things when the report from the Department comes out.  The three pillars - access, the quality of the education system, and decent work - set down what we need the future funding model to deal with.</p> <p>  The employment control framework does not just deal with academics but with all staff across the system.  Even if a university wanted to hire a security guard, it is set in stone.  That causes problems because if they do not have the funding, they might outsource or bring in a temporary cleaner or security guard.  It is across the system.  The employment control framework is a legacy of the crisis and it must be done away with.  We need to have those discussions across the board on what having more money in the system means going forward and how we deal with it.</p> <p>  The USI has given a very clear report on the effects of the accommodation crisis on students and we support it on that.</p></speech>

As the Chair said, I will have to leave the meeting after this.  I am very impressed with the presentations.</p><p>Many of the witnesses speak about access, those on the margins and disadvantage.  We still have an issue in Ireland with functional literacy with 17.9% of our adult population functionally illiterate.  It is something we regularly discuss here.  I suppose the witnesses have all come here looking for money so we need to cut to the chase of what the discussion is really about.</p><p> There are a couple of topics regularly bandied around in Irish political discourse.  If it is said in any forum that crime is out of control, most people will nod their heads in agreement.  If anybody rings "Liveline" and says "crime is out of control, Joe", most people would agree.  It does not matter what kind of international statistics we have about crime in Ireland versus any other country in the world, people would still nod their head and say crime is out of control.  If we say people in Ireland are overtaxed, most people would again nod their heads and say they are overtaxed.  Again, not to disparage "Liveline" but the caller to that programme would say "we are overtaxed, Joe".  In any pub conversation, political conversation or electoral cycle, people will assume we are overtaxed, despite it not being true.</p><p> We need much more maturity in the Irish political discourse and we cannot pretend to invest more in public services, as the delegations are advocating, with zero cost.  They have provided a very reasonable suggestion of a levy on the corporate sector here, raising &euro;550 million.  We made the political argument that to give away &euro;500 million of tax cuts in the last budget, given the state of public finances, was not the right thing to do.</p><p> I remember almost 30 years ago being a beneficiary of free education at third level and it opened doors for my family and other families like mine that could enter third level education.  Maybe some doors would have been closed to us otherwise.  Nevertheless, we lost the argument on the idea from the mid-1990s until recently.  The suggestion was made that essentially this was an advantage from which only middle class people would benefit.  The argument was that the funding mechanism should have been funnelled in a different way.</p><p> There is no way of adequately funding public services and making them free and excellent, as happens right across Europe, without having a proper discussion about the way we tax and people invest so they can feel proud of their tax system.  They should feel it is a duty and we should get away from the political discourse around every levy and taxation measure.  There is a language around "tax burden" and "squeezed middle" that always seems to come into the political discourse.</p><p> If I am going to nod my head and say the witnesses are absolutely right, as I want to, it would be dishonest of me to say they are right and we must absolutely fund what they want to achieve while telling people during my political campaigning that they are overtaxed.  I do not believe they are.  How do we fix that?  How do we make that political argument and convince the people of Ireland that a fair, transparent and progressive taxation system does not need political buy-off or auctioneering around election time?  Hard questions and choices must be made about how our taxation system produces highly educated and free citizenry.  They are free to make choices and live their lives with an education that has lifted them.  We cannot do that if we still get into the mire of comparing this tax to this levy and the assumption we are overtaxed.  There is also an assumption that public services are not excellent, and that is part of the same right-wing, conservative discussion.  As the witnesses are all seeking money, will they help me out?</p></speech>

I might repeat some of what I say now to Deputy Conway-Walsh when she returns.  We brought forward the notion of a 1% levy on corporate profits and as has been pointed out by Deputy Conway-Walsh, there have been increases in the contribution to the national training fund.  It clearly has not been nearly sufficient to meet the funding gap.  The Deputy's broader point is correct with regard to the commentary that goes with taxation discussion.</p> <p>  In general terms Ireland is not particularly out of line when it comes to income and consumption taxes.  It is out of line with its corporate taxes.  It is why we have focused on a corporate tax levy and a specific levy to take it directly into higher education.  As Mr. Cassells pointed out in his report, employers benefit hugely from what comes from our higher education sector.  It is entirely appropriate for us to look for a contribution from them commensurate with the gains they make from the very availability of the talented work pool from which they benefit.</p></speech>

The Teachers' Union of Ireland has been very clear about that.  I have spoken at rallies, including rallies organised by the Union of Students in Ireland, about this and we are utterly opposed to that.  We are utterly opposed to our current position, quite frankly, and it is extremely unfortunate that the student contribution charge came in when it did in 1996 when a Labour Minister abolished fees.  It was extremely unfortunate that the &pound;150 levy or charge was introduced.  It was the equivalent of &euro;190.46 and it has been multiplied by 15 since as it has gradually worked its way up and become this enormous burden on students.  It must be lifted and we fully support such an effort.</p></speech>

We must change the narrative and we can do that together; this is not a spend on higher education but investment in the country.  There is a very positive Indecon report and my colleague might be quoting from it with respect to returns on investment in higher education.  It was commissioned by the Irish Universities Association in 2019 and it deals with the spend on higher education and returns that come to the Exchequer from that spend.  It is a really good investment for the country and it is worth us trying to discuss that and ensure there is value for money and good returns on that investment.  That is what we are about.  We are not just a bottomless pit seeking more money.  We are seeking proper investment so there can be proper returns to society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Karl Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#F00600"><p>From the tax perspective, Mr. Marjoram has touched on our approach, while Mr. Jones has spoken to the investment perspective.  We can marry the two of them while also looking at the returns that higher education provides to society in general.  We can also consider the targets being set by the Government.  For example, there is a target of 750 apprentices in the public sector but we do not know where they are going.  There are only 50 live apprentices now in local authorities so even if we put apprentices into the local authority sector, we do not have craft workers with whom they could buddy up.  Who would deal with such matters?  How will we deal with Housing for All and retrofitting?  How will we deal with any of this?  We must invest now because we will also see societal problems down the line.  When politicians have a conversation with people at the door, they should also be saying that if we do not invest now, things will get worse.  If we do not invest now, we will not be able to do what we are suggesting.  We will not be able to build student accommodation or deal with such issues.</p> <p>  This is also about societal value.  I went to school in Kilbarrack, where only around four or five people went to the National University of Ireland colleges.  In 1995 I had the grant and in 1996 I paid &pound;50 as a registration fee in University College Dublin.  I was part of the Goldilocks generation and a number of the politicians here would have been part of that too.  Now a &euro;3,000 fee is required.  That conversation must be had about the effect we are having.  I am from a generation that benefited from free education at third level and the State provided that for me.</p> <p>  We must consider societal benefit, investment and tax.  This is about a whole discussion.  That is why we are saying this is the start of a discussion.  We would welcome the opportunity to come back to the committee when a decision has been made by the Department on a future funding model.  We must deal with all those aspects and not just the spending of money.</p><p>We need to have a discussion on how it is spent, what we are targeting and what we are trying to do.  As I said, we would welcome that conversation at that stage.</p></speech>

I am the last man standing.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is coming back in a short while.  The Western Rail Corridor is being discussed in the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication and it is a subject close to her heart.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is keen to continue the discussion on this.</p> <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir as an bhfianaise seo, na f&iacute;ric&iacute; agus an arg&oacute;int.  T&aacute;imse den tuairim go bhfuil cuid mhaith i gcoitiantacht againn.  T&aacute; tuiscint againn ar c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; oideachas sa tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al agus go dteasta&iacute;onn infheist&iacute;ocht cheart ann. </p> <p>  I will pick up briefly on the previous discussion.  It is not necessary to repeat it.  From my party's point of view, this is, as Mr. Jones has said, about investment.  This is not only about the individuals who cannot benefit and, indeed, should benefit from third level education.  It is about the value of this to us as a society and, to an extent, as an economy.  I do not want to over-emphasise the latter but it is true as well.  As a society, we need to invest in this.</p> <p>  The Cassells report was lengthy but to some extent it stated fairly simply that here is the destination, we need to get to it, there are many ways you can get to it but standing still is not adequate.  The surprising aspect of this discussion is that to a large extent across political parties and organisations, such as Mr. Jones's own, but not limited to it, there is something of a consensus that it should be done through public funding.</p> <p>  The view on a graduate tax, a student loan system or anything like that is a minority view as far as I can gather including in the education sector as a whole.  Indeed, many of the third level institutions and some of their leadership have a different view but several of them are also opposed.  To some extent, it surprises me that the suggestion is somehow so resilient that it keeps coming back into the public debate when there are so many voices against it.  I would make that minor point to agree with Mr. Marjoram on some of the taxation inequalities but perhaps the other point relates to social insurance.  We are a bit out of step in social insurance as well in terms of PRSI compared to our European comparators.</p> <p>  The general point aside, I have some specific questions for Dr. Allen.  On the issue of career pathways for postgraduate researchers and postdoctoral researchers, there are countries we can look to as doing this better but there are also countries we can look to where this is completely collapsing.  The situation in Britain seems to be adverse for postdoctoral researchers, as far as I can gather, in the precarity that exists.  Perhaps Dr. Allen can correct me, but there is a significant danger there in loss.  I have not come across that "up and out" phrase previously but I think I understand what is meant by it.  Can Dr. Allen give me a sense, when the opportunity to progress to full lectureship or a comparable occupation is not there, where is "out"?  Where do they go?  Have we any sense of how many postgraduate-postdoctoral researchers are lost to the system?  Perhaps we do not have that information.  If we do, it would be useful to have a sense of the scale of it.  Obviously, the skills involved in their experience and the expertise would be quite considerable.  I agree that there is a significant issue with the funding model.  It is peculiar that much of the funding is State led but still comes in that compartmentalised fixed-round way.</p> <p>  For the TUI and Mr. Jones, I am also conscious of the issue of fragmentation of employment and that there would be many people working in the sector who have bits and pieces of contracts - a few hours here and a few hours there.  Is there an element to which the higher education authorities are not prioritising people who are already on the books so that they get more full-time jobs and consolidate their hours?  Mr. Jones also expressed a desire - I will afford him the opportunity if he wishes - to expand on the point that they are not officially classed as lecturers, etc.</p> <p>  In response to Ms Austick, the issues with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, are enormous.  There is the issue of the adjacency levels.  It cuts in a number of ways - the threshold to qualify is too low; people on relatively low incomes do not qualify; a large proportion of the people who get grants do not get the full grant; a fairly small proportion gets the full grant; and, in any event, the full grant is not enough to cover costs.  SUSI falls shorts on so many fronts.  I am glad it is being reviewed, but a review is all well and good.  There was a stage where the student contribution was definitely a disincentive but the grant structure and the relevant cost of living was not so serious that large numbers of disadvantaged students or low-income students were put off.  We are now reaching the point, because the SUSI grants are so inadequate, that a significant number of students are facing disincentives of that kind.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Byrne on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I could be wrong on this but I imagine there have been discussions at congress level - I am not sure which trade union would necessarily represent them but perhaps it is SIPTU - about the non-teaching staff, such as the large number of caretakers, grounds staff and carpenters.  Taking caretakers, and probably security as well, for example, many universities are outsourcing these services and privatising them, and some of the terms and conditions are probably under attack.  I would say it is likely to be one of the first areas that universities look at when they are trying to cut costs.  What is the future in relation to that?</p> <p>  There is a lot there but I am hopeful that the Chair might be lenient, given that a few others have perhaps benefited from such leniency.</p></speech>

They do not accurately reflect the cost of living.  That is one of the big issues.  In previous conversations with the Department, the Minister or other key stakeholders, it always has come down to whether we should have investment in publicly-funded higher education, whether the student contribution charge should be reduced or whether there should be investment in the existing financial support services such as SUSI and the student sssistance fund, SAF.  From our perspective, it should be both.  There has to be the complete abolition of the student contribution charge.  It should be publicly funded.  The sector is so significantly underfunded that the student-staff ratios are not average.  The working conditions are not great for staff.  Students are not getting the best, most meaningful, high-quality education possible because they cannot engage in societies or clubs, or have to work part-time jobs, and have to commute up to four hours each day.  There are so many different scenarios that students experience because of the financial hardship that they are in.</p> <p>  In terms of the SUSI and SAF, we are still waiting on the SUSI review to come out to see what has been established and if there will be any financial increases in them.  However, we must look at this in a holistic way.  We must look at the criteria to qualify for the SUSI grant in the first place.  Does one get the full maintenance?  Is it only a portion of it?  Is it only the fees that are covered?  There is the non-adjacency rate as well.  Postgraduate students need support.  International students cannot avail of the SAF or the SUSI grant.  They have no real financial support at all when they come into Ireland and in some instances they pay up to nine times the amount that Irish domestic students do.</p> <p>  There is one other point I want to come back on because I just need to say it.  On the argument for a publicly-funded higher education system, you can take the practical economic approach in terms of the investment and what it does for society but there is also the emotive element to it.  Publicly-funded higher education would provide individuals, but also the collective, the opportunity to upskill, to reskill and to participate in lifelong learning encouraging them to constantly strive for more information and knowledge.</p><p>It supports society in the context of being creative and thinking outside the box and promotes social justice and equality.  There is also the economic argument whereby for &euro;1 of investment, there will be a &euro;3 return.  There are many positives to a potentially publicly funded higher education system.</p><p> This comes back to how we view our education system and whether we see it as a right.  If so, we cannot put a price on it.  Otherwise, we view it as a privilege, although I hope nobody in this room or anybody listening to the meeting thinks that way.  Ultimately, it is a right, not a privilege, and we need to invest in it and ensure that regardless of someone's background, whether he or she has worked or whether he or she wants to attend college or higher education at any stage in life, he or she will have the opportunity to do that.  We need to fund the system.  We need to have a publicly funded higher education system and invest in student accommodation that is affordable, but also ensure the financial supports that are already there are fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I might come in on the point made by the representative of the Irish Research Staff Association.  It related to a different question, but the Teachers Union of Ireland has negotiation rights on behalf of researchers in the institutes of technology and the technological universities.  It has been a very difficult and arduous path to try to do what we want to do, namely, to improve and standardise the terms and conditions.  What we want are terms and conditions that are directly comparable to those of lecturing staff, that is, the same kinds of contracts, the same level of permanency, the same pension rights and rights to leave and so on.  It has not been easy and, after many years, we have not made the progress we wanted.  There are a plethora of contracts, some of which do not have a pay scale but rather a single point where people stay for however long they remain in employment.  Other than that, there are those who have no pension arrangements made for them whatsoever.  Bizarrely, some of the funding that comes in comes from the funding body with 20% added onto the salary portion for a pension contribution, and that has been sent back in some cases, although we really do not understand why there is such a bureaucratic difficulty in doing anything with that money on the part of the host institution.  We are trying to progress these issues, and while it is not easy to do, our intention is to continue with our negotiations and to try to improve the terms and conditions of researchers to a level comparable with those of lecturing staff.</p> <p>  In technological universities, in particular, we want to see an expansion of research capacity, but not a hived-off or separated research activity that is disparate from lecturing.  We think research and lecturing go together, and that is one reason it is a good idea to have comparable terms and conditions in order that there can be interchange and there can be a time in an academic's life when there is a greater focus on one than the other.  The closer together the contracts are, the easier that is to do.</p> <p>  There has been some improvement for the sector.  The review of the model in 2019 applied &euro;5 million in funding directly to the sector for the first time.  That was a small sum - the review had recommended 5% as opposed to the &euro;5 million figure, and it will need to be ramped up to 5%, which would be about four times as much - but it has certainly helped with multiannual planning for research and the building of capacity.  That has been positive but it needs to be built on to a far greater extent.</p> <p>  There was a question about the fragmentation of employment.  To build on what Mr. Jones talked about, TUI was a little ahead of IFUT in gaining the benefits of what he mentioned and of the Cush report.  We met Michael Cush in numerous engagements to try to replicate progress we have made for our teaching grades with regard to far better terms relating to achieving permanency after only two years, as opposed to what is laid out in employment law, where four years has to have passed.  One important aspect of it relates to the augmentation of contracts after a single year of holding additional hours.  I think that was the point that was being made.  We should not have people in the system who are not turned to for additional hours that become available.  We are adamant that is what should happen.  We have an agreement and a circular letter that states that should happen, but there remain implementation difficulties and it is something we are concerned about.  The Cush process, like many of these trade union processes, arose out of industrial action and, frankly, out of saying enough is enough.  Nevertheless, we got something positive and it has improved matters, and we are still working to try to make it as effective as possible by following precisely what was laid down in the circular and the agreement.</p></speech>

I look after predominantly administrative staff in the technological universities, the IOTs and the ETBs.  We got that name changed to professional, managerial and support staff, PMSS, because it was a big bugbear for our members that there were academic and non-academic staff, which in itself suggests the latter were more important.  Much of what has gone on since the austerity years, and is still continuing citing the ECF, relates to specific-purpose contracts, and there is an awful lot of outsourcing of agency staff because of the ECF.  Trying to establish the extent of the cost being incurred by the employer was difficult and, as members can imagine, it was quite expensive compared with direct labour, which is what we are advocating for.  Under fixed-term contracts, members who worked tirelessly had some security under the legislation whereby after four years, they could become permanent and have security of tenure, whereas in the case of specific-purpose contracts, they did not.  There is an awful lot that has to be done in that regard.</p> <p>  By May, five TUs will have been established.  This is an exciting time for many students who, in the first instance, would not have had access to the universities but now they do, at world-renowned institutions.  It is important that rather than throwing money at the issue, there should be engagement with the relevant stakeholders, including all staff and us representing the members, to see what to do.  I am an advocate of the idea that if you want to know how to do a job, you should ask the people who do it.  Let us slow down and get this right.  Let us carry out due diligence that will make us proud.  Many rural institutions were set up because of local socioeconomic factors and afforded an opportunity for students to gain access to third level, and now they have university status.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked how we can make this political argument.  I do not think there is one person in a household who would not advocate for his or her student children to get the best opportunity possible.  We have that now with these TUs.  We need to fund them in such a way that Ireland can be proud and the students who qualify will receive recognised, world-renowned university degrees.</p></speech>

We have members in the IOTs and the TUs, and in the old F&Aacute;S training centres that are now ETBs, such as the instructors, the administration staff and so on.  Ms Griffin hit the nail on the head.  The outsourcing happens at the lowest level, where institutions feel they can implement it.  It happens at the levels of security, caretaking and cleaning.  In the university sector, the majority of those roles are outsourced.  The best example of where that is not done is at Trinity College, and I think the benefit of that can be seen there.  Outsourcing is about saving money, not having to deal with various issues and so on.<br/><br/>Furthermore, due to the ECF, if additional people are needed, there is the question of whether they will be taken in on fixed-term contracts, through an agency or whatever the case may be.  This is why we have requested that, if a decision is to be made, it will not be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  Once we have a new model for the funding, we should sit down and discuss what the new model for the sector will be and how we can move it forward.</p></speech>

The reason for that is that there is no sectoral engagement and social dialogue, believe it or not, across the entire sector.  University and employers' organisations are devising the researchers framework without any input from us.  They are planning out the entire career of researchers through the seven points in the researchers career framework.  When a researcher eventually reaches point 7, there is termination.  A researcher can spend 15 years on a series of contracts and the employer's plan is to get him or her to point 7, where there is termination.  There is no input from the trade unions or social dialogue.  For this to work, there must be social dialogue.  It is an absurd situation.  The point is that without social dialogue and sectoral engagement, we will not get anywhere.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the UK.  I know that with Brexit, they were struggling and there has been a lot of anxiety around the European funding that everyone is chasing.  To reference a specific example from the UK, Bristol University has followed a really good model for a number of years that features tracks.  There is a research track whereby staff can go further in their careers up to research professor level.  In Ireland, most of the time people are trying to segue from being a post-doctoral researcher to a lecturer.  They often change.  It speaks to Mr. Marjoram's point that sometimes there is a different focus on research or teaching.  Something like the Bristol model could be interesting to look at in Ireland.</p> <p>  Just to speak to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point, we are talking about investment and the value of it here.  We are not just looking for a big tranche of funding.  Ms Griffin has touched on the issue of contracts of indefinite duration and specific purpose contracts.  Research staff just want to be treated the same way most people in most sectors are treated, so that if someone works in a particular organisation for a number of years, he or she should have the same entitlement to be kept on and his or her work should be recognised after working in the sector for long enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#J00300"><p>I have a small number of questions in the same vein.  As politicians, we are often asked for funding.  I do not want to be the spoilsport, but I am asking a very serious question.  Different sectors and organisations are coming with a begging bowl looking for money.  The witnesses are experts in the educational field.  That is why they are before us today.  Why is the higher education sector more important than, for example, saving the life of a person who is suffering from cystic fibrosis, or whatever it might be, in an acute hospital?  They are the questions that I am asked if I am in a radio debate.  I do not think there is anybody that does not want more funding for education, but there are so many asks out there.  While it is a spend, it is an investment for the future to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, and everything like that.</p> <p>  I have been a huge advocate for the South East Technological University, SETU, looking at the geography of the south east and where we are located in County Wexford.  We have been told by IDA Ireland that one of the reasons that we cannot attract FDI to Wexford and the south east is because we do not have a third-level education facility.  That is particularly true in respect of County Wexford, and less so in respect of counties Waterford and Carlow.  Now we have ticked that box.  We have the infrastructure and the roads and everything like that.  We have bypasses straight into Enniscorthy and fantastic infrastructure.  I will be after the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Government in general, looking for investment for infrastructure into the all the campuses of the SETU, including the campuses in Carlow, Wexford and Waterford.  It is really important because we are behind in the south east.  The number of people who do their leaving certificate and do not go on to further or higher education but go straight into the workplace is absolutely staggering.  How do I make that argument?  I am not just saying that it is an investment.  There is something behind it as well.  I mentioned the idea of attracting FDI.  I would like the witnesses' views on that issue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Marjoram" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#J00400"><p>Ms Griffin expressed very well the fact that we share the optimism for technological universities for all that there are challenges that remain.  One thing, for instance, is that we certainly do not want the TUs to lose the really strong grip that they had on the teaching and learning side and the very strong relationship we had with the students.  On the Chairman's basic point, if we look at our own history, what has lifted this country is education.  It has been well expressed here in terms of that investment.  Would we have gotten anywhere near where we are but for very progressive decisions that were made regarding second level education 50-odd years ago?  We would not.  We would still be scrabbling around with a very poor economy.  None of the things that the Chairman rightly pointed to, such as proper healthcare and housing, are achievable without that base of education that generates the kind of economic activity and the kind of society that lifts us all.  That is the very strong point.  TUs give us an opportunity now to do better with regard to those who have not been coming to third level previously, to improve the pathways from further education into third level and into a qualification that is viewed on a par with a third-level qualification, and that adds that value to the local community.  That is one great thing about technological universities, which the Chairman highlighted, is their regional remit and the fact that they can lift the region around them.  There is very strong evidence, and it has been pointed to previously, that every euro spent on education multiplies in a local community.  For example, I saw a study on Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which was scoring highest on this.  Every euro spent was bringing &euro;6 along with it.  That is the argument.  I know it has been repeated, but there is no point in trying to make up a better argument for something that is fundamentally true and totally backed up by our own history.</p></speech>

When we say that we want money, questions will be asked about housing, healthcare and medical care.  I agree with the argument made my Mr. Marjoram.  However, there is also the other side of the argument.  How do we get the medical professionals into the field?  At this moment in time, discussions are ongoing.  We are engaging with the universities and institutes and telling them that we do not want a repeat of situation that occurred last year, which we knew had to happen because of Covid, where extra places had to be put into the system.  If extra places are put into the system, they need to be planned and looked at.  The Department is telling us that we need more medical students going into the system.  That means that we need more labs and bigger lecture theatres, or we need to roster them differently.  To provide the extra medical professionals for the hospitals, we need to invest to ensure that we have quality.  I listened to the meeting of the committee a few weeks ago when the employers, such as the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association, were in.  They were saying the same thing.  We have got to a place where quality has not been affected.  That has involved putting many shoulders to the wheel.  However, quality will be affected if we do not invest in this regard.  We had situations, during Covid, where we had overflow rooms for lectures because we could not fit everyone in the same room.  We had to extend the number of lab sessions that we had because there were pinch points around restrictions to numbers in a lab or training session.  Those are aspects of the Chairman's question.</p> <p>  I raised an issue related to housing.  How do we get the apprentices into the system?  We currently have the highest number of registrations that we have have ever had.  We have a backlog that we are working through very quickly and, hopefully, will be cleared by the summer.  We have engaged constructively with the FET stakeholders.  We and the TUI have done that at all levels to ensure that backlog is dealt with.  However, the questions remain.  How do we deal with Housing for All?  How do we deal with retrofitting?  How do we deal with those areas?  We need to invest.  This is where the societal question arises.  As a politician in the D&aacute;il, the Chairman is being asked about healthcare and housing.  That is where we are looking at all the parts that bring us to the point where we have the person in health to provide healthcare and the builder in construction to build the house that we want built.  That is where we interlink.  As Mr. Marjoram said, it is our education system that allowed us to advance going forward through the 1990s.  That is something that we are asking.</p><p>We are at the point where we have to make a decision.  There is a radical change with regard to digital and green technology and all that sort of stuff.  Will we invest in that?  Will we move forward as a country?  Will we invest in our society and people?</p><p> The people around this table say that is done through the education system.  In fairness to the committee, I have seen some of its comments on access and making sure people get into the system.  That is why it is very important and why all parties have taken significant time discussing disadvantage and, as the Chair said, ensuring people have an opportunity after they leave school.  It is all about lifelong learning as well, so that even if somebody decides to leave school and get a job, maybe at the age of 25, 26, 30 or 40, he or she has the opportunity to get back into the system.</p></speech>

If we keep going the way we are going in terms of engaging researchers on very specific-purpose, externally-funded, short- and fixed-term contracts, there will be no blue skies research.  There will be no Luke O'Neills in a number of years.  We will not have researchers ready to go who are properly engaged and safe and secure in their employment to conduct research in areas they find important.  We will be waiting until medical companies or other funding agencies decide what is important for us to research.  We need blue skies research, not just for the purpose of research but for education.</p> <p>  We have seen that through Covid.  Every news programme over the past two years relied on the few senior researchers left who are comfortably, properly and safely employed on contracts of indefinite duration, CIDs, in both public and private universities.  We have another crisis, our climate crisis, which will put Covid into the ha'penny place.  We need to have our people ready for that and properly safely engaged, rather than waiting on three-year externally-funded contracts that lead to definite termination at the end of the project.</p></speech>

With regard to the accommodation example given by the Chairman, if support was given to colleges to build affordable purpose-built student accommodation and students had accommodation to live in, that would, potentially, free up the private rental market.  We need to identify where education overlaps with different sectors and what we can do, collectively, to ensure there is a better, more prosperous, inclusive society going forward.  Funding allocated to the entire education sector and to building student accommodation would, it is hoped, alleviate the wider accommodation crisis.  We have to link up the different difficulties and challenges we meet and see where the intersectionality is.</p></speech>

We need affordable purpose-built student accommodation that is available to students.  We need to ensure the rent is affordable and the rooms are up to standard.  It is about finding places for students.  Very often we look at providing course places for students, and that is all great and we want more people to attend college, but we cannot forget about where they will live or stay or how they will commute to college.

It is important and pertinent that it is International Women's Day.  I would particularly like to thank the people with lived experience for joining us here today to share their personal experiences, which can be difficult and traumatic.<br/><br/>I want to start with an opening statement.  I want the committee members to imagine what it would be like to have their decisions taken away from them.</p> <blockquote> 	Imagine if someone else was making decisions for you.  They could decide to take you away, lock you up, not listen to you, give you medication, block you from doing your work and living your life with your body and mind the way they are.  Would you want this to happen to you?  Wouldn't you have the feeling that you have lost your dignity and want it back? </blockquote> <p>That is a quotation from the drafting of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, which was drafted in 2006.  That is a common experience for many of the people here today.  It helps us to reflect on the dehumanising impact of decisions being taken away from us or being forced upon us.  The basic question we need to ask ourselves is: how would we like to be treated if we found ourselves in this position?  Would we like to be listened to, supported and have our wishes and human rights respected, or would we want those wishes disrespected, taken away from us or forced upon us?  This has been a reality for many thousands of people, including many of those here today, who have been admitted to the mental health system in Ireland under our mental health legislation or otherwise.<br/><br/>This can happen to any of us, at any stage in our lives, due to a myriad of life stressors.  One in four Irish people will experience mental distress during their lifetime.  We are all vulnerable to periods of mental distress.  This legislation applies to all of us.  It is not just about people who are detained under the legislation; we are all potential users of mental health services.  We are all only one instance away from having these decision-making rights and human rights taken away from us.<br/><br/>Why is respecting human rights so important in the Bill?  The basic right to make decisions and choices for oneself is called legal capacity and it is the right to be recognised as a person before the law.  Once people lose that right, they are extremely vulnerable to having their other human rights and decision choices taken away from them and having their human rights violated.  Under the Mental Health Act, many people have been deemed to lack capacity to make decisions for themselves and have been vulnerable to having their human rights violated.  This causes additional trauma for the person from which they have to recover.  In the Bill, we need to challenge the fundamental assumptions we have about people with mental health issues and their capacity to make decisions.  We all make bad decisions but these decisions are never questioned unless we have a disability or a mental health diagnosis.  The question we need to ask is why we preventively detain people and forcibly treat people experiencing mental distress under our mental health legislation.  There is no evidence to suggest coercion works, so why are we still using it?<br/><br/>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires us to fundamentally change our approach to mental health law towards a more human rights-based approach under the social and human rights model of disability.</p><p>Ireland ratified the CRPD in 2018, but has so far failed to implement many of its provisions or ratify the optional protocol.  The CRPD requires us to move away from coercion in our legislation, which deprives people of their liberty and the right to make decisions for themselves.  We are required under the legislation to support people to make their own decisions and to respect their wishes in the mental health system.  It is critical that people are not treated differently under our new capacity legislation and mental health legislation and that we move towards a same human rights-based approach.  The CRPD also requires us to move away from coercion towards a human rights-based approach.<br/><br/>In its current format, the proposed Bill would still deprive people of their capacity to make decisions for themselves.  We need to remove stigmatising language from it in order that people are respected as human beings in society and under the legislation.  The ethos of human rights must permeate the general principles and the entire legislation to comply with our obligations under the CRPD.  We also need to effect cultural change in practice and how we view people with mental health issues and disabilities.  This is a unique opportunity for Ireland to have human rights-based legislation and provide a better future for all of us.  Let us remember that this proposed legislation could apply to any of us at any time.  In that context, we have an opportunity to provide better outcomes for everyone, namely, people using mental health services, staff working in services, families and society in general.  This helps enhance recovery, eliminate stigma and discrimination and promote a sense of trust and respect for people experiencing mental distress.  Reform of our legislation provides Ireland with a unique opportunity to be a world leader in implementing CRPD human rights in mental health and capacity legislation providing a better future for all of us.<br/><br/>I will leave the committee with some quotes from people with experience of being treated and detained under existing legislation, the first of which is: &quot;it is an awful feeling to know your liberty and rights can be taken away from you at any time and that you have no say whatsoever in your treatment.&quot;  After successfully filing a legal challenge for differential treatment under the Americans with Disabilities Act in 2003, Nancy Hargrave, who was detained under US mental health legislation, said: &quot;It seems fundamentally unfair that I choose or refuse chemotherapy which is saving my life, but I don't have the same right to choose or refuse psychiatric medication.&quot;<br/><br/>A former UN rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health has urged countries to move away from coercion towards a more human-rights based approach where people are supported to make their own decisions and decision-making capacity is not taken away from them.  We all have the right to make decisions and choices for ourselves.  According to Mr. Dainius Pras, UN rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health, we need little short of a revolution in mental health care to end decades of neglect, abuse and violence, the <i>status quo</i>is simply unacceptable and we need to provide a better future for all of us.  Anyone of us could be detained or treated under this legislation.</p></speech>

I represent Recovery Experts by Experience, a group of people with lived experience that has made two submissions to the UN on mental health legislation and the need for reform in Ireland.  My experience encompasses over 20 years of activism and user-led and survivor-led research.  This is research that comes from the perspective of people who have used services.</p><p>My personal experience and research with people around the world lets me speak with some authority to the fact that mental health legislation is not fit for purpose in our experience.  We have been arguing for a long time that the medical model is completely inadequate.  It is informed by a biomedical brain chemistry perspective that does not take people&rsquo;s lived experience or the situation in which they are living into account.  From our perspective, I would make the point that psychiatry is not a neutral standpoint.  The perspective of psychiatry is very influenced by the physical approach those in the profession take to the brain.  As a profession, psychiatrists are very much bound up with and are, we would argue, under undue influence from big pharma such that medication becomes the sole treatment that is available to us and we really feel that denies people's human rights.</p><p> I would like the committee to consider one point, which Dr. Morrissey mentioned, namely, the idea of coercive control.  Once somebody goes into an acute unit, that person is automatically and inevitably under the power of the treating teams and is not able to control his or her destiny within the services.  That person must comply.  Most recently, I was working with the HSE as an area lead for mental health engagement.  I would have heard feedback from people who came to local forums to try to influence positive change and make things better from the perspective of lived experience.  Those people told me instances of their experiences on acute units where they had to conform to be compliant.  They had to work to become good patients so they could fit in.  That meant taking their medication or doing what they were told to do by the nurse.  This is a situation that is rife for abuses of power because people need to do what they are told.  For instance, one person told me he had been approached by a nurse who seemed to be in bad form and that nurse towered over him, told him to go back into his room, and if he did not do so, he would be thrown into seclusion.</p><p> The Mental Health Act and the Mental Health Commission have devised regulations but in many instances they are red tape.  I know from working with colleagues in mental health services that they are very bound up with responding to the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s visits.  Enormous amounts of energy and resources that could be spent working with and listening to people and giving them person-centred care is bound up in preparation for inspections by the Mental Health Commission.  I was a layperson on tribunals but I do not have time to speak to that.  Dr. O'Mahony will speak to that and mental health review boards.</p><p> There is much that is good in what we have seen so far, but one point I would leave with the committee is to consider some measure to address the issue of coercive control.  It is not very far removed from what people experience in abusive domestic violence relationships.</p><p>When women are trying to free themselves, they need a lot of supports in order to break free from the coercion.  Everybody I know in Recovery Experts by Experience and who are on mental health forums would tell us that the idea of voluntary patients, involuntary patients and the in-between is almost a paper exercise because once you go into the mental health services, you must comply with what you are directed to do because those services then have the power under mental health legislation to detain you and treat you against your will.  We know that electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, is the ultimate treatment that can potentially be held over people.<br/><br/>I request that the committee give strong consideration to simplifying the legislation such that it is easily accessible and understood by people, as well as being easy to apply so that the services can free up more resources to work in person-centred care in trauma-informed ways to help people who come into distress and so that they recognise that for 99% of people it is evident it is past trauma or difficulties that cause them to become distressed and force them to seek mental health supports.  I am conscious of the time restrictions.  I will conclude with that request for the committee to consider the coercive control element and see if it is possible to bring this into the Bill in order to recognise the utter powerlessness people have <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>psychiatry.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the committee on this important proposed legislation.  In the time allocated to me, I will speak to four issues, the first of which is the intermediate category as proposed under the general scheme.  The second is the need for a proper complaints mechanism, which is not currently provided for.  I will speak then briefly on the mental health tribunals and the lack of provision in the mental health legislation for people who experience mental ill-health in the context of the criminal justice system.</p> <p>  As regards the intermediate category, the lack of human rights safeguards for persons who are considered voluntary under the Act and have difficulties in making decisions is one of the weak points within the Mental Health Act 2001.  The creation of the new intermediate category has the potential to provide a level of safeguard for people who are voluntary patients but de facto detained, with no oversight of their detention.  However, it remains to be seen whether the provisions in the general scheme will address this human rights issue.  We are concerned there is a potential risk that the introduction of this new intermediate category could widen the net of coercion.  Voluntary persons who are considered to lack capacity under the Mental Health Act could be supported by the provisions in the 2015 Act to make decisions.  That could be an alternative to this intermediate category.  The touted liberty of safeguard processes that are being developed could also support people.  One of concerns in respect of the intermediate category is that it could potentially broaden the net of coercion for people rather than addressing this big human rights issue in the proposed legislation.</p> <p>  The next issue I wish to address is that of the direct complaints mechanism.  It is a source of much disappointment that the general scheme does not contain any provisions that will support persons subject to the legislation to raise issues or complaints based on their lived experiences of mental health services.  It is clear that one of the major deficits of the 2001 Act since it was enacted in 2006 is that it does not provide for a dedicated independent direct complaints mechanism.  In the absence of a specific complaints mechanism, people who use mental health services must lodge their complaints with the internal HSE complaints mechanism.</p><p>If a complainant is not satisfied with the outcome, he or she may then make a complaint to the Ombudsman.  Section 16 of the Mental Health Act provides that a person must be notified of his or her entitlement to communicate with the Inspector of Mental Health Services during the annual inspection.  This is not an adequate safeguard because by the time the inspectorate team comes to the approved centre, the person may have been discharged.  There are no robust powers for the inspector or her team in terms of responding to complaints.  This is a major deficit in the 2001 Act and the Bill.</p><p> In addition, although Ireland has now ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, it has not ratified the optional protocol that would allow people with lived experience of mental health issues and services to make a complaint directly to the UNCRPD committee.  The failure to ratify the optional protocol means an essential layer of accountability is absent.  Members of the committee should be advocating for the Government to ratify the optional protocol to the convention.</p><p> I refer to mental health review boards which, under the Bill, will replace mental health tribunals.  From a human rights perspective, these tribunals or review boards are an essential procedural safeguard for persons who are detained under the 2001 Act.  They relate to vindicating the right to liberty, which is lost in these circumstances.  However, I draw the attention of the committee to a recent systematic review of international literature in respect of mental health tribunals.  It highlighted significant issues with these tribunals, indicating the tribunals are not adequate in protecting human rights but, in fact, can deny human rights, legitimise coercion and restrict access to justice.  That is a real problem.  The research identified that the participatory potential of the tribunals can be undermined by medicalised and legal cultural practices that dictate and dominate their proceedings.  There is also a lack of meaningful involvement of detained persons in the tribunal hearings and they result in a sense of powerlessness and procedural unfairness.  Cultural change is required to ensure the tribunals comply with international human rights law.  The qualitative research in Ireland on this issue reflects the experience here.</p><p> In deciding whether to affirm or revoke an order, the tribunal psychiatrist at these hearings is generally asked for his or her opinion in the first instance.  In evidence before the tribunal, the responsible consultant psychiatrist is almost always asked to submit his or her evidence before the person detained has an opportunity to speak at the tribunal hearing.  In some cases, the person may wish to speak first but be told by the tribunal to wait until the responsible consultant psychiatrist has given his or her evidence.</p><p> In my view, the proposed changes to mental health tribunals as outlined in the Bill are insufficient to make the current tribunal systems effective in vindicating the rights of persons subject to the 2001 Act.  The current mental health tribunal process does not adequately protect the human rights of persons admitted under the 2001 Act.  The data show that less than 12% of admission orders are revoked at hearing stage.  Tribunal composition is heavily weighted towards the medical model and professional opinion, with little or no multidisciplinary or advocacy input.  Psychiatrists and legal professionals are dominant within the tribunals and the voice of the layperson is very much marginalised.  A layperson cannot be a chairperson of the tribunal.  In addition, the psychiatrists and lawyers get paid more than the laypeople.  There are several changes needed in respect of tribunals to make them more meaningful for people and for them to be an effective human rights mechanism to review the detention of people.</p></speech>

The Bill produced by the Department of Health does not represent the required revolution.  It is modest and unambitious.  The review of the 2001 Act has been a long process marked by delay and deferral and culminating ultimately in a Bill that disappoints in failing to address many of the key human rights issues.</p><p> I will speak to a number of other points.

Unfortunately, I am participating today because my sister, Valerie, died by suicide in January 2020.  She was 42 years of age and spent the best part of 25 years interacting with the mental health services at various points in her life.  In spite of all of this, she lived a good life - this is an important point to make - and was well much of the time.  She was a preschool teacher, she travelled a great deal, she was a great sportswoman - she played golf and badminton - and she had many great friends and loved ones.  She deserved so much more, though, and her life, her potential and her opportunities were seriously hampered by a label of &quot;bipolar&quot;, the &quot;medication for life&quot; mantra and the coercive nature of our mental health system.  She was just 15 years of age when a professional first described her as having depression and hypomania.  By the time she was 19, she had the lifelong label of &quot;bipolar&quot; and had already been given a range of powerful psychiatric drugs that did not make matters any better and undoubtedly made them worse.<br/><br/>The medical model of mental health treatment we are discussing means that, once someone gets a diagnosis, medication becomes the main focus of treatment.  My sister was bipolar, so the story that she was disordered told her that she was the problem.  Her brain, her make-up and her biology were the problem.  Asking for help from such a system is counter-intuitive because the help on offer comes at great cost, including the potential loss of liberty.  My sister was sectioned and detained twice, but that is a whole other story that I do not have time to go into today.  Other costs are mind-altering medications and traumatising environments with very little therapeutic value, if any, despite the best efforts of those working in them.  Talking is almost discouraged in the mainstream mental health system because there is no one there to talk to and, as we all know, real talk therapy takes a great deal of time and investment.  Instead, the Band-Aids - the medications - are applied and the trauma for which people are there in the first place and the great stigma around mental health issues continue.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there are not even Band-Aids.  I sat with my sister once in an overcrowded accident and emergency department.  Later, she was locked into a stroke ward for safety.  I suppose people were kept there in case they wandered out.  She stayed there for a whole weekend and was then sent home with no mental health intervention at all.  She just could not face all of this anymore.  She had been there too many times, been traumatised and retraumatised, and been hit by the revolving door on the way out.<br/><br/>My sister's right to health and life was denied by a system that did not treat people holistically, medicated human distress over understanding it, and retraumatised them by wielding significant power over their lives.  For example, if people do not take their medications, they are seen as not having insight or as being non-compliant.  This can mean they have to stay longer in hospital.  Even if they are voluntary patients, the threat of being made involuntary is always there.  Over the years, my sister learned how to become a good patient and become compliant.  That takes people's voices away and makes them powerless.  Their voices are seen as not valid or not compliant.<br/><br/>If we want to change how we treat people in greatest need, we must start demanding it.  Last year, the World Health Organization released a report signalling the failure of biomedical mental health systems.  It stated that mental health systems overdiagnosed human distress and over-relied on psychotropic drugs to the detriment of psychosocial interventions, and that a fundamental shift within the mental health field was required.<br/><br/>We need to face up to the realisation that treating people with drugs is behaviour modification, not treatment.  We are giving people drugs to change their state of mind, not to cure some supposed underlying disease or biological abnormality.  We have all heard the stories about Kerry CAMHS in recent months.  I wonder how many young people are starting on the same path my sister was put on at 15 years of age.  Are young people being told they have a mental disorder for life and that they have to take medications for it?  Is that really how we are still treating our young people?<br/><br/>It is no longer acceptable that mental health services do not actively seek to get to the root of people's trauma.  Above anything else, this should be their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.  At the very least and as a matter of urgency, mental health services must be guided by human rights-based, person-centred principles and provide accurate and objective information.</p><p>This is basic informed consent, but it does not happen.  Services should seek to understand and address people's life experiences without coercive practices.  Again, this does not happen.  People should not be maintained on psychiatric drugs without close monitoring and a plan to reduce them as much as possible, but this is not the case.  We have to stop medicalising human distress.  We need to listen to people's stories and the growing chorus of expert evidence and research that says that mental health systems based on labels and drug treatment are not working and are, in fact, further harming and stigmatising people.</p><p> I thank members for listening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute.  I have been with the mental health services for the past 30 years or so under the Mental Health Treatment Act 1945 and the Mental Health Act 2001.</p> <p>  I will start on the subject of involuntary detainment and the proposals relating to medical treatments and electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, under the 2001 Act.  The Act requires that the responsible treating consultant psychiatrist explain to the involuntarily detained person in an understandable method and language the benefits, side effects and withdrawal symptoms of any proposed medical treatment or ECT.  The detainee should be given a minimum of 24 hours, but ideally 48 hours, to consider the proposed medical treatment or ECT, weigh the pros and cons of the information, make an informed decision and communicate with persons to assist him or her.  Where capacity is compromised, the detainee should be permitted to appoint a person whom he or she trusts to assist in any of the three ways listed below, having due regard, respect and consideration for the expressed will and preferences of the detainee and not the "best interests" approach, under which the person has no involvement in the decision-making process and outcome.</p> <p>  The three-tiered system is: appoint a person or persons to assist the detainee to understand the information relating to any proposed medical treatment or ECT so that he or she is in a position to make an informed decision; appoint a person or persons to assist the detainee to understand the information relating to any proposed medical treatment or ECT and make a combined decision with the person; and the courts appoint a representative, preferably somebody close to the person and trusted by him or her, to make decisions on his or her behalf.  While enduring power of attorney is an option available to the person, the decision to appoint someone to act on his or her behalf should his or her capacity become compromised requires careful consideration because it is wide open to abuse in terms of finances and property, particularly where older persons are concerned.</p> <p>  It is important to note that it does not automatically follow that an involuntarily detained person also lacks the capacity to make decisions.  A reservation is being sought to be placed on Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, on legal capacity, especially as regards psychosocial and mental health disabilities, which would be discriminatory and goes against Article 5 on equality and non-discrimination.  It is important to note that all individuals, when given the opportunity and option to appoint a person to assist them, even with compromised capacity, are capable of making a decision or a combined decision and of trusting someone to make decisions on their behalf.</p> <p>  Advanced medical directives are not legally binding in mental healthcare as they are in general medical services and the 2001 Act overrides the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 in its present format.</p><p>Upon admission, an involuntary detainee is provided with a copy of a guide to the Mental Health Act 2001, known as the blue book.  This is the most inappropriate time to give the booklet to a person because he or she may be too ill to read and understand the information regarding mental health tribunals or may be medicated to the hilt on admission.  The term "mental health tribunal" may lead to a misunderstanding of what a mental health tribunal consists of and should be changed to mental health "review board" rather than a "tribunal panel".  </p><p> A section 28 hearing should be explained fully to the involuntary detainee.  More often than not an involuntary detainment order is revoked prior to the initial hearing.  A detainee may not have what is defined as a "mental disorder" at the time of the tribunal and often a detainment order is revoked before a hearing can take place.  Many involuntary detainees are not given the opportunity to have their voices heard and their human rights vindicated by a mental health tribunal.</p></speech>

I will now invite members to ask questions before returning to the last three witnesses.  Deputy Ward is first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#L00300"><p>I thank all of the witnesses for coming here today.  It is very important that everyone's voice is heard in the context of this mental health (amendment) Bill to make sure that the legislation is fully inclusive.</p> <p>  My first question is for Dr. Morrissey.  She said we are all potential users of mental health services and I speak as someone who has used mental health services in the past.  I speak about it so often and so openly because I want to break down the stigma around mental health.  It is very important for people to have their voices heard and to talk about mental health as much as possible.  In the context of the heads of the Bill, the report commissioned by Mental Health Reform was very helpful, particularly its human rights analysis of the Mental Health Act.  What recommendations would Dr. Morrissey like to see prioritised in the subcommittee's report?  There are a number of recommendations in the human rights analysis but which ones would Dr. Morrissey like to see prioritised?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fiona Morrissey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#L00400"><p>I thank Deputy Ward for what is a very good question.  We want to prioritise a human rights-based approach primarily.  We want to move away from coercion or forcible treatment and taking people's decision-making rights away from them towards a system of support.  We want to see something similar to our Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act where people are supported to make decisions for themselves rather than having decisions made for them and being forcibly treated or deprived of their liberty.  We want people to be supported to make decisions around their mental health treatment.  We need to strengthen the presumption of capacity in the legislation and the requirement to provide people with supports to make decisions around their treatment.  That could be through support from a supportive decision maker or through independent advocacy.  A right to independent advocacy is quite important.</p> <p>  We need to move away from the ethos whereby it is presumed people do not have capacity to make decisions to a system where we presume they have capacity but they might need support to make decisions when they are unwell.  In the legislation we need to strengthen those presumptions, provide people with the support they need to make decisions, and move towards a system where coercion is the exception rather than the rule and is only used in very rare circumstances.  That would be a good start in terms of the legislation.</p> <p>  Another important issue is the regrading of power from voluntary to involuntary.  Once people are in the system, even if they were initially admitted on a voluntary basis, they can be made an involuntary patient at any time through the regrading powers under the Act.  In fact, the Bill erodes people's rights further.</p><p>Under previous legislation, people had to express a wish to leave but now they can actually be regraded without even having to express that wish.  Coercion pervades the whole system.  People are prevented from making decisions for themselves and are not supported to make their own decisions.  We need to start from the basis that we presume people have capacity and support them to make their own decisions around their treatment and care.  I hope that answers Deputy Ward's question.</p></speech>

Ms Anderson mentioned the advanced healthcare directives and the contradictions between the Mental Health Act and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  As someone who has used mental health services, what does Ms Anderson think needs to go into this Bill to strengthen the Mental Health Act?</p></speech>

This is deliberate as it is considered a sufficient time span for recovery and the person is more likely to co-operate and comply with treatment.  After the three months have expired, explicit consent must be obtained to continue with the medical treatment.  Should a person make the decision to cease medical treatment, irrespective of how unwise that decision may appear, it must be respected and adhered to.</p></speech>

That could be very useful.  I thank Ms Anderson for her response.</p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. O'Mahony.  In his opening statement he mentioned the Mental Health Act and the criminal justice system.  In his written submission he said it is regrettable the review of the 2001 Act, which we are now reviewing, has ignored the issue totally.  What would he like to see in this Bill on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.562" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Charles O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#M00500"><p>In the Green and White papers which informed the 2001 Act, there were proposals to provide for the assessment of people in the criminal justice system at the start of the process, before they are convicted, so they could access mental health services.  However, there was quite a lot of backlash to that in the 1990s, particularly from psychiatrists who did not want to see the courts having powers relating to diversion and diverting people out of the criminal justice system into mental health services.  When the 2001 Act was going through the Houses, those provisions were dropped, surprisingly, and Senator Mary Henry raised that issue in some of the debates on the 2001 legislation.  The Government gave a commitment to revisit the issue but it never did and the review of the Mental Health Act, which went on for more than ten years, did not engage with the criminal law aspects at all.</p> <p>  Diversion is a policy that has developed throughout the western world.  The aim is to divert people with mental health problems away from the criminal justice system, but we are a real outlier in that we have not developed an overarching policy.  We do not have provisions, procedures or legislative provisions to facilitate diversion and have a very piecemeal approach to it.  The 2001 Act needs to be amended to maximise the opportunities to divert people out of the criminal justice system and allow them to choose mental health treatment.  We need to take a problem-solving approach.  A recent report by the Inspector of Mental Health Services, Dr. Susan Finnerty, entitled Access to Mental Health Services for People in the Criminal Justice System, contains some very good proposals, including some law reform proposals that could be implemented through amendments to the 2001 Act.</p></speech>

Those reports are not good and are very damning of society.  This is an issue that must be included in the committee's report.</p> <p>  My last question relates to the complaints mechanism.</p><p>Dr. O'Mahony stated both adults and children should be entitled to avail of this complaints mechanism and that is very apt.  Representatives of CAMHS appeared before the Joint Committee on Health last week and we heard some heartbreaking stories of children being over-medicated without receiving any other treatments such as psychotherapy, occupational therapy or whatever else might be needed.  If Dr. O'Mahony had a magic wand, what would he make this independent complaints mechanism look like and how would it work?</p></speech>

In line with international best practice, there could be a mental health ombudsman, although that would, obviously, require additional resources, as will be the case for the Mental Health Commission and the inspector.  It is important that there be a mandate.  A number of amendments could be used to extend that mandate to the inspector in order that, when she and her team are carrying out their inspections, they can respond more robustly to complaints and there will be more accountability and oversight.  Moreover, they should be able to examine clinical decision-making in order that it will be more robust for people.</p> <p>  When people are detained, significant human rights issues arise, such as loss of liberty, forced drugging and ECT.  It is important, therefore, that there be a robust complaints mechanism.  The south Kerry CAMHS scandal, which has been in the news in recent weeks, showed what can happen with the lack of a complaints mechanism.  Issues may not be reported or responded to because people do not know whom to approach and there is not effective oversight by way of a complaints mechanism.</p></speech>

I have worked in independent advocacy for more than 25 years.  I currently work as an advocacy co-ordinator with the Social and Health Education Project, a community development and training organisation.  We provide advocacy support to all disabled people, including people who use mental health services.  Critical changes will need to happen if we are to move towards a more humane and human rights-based legislative mental health framework.  That is supported by what has been said during this meeting regarding the importance of the UN convention, the special rapporteur, the WHO reports and our assisted decision-making legislation.</p> <p>  I want to raise two points that relate to being a voluntary patient and the protection of my liberty.  If I am admitted as a voluntary patient and I remain a voluntary patient, yet I am not allowed to leave, as I have witnessed in my work primarily because people have nowhere to go, I have no protection of my liberty and I am deprived of my liberty.  This does nothing to protect my human rights.  I do not think the Mental Health Act addresses this.  I have witnessed the issue of the intermediate person being of particular concern when a person may be doubly labelled, or diagnosed as having both an intellectual disability and a mental health difficulty.  To address this in the current legislation, which is not fully enhanced in regard to human rights, there needs to be access to independent advocacy to support the human rights of the person.  I have witnessed service providers struggling to address this matter and the value of independent advocacy in challenging this deprivation of liberty and supporting a person's wish to leave.</p> <p>  Draft safeguarding legislation has been mentioned.  It is hoped this might address the matter in some way, although I hold reservations about the paternalism in the general scheme of the Bill.  There appears to be no progress on this, only the addition of this intermediate person, and while I fully accept this will afford some access to redress and respect of rights, as other speakers have said, the voluntary position is very similar regardless of the judgment on a person's lack of capacity.  I have grave concerns this will not be used because a person requires treatment in an approved centre but rather because people have nowhere to go.  I have witnessed cases of people having stayed in units for more than ten years in this position, and I cannot begin to imagine what that must be like.</p><p> As regards the statutory right of access to independent advocacy, if I am detained under the Mental Health Act, I should have a statutory right of access to independent advocacy besides the right of advocacy to legal representation.  Legal representation, unless it is provided in such a way that fully comprehends a human rights-based approach to mental health that involves going beyond the confines of the medical, does not suffice.  Any situation in a civilised world which means that a person is deprived of liberty because of his or her health warrants access to independent advocacy support to ensure our voices will be heard and our rights respected.  We have a responsibility to respond to the UN convention and to develop our legal framework to honour our ratification of this convention.  Other jurisdictions have embedded a statutory right to independent advocacy in their mental health legislation for many years, and with this comes the requirement to resource independent advocacy adequately.  I carry some reservations because, if it is resourced to support a statutory right only where a person is involuntarily detained, that is not good enough.  Scotland has overcome this in legislation by making independent advocacy a statutory right for a person at any point in the mental health system.</p><p> Those aspects are important to remember at this moment, but the bigger question is when we will move from the inhumane actions of coercion and control in the name of treatment.  This legislation is being reviewed in the context of improving a system that we already have and that already fails us in respect of human rights.  How can we go beyond the scope of this limited and medicalised model in this legislation?  I do not think we can, but the smaller steps would go some way to getting us there.  If we enact legislation in the spirt of human rights, this Act should not exist, although that is not going to happen today or tomorrow.  We now have legislation that provides a human rights framework to address our health needs, namely, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which we hope will finally replace the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871, in 2022.  If, at times, we may need extra support to speak for ourselves about decisions being made about our health and our lives, this Act affords us that support.  Why, therefore, do we need the Mental Health Act?  Wherever and whenever we are trying to make informed decisions about our own lives in systems where power is inequitable and professionals are not listening, access to independent advocacy is of critical importance in supporting that process.</p></speech>

My first questions are for Ms Lillis, although Dr. O'Mahony might also have something to say.  I might explore the issue of independent advocacy and how it might look in real terms.  Ms Lillis was clear it is not just about legal representation but that it is a broader issue.  In her estimation and that of anyone else who wishes to give one, who would fulfil that role and at what point in proceedings would he or she be triggered into action?  At what point would the representative advocate for the person?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Lillis" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#O00400"><p>There is some discussion and debate about who would fulfil the role.  There is a clear commitment to developing peer-led advocacy, but I am not sure how open the current peer-led advocacy service is to people with intellectual disabilities.  There should be a breadth of capacity in respect of the independent advocacy resource in order that it will not restrict itself in regard to whom it might serve, including children and young people aged 16 to 18, who may also be in need of an independent advocate.  There is scope for discussion.  The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities is growing, strong and independent of the HSE but it is not necessarily a peer-led service.  There has to be some scope for development and discussion in that regard, although I am just a small cog in a small organisation in this advocacy world.  There needs to be space to discuss the issue, or else there will be only competition between forms of advocacy, which does not serve us well at all.</p> <p>  On when the advocacy might be triggered, we have heard during this meeting that it is no good giving the blue book, or whatever it is now called, to a person when he or she is in a state of extreme distress as he or she walks through the door.</p><p>An advocate should be available when a person walks in the door.  If I am correct, advocacy is referred to in many places throughout the report Dr. Morrissey and Dr. O'Mahony have written with regard to the human rights approach in nearly every section, which talks about rights relating to consent, care planning, support in writing an advanced healthcare directive and mental health tribunals, and its recommendations.  I hope Dr. Morrissey and Dr. O'Mahony will tell me if I am mistaken.  It needs to be there from the beginning to the end and beyond.  In Scotland, people may have access to independent advocacy support before they go into hospital so there is someone to support them and to speak for them in respect of what their advanced healthcare directive says regarding what does and does not help them.  It may say that it helps to have somebody who is in the community, a person they can speak to.  In the UK, this has been categorised as falling under involuntary detention.  It is not sufficient because it happens at the last minute.  It has to be across mental health service provision, just as it is in Scotland's legislation.</p></speech>

With regard to the general scheme, advocacy needs to be put on a statutory footing.  It is recognised in the general scheme but there is no provision made for it and no funding source provided so that is quite meaningless in the current format.  It is very clear that, for advocacy to be effective and independent, it has to be independent of the HSE, the Mental Health Commission and the decision-making support service.  That should also be specified in the legislation.  It also needs to be peer-led.  It is a core requirement that people with lived experience lead the advocacy service.  There needs to be statutory provisions to ensure that advocates live up to the role and funding needs to be provided.  It is also core that advocates receive human rights training relating to the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the European Convention on Human Rights.  That is core if we are to have an effective independent advocacy service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fiona Morrissey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#P00300"><p>Dr. O'Mahony covered some of what I was going to say but it should be an automatic right and it is critical that advocacy be independent.  Even the legal representation people have at mental health tribunals is not adequate.  They should also have an automatic right to an independent advocate because the legal representation does not always represent people's wishes, views and preferences.  Human rights training is critical.  This is also a key support under the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities to support people to make their decisions.  We need to give people the support they need to enable them to make decisions for themselves.  Independent advocacy is a key part of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.575" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Liz Brosnan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#P00400"><p>This is a very good question.  I agree with everything that has been said.  It is very important that independent funding and independent sources be provided to build up the capacity of a group that can actually step up as an independent advocate.  It should be people with lived experience but people with lived experience need an awful lot of help to overcome many of the barriers faced by marginalised groups such as ours.  Creating places and mechanisms to train people in human rights and in the values and principles of the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities and ensuring we can translate them into the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill is important.  It is only when we get the resources and supports needed to build a strong independent user movement in this country that things will begin to change and that people will be able to step in and step up as peer advocates and peer support workers with the ability to resist capture by the mental health service and the whole ethos of coercive control I mentioned before.  We need supports to build the strength of a movement that can help people.  We are one of the last marginalised groups of people in this country.  We are not recognised and not helped to step out of the chains that many of us are in.  We want to believe the mental health services are doing things in our best interest but, in fact, they are actually keeping us captive.</p><p>As Ms Lillis said, independent peer advocacy at the time can help and support people not to need involuntary treatment.  Every one of us wants to keep people out of the services and for those who go into the services to get the best support and help possible, but we also want to help people to step beyond the cognitive capture that happens within services.  I echo everything.  It is very important we build in strong supports.  I thank the Deputy for the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.577" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#Q00200"><p>I will just come in on the question of mental health tribunals.  A section 28 hearing should be explained fully to the involuntary detainee.  More often than not, an involuntary detainment order is revoked prior to the initial hearing.  Many involuntary detainees are therefore not given the opportunity to have their voices heard and their rights considered and vindicated.  Neither do they have the opportunity to stand their ground and defend their corner.  Many do not have the skills, the confidence and the voice to speak on their own behalf.  When legal representatives are appointed by the Mental Health Commission, they are there to protect the patient's interests, but they do not really know the story behind the person.  A person is not just to be listened to but to be actively heard.  I will leave it there.</p></speech>

I will go back to the issue Dr. O'Mahony raised with regard to the criminal justice system and diversion mechanisms.  He mentioned things like proposals for law reform.  A body of work seems to have been done on that.  Does Dr. O'Mahony envisage that as something that would live within the current legislative work or does it require separate and different work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Charles O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#Q00400"><p>It depends on the pace at which the legislation goes forward.  Proposals were developed previously and there have been recommendations from the inspector, who envisages a number of different powers for the courts to refer people for assessment and treatment with the mental health services.  That would require a new part in the legislation if it was to be included.  It was very regrettable that, even though it was raised as part of the review process, this oversight and massive gap was not addressed.  It may delay the legislation but it would require a specific part within the legislation if it was to be included.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#Q00500"><p>That is an important point for all of us.  It should live in this legislation although it may need other supporting pieces down the road.  I will turn to Dr. Morrissey who, at the beginning, spoke a little bit about stigmatising language.  We are trying to be very aware of those things but it is a live issue and moves all of the time.  Will Dr. Morrissey outline her concerns in that regard to us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.581" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fiona Morrissey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#Q00600"><p>The language in the current Act is improved somewhat in the Bill but these improvements do not go far enough.  We need to use the language used in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Using terms like "mental disorder" suggests people are disordered.  We need to start focusing on people's strengths rather than on their deficits.  The change from "patient" to "person" is very welcome, but we need to move away from terms like "mental disorder" and even "mental illness".  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities refers to people with psychosocial disabilities and people who experience psychosocial distress.  We need to move away from that language because language is very powerful.  It can label a person and such a label can be a great burden.  Once you have that diagnosis or label, everything you do in your life is questioned.  We need to be very aware of the language we use in respect of people.  It is primarily a question of talking about people as equal human beings, the same as ourselves, rather than talking about them as being disordered in any way.</p><p>It is just different degrees or levels of human distress that we all experience.  We need to move away from that language throughout the Act and the proposed draft Bill.  We need to get rid of terms such as "mental disorder" for sure.</p></speech>

I will finish with a short discussion around the issue of coercive control.  It overlaps a little with the discussion around involuntary treatments.  Our guests have done a brilliant job of outlining the concerns around coercive control and how it relates to issues such as involuntary treatments.  Is that a larger or separate piece of work or something they would see threaded through this legislation?  It is back to the question whether coercive control is something that goes beyond the scope of when a person is an inpatient, whether is similar to independent advocacy in that it should be a consideration throughout a person's experience of service provision, and where that would best live and how we would address that.  I do not know who wants to answer that.  It is an open question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.584" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Liz Brosnan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#R00300"><p>I want to come in on this point because it is a critical point.  I thank Deputy Hourigan for raising the question.</p> <p>  Everything that permeates the culture and ethos within services revolves around coercion.  To make a difference, I would like to see some thought given to whether it could be mentioned as a concept that is now emerging in legislation to support women - incidentally, a happy International Women's Day to my sisters here - where I understand some efforts are being made to address the issue of people experiencing coercive relationships by providing for a code for criminal coercion in that area of law.  Perhaps it is possible for the creative minds of people on the committee and within Government, people who experience this and us to be creative and to capture it within the guiding principles or the opening statement, being mindful that it is something we need to find ways to address.  There should be a strong emphasis on freedom and supporting people in terms of independent advocacy and their rights and providing funding to strong peer-developed projects.  We have projects around the world, such as Soteria and the Leeds peer-run crisis houses, to which I hope others will speak.  We have examples around the world of places where people can find alternatives to the control that happens within services.</p> <p>  It is not a direct answer.  It is a plea for us to begin to think more and to divert more funding into alternatives to the system we have.  I do not believe it is possible to replace it but let us please find some way to divert more funding and resources into building up the capacity of the independent peer-run and peer-support services.</p></speech>

They are connected but they are separate as well.  Coercion can certainly be organised through legislation; I am not quite sure about control.  We have heard about abuse of power.  We have heard Dr. Brosnan talking about a very different type of service.  Control is also a cultural, and not only a legislative, issue.  A cultural shift and a cultural change is a much more difficult thing to address.  They are two separate but connected issues.</p> <p>  I certainly support what Dr. Brosnan has said about alternative services because there are good examples of services where there is hardly any control and no coercion at all.</p></speech>

I refer to the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  At this moment in time, can there be some further look at how the two Acts interact and how, if we are working to a system of supported decision-making, that immediately shifts the culture and the legislation in relation to coercion?  The idea of a briefing on the 2015 Act sounds wonderful.  That is really important at this moment, especially as it is now coming, hopefully, into full operation in the summer of this year.  That may help the current draft.</p></speech>

The issue there around cultural change is critical.  We need to effect cultural change in practice and human rights training within our services.  The WHO now has an equality rights training programme, which we need to implement in our services to help people to move away from coercion and challenge the assumptions that we all have around coercion.  We need to use it towards a system where we are supporting people.</p> <p>  We do not need to use coercion.  It is a practice that has built up over time.  We need to move away from coercion and control under the legislation within our services as well.</p></speech>

It is a Dutch name.  I thank the committee for inviting me to speak here this morning.</p> <p>  I will be brief because most of what I intended to say has already been said.  It feels as though I am at a conference that I and others organise every year which is called the Critical Voices Network Ireland conference.  Everything that has been said here this morning I have listened to over the past 14 or 15 years.  Unfortunately, we have not made much progress.  I will say a little about Critical Voices Network Ireland and then I will say a little more about the WHO guidance report, which came out last year and has been mentioned already.</p> <p>  Critical Voices Network Ireland, of which I am a representative here today, is a broad network of service users whom we have heard today, carers about whom we have heard today, professionals about whom we are hearing today, and academics and national campaigning and advocacy groups all of which are looking for a mental health system not based on the traditional biomedical model.  The concerns expressed here this morning capture well some of the concerns that individuals, groups and communities have been expressing about mental health care in Ireland for many years.</p><p>Such concerns refer not only to coercive practices and lack of treatment and care choices, but also to abuse of professional power, over-reliance on and excessive use of medication, discrimination and stigmatisation, inhumane physical conditions in hospital units and lack of meaningful community-based alternatives to hospitalisation.  We have heard references to that this morning. <br/><br/>Critical Voices Network Ireland provides a broad platform to discuss and debate concerns and share new initiatives and ideas.  Every year, we get about 500 people coming to Cork for two days to discuss themes such as recovery, medicalisation, meanings of madness, trauma and distress, the value of psychiatric diagnosis, the therapy industry, activism and acts of resistance and safe spaces.  This year's conference is on 16 and 17 November.  I hope members can come to Cork to discuss issues around the notion of self-experience.  What does &quot;self-experience&quot; mean?  We talk so much about it.  It is a common theme and term.  Whose &quot;self-experience&quot; is referred to?  That is my plug about Critical Voices Network Ireland.<br/><br/>It is not easy to influence policymakers, as we are trying to do this morning.The campaign to delete section 59(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Mental Health Act 2001 had limited success.  We were able to get rid of the word &quot;unwilling&quot;, but &quot;unable&quot; remains in the legislation, so concerns about involuntary treatment remain.  People can still have ECT against their will if they are deemed to be unable but no longer where they are unwilling.<br/><br/>In the wider context of transforming mental health care provision in Ireland, the attention of members has been drawn to the WHO guidance document, which they may have in their possession.  If they do not, I urge them to get hold of it.  It is entitled Guidance on Community Mental Health Services: Promoting Person-Centred and Rights-Based Approaches and affirms that mental health care must be grounded in a human rights-based approach, as is clear.At the launch last June, Dr. Michelle Funk stated:</p><blockquote>	This comprehensive new guidance provides a strong argument for a much faster transition from mental health services that use coercion and focus almost exclusively on the use of medication to manage symptoms of mental health conditions, to a more holistic approach that takes into account the specific circumstances and wishes of the individual and offers a variety of approaches for treatment and support ... </blockquote><p>We have heard that reflected this morning.  It is all set out in the CRPD.  A few countries have established the frameworks necessary to meet the far-reaching changes but many more have not.<br/><br/>The guidance is intended primarily for people with responsibility for organising and managing mental health care.  It presents details of what is required in areas such as mental health law, policy and strategy, service delivery, financing, workforce development and civil society participation in order for mental health services to be compliant with the CRPD.  The guidance report contains examples of good practice.  I will offer an example with which members may be familiar.  Ireland is represented by an example of a community-based mental health service that has demonstrated good practice in respect of non-coercive practices, community inclusion and respect of people&rsquo;s legal capacity.  That is the Home Focus project in west Cork.<br/><br/>That is all I wanted to say and it reflects what I have been listening to for the last 15 years.  It is interesting that it has moved to a different arena and, hopefully, we can stay in that arena for a bit longer because that is where the influences can be made.</p></speech>

It has been useful and powerful and has given us things to think about.</p><p>Early in the presentation, reference was made to stigmatising language.  Will the witnesses tease out the correlation between the stigmatising language used in legislation and the direct impact on patients?  Sometimes people can see things as just words.  Will the witnesses draw the link between the two so we can understand it when we think about the language used in this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fiona Morrissey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#U00200"><p>That is a good question.  I think Deputy Hourigan was talking about it as well.  That stigmatising language is important because when discriminatory language is used, it affects a person's identity and role in society and it devalues them.  When you talk about people with a mental disorder, it becomes an othering.  You are talking about these other people.  That is why at the beginning of the session I said this applies to all of us.  It is not some people out there with mental disorders.  It is just human beings who experience mental or human distress.  When we use language that makes people different or equates to othering, we start dehumanising people and talking their human rights away.</p> <p>  Language is important and that is why the CRPD did not use any of that medicalised language.  It used terms like "psychosocial disability".  It did not define "disability" because there can be different levels of human distress and of disability.  I have heard people talk about having a mental disorder and, therefore, not being able to do certain things in their lives, such as getting married or making decisions for themselves, and having no control over their lives.</p> <p>  When you undermine somebody's value in society by labelling them in stigmatising and discriminatory language, you undermine their identity and society's perception of them.  It is important to move away from such language to more human rights-based language where people are seen as equal human beings with the same rights we all have.  That is why it is critical that we allow people to make decisions for themselves and that we do not take rights like their legal capacity away from them.  We all need different supports to make decisions and we should give them the supports to do that.  The language in the legislation is powerful in terms of society's perception of people experiencing mental distress.  We need to move away from that sort of language if we want to move to a society where it is accepted and people are treated with respect.</p></speech>

People with lived experience of mental health issues and service users experience a form of discrimination that has no name.  Every other form of discrimination and stigmatised behaviour has a label, whether sexism, racism, Islamophobia or any other aspect of people's identity by which they are marginalised.  Language is important.  Many of us are silenced and it is difficult to find words to speak about the way people are set up as subjects under mental health law.</p> <p>  I urge in the strongest possible terms that we use the word "person", bearing in mind that any person can, due to the vagaries of life, end up requiring mental health services.  Finding respectful language helps us to build that sense of value and worth to combat the discrimination that has no name.</p><p>Some people use the word "sanism".  Everybody is presumed to be sane unless he or she comes into contact with mental health services but it is not a very comfortable word and we are trying to find a new way to speak about it.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Charles O'Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#V00200"><p>One of the positive things in the Bill is the alignment of the guiding principles with the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  One of the regrettable things about the 2001 Act was that the notion of best interests in respect of adults was used by the courts to let some mental health services off when they did not comply with the legislation.  The courts took a very paternalistic approach in a number of cases where individuals had challenged the legality of their detention.  It is very important that there is a push back against any attempt to undermine those revised guiding principles in the Bill or any suggestion that these principles be changed.</p> <p>  The language is very important.  Head 5, section 4(9) limits the scope of the revised guiding principles with a caveat that the provision of mental health services is subject to the availability of resources.  This should be deleted because it could undermine the more positive guiding principles that are now included in the Bill.  I encourage the committee to take a look at that and recommend the removal of that caveat to the revised guiding principles.</p></speech>

It is always useful for us to have specific issues to focus on and chase after.  A couple of weeks ago, doctors and medical professionals appeared before the committee.  One witness spoke about a colleague who, as a GP in Australia, prescribed medication for about 30% of patients with mental health difficulties whereas in Ireland, she found herself prescribing for nearly 100% of such patients.  I asked the witnesses whether she thought we were overprescribing and there was broad acceptance that we are because of the lack of other supports and resources.  I know we had a conversation earlier about the biomedical model and mental health systems where we are prescribing for behaviour modification but not dealing with more significant issues.  Could anyone comment on what was said from the perspective of GPs, overprescribing, including prescribing for up to 100% of patients, and what we are talking about today, which is from a more patient advocacy perspective?  I do not want to make correlations or links between the two that are not there but I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' thoughts and the impact that would have.</p></speech>

No alternatives have been developed.  There is a funding stream into a very biomedical system, which might explain why there is a different approach in different jurisdictions.  One of the recommendations in our report on mental health reform was that consideration be given to a right to community mental health services.  A Vision for Change, which is largely unimplemented, was predicated on the notion of developing community mental health services but we have not seen the development of those services.  A right to community mental health services in the amending legislation would be welcome.  It would signal a commitment to moving to alternatives and away from coercion, which is something that should be given serious consideration.</p></speech>

We know from experience that when a doctor does not have time to listen to people even in general practice and to explore the issue bringing the person to seek help, the easy solution is used because of the weight of medical education, theory and all of the funding from the pharmaceutical industry in terms of research.</p><p>This powerful lobby makes it far easier for people to give drugs than to spend time listening to people.  This is not to say that on some occasions, although very rarely, with somebody presenting in a state of extreme distress, some medication could be used to alleviate that.  In effect, the drugs are called antipsychotics, which are usually given to people with long-term conditions.  They have a lot of metabolic side effects that are very often not spoken about and they have consequences for physical bodies so people end up more likely to die younger.  They often put that down to the fact that many people smoke and they attribute increased mortality rates of people who use mental health services to that.  They rarely look at the effect of the drugs on people's bodies because they are very powerful drugs and are used far more than they need to be.  Joanna Moncrieff, a psychiatrist in the UK, would speak very strongly to the fact that these are very powerful medicines that are overused and often used in combination so there is polypharmacy.  To be fair, I have come across some concerns about this discussion among professionals in mental health services.</p><p> There is a push to develop more access to talking therapies within mental health services.  That is what people want.  They want access to a safe space to talk about the underlying issues.  It could not have been clearer from what Ms Hough said earlier about what she felt her sister did not get.  Doctors are under too much pressure with too little time, too many people to see and too few resources.  Community mental health teams need to be fully resourced and they need to be multidisciplinary because each and every discipline in mental health has a unique and important aspect to offer people who use the services.  Owing to the dominance of psychiatry, quite often the first position that is filled is that of psychiatrist and it then trickles down so it is very hard to rebalance the power of psychiatry.  Often when psychiatrists do not know what to do or do not have the time, falling back on overmedication is a human response to the pressure they may be under because of lack of resources for mental health services.  Services are so underfunded.  I know that during Covid, the first aspect of services to falter involved the community teams that had been developed because staff working in teams were pulled back into trying to cope with the acute units as these are the services that are currently legislated for under mental health legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennifer Hough" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#W00200"><p>I echo what Dr. Brosnan said.  The minute someone in Ireland comes into contact with mental health services or even a GP, drug treatment is the first line treatment.  It does not matter whether it is depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.</p><p>No matter where a patient's ailment falls on the spectrum, drug treatment is the answer.  My sister was on four or five different medications at one time.  We talk about access to services.  My sister was lucky enough, if that is the right phrase, to access private services in Ireland, which meant she was put on even more drugs than she would have been in the public service.  It is crazy.  She was left walking around unsupervised and unmonitored while on four or five antipsychotic medications.  We call them antipsychotics but they are really just tranquilisers.  An antidepressant could be thrown in too.  Those medications are seen to be working if the person plateaus back to a baseline.  They are working the way they are meant to work.  They dampen the person's emotions, numb them and make them able to be a normal person who can walk around in society but that is not getting to the core problem.  Of course, that is why we have a revolving door system.  People are taking drugs that are only maintaining them.  It is an enormous problem and unless we get to grips with it, people are never going to achieve their human rights.  Some people are lucky enough to recover but it is very difficult.  One cannot challenge accepted notions and say the drugs are a problem because there is no mechanism for patients to taper off their drugs within the current system.  The British Psychological Society produced an excellent paper last year intended to help professionals to help people taper off their medication.  We have nothing like that in Ireland yet.  We need to be able to support people to come off their medication but, of course, other resources are then required to support them, including talk therapies and all of that.  This is crucial.  It is a topic about which I am very passionate.  It is at the core of everything.  We just give people medication and that is it.  I could go on but I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

That is an area that people, even independent advocates, are reluctant to touch because it is seen as the territory of the clinicians.  The work we are doing is trying to address that issue within a human rights context.  We are developing workshops and dialogue sessions relating to informed consent to deliver to people using services and healthcare professionals.  There is language of shared consent and shared decision-making in the clinical world that I am familiar with but we want to move to a place where people are empowered to ask questions about their medication, to ask whether a review has happened, to ask about the side effects of a medication and to ask whether there are any other options.  Stemming from work conducted in the UK, we also want to encourage service providers to sign up to a pledge to honour a human rights-based approach to the prescribing of medication.  We would be happy to talk more about that to the Senator if she is interested.</p></speech>

Advocacy could support those patients to taper off their medications in consultation with their clinicians.  We are looking for that kind of supported decision-making.  We must remember that we have resources but they are all going into the area of medication and not into the alternatives and other supports.  That does not cost a lot of money.  The problem is that all of the resources at the moment are going into one area when we need to provide other supporting resources, such as independent advocacy and other supports, so that people can be supported to make decisions around medications.  Such  a system does not exist at the moment but it is critical.</p></speech>

I would be interested to learn more.  In the same way it is for Deputy Ward, this is a very personal topic to me, especially issues around tapering the use of medication.  When I was a very young woman, there were many complexities around those issues and perhaps some day I will be more confident to speak about my experiences more publicly.  The human rights framework and informed consent elements are very important.  Sometimes, particularly in crisis situations or dire situations, one is told there is only one way.  Perhaps that is sometimes the case in a crisis moment but it cannot be the only way forever.  At some point, a patient will come off the bottom.  A patient is told there is only one way and at no point does someone ask the patient if he or she would like to have a conversation.  I am particularly interested in that aspect of the matter and I would be interested to hear more about it because, as I said, it is a personal topic to me.</p><p>I will ask a question that I also asked of some medical professionals who were before the committee a few weeks ago.  We are working on a piece of legislation and our guests' job is to come in and point out the flaws and problems with it and suggest ways in which we can improve it.  Are we on the right track with this legislation?  Is it fit for purpose?  We have been talking about this for the past ten or 15 years.  Are we on track to having a gold standard or world-class standard of service, or even just good legislation, that would protect, support and provide care and compassion for the people who will be affected by it?  This legislation will affect fewer people than some other pieces of legislation we look at.  Are we going in the right direction in terms of how we need to treat or support our patients with mental health issues?  I am talking specifically about this Bill.  We all know our thoughts about the mental health supports sector overall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.614" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fiona Morrissey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#Y00200"><p>It is an improvement to be talking about a person rather than a patient and things like that.  Moving away from the "best interests" approach is an improvement on what we have had before.  However, we still have a long way to go and there are many things we need to change.  We really need to enshrine the UNCRPD approach into the legislation to make it human rights-based.  That needs to permeate the whole legislation and that is not the case at the moment.  Once we have powers within the legislation whereby people are deemed unable to make decisions and their capacity to make decisions about treatment and other matters is taken away from them, we are going in the wrong direction.  No matter what oversight we provide through, say, multidisciplinary professionals or an independent consultant psychiatrist, it does not provide the human rights protections people need.  Neither do mental health tribunals.  I know that because I remember those tribunals.  In some cases, tribunals can legitimise coercion.  We need to be careful about the direction we are going in terms of human rights.  Are we putting our resources and money into the wrong area?  Do we need to fundamentally change our focus to support people and not take away their decision-making capacity?  The underlying theme of the legislation is that we are still taking decision-making away from people and we are not treating them in accordance with their will and preferences.  We need to move more towards putting the person's will and preferences at the centre of everything we do in the legislation and when we do that, we are then going towards a supported decision-making model and putting those supports in place.</p> <p>  This legislation is an improvement but it needs to go further and to move more towards the model in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  We also need a cultural change in practice and to educate people.  We need to enshrine that throughout the legislation.  We are moving a small bit in the right direction but we have a lot further to go in terms of the supports we put in place.  Things such as advanced healthcare directives must ensure services are equally available for everybody, including independent advocacy and all the other projects we have talked about at this meeting.  We need to go further, to be honest.</p></speech>

There are positive elements in the Bill as published but there are also many deficits.  The UNCRPD requires us to abolish mental health laws because they are discriminatory.  It is clear we are not going to do that.  We are going to retain those laws and try to enhance the procedural safeguards.  That does not sufficiently address our human rights obligations and that is why, in the recommendations we made in that report, there are many practical suggestions on how the Bill can be refined to allow for better procedural safeguards.  For example, as Dr. Morrissey said, tribunals are not a meaningful or effective mechanism to review detention.  There is a lack of independent advocacy and other mechanisms.  All those components are core in the absence of abolishing mental health laws to make sure people's rights are vindicated and that effective procedural safeguards are in place.</p></speech>

I will make a couple of points about the tapering off of medication.  There is an absolute need for a structural approach to the tapering off of medication.</p><p>People in this country are desperate for help and assistance with that.  That is one point.</p><p> We in the our rights and medication group would love to meet Senator Hoey.  Second, I am surprised - maybe I do not know enough about it - but does anybody know about the WHO guidance document?  Is that not the guiding document that should drive policy in Ireland on mental health development and services?  Is it going to end up on the shelf?  It contains so much information.  There is so much guidance, including technical guidance and everything.  It should drive matters.  Is it going to end up on the shelf?  I do not know.  Anyway, that is my point.</p></speech>

If it can be aligned with that, then we are moving more towards a gold standard.</p></speech>

I enjoyed reading their statements this morning when coming up to Dublin.  Much has been covered.  I hear what they are saying about the assisted decision stuff, the advanced healthcare directives and the coercion, which is very difficult to control or police, should we say, at the moment.</p> <p>  I am very interested in what Dr. O'Mahony and others said about this being advocacy- and community-led.  In this country we normally have two options.  We are reactive instead of proactive when it comes to addressing problems.  We do a great job of burying them more so than sorting them.  Dr. O'Mahony mentioned community-led mental health services.  Even though we are talking in technical terms and about the general scheme of the mental health (amendment) Bill and what we can do to strengthen it, we have members within the mental health service who are trying to move away from community-led mental health services.  Thus, in terms of where we are starting today and where we have started before, we have constantly met resistance.  I do not know what it is.  I was very interested in the advanced healthcare directives and advocacy groups.  I have a situation at the moment, if I am allowed to say it, with the Owenacurra Centre in my own town.  It is a mental health respite centre.  It has been working.  It is a model of consistency and excellence.  Is there a way for the likes of an advocacy group to represent the members and the patients - or should I say the residents, because many of them are there long-term and are very happy there - and their views?</p> <p>  The other point I want to address is the overprescibing of medicines.  This has been a bugbear of mine for years.  I will not mention the company or anything but I remember an anti-depressant on which the patent was running out.  The company was going to discredit this old anti-depressant because it was bringing out a new one.  I actually have the paperwork in my possession.  What amazed me in this case was it was the company that was pushing this.  It was supported by a payment by a doctor to sign off on it to vindicate it.  We were talking about trying to reduce the level of medication.  The statement issued by the company stated that one is no good, that it would admit what it would not admit in the past, namely, that there were side effects but that this one is so good you do not even have to wean yourself off it and you can go straight onto it.</p><p> There is one major problem because it is industry-led when it comes to prescribing medicines.  On this side, we are trying to work on mental health issues and be patient-centred, which is very important, but I am worried about being rights-centred.  We all have experience within the mental health services, whether we worked in them, used the services or visit people within them.  Do not get me wrong, it is not in every sector but it seems to be top-heavy with management.  If management do not have control then those on the advocacy side of it will not be welcome because they are stepping on the management's patch.  There is one centre and one problem.  The other side of it I am looking at is how we can work together.  Working with groups like those represented by our guests, I am interested in how the advocacy can get into the community faster.  How large are our guests as a group or entity?  What can we do to help each other, working within the mental health services?</p><p> As a final point, even though we are working on the general scheme, should there be specific rules included such that when the Mental Health Act is done and people within that system fail to keep those standards, there would be repercussions for them as well?  There is a lot there.</p></speech>

I got some of it.  On the last part, we need to support people who are working in the system.  We need to educate them on human rights.  I suppose we do not want to punish people who are working in the system who just may not realise the impact of the things they are doing on people.  This is about educating everybody and working together.  It is about collaborating with people with lived experience as equal partners and having user-led services and working together with all partners as equal partners.  I do not think it is a good idea to punish people.  It is important to support people with lived experience but also to support those working in the services to protect human rights and educate them on the impact of some of the decisions they are making or approaches they are taking.  The more we hear the voice of lived experience and put it to the forefront of our services, the more we can do that.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned advanced healthcare directives.  They are really important tools for opening up the conversation with professionals and people with lived experience so you are forced to have that conversation, listen to the person and respect his or her will and preferences.  If you do not have that conversation, you do not know what the person's wishes are.  How then can you respect his or her wishes if you do not even know what they are because you have not had that conversation?  We need to have continuity of care around that as well so the person is dealing with the same people and that his or her wishes are written down in this legally binding statement.  It is important we work together and try to move forward together rather than alienating or demonising any one group of people.</p></speech>

On the first point about advocacy supporting people who may be in residential situations, our small group SHEP is very poorly resourced but over the past ten years we have been supporting people in congregated settings to have a voice in the process of moving away from those.  Some of those people would have been moved from Our Lady's, sent to places that are other institutions and been told they were there from three months and then been there for 20 years, so there is space for advocacy to facilitate that kind of collective voice in the community as well.</p><p>There is a danger sometimes - this is happening in other places - that one-to-one, independent, issue-based advocacy takes away the space to provide collective advocacy spaces.  I am aware that the Irish Advocacy Network has tried to offer that in other spaces, but all advocacy is very poorly resourced, wherever it is.  One advocate could serve all psychiatric inpatient units and then try to serve populations of people collectively.  I am not speaking for advocates but I am speaking of what I witness here.  I hope I am not speaking in the wrong way.  It is from my understanding.  If there are spaces for facilitating collective advocacy in the sphere of independent advocacy, specifically with regard to community, we can enhance the collective voice.</p></speech>

This is Ms Wilson's statement:</p> <blockquote> 	This presentation is my story of my ... mental health episodes treated in Irish hospitals.  I don't like remembering and disclosing these periods of &ldquo;Deep Depression with Psychotic Symptoms&rdquo;.  Symptoms which included overwhelming guilt. </blockquote> <p>Ms Wilson's statement reads that she does it to use her voice in solidarity and to help to counteract stigma.</p> <blockquote> 	My first breakdown was in 2001 when I was 63. This came as a shock to me and my family, my first mental health episode in my hard-working life rearing 4 children and working full time as a lecturer in London Colleges and for the Open University.  I was committed to the County Hospital, my clothes were removed for 10 days ... my husband and sister were told ECT was the best treatment, I was not told anything, the how and what and why of it. </blockquote> <p>Ms Wilson wrote a poem on ECT soon after.  I do not have the attachment because it did not come in.  Her statement reads that one consultant told her it was her brain chemistry and was probably genetic and that she should talk to her four children, as they may also be affected.  The statement also reads that no one considered the underlying factors probably related to her childhood and that the consultant's words made her feel branded and even guiltier and more fearful.</p> <blockquote> 	Again in 2017 I became very depressed, and my doctor arranged my admission to another hospital as I had moved house.  I was there for six months; my psychotic symptoms were very severe and I was not improving ... My consultant told my family he needed to use ECT as a last resort and they agreed but I didn't.  A tribunal was set up where I argued my case with a lawyer appointed to support me.  However, the tribunal agreed with the consultant, and I was made an involuntary patient and given 12 sessions of ECT.  For the last one the consultant asked me to take it as a voluntary patient and I agreed.  Although I can remember my psychoses there is a lot about the hospital that I don't recall.  For me ECT wipes my memory ... Because I am under Old Age Psychiatry, I receive very good after care mainly by visits from Community Nurse Team. </blockquote> <p>In light of the above, Ms Wilson argues strongly that the human rights model enshrined in the CRPD should replace the hierarchical medical model that gives doctors the power to decide what is in the best interest of patients.  Her advanced healthcare directive states:</p> <blockquote> 	Any mental health care that I require is to centre on rest, counselling and minimal short-term medication (preferably in my own home).  In any episode treatment will assume my recovery and return to normal living.  I specifically never want to be subjected to ECT again unless medical advice deems it absolutely necessary. </blockquote> <p>Ms Wilson's statement continues:</p> <blockquote> 	I have given copies of my advanced healthcare directive to my GP and Community Psychiatric Consultant ... They both welcomed the document ... and will put them in my files.  Their response was an affirmation of the Human Rights model we're all working towards.  Even so I am every day [still] frightened that I may have another breakdown and age 83 be sent to a nursing home and given medication against my will. </blockquote> <p>I apologise.  Ms Wilson did not send me her poem and I do not have it.  She is a very accomplished poet and has written a poem on ECT.  Maybe we can share it with the committee afterwards.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, and I do not say this to disparage, Valerie's story is not unique.  I have heard many times about overmedication with powerful drugs, the importance for medical experts of giving a label and a diagnosis, and the lack of alternative therapies such as talk therapies.  Valerie's experience in emergency departments is similar to what I hear on a regular basis, as well.  I have spoken to liaison psychiatrists who work in hospitals.  Unfortunately, there are just not enough of them to see everybody who comes into emergency departments.  They are under-resourced.</p> <p>  I am very interested in what Ms Hough and others mentioned about their views on tapering and the right to taper.  In other health areas, there is a right to taper.  I have worked in addiction services for numerous years and there is a right to taper.  It is called detoxification.  The word detoxification literally means removing a toxin from one's body.  If somebody was put on a methadone substitute for heroin treatment, he or she has a right to taper off that with the help of a GP or a prescribing doctor.  A number of people over the past 20 years have been presenting to addiction services with an addiction to prescribed medication.  Benzodiazepines and codeine are two of the medications that regularly feature.  How does Ms Hough see the right to tapering working?  What structures need to be put in place?  Would it be advocacy with someone speaking on behalf of the person who seeks to taper off his or her medication?  Does this need to be legislated for?  I do not know the answer to that either.  Will Ms Hough answer some of that?  If anybody else has any questions, that would be very useful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.642" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jennifer Hough" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#CC00500"><p>I will make a quick comment and then leave it to the professionals to say how it could be done in legislation.  The issue of medication and tapering or coming off it challenges the biomedical notion of a person having a disorder in his or her brain and needing to take medication for life.  All of a sudden saying one can taper off medication and will be okay with the right supports challenges psychiatry and everything in which it believes.  In the UK, the British Psychological Society has developed a paper that recognises the right of people and gives guidance for professionals on how to do this.</p> <p>  It is very challenging because it challenges what psychiatry believes and the medical model that medication essentially corrects a brain disorder.  I remember my sister and my family were told when she was 16 years of age that she had a chemical imbalance - that she needed to take medications and would be grand.  However, we know now that this story about the chemical imbalance is not true.  There is no science behind it.  It is a false narrative that helps to explain, potentially, how medication might work because it is not known how it works.</p> <p>  Bipolar is just a construct that explains behaviours.  It is not a scientific term that says this is what goes on in a person's brain because nobody knows that.  Nobody ever tells the person.  Nobody comes back to say that new research shows these medications do not work the way we thought they used to.  Nobody comes back to the family and updates them on evolutions in research or science.</p> <p>  Some 20 years ago, we did not know that these medications did not work very well or were damaging.  We know now.  The research is very clear on antidepressants and antipsychotics but it never filters down to the person.</p><p>In my view, it is a scandal.  I will leave it to the professionals to say how we can legislate for that.</p></speech>

It is not enough to have an independent advocate available to go in with somebody to an appointment with a psychiatrist because some psychiatrists do not let in independent advocates.  It is not enough.  Something stronger is needed.  As Ms Hough said, it is challenging the entire system.  The our rights and medication group is challenging the system.  Everybody knows the quote from the special rapporteur that we need to move away from addressing a chemical imbalance to the power imbalances in psychiatry.  I wonder what it would be like to consider legislative pieces with respect to conditions to taper.  I wonder how that would happen and whether it would work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.645" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fiona Morrissey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#DD00300"><p>It is a good point and we could have a position of statutory reviews of people's medication, or they would have to be reviewed at different periods.  There is no statutory obligation or regulation around that.  The question we must ask is why in mental health are we treating people without their consent.  Why is this the only area in which we forcibly treat people or treat them without consent?  Why is mental health different from general health care or other areas of health, including drug treatment?  In any other area of health, we do not forcibly treat people.  Why, then, are we doing it here?  There is no evidence to suggest that people have any less capacity in the mental health system than they do in the general health system, and a recent Irish study compiled in the past year or so proves that.  There is no evidence of increased risk of violence or danger so we must consider why we are continuing to treat people the way we are doing it now, without their consent or forcibly treating them?  They have no pathway to come off medication once they go on it either.  When we bring people into the system by treating them without their consent, there is no pathway out or a statutory review mechanism either.</p> <p>  We must question the justification of this non-consensual and forcible treatment.  There is no evidence to show coercion works.  People might continue with medication for a long time, which can have very damaging side effects for the person.  We must question all of that.  Why are we still doing it given that international human rights law now obligates us to move away from it as well?  What is the justification for continuing with this?  We have the opportunity to be a world leader and a model of best practice in the same way our capacity legislation is looked at by other countries.  Why can we not do this for mental health as well?</p></speech>

What sort of control or review is there on individual psychiatrists when they prescribe medication?  There is none, by the sounds of it, and I am not quite sure if there is any legislation around it.  It is an example of the power of individual psychiatrists and nobody knows what they are prescribing.  That was until another psychiatrist came along and asked what was going on.  I just wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

Another psychiatrist came in and asked what was going on.  Only for that whistleblower, as he is being called, being brave enough to ask the question, the issue could have gone on much longer than it did.  It is really important for people to ask what is going on.  I thank Dr. Gijbels.</p></speech>

First, however, I should say that I cannot thank the witnesses enough for their contributions and statements.  I totally agree with Deputy Ward's comments.  It is like gold dust for us to receive this information, particularly with regard to legislation.</p> <p>  Is there a country that uses the best-practice model in this area that the witnesses think Ireland should adopt?  Could they recommend any best practice model to take on?  What are their thoughts on countries that are doing really well in the mental health area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Harry Gijbels" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#EE00200"><p>It is difficult to say if there is a particular country doing well in all areas.  There are countries that are doing well in particular areas, including legislation and practice.  I refer again to the WHO guidance, which has many examples from different areas right across the globe.  It is a very comprehensive document.  I mentioned a good example in Ireland with the West Cork Home Focus team that has been going for years.  There are good examples in Norway, which has drug-free mental health units.  It is difficult to point out a country that is expert at everything and different countries are expert at different things.  Italy, of course, is known for community-based healthcare.  The committee should really look at examples of good practice right across the globe, and again I refer to the WHO document.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.650" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fiona Morrissey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022030800002#EE00300"><p>I agree with those comments.  There are pockets of best practice all over the world that we can bring together.  A manual has recently been compiled of examples of good practices at both European and international level.  That is a manual we could look at.  The WHO has published guidance in the area advocating a move towards human rights-based approach to mental health services.  There is the good practice manual and examples like the personal ombudsman scheme in Sweden.  There are independent advocacy examples all over the world.  As Dr. Gijbels has said, there are medication-free wards in Norway and in Trieste they have made an initial move to a community treatment-based approach.  In the United States there are examples of good practice.</p> <p>  We could bring all those together into our system and we are ready with the capacity legislation moving to a model of best practice that other countries are looking to with respect to supported decision-making.  Why can we not move towards something like that in mental health?  We have already done it in the capacity area so why should mental health be different from capacity law?  Why can we not move towards the same model?  We could bring together everything we have spoken about today.  There is no one country I would look to but I would certainly look to all those examples of best practice, along with the manual and WHO guidance.  It is important that these are led by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#E00200"><p>Today is our fourth meeting in a series of meetings on urban and rural regeneration.  We are joined from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, and Mr. Stewart Logan, senior planning adviser.  Ms Lisa Clifford, from the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, section of the Department joins us remotely.  From the Department of Rural and Community Development we are joined remotely by Mr. Fintan O'Brien, assistant secretary; Mr. Eddie Forsyth from the rural fund and corporate support unit; and Mr. J.P. Mulherin, from the rural programmes and policies unit.  We have circulated the opening statements to the members.</p> <p>  I will outline what the committee has done so far.  We have had a series of meetings.  We agreed to discuss dereliction and vacancy and a number of related areas such as compulsory purchase order, CPO, transport-orientated development and how we can bring life and vitality to rejuvenate our towns and villages.  In this fourth meeting we will discuss another important aspect, that of central government funding to support policies such as Town Centre First and Our Rural Future and also to support many of the measures that are outlined in the Housing for All strategy.  Central government funding is critical to that.  We recognise that not all funding for our towns and villages will come from central government.  There will also be private investment and they will all work together to regenerate.</p> <p>  I am delighted the witnesses have joined us.  I and other members are former local authority members.  The URDF and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, announcements are always a time of great interest and excitement at local authority level because they have done some fantastic work out there.  We have all seen that in our constituencies in the few years since the funding was introduced.</p> <p>  I will ask the witnesses to make their opening statements and members will then be invited to address questions to them.  We will limit it to seven minutes for each interaction involving questions and answers.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in the public meetings.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limits to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings as a person who is physically present in the Leinster House complex does.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements will be available on the Oireachtas website after the meeting.</p> <p>  I apologise to witnesses for the late start to the meeting.  We had a vote in the Chamber and then a roll call was sought on that vote which delayed us all.  Some members are still in the Chamber, but they will join us when they finish there.  I invite Ms Graham from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#E00300"><p>I am grateful for the invitation to expand on the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, which was touched on in my statement to the committee on 25 January.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by Ms Lisa Clifford, principal officer in the URDF section, and Mr. Stewart Logan, senior planning adviser.</p> <p>  As members have the full statement which contains some examples, I might just focus on the key points now.  Since our last appearance before the committee, the Government has launched the Town Centre First policy, which provides an important enabling framework for the development of towns.  While towns face many challenges, there are also many opportunities to reimagine and revitalise many areas.  A number of structures are being put in place to lead and support this initiative, which is fundamentally about enabling towns and their communities to define the vision for the future of their town.  We are working with colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development to implement this policy.</p> <p>  For towns with populations of over 10,000, the URDF provides an important source of funding to realise these ambitions.  The URDF is one of the four funds launched in 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, and is specifically focused on implementing the national planning framework and that alignment of special and investment plans to deliver on a timely basis the investment required to provide the housing, jobs and infrastructure of the present and future population which is likely to increase by 1 million by 2040.</p> <p>  The URDF has proved to be a game changer in the promotion of co-ordinated investment in the renewal and redevelopment of cities and towns.  Under the NDP review published last year, a commitment was made to extend the time of the fund from 2027 out to 2030.  It is a &euro;2 billion fund and there will be an associated additional investment for that extra period.</p> <p>  There have been two calls to date.  Over &euro;300 million was allocated to 87 projects in call 1.  Many of these were master planning and initial kick-off projects.  A total of 45 projects got &euro;1.3 billion in funding approved under call 2.  There were some delays to project roll-out because they were impacted by the Covid-19 construction restrictions.</p><p>Activity is now increasing and we expect the build to increase significantly in the coming years.</p><p> I will focus on cities and towns, in particular.  Many of the very high value projects have been approved for metropolitan areas.  They are projects of significant scale.  In total &euro;1.286 billion has been approved for metropolitan areas and key driver towns.  Some examples, such as the Cork docklands, are set out in the statement.  It would be true to say that both the nature and the scale of the projects and the funding approach are transformative.  It provides an integrated, dynamic and responsive way to underpin the national planning framework with a particular focus on compact growth.  The approach brings together a number of strands of public investment, such as transport and water services, to deliver an overall integrated urban development proposal.  As the Chairman said, the projects deliver new energy, new life and opportunities for economic activity and residential development in parts of cities with high levels of dereliction, under-use and a need for transformative change.</p><p> In addition, &euro;330 million has also been approved for projects in towns under the URDF to date, supporting a wide range of projects which are catalysts for change.  Again, a couple of examples are set out in the statement as an illustration.  The Department has been very impressed by the richness and diversity of projects put forward by local authorities under the URDF.  We have supported the application stage through the hosting of workshops, including one hosted by the IDA, given the importance of place making to the economic vibrancy of towns and the offering they can make in enterprise and employment terms.  </p><p> In regard to the funding approach, projects are initially examined by a project appraisal board which is chaired by the Department and by Ms Clifford, who is with us.  That comprises a range of funding Departments and external expertise.  This is a very useful step in ensuring proposals meet the fund criteria and provide additionality to other funding streams.  As set out in the NDP review and reflecting our experience to date, the next rounds of funding will separately target cities and towns given the different needs and scales of projects.  The next call will be for projects in towns later this year and it will align with the Town Centre First policy launched in February.  The criteria will also specifically identify the tackling of vacancy, as outlined in Housing for All and Town Centre First to encourage the activation of vacant properties.  The Department will also move from a competitive call basis, which was a feature of the funding to date and was important in the early stage, to now work with local authorities to bring the next generation of projects forward and ensure a steady pipeline of suitable projects.  It will also ensure there is a good spread geographically of those projects, particularly in the light of the Town Centre First plans that will be emerging in towns around the country and to ensure the activation of residential development in strategic areas.</p><p> The combination of policies through Town Centre First reflecting the objectives of the national planning framework, matched with substantial funding available through the URDF, gives a real opportunity to deliver improvements to the liveability of cities and towns and make a real difference to the social and economic sustainability and development.  We are happy to take any questions that committee members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their invitation to the meeting today.  I understand the committee is holding a series of meetings relating to urban and rural regeneration, so we are happy to be here today to discuss our Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the rural element of that discussion.  I am joined today by two colleagues, Mr. J.P. Mulherin and Mr. Eddie Forsyth, both of whom are principal officers in the Department of Rural and Community Development with responsibility for policies and schemes which are of direct relevance to the matters being discussed by the committee.</p> <p>  As a starting point for the discussion I am sure the committee members are aware that Our Rural Future, the national rural development plan for 2021 to 2025, was published last year.  The policy clearly recognises that not all rural areas are identical and that individual towns, villages and parishes differ significantly.  Our approach to rural development and regeneration must take account of this reality.</p> <p>  The policy also sets out the challenges and opportunities that face rural Ireland and includes a range of actions for delivery over the period of the policy which aims to deliver on the policy&rsquo;s stated vision of a thriving rural Ireland which is integral to our national economic, social, cultural and environmental well-being and development.  The policy also recognises the interdependence of urban and rural areas, the centrality of people and the importance of vibrant and lived-in rural places.  The policy importantly provides a framework for the significant level of current and future investment in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  From this Department&rsquo;s perspective the main elements of this funding which will be of relevance to today&rsquo;s discussion with the committee are contained in the rural development investment programme, RDIP.  The schemes included in that investment programme are the EU co-funded LEADER programme, which has been successfully implemented in Ireland over 30 years; the CL&Aacute;R programme, which has been launched this year with a &euro;7 million budget and which provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in certain designated rural areas; the local improvement scheme, which has a budget of &euro;11 million in 2022 to support the improvement of non-public roads in rural communities and improve access to rural farms and homes; the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, which has also recently been launched for 2022 with a budget of &euro;15 million; the town and village renewal scheme, which will be launched shortly for 2022 and will include support for streetscape enhancements and key priorities such as the development of remote network facilities, the regeneration of disused buildings for community use; and the Rural Regeneration Development Fund, RRDF, which to date has delivered funding of &euro;278 million over a total of 191 projects.</p> <p>  I understand that the town and village renewal scheme and the RRDF may be of particular interest to members of the committee in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion and we would be happy to provide any further detail required on these two schemes.</p> <p>  The town and village renewal scheme and the RRDF are also closely linked to another recent policy development which Ms Graham mentioned, namely, the publication of the Town Centre First policy.  This policy was developed jointly by the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and drew on the input of a wide range of expert stakeholders in its development.  The policy sets out to address many of the issues which the committee may have been discussing in its recent deliberations and it includes a range of 33 actions which seek to tackle issues such as vacancy and dereliction and to give our towns the tools and resources they require in order to regenerate themselves as viable and attractive places in which people and families can live, work and run a business.</p> <p>  As referenced at the beginning of my remarks, no two rural areas are identical and the Town Centre First policy clearly recognises the role of locally led town teams in developing plans that recognise their own circumstances, challenges and opportunities.  The initial financial supports are in place to support the roll-out of the Town Centre First policy, for example, funding has been provided for the first tranche of 26 towns to develop their own Town Centre First plans and arrangements are currently being finalised to put in place the local town regeneration officers who will play a key co-ordinating and leadership role in local authorities throughout the country and for establishing the national delivery structures that will ensure momentum and coherence in implementation of the policy.</p> <p>  I am conscious that my opening remarks represent a very brief overview of some of the key areas of intervention by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  My colleagues and I will be very happy to answer any questions that members of the committee may have and to provide any further detail which may be required.</p></speech>

I have a question.  The town and village renewal scheme is applicable to towns with populations of less than 10,000, is that correct?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.670" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#F00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today and for all the work they do.  We are delighted they are contributing to our consideration of urban and rural regeneration.  I will focus my initial round of questions on the urban.  Hopefully I will get an opportunity to come back in later.  We have a strict time limit.</p> <p>  In regard to the &euro;1.286 billion in URDF funding, I agree it has the potential to be a game-changer.  The north inner-city in Dublin Central was fortunate, and it was deserving, to get approximately &euro;120 million of the funding announced under it for important projects, such as the fruit and vegetable market in Dublin 7, the national monument on Moore Street, the Moore Street market, Parnell Square, the city library, Mountjoy Square and the Five Lamps.</p><p>It is a fantastic way for the State to be investing.  I would argue that it is long overdue and it is certainly more than a decade overdue.</p><p> I cannot let the witnesses out of here today without saying that there is huge frustration and disappointment that we are a year on from the announcement and I see very little evidence on the ground of the city council actually using those funds.  I will use the fruit and vegetable market as an example.  Not only is that a spectacular and purpose-built market building.  If we were to try to set out today to build such infrastructure, the craftsmanship would be very hard to replicate.  It is in great condition but we are not seeing any evidence of development.  Millions of euro have been dedicated and given to Dublin City Council to reopen that market.  I have a list as long as my arm of people who would go in there and reanimate it.  This list includes everything from fresh food producers to cooked food producers and artists.  How can the Department trigger the local authority to use those funds?  How can the Department find out where is the bottleneck with the local authority?</p><p> It is a similar situation with residential properties in the north inner city.  We have talked about the Town Centre First policy, and Housing For All has clearly called out the need for us to use and reuse existing building infrastructure.  There is no more sustainable way to increase our housing stock than to use the housing stock that is already built.  This is not happening.  Dublin City Council has had a vacancy officer since 2017.  The council, however, had a pitiful track record in this regard when council officials came in to speak with the committee about tackling dereliction and vacancy in the city.  What can the Department do with the local authority to support them to actually open up those properties?  The city is coming down with people looking for affordable homes.  The city is coming down with people who are just looking for homes.  Yet, we have endless vacancy and dereliction in the city.  What can the Department do to support the local authority?  The Department is clearly providing the funds but something more is needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.672" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#G00200"><p>There are a couple of issues.  The important aspect, in addition to giving the investment and the opportunity for investment, is about driving the programme.  From the Department's perspective, all of these projects were given the funding and the local authority is in the driving seat as the sponsor.  We have put in arrangements within the Department and we will be meeting local authorities regularly.  I will ask Ms Clifford to come in on that in a moment.  We have expanded our planning and advisory team with Mr. Logan in order that we will have advisers who would be dealing with all the different areas of the country.  Part of this is to give that support and monitoring, from the Department's point of view, to see that drive.<br/><br/>It must be acknowledged also that there has been a Covid effect.  While some housing projects, for example social housing projects, were able to continue if they were at a certain stage during construction shutdowns, the nature of the urban regeneration and development fund projects was that they were shut down if they were at construction stage.  This has had a knock-on effect.  We are moving very much into the mobilisation phase as well.<br/><br/>From a broader perspective and the actions in Housing For All around vacancy nationwide, the vacant homes officers are becoming full-time.  The Senator referred to Dublin being one of the areas that has had full-time vacant homes officers.  Again, from the supporting and driving perspective, the Department is establishing its own principal officer-led vacant unit, to bring together many of the aspects the committee has spoken about including the investment, regulation and funding, to have a co-ordinated approach.  The Housing Agency is looking at supporting local authorities with advice through the agency's procurement unit, and through its compulsory purchase system expertise.<br/><br/>The final piece we will be working on from a national planning framework perspective is city delivery boards, under Project Ireland 2040.  At present, we have a national Project Ireland 2040 delivery board that has all of the Secretaries General of the funding Departments, who are now external members.  There will be city development boards for Dublin and for the other cities that will bring the national board to the city level and will really focus on ensuring there is integration of the spatial plans and the investment.  Some of these are very big projects that can be dependent on a lot of big public investment in transport and water, as well as the mobilisation of the projects.<br/><br/>The other leg is that we are working with the County and City Management Association, CCMA,<font color="#3C4043"> </font>around resourcing of local authorities.  Mr. O'Brien has touched on some of the resourcing and the town regeneration offices funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  There is a wider resourcing issue of planning and town regeneration.  We want to get to the heart of that to see what the numbers are and what the skills are, and how we can make sure that local authorities are set up for the future.  There is a commitment in Housing For All to make sure that the planning resource is funded.  There are a couple of elements there.  Perhaps Ms Clifford will talk a little bit about how we engage with Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

We are working with Dublin City Council to see how best we can move forward the parts of the project that can move more quickly.  The pieces such as the library, which the Senator referred to and is a longer-term project, are a bit more complex and will take that little bit longer to get through the various stages of the public spending code.  The exercise we carried out with all of the local authorities was to critically look at the different elements of the projects to see where we can move things forward more quickly.  This is certainly something we will be following up with Dublin City Council, in the context of its projects.  From the Department's perspective, the Dublin north inner city project is one of our largest and we have a particular interest in making sure that these projects get on the right track, particularly the larger and more complex projects.  Following on from our previous meetings, we will be following up with Dublin City Council to see what progress it has made on that.</p></speech>

Why have the recommendations of Alison Harvey of the Heritage Council, in its collaboration on vacancy data with the Housing Agency, Vacanthomes.ie and Space Engagers, not been taken on board given that it was a key objective in the last housing policy?</p></speech>

We gave a paper previously to the committee around the range of elements.  I will ask Mr. Logan to come in on this in a moment.</p> <p>  We are looking at the vacancy data that are available. Some of them are dynamic, and often they are incomplete.  Some additional data will be gathered through the census this year.  We are looking at some of the geospatial data that are available.  We did some pilot studies ourselves as part of the housing strategy in Rebuilding Ireland.  We are also working with Department of Finance on the data it is collecting from the local property tax, which should be available shortly.</p> <p>  Part of the issue about vacancy is there is a need for a national perspective and a real on-the-ground perspective.  This is part and parcel of the role that we would see the full-time vacant homes officers doing. Perhaps Mr. Logan will add to that.  </p></speech>

It is very much intended as an action in this document that this would be built upon and brought into a national scheme as part of the national office in order that the type of work that is being done on a limited but very good quality basis by the Heritage Council would be accessed by more towns in a fuller way.  They have limited resources there but what is done in the town centre health check format would be brought into a national approach that every town could take.</p></speech>

Yesterday, Deputy &Oacute; Broin was in Cork with me and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  We walked around with the Anois group, representatives of which, Dr. Frank O'Connor and Ms Jude Sherry, gave a presentation to this committee on dereliction.  I walked around Cork city centre and the surrounding streets yesterday and noted the amount of dereliction that is in Cork.  We have no accurate data in Cork City Council on derelict sites.  There are fewer than 100 derelict sites listed.  I saw 100 such sites yesterday on my own.  That was only on North Main Street and the northside.  There are no accurate dereliction figures and no accurate vacancy figures for the second city in the State.  I am not blaming the witnesses but my point is that I represent people and I believe that things are so bad in my city at the moment that the housing crisis in Cork is worse than Dublin.  People are looking at properties every day of the week that should be housing.  Families should be in there and nothing is happening.</p> <p>  I have another question.  The last time representatives of the Department were in here, I asked for an update on derelict homes officers and vacant homes officers.  I was told that a special section was going to be set up in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to tackle dereliction and vacancy.  Has that section been set up?  How many staff are in there?  Where are we with it?</p></speech>

Just to clarify, our funding streams will not be restricted by a lack of data.  For the things like the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund, we will be depending on local authorities coming to us with proposals and saying that they are vacant.  Similarly, the URDF is based on the local authority declaration of vacancy.  I should say that.</p></speech>

We have been waiting 30 years for the docklands regeneration.  It is welcome money and it is very much needed.  Not a single penny in funding was granted for the northside of Cork city, which has the worst dereliction.  In the Department's opening statement, "parts of cities with high levels of dereliction" were mentioned.  In the part of the city that I represent on the northside of Cork, no funding was awarded in the URDF out of &euro;405 million.  Ms Graham mentioned applications coming in.  In the northside of Cork city, we have no funding to tackle dereliction.</p></speech>

That is why we have talked about working about local authorities to see where there are gaps.  There are some areas where proposals were not successful because they did not meet the criteria and other areas.  Hopefully, projects like that will come forward.  In terms of the vacant homes unit, at the moment, there are staff who are working on other issues as well.  There is a principal officer.  Recruitment is about to commence for the principal officer.  Recruitment has just concluded for two assistant principal officers.  There will be support staff for that unit.  At present, it is taking a good deal of my own time and personal focus.  The principal officer who appeared before the committee previously is dealing with social inclusion and vacancy.  The idea is that he will pass responsibility to a full-time officer in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

In terms of the URDF, I welcome the investment in my own area. Tandy's Lane Park opened in the summer and it is a direct result of the URDF funding stream.  Airlie Park in Adamstown is under construction at the moment.  We are all eagerly awaiting it being opened, hopefully later this year.  As referenced in the opening statements, Clonburris has also received quite a significant injection of funding.  While it is welcome, it is absolutely and utterly needed.  It is a basic requirement because these are massive growing areas.  They are very large-scale strategic development zones.  As we are talking about an influx of thousands of families into the area, we need the services and the amenities to come on stream and be delivered hand in hand with housing.  I am really glad that the URDF is there to help make that happen.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in Ms Graham's point about the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  It is great to hear of the hiring of staff, and indeed support staff, that is happening in the area.  Obviously, it is going to take teams of people to help tackle the issues that my colleague referred to in terms of dereliction and vacancy.  Vacancy is just one of the key focuses that we have had in Fine Gael.  Senator Cummins, who sends his apologies today, and I launched a discussion document on dereliction and vacancy and urban and rural renewal.  At this stage, we have had three different successful provincial meetings to reach out to stakeholders, including local authorities, Tidy Towns groups, chambers of commerce groups, and many people who have a vested interest in ensuring that we are transforming derelict and vacant properties into used spaces and family homes.  There have been three really welcome updates in the last few weeks, including that on the vacant homes officer and the announcement of the increase of funding to &euro;60,000.  The idea that these are all going to be full-time positions, or at least full-time equivalent positions, in each local authority in the country shows the commitment and the focus that there is going to be in every local authority up and down the country in this regard.  In respect of the announcement of the new grant of &euro;30,000 for people who want to purchase a vacant or derelict building and to transform it, I note the Minister has announced his commitment to making sure that this happens.  In terms of the ministerial regulations, we have also seen in the past few weeks the change of use rules that will now make it so much easier to have above-pub dwellings, as it were.  People no longer have to go through a lengthy and complex planning procedure.  Homes can be delivered above pubs without a change of use being required.  That is something that is really welcome, particularly in rural Ireland, where, unfortunately, we have seen pubs go to dereliction.</p> <p>  We need to see more progress being made in targets.  Local authorities still do not have targets, at this stage, for the repair and lease or buy and renew schemes.  These are schemes that we know are proven to work in terms of taking derelict and vacant properties and transforming them into houses.  That is what we want to do.  We want to unlock that potential.</p> <p>  From a living cities perspective, one of the initiatives that we spoke about previously was perhaps extending that to new areas that might need rejuvenation.  I would be particularly keen to hear Mr. O'Brien's views on that.  Overall, there is a sense that we need to reform and modernise the Derelict Sites Act.  Mr. O'Brien is probably the most expert witness in that area.  Perhaps he could comment on the extension of the living cities initiative and the reform of it.  I ask Ms Graham to talk me through the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, what it looks like, how it is going to be monitored, how progress is going to be measured and how it is going to be reported out.  That would be fantastic.  </p></speech>

In relation to the Living City initiative, it was something that featured in our discussions on the Town Centre First policy.  There was quite a proportion of people who had considerable experience of it.</p> <p>  In terms of the extension of it, I assume we are talking about the same thing.  This is the tax incentives.  The extension is a matter for the Department of Finance.  I understood that it was extended to the end of the year but I am not aware of any further extensions being considered by that Department at present.</p></speech>

It is in tandem with much of the investment that we are putting in at present through those existing schemes.  We are certainly willing to consider that.</p> <p>  From my point of view, there are some things coming on track in relation to that as well.  There is support under the new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe supports from Ms Graham's Department.  There is a full suite of investments and possible approaches there.  The key is to make sure we are as co-ordinated and coherent as possible between those various different streams of funding and support and to make sure they are all pushing in the same direction.</p></speech>

In terms of Project Ireland 2040, there is a delivery board at national level, which is monitoring the overall national development plan and looking at issues such as the revamping that there has been of the public spending code, a project tracker, any barriers that might be faced, and the national planning framework and how investment is aligning with what the direction should be.  I suppose the next phase that we believe is important is to bring that down to the city level.  For example, we would have had sector presentations on education, transport, housing and water services.  It is really to bring that to the city level, so that if there are particular blockages, they can be looked at in the wider metropolitan area and not only in one authority.  That is the concept that we are developing.</p> <p>  We are reviewing the derelict sites - it is within my area - to see if there are any kind of improvements that we can make to the working of the legislation as it is now.</p></speech>

I will take the next slot, which is the Green Party slot.  The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, URDF, is a &euro;2 billion fund.  There is &euro;1.6 billion, if I am reading this correctly, between 2019 and 2022 and it is extended out to 2030.  Is the fund to be increased to extend it out to 2030?</p></speech>

The capital ceilings for Departments have not been stretched out to the whole area but it is written into the national development plan, NDP, that there will be additional investment.  I would assume that would be at the level of which we are at when we get to 2026-2027 and that there will be funding beyond the &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

It acts as a stimulus as well, if the local authority invests in the local town or creates this nice place.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear Ms Graham mention place making in her opening statement.  I was at a presentation by IDA Ireland at the Irish planning conference many years ago at which it was said that this principle of place making is so important for people who want to invest, not only local investment but for foreign direct investment as well.  Companies that want to invest in Ireland - it does not matter if you have the best broadband and the best industrial estate - want nice places for the families that go with those jobs.  Place making is incredibly important and this can help towards it.</p> <p>  Where the local authority invests in it, and it might create that stimulus for a private building owner who wants to develop over-the-shop or a derelict site, it is my understanding that the regulations around this are quite cumbersome.  I will direct this question to Mr. Logan as it is probably planning related.  We have got the planning exemption for certain developments but the process for the fire safety certificate, the accessibility certificate and the section 57 certificate for the certification at the end of it seems to involve quite an onerous number of hoops somebody has to jump through.  What has being suggested to me is that where it is a small development of maybe two or three apartments above the shop, the expense that goes with that process is disproportionate to the overall conversion or refurbishment project.  Do we need to look at streamlining certain regulation processes around development in order to maximise the local authority's investment in that town as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.703" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stewart Logan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#J01000"><p>It is important to say there is a review under way of Part B under the fire regulations by colleagues in the Department.  That will specifically look at the smaller type of development the Chairman referred to in terms of whether that is a significant barrier and whether there are changes that can be made for that code.  That is under way currently.</p> <p>  The exemptions the Chairman referred to have been quite successful.  From 2018, we have had 300 or 400 of these properties that have moved.  That is very much market based and a response to what might be considered a relaxation of or, more correctly, flexibility in the planning regulations, specifically, as the Chairman said, for those typical properties that are above shop on the main street where there are vacancies that have not moved into residential.  They have been quite successful.</p> <p>  There possibly is a piece around the co-ordination within the local authority, which holds much of the statutory code piece in that regard.  There may be a co-ordination piece there that could perhaps achieve more results around those properties and bring them into residential use.  It is a co-ordination piece that is responsive to where there are those properties that perhaps individuals or landowners are interested in developing and I suppose the local authority sector perhaps allocating more resources, more particularly, to assisting those in bring those into a residential use.</p></speech>

If there is a review of regulations or that process, I am sure it will come to the committee at some point.  We would be interested in engaging in that.  My understanding is - this is from experts working in the field and the large technical guidance document comprising 12 or 13 chapters that is out there - it is quite directed towards new builds or not quite at where you have got to refurbish three-storey buildings.  That is helpful to know.</p> <p>  On the dereliction, would a dereliction tax work better than a dereliction levy?  There was &euro;5 million levied on derelict sites and derelict buildings owners in 2020 by local authorities but they collected less than &euro;400,000 - a less than 10% collection rate.  Might a dereliction tax, with that tax coming back to the local authorities to feed back into this urban and rural regeneration that we are trying to do, be a sensible move?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#J01200"><p>There can be definitional issues between vacancy and dereliction.  There is a spectrum.  In the context of the gathering of information for the local property tax, LPT, one of the issues that is being looked at is a tax on vacant properties.  Obviously, the scope and what that would include would be important.</p> <p>  From the data we have got from local authorities, many issues around dereliction are to do with ownership and the capacity to activate is quite difficult.  You need a number of tools in your armoury to deal with that.  Many of the local authorities have been quite successful in issuing compulsorily purchase orders, CPOs, on the property because then one can more readily assure it comes into active, and particularly residential, use.  The Housing Agency is developing guidance on issuing CPOs on property.  That is a particular area that we are looking at, not only for social housing needs and for affordable housing needs, but also for market-based housing.</p> <p>  Taxation plays a role.  Obviously, we are looking at that.  We will have the residential zoned land tax.  That is looking at the sites.</p><p>The Minister for Finance is examining the property tax and consideration is being given to what the extent of that would be.  Beyond penalisation of holding the property, we also need incentives to activate the property.  That is probably where our focus is at the moment.  The more derelict a property is, the more risky it is to bring it back in.  The question is whether there is a role for local authorities or the Housing Agency to revamp the project and then put it to the market.  </p><p> One of the other sources of funding that has not yet come on stream but is being worked on is the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, which the regional assemblies are looking at.   In particular, they are looking at gaps where there may not be other funding streams.  Hopefully, that will be finalised in the second quarter of this year.  They are looking at the issues of vacancy and dereliction.  Mr. Logan will have had a lot of conversations with them.  We are trying to make sure there is a suite of actions.</p></speech>

There are part-time vacant homes officers but this is to bring them all up to full time.  I just got that information two or three days ago in a reply to a parliamentary question.</p></speech>

Project Ireland 2040 sets ambitious targets and goals for making Ireland a better country for all.  I like that &quot;for all&quot;.  We tended not to have the same distribution across the country.  I also see echoing through the statements today local and regional ambition and, ultimately, national impact.  It is going to take time but I acknowledge it and can see the work.  I have been on this committee previously and I know we have repeated many issues.  Everything is slow.  As Ms Graham rightly said, we have had Covid and other issues.</p><p>The Waterford North Quays project is amazing and highly ambitious.  It has had some setbacks and bad publicity in respect of parts of it not going ahead.  I am aware &euro;81 million was set out in ERDF funding for that phase of the projects.  The officials might let the committee know more about that, if not today then at some point.</p><p>The other recurring issue is resources.  Somebody just mentioned compulsory purchase orders.  The local authorities will tell us that they have no funding for compulsory purchase or for the protracted litigation that goes into all of these issues.  The officials might address that.  Ms Graham talked about resources into the future but we need to hear about resources now.  We need to see tracking, timelines and delivery.</p><p>One of the biggest issues of concern is that of the local authorities themselves.  I know these are areas Ms Graham covers; I apologise that I am directing all my questions at her.  The local authority declaration of vacant properties is an extraordinary document.  I have had opportunity to look at one and have seen properties omitted from it.  It has been raised with me by councillors that certain properties are not included.  How verifiable and accurate is that list?  Where I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the local authority is presiding over dereliction in many parts.  There are substantial sites with major town centre zoning that have been derelict for up to 20 years.  It is extraordinary.  I took the time early this morning to walk around these properties again to double-check if there had been a miracle since I was there last week but nothing has changed.  They put up their hands and say the chief executive wants this and that and we might have social housing.  It is crazy stuff.  Some of these are protected structures so that is a challenge.  They do not all have to remain protected structures, however.  There is a process of delisting.  I would not encourage this but in some cases protected structure status may not be warranted.  That is not something I like to talk about too often as I am very committed to protected structures and our built heritage.  </p><p>I do not know if any of the officials read an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>by Darragh Bermingham recently.  Councillor Annemarie Ryan Shiner in County Tipperary raised the article.  She acknowledged the great work the Heritage Council has done on the collaborative town centre health check.  When is that going to be rolled out across every local authority?  It works; people are speaking about it and it appears to be very successful.  I would like the officials to talk about that.</p><p>We are talking about vacancies and dereliction today.  Some of the harbour port companies are presiding over massive dereliction of viable and nice property in major areas where people would want to live and do business.  We have the Office of Public Works.  There are two Garda stations in close proximity to me, in Dalkey and Kill of the Grange, that have been empty for nine and ten years.  We know there needs to be co-ordination on issues.  We need to look at the Defence Forces, dare I say it.  There are very substantial lands out in Thornton Hall.  What are we going to do with them?  Who is going to go out there?  Can we do property swaps?  We have to be realistic and look at that. </p><p>I have asked enough questions.  There are some issues.  I am concerned with the power the Department is investing in local authority officials, not in the councillors but in the officials.  They have had this for a long time.  I ask the officials to look specifically at the properties that are under the ownership of local authorities and to come back to us in three months with a detailed report.  We need to ask these city and county managers what is going on here.  It is very important that the vacant housing officers should be full time.  It should not be a matter of chief executives moving people around buildings and calling them a bit of this and a bit of that.  We want full-time vacant housing officers and town centre offices.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  There are really important initiatives happening here and I commend all those involved.</p></speech>

On the Waterford project, it is a really interesting project that includes moving the train station and a lot of public transport and an infrastructure piece.  The Department is firmly committed to that project and to its funding and will work closely with Waterford officials to make sure it comes to fruition.</p> <p>  On the broad issue of resourcing, the idea with Town Centre First is that there will be a staffed national office within the Local Government Management Agency.  We are in the final stages between the two Departments.  We have funding to staff that office and they will also have some secondments from each Department.  They will drive the town centre programme and the network of town regeneration officers.  From a data and monitoring perspective, that will address the kind of issues the Senator was talking about, both the supports and the monitoring piece.</p> <p>  The Housing Finance Agency will be giving bridging finance for the compulsory purchase programme so that is an important source of funding.  We are trying to de-risk it as much as possible so that if local authorities go down this route they will not be left with properties on their hands.  Some of those concerns are taken away upfront.</p> <p>  I do think there is a boots on the ground piece.  I appreciate that the Senator has gone around D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  A lot of it is around looking at the properties.  That is why the town regeneration officers and vacant home officers are really important in seeing what scope is there.  The derelict site provision gives local authorities a lot of powers but there is inconsistency in terms of the approach.  Some authorities have been very successful in using the derelict site and compulsory purchase powers under the Act to gain properties and I think that is really increasing.  As that body of knowledge is improved and we really want to give momentum to that----</p></speech>

We can come back to the Senator's questions in the second round.  I call Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.</p></speech>

I walked around Clongriffin in my constituency recently.  The town centre there was built ten or 15 years ago and more than 50% of the retail units on the ground floor are still vacant.  Has any examination been done at a national level as to whether rates are being applied to ground floor retail units in these areas?  Dublin City Council has always applied certain rates on vacant units as a disincentive and other local authorities can do that as well.  Is there an issue with newer units, albeit ones that are ten or 15 years old, not being rated at all?  They may be escaping those vacant premises rates on the basis that they have not been fully completed or finished out.  Is that how they escape the rates?  Has that been looked at or examined at all?</p></speech>

We are particularly conscious that things should not fall between two stools and that there should not be these kinds of gaps for either rateable properties or taxable properties.  This is on the list of issues we are looking at in that context.  Those kinds of properties are referenced more broadly in Housing for All.  That is part of the planning exemption for change of use.  If it is very clear that there will not be a commercial use for properties developed in that way, they can be turned to residential use.  From a Town Centre First perspective, if there is a need for services for the area, it is about how that is stimulated in the vision for the town.</p></speech>

There are disincentives for vacancy at the moment but I am concerned that a number of properties are escaping them on the basis that the owner is claiming they are not fully finished, even though the planning permission to finish them would be expired by now.  There may be a cohort missing there.</p> <p>  On the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, some great projects were funded in the last round but there was strong criticism that applications from some areas with high levels of social deprivation, such as Cherry Orchard, Darndale and the newer communities adjoining Darndale around Northern Cross, were not successful.  Dublin City Council said applications for brownfield sites were being prioritised and I can understand that.  Outside Dublin city, non-brownfield site applications for funding were successful.  When is another round of funding for the URDF for cities likely to happen?  Will those areas with higher levels of social deprivation in Dublin city outside the canals be eligible for funding?  Is there any engagement with Dublin City Council on that to make sure these do not miss out or would not be ineligible?</p></speech>

It is important for us to get a geographical spread and recognise the size of different cities.  That is reflected in what we have done.  As the projects have developed, it has become clear that there is a need to separate towns and cities.  Due to the Town Centre First policy, towns will be addressed the first and the cities will follow on from that.  The focus for this year is on getting the projects that are already approved under way.  Ms Clifford has been involved in the project board so she might want to say something on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.715" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lisa Clifford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#L00500"><p>On the projects in other areas of Dublin city, we saw this issue across the board when assessing the projects last year.  We were massively oversubscribed for the amount of money we had and we had to make decisions on the focus of the projects in the second call for applications.  Our initial focus was on moving into the urban core and then moving out.  Where we had to make decisions in different local authority areas about which projects to fund as part of that call, we applied that approach universally.  We targeted the core first, so projects in the core would have been successful, with a view to moving out as further calls are announced.  As Ms Graham said, our next focus will be on town centres but we recognise that there is a lot of work still to be done in the cities.  There will be a call focusing on the cities.  Given the scale of the projects that were approved as part of the second call, we need to get those up and running first.  We need to focus the metropolitan local authorities on getting those projects activated, moving and into construction.  We can then change our focus to look where we need to go next.  As Ms Graham mentioned earlier, one of the things we want to do is work more collaboratively with the local authorities in future calls to target areas where applications have not come forward yet or have not been funded yet but where we know we need to invest.</p></speech>

They are very helpful.  I reiterate that for areas of social deprivation, especially where they adjoin newer communities, proposals to integrate them could very valuable.  I am just putting that in the mix as something to be considered for the future.</p></speech>

If a local authority does not move sufficiently fast on a scheme that has been awarded funding, can the Department take that back and give it to someone who will use it?  Have the witnesses ever needed to tell local authorities they are not moving fast enough?</p></speech>

Obviously, projects have been impacted by Covid and we have to allow for that.  This will be important as we move forward because we would not want an authority to be reserving funding when there are other projects, such as the ones Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned, that could be ready to go.  Those are the harder decisions that might have to be made down the line.  That is why it is important that projects that are approved get under way.</p></speech>

I ask Ms Graham to outline the reforms she referred to earlier with regard to the Derelict Sites Act, which needs to be modernised and reformed.  It sounds like she is doing a body of work in investigating what changes could be made to make it a more useful tool, which could become the catalyst for some change in this area.  I would welcome her views on that.</p></speech>

We are collating the views of local authorities on changes that could be made to the legislation or operationally that would improve the operation of the Act.  That is something we are looking at.  We are very willing to take action if ideas come forward for changing the legislation in some way to make it more workable.  An important dimension is the compulsory purchase piece, which the Law Reform Commission is looking at in depth.  That will also come up in the context of the planning review because these are complex CPO arrangements.  Many local authorities, such as those in Waterford and Limerick, and Louth to some extent, have been very successful in their use of CPO powers, particularly for social housing.</p><p>Some of it is 19th-century legislation so that is an area that needs to better reflect a modern legislative code.  That is one of the aspects with which we will not be able to deal within a review.</p></speech>

That is the major piece of work for this year.  There are a couple of other items on the planning agenda.  If there are minor changes, we could be able to bring these forward - certainly in the latter half of this year - or if there are some tweaks.  Some of it may be operational.  Some of that involves the supports that can be given.  Some local authorities have been using it very effectively so that is part of the Town Centre First strategy and addressing vacant properties and the Housing Agency giving that support so that the lessons from one local authority can be applied in others.  They are both pieces of it.</p></speech>

Making sure we have the legislative tools we need to take action and to do it as quickly as possible is key.  I really welcome all the progress they are making on this and the fact that they are doing so much work analysing what research and development exists and how it could be changed or how changes could be incorporated into new bodies of new legislation to really make that happen.  This committee talks all the time about the lack of data on vacancy rates across the country.  Some people rely on the CSO while others rely on GeoDirectory.  There is so much uncertainty in this field but what we do know is that the tools, techniques and legislation we do have are under-utilised.  If we can do a body of work around reliable data, as has been discussed many times in this committee, and combine it with the kind of work the witnesses are doing, we make genuine change in this area.  I thank the witnesses for all that work.</p></speech>

As the Chairman rightly said, it has been hugely informative and we have had a number of very engaging sessions.  In particular, I pay tribute to the officials from the Department.  It is very clear that they have a great grasp of this area.  A huge sense of enthusiasm for and information about the opportunities afforded by these funding streams are reflected in their presentation.  Today has taken on an additional dimension in that we have launched our Town Centre First policy, which will very much inform future policy, particularly relating to the URDF.  I am interested in changes to the scoring criteria for that scheme where it will be very much led by the local Town Centre First policy as opposed to the traditional competitive call.  How confident are the witnesses that this will bring to the top the quality of projects we want and need to see?  Are they reassured that this will happen?</p> <p>  In respect of the Town Centre First policy, vacancies will remain a significant challenge in provincial Ireland.  Regarding banks that continue to hold property in provincial towns, many of these are what banks refer to as low-hanging fruit.  They do not feel there is a sufficient need for them to dispose of those properties at this stage and they are waiting for the value of those properties to appreciate before they sell them.  Have the witnesses engaged with banks and got some sense of how much property is held by banks as opposed to members of the public?  How engaged are the main banks in terms of helping us to drive our Town Centre First policy?  </p> <p>  My final question is for Ms Clifford.  I know she has done a piece of work on projects that have funding.  Could she crystallise the issues in cases where they are struggling to get projects up and running?  I anticipate that one of them will be the change in building costs and an inability to get contractors.  Will the Department give consideration to these issues?  Will balloon payments need to be introduced for many of these projects that are at an advanced stage or ready to break ground but where there is real concern at local authority level that they do not have sufficient funding in place?  I am conscious that I have thrown plenty at the witnesses helter-skelter but I am sure they have picked out the salient points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#M00800"><p>Mr. O'Brien might be able to talk about it from the perspective of the rural fund but certainly from the urban fund perspective, we have been oversubscribed and have not had difficulty in finding good projects.  We are conscious that some projects were submitted that did not meet the criteria for the urban fund and we want to work with them to define them for the future.  The advantage of having the Town Centre First policy and the plan is that there is that engagement with the community around what the vision for the town is.  The next generation of projects should come from that.</p> <p>  The other issue I might touch on relates to banks.  The Housing Agency has had a housing acquisition fund where it has been dealing with banks in terms of properties as part of that and has done a lot of work in recent years.  We are now looking at that acquisition fund and where it goes in the future.  I know the Housing Agency is also engaging with a number of institutions that may have their own properties in areas that might be suitable.  Senator Boyhan mentioned former Garda stations.  There is a range of buildings that might be put to use and there might be an advantage in the Housing Agency centralising and working with local authorities in that area.  I will pass over to Ms Clifford to talk about problems.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.730" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lisa Clifford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#M00900"><p>As I mentioned earlier, we have just come out of a series of meetings with local authorities looking at all of their URDF projects and getting a sense of where they are.  The overriding message is that there are issues around costs in particular such as construction price inflation and we are seeing this reflected in the budget costs for the projects.  The message I have given to local authorities is that we want them to do due diligence on costs because we do not want over-inflated costs that are not realistic but we also recognise that there are increases in costs and we will be able to meet some of those.  We have asked local authorities to look critically at that and other sources of funding that might be appropriate and help to absorb some of those additional costs.  To give an example, a project with quite a significant increase in costs was able to secure some funding from our colleagues in the NTA to fund the active travel parts of it because there is funding there for active travel.  This reduced the impact on the URDF element so we were able to absorb the rest of the cost.</p><p>We have an iterative process with the local authorities on budget development as projects move through the various stages of the public spending code.  We are not telling local authorities that only a certain amount of funding is available and that is it.  There is obviously a process to be gone through as these projects develop to the construction stage, and we are working with local authorities on that, looking at how much the fund can absorb and what other sources of funding might be available for other elements of the project that might be more suitable to, say, active travel or whatever else.  Our colleagues in the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Department of Transport have been co-operative in terms of those types of projects.  I hope that answers the question.  It is an ongoing process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#N00200"><p>I will respond to the mention of engagement over banks and buildings such as Garda stations.  That is relevant to the town and village renewal scheme.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has had some engagement with banks about their buildings rather than anything else.  We have been acting as a conduit between them and the local authorities to make sure everyone is aware of the opportunities that may exist.  Some of those bank buildings and Garda stations tend to be strategically important buildings within towns, so we are working on that as a conduit of communication.</p> <p>  The committee may have heard that some relevant projects were included in the recent town and village renewal announcement.  For example, an old bank in Urlingford is being turned into a remote working hub.  A Garda station in Dromahair in Leitrim is being refurbished as a community facility.  I agree absolutely there is potential and it is something about which we are talking to various people.</p></speech>

I started my earlier contribution by talking about local and regional ambition and national impact.  I acknowledge the amazing input of our guests.  They are, dare I say it, members of the permanent Civil Service.  They know what is going on and we are fortunate to have people like them at the helm.</p><p>There is, however, a disconnect between our guests and the local authorities.  There is always a tension with local authority members.  Ms Graham spoke in her presentation about engagement in workshops.  I am not sure enough of that is going on with the local authority members.  We must remember there will always be a healthy tension between the executive of a local authority and its elected members.  That healthy tension is a good thing and long may it last.  Those members are watchdogs and are holding the executive to account.  That is a part of their remit and function.  However, they are somehow left out of the picture in terms of information.  I wrote to every chief executive today to tell them this meeting was on.  I know it was short notice but I asked them to confirm their knowledge and understanding of the situation and whether they had a vacant housing officer or town centre officer.  It was pushing it a bit to ask if they had town centre officers because that role has only recently been announced.  I had an interesting mix of reactions from some of those chief executives.  Some of them said they need more clarification and I ask our guests to take that home with them.  We have had a lot of external communication but perhaps we are not as good at internal communication within the local government sector and other State agencies.</p><p>I acknowledge the importance and excitement of all of this.  It shows a realisation that people can be ambitious for their rural towns and expect to see something happening, with a national input from the Government.</p><p>I will return to the article in yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, which contained a reference to smart data and how we collect it.  We can collect an awful lot of data in respect of utilities.  That happens in Scotland and other parts of the UK.  I am familiar with how it happens there.  We can keep it simple.  There are many agencies that feed utilities into properties, be they commercial or residential, and we need to do more work on that.  I think the Chair will agree that the committee would be interested in hearing more about that area.  We do not necessarily have the expertise but I would like to hear more about that area.</p><p>I would like to know that we have fully resourced our local authorities with vacant housing officers and town centre officers.  Perhaps within the next few weeks the Departments could come back to the committee confirming those officers are in place.  Sometimes we have to chase these things.  It is surprising how difficult it is sometimes.  I would like to see a list.  I made a commitment to the chief executives that I would be back on their tails and looking for this information.  I should not have to do that.  We, as a committee, should get some reassurance that this is actually happening.  I would like our guests to put that on their list of actions.</p><p>One of the first things I said earlier related to local authority declarations of vacant properties.  Would it be possible for the committee to have a copy of the latest local authority declaration of vacant properties for all 31 local authorities?  That would be helpful.  We bring to this debate our own knowledge of local government.  Most members of this committee have been elected to city or county councils.  That would be interesting.  The more information we share with one another, the more we can understand.  We can then monitor progress.  Our guests might address those few issues.</p><p>I will wrap up by saying this is very positive news.  There will be issues and challenges from time to time, but the will and ambition are there and people are excited.  The only possible setback may, in time, be resources, but we got a clear commitment today that resources will not be an issue.  I again thank our guests for participating in this informative and interesting meeting.</p></speech>

I was talking to Mr. Logan before the meeting about the many times he has done the town centre first presentation.  We have done it for chief executives and directors of housing and planning authorities.  The point the Senator made about elected members is an interesting one and we will take that away because there is an important point at the moment around communication.  Part of the enabling framework will have a network of town regeneration officers and a national oversight group, which will be very important in bringing all these elements together.  It is important to acknowledge that a considerable variety of people were involved in the advisory group that developed the town centre first scheme, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.</p> <p>  The Senator made an important point about smart data because data are a part of that town regeneration element.</p> <p>  On the vacant home officers, we asked local authorities, in the circular we issued, to come back to us indicating what resources they would put in.  They have a period of time within which to come back to us, but as we get to the end of the process, we are happy to share it.</p> <p>  The registers are with the 31 local authorities but we have a series of spreadsheets with, if you like, summary data and information around what is collected and the numbers involved.  I am happy to share that with the committee.  We have information on vacant sites and derelict sites that might be useful.  We can see where the information goes from there.</p></speech>

We have quite structured engagement with the local authority sector but the Senator's point about wider consultation and communications is well made.  I note, as a point of interest, that the Department of Rural and Community Development is conducting an online event this week for a wide range of stakeholders at which we will present to as wide an audience as possible our schemes and initiatives and the opportunities that exist.  We will present those schemes as a coherent whole to make sure all the relevant stakeholders are aware of the situation.</p> <p>  I will come back to a question the Senator asked during the previous round of questions which we did not have time to answer.  The health check model will be a central part of the implementation of the town centre first strategy.  It is about building on that Heritage Council model and to roll it out in towns because it is a useful model that has worked in other places.</p></speech>

Can that be contributory to dereliction and vacancy?  A street that is car-dominated, has two lanes of traffic, parking on either side of the road and narrow footpaths is not a nice place to be as a pedestrian.  It may not be a place where one would like to shop.  The whole street then becomes worn down and a thoroughfare to somewhere else, another part of town.  Are our guests aware of any research that has been done in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stewart Logan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#N00800"><p>I do not think any specific research on that has been undertaken recently but the whole weight of our investment, particularly in the public realm, through the urban renewal and development fund and the rural fund, tries to recognise the importance of the place-making piece.  What happens in the public element of that is important because it does, as the Chairman mentioned earlier, create spin-offs and investment.  We have seen that in a couple of locations.</p><p>In Clones, County Monaghan, in the public arm of that which is social housing, rather than having the sites which were perhaps more peripheral, we made a conscious effort to try to invest in a building or street which was perhaps one of these derelict and vacant properties we mentioned earlier.  These have been brought back into two or three homes and there has been an uplift in that street, in the activity and in the visual presentation of it in terms of the buildings, as opposed to the footpaths, roads, the public lighting and so forth.  It has also created a spin-off with private properties that were in a similar state, where investment has been made in the upkeep of those properties because the owners have seen the commitment on the public side of things.  This will generate a response in the market, if one can call it that.</p><p> That is the strong tenet and, as I mentioned earlier, we are engaging with the local authorities on a very active basis, in particular with the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, URDF, and it is a point to be made time and again.  One of the learnings from the past two years, in particular, is the reclaiming of the street by the public, namely, the reclaiming of the car parking spaces outside pubs and restaurants having outdoor dining facilities.  Both our Department and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media have found that has been very successful.  To be honest, it has overcome some of the reticence, sometimes, of the local traders and of the local community around that as they can see it can be very positive in the economic sense and in the life and activity within the town itself.  That is something we are building on in terms of trying to encourage businesses to do more of that because it chimes very much with the Towns Centre First policy and the night-time economy policy we are preparing.  That activity is something that just cannot be left there; there has to be intervention also.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stewart Logan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#O00300"><p>I would also make the point that that is essentially one of the main lessons that came through from the advisory group, namely, that the Town Centre First policy has to co-ordinate these different funds that are available.  The local authorities and the local town teams have to put their projects together to actively pursue the available funding across quite a number of points.  The URDF and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, RRDF, are the flagship ones but there is a plethora of other funding sources available, and if you have your project in place, you are in a much better position to acquire that funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#O00400"><p>This leads me on to another question.  We hear a great deal about the big-ticket items such as the &euro;81 million project mentioned by Mr. Logan in Waterford on the North Quays.  If I am a private building owner, and the Department has done a very nice square, a public space, under the new URDF, and I want to develop my second or third floor into apartments and residential living space, or even the lower floor if it complies with the local area plan, I do not have any control over the footpath outside.  Nobody wants to walk out the front door of their apartment with a child to a 2 ft. wide footpath.  One would want some space there for planters and so forth.  Such a person has no control over that but the local authority does.  How does the interaction work on smaller jobs like that to improve the offering for pedestrians in terms of the safety aspect and making it more attractive to bring it back into residential use?  These are for quite small projects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stewart Logan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#O00500"><p>They are but again they are feeding into a local situation.  It is very much a question of the prioritisation of those projects where one has perhaps, as the Chairman said, some activity in the private market around housing which should co-ordinate with what is available from the Department of Transport in respect of those.  A normal stock in trade for local authorities' functions is improving footpaths, public lighting and road maintenance.  Our piece is probably the larger one, which is the public realm piece, where there is a new plaza or a significant investment which may involve repurposing or reinvesting in the water infrastructure that is under that road.  That can also be a co-ordination piece.  There is good practice.</p> <p>  The point was made earlier around the data that is involved in this dereliction, which has to be considered.  However, there is also a piece about best practice.  That is certainly something we want the Town Centre First national co-ordination office to do and to be aware of.</p> <p>  As Ms Graham mentioned, there is good practice around the making of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, in terms of the use of the Derelict Sites Act in Waterford and Limerick.  That is such an exchange because there is not a form for it at the moment and we are contacted constantly by individuals within the local authorities who ask how this is being done elsewhere.  I know it is being done elsewhere but what is the form?  We want that to be built on and to provide that communication and best practice exchange between local authorities so they are able to build on good practice elsewhere and, certainly, to see more of it.</p></speech>

I give the example of local authorities which have a county architect, someone who is able to oversee these projects from above and see how all of these parts work together.  That is one of the additional officers I would like to see added to every local authority along with a vacant homes officer.  A county architect would be one of the most beneficial posts we could create which could pull all those different divisions together, that is, active transport and the ability to try to find building owners.  The big disincentive is that we just do not know who owns the buildings or the derelict sites.  It is too big a task to chase that down, so it just gets left and ignored.  That exists throughout all of the local authorities.  I am hoping the vacant homes officers would take this suggestion on board also.</p></speech>

It may be a professional skill but it may also be around the personal enthusiasm and commitment to the job.  These may be found in different professions in the different local authorities.  It is about how they work in the particular local authority in terms of pulling those skills together.  We have been less prescriptive about what that skill is but it is important that there is a range of skills available.</p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman that there are very good examples out there and that was why in the Town Centre First document, there is a great deal of examples because that is the kind of best practice we are talking about.  To be honest, and Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and I would agree, we had to code the number of examples going into the document.  This involves building on what we have, which is 500 or so towns and multiples of villages.  It is a big task.</p></speech>

I can think of someone in my own area with great ideas.  Sometimes we are top-heavy in local government.  Our chief executives are dominant characters by their very nature in how they have come up to that position, as most of them have come up through the ranks.  Not very many of them have come from the private sector, from somewhere else or, indeed, from overseas.  This is the way, unfortunately, that we do local government, so it is the same people.  They start in a local authority in a rural area and move into the city.</p> <p>  One can have very many skilled people in local government, including architects, landscape architects, parks designers and public realm people and when one gets enthusiasm, it carries the day and brings support with it.  One does not necessarily need all of the skills.  Enthusiasm carries one along in the public realm.</p> <p>  It is interesting because I am a landscape contractor by profession and I know everybody wants to have a property on the south side.  I can take people to streets in my own town of D&uacute;n Laoghaire where there is not a vacant shop facing south.  Aspect and orientation is a factor in respect of the sun.  There are so many little facets to a place.  A street can become activated and animated.  We have seen this through the Covid-19 period, where so many places which had nothing now had people outside selling bits of food, coffee and so forth and there was improved paving or temporary facilities.  These places have taken on a life of their own and a number of people have said to me that there are places within five or ten minutes of their house that they never knew existed.</p><p>There would be outdoor space, which improves community and local interaction.  There are so many knock-on effects.</p><p> Again, I wish everybody well.  I know many of the people here today are deeply involved with all of this.  It is a tribute and the witnesses should keep going.  Politicians come and go but what we have in common is that we call live in communities and villages.  What is really good about what we have spoken about today is the question of a local vision and ambition.  A regional vision can feed into our national plans.  For the first time in a long time - I was a councillor for over 20 years and I am here for a few years - I see a layering process and where we are going.  That is really important and I thank the witnesses for that.</p></speech>

I remember when the URDF and RRDF were announced and I seem to remember a climate resilience fund being announced at the same time of &euro;500 million.  Does anybody recall that at the time of the announcement?</p></speech>

The opening statement of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage speaks about the Town Centre First policy.  The next call is for projects for towns and aligning town centres first, which is good.  That is what we want to see.  The criteria will also specifically identify tackling vacancy.  Will Ms Graham give some detail on how the application criteria has changed to focus people on vacancy or dereliction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#P00500"><p>The criteria set out are largely as one might expect, relating to compact growth, brownfield and integrated urban development.  I might ask Ms Clifford to come in on this.  These are marked and it is specifically about giving a scoring where tackling of vacancy or dereliction forms part of the project.  It is about highlighting that process and amplifying it within the projects.  In very big projects there are areas of dereliction and reuse.  We have also seen them in smaller projects where people are perhaps looking at derelict buildings in towns and backlands in towns.  It is about making that very explicit as criteria on which people will be judged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.755" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#P00600"><p>When Ms Graham talks about tackling vacancy, I am conscious that when we start really looking at the detail of vacancy and dereliction, there can be a vacant home, site or commercial building.  Those would not be derelict but rather just vacant.  In tackling vacancy, is Ms Graham speaking about vacant buildings that used to have a commercial use in our towns?  Is that the aim?</p></speech>

It is any level of vacancy or dereliction that could be brought into use.  It could be brought into use for residential purposes or as part of the economic development of the town.  We would be looking at a locality and the levels of dereliction and vacancy so I am being a bit prescriptive with criteria that we will work through with local authorities before finalising.  In some cases, the vacant homes are population-dispersed.  We are really looking at where there is a significant level of vacancy that may relate to the fact that the area of the town has become derelict or less attractive, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

I do not believe we would make a distinction in the URDF as to whether a property is vacant or derelict.  It would form part of a wider project that would be trying to tackle an area.  It could bring some derelict properties into some community or public building use or something of that nature.  That is what we are talking about.  It could be about reimagining an area where there is much dereliction for other purposes.</p></speech>

Is it the same for our town and village renewal?  Are we concentrating on the town centre or is that just something used in the cities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stewart Logan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022030800002#P01100"><p>I can answer that because that is very much the essence of Town Centre First.  It is about such concentration in a primary sense.  It is not divorced from our planning system, as the Chairman is aware.  We have issued development plan guidance specifically under section 20 of the Act.  There may well be a case for work to go out from the centre to an area that needs expansion but that would not be at the cost of neglecting the core area of the two.  Where services are available, it makes more sense in terms of our carbon footprint to concentrate on that area.  Planning guidance is quite specific around that and it would be very much keyed in, as it is currently with the urban regeneration fund and will continue to be.</p></speech>

Adding all the various policy tools that have been outlined, including the URDF and Town Centre First and so on, I take my perspective from the towns and villages in my community.  Many are what might be called urban villages.  I am thinking of areas like Finglas and towns like Ballymun.  They could be replicated in places like Raheny and new communities in Donaghmede and so on.  The question is where those urban villages fit in the policy framework.</p> <p>  For example, with Town Centre First, do urban villages fall under its remit?  Are they eligible to apply?  Dublin City Council has not made applications under that scheme.  The URDF, a large amount of very welcome money, has primarily gone to the inner city area and it is often used for large citywide projects.  We must look to the future expansion of housing, such as that on the Oscar Traynor Road lands, with nearly 1,000 homes, and the Ballymun local area plan, which has nearly 2,000 homes.  The master plan for private land on the Jamestown Road site would accommodate more than 1,000 homes as well.  How do we retrofit existing communities with facilities that are needed for those new homes?  Adding more homes into those communities that in many cases have already experienced a dearth of community facilities would only compound problems.</p> <p>  In particular I am thinking of the community at Santry, which has seen much private sector development, all on private land.  It has two large council areas on either side and perhaps it has missed out on some service provision that may exist in areas where the city council may have more of a presence.  Will the witnesses piece together a plan that I can beat up Dublin City Council with?  I can say that tools are available to these towns and what the council should apply to.</p> <p>  I echo the point made by Senator Boyhan on the accountability for who is deciding what applications for URDF come before the Department.  Those decisions are largely made by officials.  My understanding is there has not been any serious democratic scrutiny of which applications come before the Department for the scheme, which is an issue.  The Ballymun local area plan is a Dublin City Council project and it has been on its books since 2017.  All the land is owned by Dublin City Council.  Despite this, the council did not put forward the area for the URDF.  There is something wrong in that respect when there is such an obvious need to tackle disadvantage and at the same time address the question of new and affordable housing and cost rental.  I appreciate there is much to get through there.</p></speech>

I wrote down something in reply to Senator Boyhan and it would be remiss of me not to say that in all this we have seen huge co-operation from local authorities and chief executives in their engagement.  That is important.  The point made by the Deputy on the involvement of elected members is one we can take away and look at.</p><p>Urban villages are a really interesting concept.  There was a book that wrote about Dublin being created of villages.  The Town Centre First policy is primarily focused on towns that have their own integrity but it specifically provides that the principles can be applied in cities and to very small villages.  Those are the concepts about community knowing what they want the future of their area to look like, the place-making piece.  While much of Town Centre First will be focused on enabling the towns, including towns in north Dublin, the URDF covers areas with a population of over 10,000.  Therefore, we will include the urban villages.</p><p> Earlier Lisa Clifford explained that because we were oversubscribed, we had to look at the core areas, but we will move out.  I take on board the point the Deputy made about how prioritisation within an authority might be looked at in that context.  We were anxious to get the first lot of projects up and running because that gives us a perspective on how much funding is left and as we go into the latter phases more funding will be available.  Those are important points the Deputy has made.</p><p> The cro&iacute; c&oacute;naithe towns will be focused on towns and the cro&iacute; c&oacute;naithe cities will be focused on cities.  The CPO powers go across the board.  There are a range of sources.  Some urban development funding will come in from the regional assemblies.  Many of these are pathfinders and as they are rolled out, we are very open to identifying gaps in areas that need to be addressed.</p></speech>

There are great schemes relating to empty buildings in the centre of rural towns that are being used as community hubs or for other purposes.  I could talk about empty pubs in Finglas village and derelict sites in Ballymun or Santry.  Those urban villages all have the same needs and I would argue that they all have the same integrity.  I know Ms Graham does not mean it in that sense of the word.  There are distinct geographic areas that make up a city.  If we are going to be more sustainable and have 15-minute cities, urban villages must increasingly become places where people connect so that people are not travelling into and out of the city all the time and rather are travelling into their local village.  Particularly on Town Centre First, are those urban villages eligible for the policy tools I talked about for hubs etc. or is that exclusively for rural towns?</p></speech>

When I said integrity, it was more related to, for example, Santry being beside other areas, as the Deputy said.

While this Department is very focused on rural areas, there are some funding streams for things such as hubs that the Deputy mentioned.  We funded the development of hubs in some of those urban villages he mentioned through various schemes.  One of the schemes we launched recently helped to develop existing infrastructure in those hubs, including additional seating and Covid-related social distancing facilities.  While we are quite rural focused given the nature of the Department, some of our schemes cover those urban villages the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

Most of my questions are local ones if the witnesses do not mind.  There were some very welcome announcements recently related to Town Centre First fund, specifically for Lusk.

Both could really benefit from this.  What is the timeline for delivery of these health checks?  When will they happen and how will that look?

We have given &euro;100,000 to 26 towns to support developing the Town Centre First plan itself.  We see that very much as a first phase of that funding.  I think the Deputy is referring to funding under the town and village renewal scheme for Naul and Oldtown.  I do not see any issue with crossover there.</p> <p>  We have also allocated funding for town regeneration officers in local authorities.  We secured that funding in budget 2022.  Earlier we talked about the national structures.  It is about getting to the final bits of detail and putting them in place.  We have funding.  We have had very good discussions with the CCMA on how to roll them out.  We hope to start to put them in place in the coming weeks.  They will be key enablers and key drivers for towns across local authorities in the coming months as we roll TCF out.  I hope that addresses the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I thank Mr O'Brien.</p> <p>  My next question relates to the derelict sites register.  In Fingal there were three properties on it as of December 2020.  No additional sites were added to that and the local authority did not collect a single cent under the derelict sites levy in 2020.  Six sites on the vacant sites register that are vacant now were vacant on the register in 2020.  They were worth over &euro;55 million but not a cent was collected on that.  Fingal County Council is losing out on money here.  Has the Department provided assistance for the collection of this money?  What level of engagement has there been?</p> <p>  My next question is very parochial and one on which I have asked a number of parliamentary questions.  I am looking for guidance and assistance from the witnesses.  The HSE owns derelict houses on HSE land in Portrane in my constituency.  I understand that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has no hostility to working to get these brought back into use.  Who needs to make the final decision on this?  I have corresponded with the Minister.  He is aware of this; it is in his own area.  It needs a push to get it started.  In the meantime, several houses could be brought back into use.  In their day they were really decent family homes and we would like to see them brought back into use.  It is not fully the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and not fully the responsibility of the Department of Health.  The Department of Health owns the land and the houses, but it does not have the capacity to do anything with them.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has the capacity but it does not own the land and houses.  It just needs somebody to take the initiative on this.  I have asked both Departments and both of them have said they have no problem with somebody taking an initiative but nobody is taking an initiative.</p></speech>

Last November we initiated a call to local authorities to review the Act to see if any operational tweaks could be made to the legislation to improve it.  I have committed here to giving the data we have on derelict sites, which would obviously reflect what the Deputy is saying about Fingal but to give that in a global sense.  We are very open to proposing legislative changes or seeing if some local authorities are better in their practice and seeing if that practice can be rolled out.  We see that very much as part of what the Town Centre First policy might do.</p><p> In terms of properties that are derelict, our Secretary General has written to all Secretaries General to see what portfolio projects they may have that could be used.  There is an action under Housing for All for State properties that are underutilised.  Many of the structures that are in Housing for All are looking at driving these actions in combination and how this might be brought forward.  First, we must get the data on what is out there but also on what mechanisms we can use.  We are looking with the Housing Agency to see if it has a role, because sometimes it can activate issues more easily as a single body than multiple local authorities, for example, dealing with HSE properties.  We have a number of funding schemes.  Many of them are focused on individuals.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns funding is for individuals, but we are looking with the regional assemblies at European funding that is due to be finalised at the end of the second quarter to see if there are gaps where resourcing could be put in place.  It is something we are actively looking at.  We have had a couple of examples of a similar nature shared today where there are properties that may not be owned by Departments but are in the State's portfolio and could be brought into use.  We are very anxious to see that happen.  It would be a common community response to see such projects activated.</p></speech>

I would nearly prefer if one Department said it was not doing that because we could have a proper conversation about the issue.  It is not unique to my area, but when I walk past the houses, I see they are falling further into dereliction, and it will be increasingly expensive to bring them back into use.  Some catalyst will have to be deployed to get the ball rolling on this because both Departments are saying they are not hostile to derelict houses being developed, but they are still not being developed.  Would Ms Graham be able to give me a sense of when we could expect to see these houses coming back into use?</p></speech>

I apologise if it was because, like Deputy O'Reilly, I was in the Chamber.  I refer to compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  Local authorities have spent millions on what could be described as the unsuccessful pursuit of properties.  In many cases, it is not as much the availability of resources as the chilling effect a bad case can have.  Local authorities ask why they would spend hundreds of thousands of euro pursuing a single property when it might get nowhere in the courts and it could spend the money on developing housing.  One of the big issues we have is a reluctance by officials to go down the road of CPOs at all.  Whatever powers we give and whatever changes we make in the area, we must also give confidence to local authority officials that they can pursue matters.</p> <p>  The second point is that it is far too cumbersome to secure properties.  I do not represent the area any longer, but there are two properties on Walsh Road and everybody in the whole of Drumcondra knows the two houses are collapsing in on top of each other.  There are huge problems.  Ten years after I raised the issue on the council, those properties are still there for all the complicated reasons that exist.  There are many similar properties around Dublin city.  Often, it can come down to the financial capacity of the owners of the properties or other limiting capacities.  People may have other issues.  On a different site in my area, somebody inherited a very large property but does not have the mental health resilience to be able to take on a project of that size.  Active land management must be the key here.  We need to empower local authorities not just to tackle vacancy but to undertake active land management whereby solutions are put together for landowners that otherwise would not have the financial or business acumen or inclination to proceed with a project.</p> <p>  Providing them is one thing, but sometimes local authorities have to put together a solution to unlock the potential of a site.  Vacancy officers are one element in the equation, but in Ballymun, for example, we have an economic officer specifically for that electoral district within the city.  It is unique to Dublin City Council.  He actively tries to unlock the potential of units that are developed, for example, that have large fit-out costs or leases that are taking too long to get through the local authority or for whatever other reason.  That is what we need to see both in terms of vacancy and CPOs.  I ask Ms Graham to tackle those big areas.</p></speech>

Large portions of it date back to the 19th century.  Deputy McAuliffe rightly said it is quite cumbersome and it needs to be modernised.  Some aspects of it will come up in the context of the planning review.  It has been highlighted as an area of difficulty.  In the meantime, one of the measures the Housing Agency has put in place is a dedicated procurement unit with CPO advice so that it can advise local authorities.  It produces guidance around that and will continue to do it.  Bridging finance will come from the Housing Finance Agency, in particular if local authorities want to compulsorily purchase properties, as we envisage under Housing for All, and put them out to the market.  As Deputy McAuliffe says, quite often it is the case the individual who owns a property does not have the wherewithal for a number of reasons to bring it back into use.  We do need to look at what risks a local authority might face in that regard and ensure we mitigate the risks so that local authorities can move with a degree of confidence even in a complex process.  That is what we are trying to work on at the moment and then see what comes from the Law Reform Commission in terms of revamping the CPO legislation.</p></speech>

The only project to benefit from the URDF in my constituency was &euro;37,000 for a feasibility study on the Dunsink lands.  Some of my colleagues asked me if it was &euro;40 million, and I said it was just &euro;37,000.  That was a case of the local authority using money to carry out a feasibility study with the intention of possibly applying again.  Fingal County Council has suggested rezoning the Dunsink lands as part of its development plan, which it had not otherwise planned to do.  The question is if there will be a link between different phases where local authorities might provide an early phase for feasibility and then larger amounts.  Has the Department had detailed discussions with Fingal County Council in regard to the Dunsink lands?  This is an extensive land bank on the edge of the city but very close to existing communities that would have concerns.</p></speech>

It was the case that the first call resulted in a lot of feasibility studies and we are seeing more projects as we go on.  Ms Clifford might speak about Fingal in particular.</p></speech>

The major one was the regeneration of Balbriggan.  Deputy McAuliffe is correct that &euro;40,000 was given to Fingal to do the feasibility study on the Dunsink site.  It is with a view to seeing what needs to be invested to develop that site in the future.  There are two aspects to that.  The first is the development of the site, but the council also needed to undertake a number of environmental surveys on the site to see the extent of investment that might be needed going forward.</p> <p>  To go back to a point Ms Graham made earlier, our next call is focused on town centre first, but thereafter we will have a call that is focused on the cities, and it will look to those large-scale, strategic sites that need to be developed and the suite of infrastructure that might need to be put in place there.  We have a number of those feasibility master planning projects in train that will feed into the larger capital projects going forward.  The Naas Road is another example.</p></speech>

First, it is a very complicated site that has a large population of the Traveller community who would need to be consulted.  Second, there have long been promises that the site would be for sports and recreation facilities.  Third, Fingal County Council has a long history of building large unsupported residential developments on the edge of Dublin city, Meakstown being the classic one where housing was provided and the community facilities are only now following, 15 years later.  We cannot see that on the Dunsink lands, even though there is great potential on that site.  Of course, there is also the observatory, which is a little gem.  I would love to see more people getting access even to the grounds if not to the observatory itself.</p></speech>

Blackpool is probably one of the most historic areas in Cork, with the history of the area going back hundreds of years.  We have villages within cities which have their own identification and the people associate with them.  Should they not qualify under the town and village scheme?  Blackpool is an area I have been looking to have regenerated for decades.  It has huge issues around flooding and dereliction and, to me, this area would be perfect for that scheme.  Is it possible to include villages within cities or towns?  I know a population of less than 10,000 is required under the town and village renewal scheme but Blackpool is losing out because it is part of Cork city and it is not seen as a village in itself.</p></speech>

I understand the point the Deputy is making.  Our focus, as the Department of Rural and Community Development, is very much on the rural side so it is currently not covered under the town and village renewal scheme.</p></speech>

With regard to sanctions for local authorities which do not collect the derelict sites levy or which do not list sites as derelict sites, is there anything we can do to ensure local authorities deliver?  The figures I have are astounding, given the number of local authorities not even putting sites on the list or not collecting the levy.  If we are going to tackle dereliction, this is one of the tools we would need.  Is there any way we can compel local authorities to do what is covered by legislation?</p></speech>

They are sometimes working through difficult problems with people.  What we are trying to do is get behind some of the issues that have been raised in this committee, in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere around the obvious levels of dereliction in areas and the fact those sites are not on the derelict sites register.  There are some reasons for that - for example, it only covers urban areas - but we are trying to get behind that.  When we have that exercise concluded, we will be happy to come back to the committee.</p></speech>

Last year, I was informed there were only three full-time vacant homes officers in the 31 local authorities.  The Minister then announced in November that there was an initial &euro;10,000 on top of the existing &euro;50,000 to ensure that every local authority will have a full-time vacant homes officer.  Has every local authority got a full-time vacant homes officer?  I believe the &euro;60,000 should be more like &euro;260,000 because there should be a team in each local authority to tackle vacancy.</p></speech>

We have had a number of people coming back but they all have to come back.  The funding for the vacant homes officers was pre-funded up to June of this year so they are coming back to us over the coming months.  We expect them all to be full-time and that is what we have asked for, and we do not have any indications otherwise.  We expect to get a report for each authority over the coming months on the arrangements they have put in place.  We had one session with all of the vacant homes officers in January.  As many of the measures are rolled out, we expect we will be having further sessions with them.</p> <p>  We are looking more deeply at the resourcing of local authorities to deal with both planning and town centre issues and it may well show that more resources are required.  We are working with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to look at what gaps there may be at the moment, what future gaps there may be and what skills gaps there may be.  That ultimately may lead to engagement with the third level sector to deal with the kind of skills that are required for the future.  There is a piece of work under way on it that will be finished by the summer.</p></speech>

When the Department is trying to judge the applications, does it try to look for equity across the country based on <i>per capita</i>or population figures?  This is very substantial and significant funding that can lift any town or village, so we are trying to make sure everybody gets a chance at it.</p></speech>

We run a number of tests across it and that is one of them.  That is one of the reasons why we would now be talking about the move from competitive bidding, which has worked very well for authorities that have projects thought about and developed, to working with local authorities to bring projects forward.  For authorities that perhaps have not quite got to that stage, rather than having them keep submitting projects that do not meet the criteria, we work with them to bring a project to fruition.</p></speech>

To get that balance, we need to look at it and, for example, decide that area X does not have any projects and that, in fact, we need to work with that authority so it brings them forward and that we give it more support in terms of the type of projects the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, can fund, rather than having it try to submit something that misses the mark.</p> <p>  Ms Clifford chairs the project appraisal board so she might comment.</p></speech>

The first two calls were very useful, as Ms Graham said, in terms of bringing forward projects that were already thought through and were a certain degree along the line.  When we were looking back at both of the calls and reviewing once the announcements were made, it was very clear there were a number of areas where, from a national planning framework, NPF, perspective, we need investment but the right projects had not come through.  That has influenced our thinking in terms of working more directly with the local authorities going forward, particularly those local authorities where we can see there are gaps in their development objectives where we need to target investment.  That is what is guiding how we are going to develop the next call, moving slightly away from the more competitive element of it and really targeting the investment in those gap areas where, from an NPF perspective, the ERDF has not found the right project yet.</p></speech>

Quality is obviously a major issue when it comes to the best use of public funds, but we are also aware of the imperative around balanced regional development.  We have a number of conditions within schemes to help that along.  For example, in respect of the town and village renewal scheme, we look at minimum levels of funding for counties to make sure there is no risk of being completely left behind.  We make sure there is a maximum number of applications per local authority in order that a scheme is not dominated by particular areas.  Overall, we track that and keep an eye on the regional spread.  We have published some maps, including heat maps, relating to the spread of those proposals and projects that are funded.  Quality is a significant issue for us but we keep regional spread in mind.  As Ms Graham said, there is an element of us supporting those areas that may not have been as successful in the past and keeping an eye on that.  We certainly believe that the element in Town Centre First of upskilling towns, and bringing towns and communities along to be able to make the best of those funding opportunities, is also important.</p></speech>

This is the fourth meeting in the series of four we have had.  They have been very informative and interesting for the committee.  We have had very good engagement on this matter and we will now produce a report on it.  Aside from the Housing for All policy, which contains some very good objectives, if we can successfully implement many of the objectives in the Town Centre First policy and Our Rural Future policy document, we will go a long way towards achieving balanced development and a significant distance in rejuvenating many of our towns and villages that have started to decay over the years.  The objectives are there, the funding is there, which is also incredibly important, and the political will is there to deliver on that.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Graham, Mr. Logan and Ms Clifford, in addition to Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Mulherin and Mr. Forsyth, for their engagement.</p></speech>

I would be appreciative if the committee would join with me in proposing that we send a letter to Garda Commissioner Drew Harris to give our unwavering support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the work that it does in every part of the country, but particularly in the Border constituencies, which we all acknowledge is a little bit more difficult in terms of the terrain and the work it does there, and to extend our good wishes to Garda Padraig Scott for a speedy recovery and a return to duty as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The purpose of our meeting is to discuss the written submissions on the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill.  All witnesses are appearing before the committee from outside the precincts of Leinster House.  I remind guests and members to mute microphones when not speaking to ensure we can all hear each other.  I ask everybody to use the hand-raising function when they want to contribute.</p> <p>  Our representatives comprise: Mr. Colm Finlay of BetXS; Ms Jackie Murphy, director of Ladbrokes Ireland; Mr. Martin Le Jeune, head of public affairs UK-Ireland at Entain; Mr. Conor Grant, CEO of Flutter UK and Ireland; Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, chief legal officer and group commercial director of Flutter UK and Ireland; Mr. Graham Ross, Ireland country manager of Lottoland; and Ms Sharon Byrne, chairperson of the Irish Bookmakers Association.  They are all very welcome.  We are also joined by Ms Clare Brosnan, principal officer, and Ms Joanne King, principal officer, from the Department of Justice, who are very welcome.</p> <p>  I have a little bit of housekeeping to do on reminding everyone of the rules around parliamentary privilege, so please bear with me.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, they will be asked to redirect or discontinue their remarks.</p><p>For witnesses attending outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations on parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  The issue of witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State does not have any bearing on us today.</p><p> I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which the Parliament has chosen to sit today, which is Leinster House.  I cannot permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to that constitutional requirement.  Members and witnesses are expected to strictly adhere to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today and any deviation from that topic will be addressed through the Chair.</p><p> The format of the meeting is that I will invite each of the organisations in turn to make an opening statement that is of a maximum of three minutes.  I will then call on the members of the committee in the order that they indicate to me to put questions.  The committee operates on a rota system which provides each member with an initial seven minutes to engage with our witnesses.  It is important to note that that seven minutes is for both questions and answers.  Therefore, it is important for members to put their questions while allowing the witnesses sufficient time to respond.  When all members have indicated and have had their initial engagement, a second round will commence if and where that is necessary.</p><p> I will call each of the organisations to deliver their opening statement, beginning with Mr. Finlay from BetXS.</p></speech>

I am a licensed independent bookmaker.  I thank the committee for inviting me today to share my thoughts on the new gambling Bill due before Oireachtas later this year.  I should preface my remarks by saying they relate primarily to retail betting in betting shops.  My credentials are that my family have been involved in bookmaking going back four generations, so I have great in-depth knowledge and understanding of the business at the coalface.</p> <p>  In my earlier submission to the committee, I identified three key areas that must be addressed in the proposed Bill if we are to have a proper framework governing the industry: underage gambling; gambling addiction in all its aspects; and anti-money laundering, AML, issues.  Members will see that technology can solve all three, so let me deal with each briefly.</p> <p>  The first issue is underage betting.  Sports and betting have become deeply intertwined in recent years.  This has been driven by massive television coverage, advertising and social media exposure.  Young people have been seduced by the glamour and excitement of sports and betting.  The inevitable recreational exposure has led to vulnerable youths being drawn into this world of easy money.  Given the way betting shops operate, it is not possible, within the financial constraints of their operation, to control or monitor underage behaviour.  Staff are under pressure dealing with transactions and are unable to supervise closely.  I believe technology can solve this issue.</p> <p>  The second issue is gambling addiction.  This, by its nature, can be a very secretive activity but with appalling consequences for individuals and their families.  Current betting shop vetting procedures are simply not fit for purpose.  There is no industry-wide process to recognise, control and manage the vetting process.  Proper identification using technology can overcome this.  Sophisticated electronic controls can be put in place at the point of sale to ensure compliance.</p> <p>  Third, the AML issue has come the fore with recent publicity on how criminals manage to disguise their financial activities through the medium of betting.  This corrupt activity has implications not just for betting and it has also influenced sporting outcomes.  Again, technology can address this comprehensively.</p> <p>  I would be pleased to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

We are grateful for the invitation and we welcome the inquiry.  We welcome what the committee is doing and we are on the same page with it as far as safer gambling is concerned.</p> <p>  Members may not have heard of Entain, but we are one of the world&rsquo;s largest sports-betting and gaming groups.  In Ireland, people probably know us as Ladbrokes.  We employ 700 people and have 133 betting shops in the State.  We are very proud to operate in Ireland and we would like to continue doing so.  We make a very significant contribution to Ireland's economy beyond employment.  In 2019, the last representative year given the lockdown, we paid well over &euro;14 million to the State via various channels.</p> <p>  We believe gambling is a legitimate activity that thousands of Irish people participate in safely and responsibly and we think the work of the committee in establishing a new regulator is going to be an extremely positive development.  In fact, it gives Ireland the opportunity to be an example of regulatory excellence and we welcome that.  We need to ensure safer gambling.  On the comparative evidence from the UK, I hold my hand up immediately because I know we cannot just transfer UK experience to Ireland.  The evidence suggests, however, that problem gambling in the UK is stable or falling.  We would like the regulator to carry out the same kind of research and find the same kind of evidence that exists in the UK for the Irish market.  Our view is that online gambling is inherently no more dangerous than retail gambling, and I am sure this will come up in questions.</p> <p>  We would like to state to the committee that we have a complete commitment to reducing levels of problem gambling wherever we can because we want to be a sustainable business, with loyal and contented customers.  As a result, we have invested very heavily in technological solutions to treating problem gambling online and we can deal with these in more detail during questions.  We have a system called advanced responsibility and care, ARC, which is increasingly seeking not only to identify people who have problem gambling behaviour but to anticipate that and to intervene before it develops into problem gambling.</p> <p>  As the committee has seen from our submission, we welcome the general scheme and we welcome its main themes.  There are a few reservations that we have in regard to betting shop displays, advertising, marketing and sponsorship, and those are based on the fact that we want our customers to enjoy betting as freely as possible.  Second, as Ms Murphy will discuss, our shops are an integral part of communities.  Finally, sponsorship and advertising support Irish sport, particularly Irish horse racing, which is one of this country's greatest assets.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Conor Grant, who is chief executive officer of Flutter UK and Ireland.  We are delighted to participate in this session today.  We have made a detailed submission to the committee and sincerely hope that we can constructively assist in its very welcome and important work in this area.  Flutter fully supports the establishment of a well-resourced, evidence-led gambling regulatory authority which is given broad powers by legislation to respond to a quickly evolving industry.  This is an important point to emphasise as there is a popular misconception that gambling companies are against regulation, whereas the opposite is the case.</p> <p>  Flutter&rsquo;s business model is based on regulated markets and we hold licenses in more than 20 countries and 12 US states.  Ireland is our home, where the business was founded, and we very much want it to have a world class regulatory system for our industry.  Flutter Entertainment is one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest listed companies and a global leader in the gambling sector.  Ireland is one half of our UK and Ireland division, from which we operate the Paddy Power, Sky Betting and Gaming and Betfair brands.  We employ 1,600 people in our Dublin HQ, along with a further 1,400 colleagues in 265 Paddy Power shops located in every county in the State.  In total, we have approximately 17,000 employees and more than 14 million active customers across the globe.  In 2021, we contributed more than &euro;125.5 million in taxes to the Irish Exchequer and we are major supporters of the Irish horse racing industry.</p><p> In the conversation about gambling it is often unsaid that the vast majority of people gamble for fun and do so safely.  From the Listowel Races to the All-Ireland finals, people the length and breadth of Ireland like a punt, whether it is yearly on the Grand National or once a week on a football accumulator.  With the development of digital betting and gaming services, we need a strong regulator to ensure all gambling companies in Ireland work to reduce harm to customers for whom gambling becomes a problem.  In addition, Irish punters should be protected against the dangers of unregulated offshore operators.  As a company, we accept that we have not always got it right in the past.  However, we have learned from other markets and made significant voluntary, proactive strides to protect customers in Ireland.  We have greatly increased the resources we dedicate to protecting our customers from harm.  Today, more than 180 full-time employees are dedicated to safer gambling across our UK and Ireland operations and these are very energetic, dedicated people.</p><p> Important initiatives we have recently introduced include a mandatory &euro;500 per month net deposit limit for all customers under the age of 25; a ban on customers using credit cards across online and retail; and a pre-watershed whistle to whistle advertising ban that restricts advertising during live sport.  In addition, Flutter has committed to materially increase its contribution to support research, education and treatment of problem gambling to 1% of net gaming revenue in Ireland by next year.  However, none of these initiatives is currently required of the industry as a whole in Ireland. </p><p> The legislative challenge is to strike the right balance between allowing the vast majority who enjoy gambling safely to do so while protecting those who are vulnerable to experiencing harm from their gambling. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Ross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022030800002#F00500"><p>I thank the Chairman, members and secretariat for the invitation to partake in the discussion on the proposed gambling regulation Bill.  I will take a few moments to explain who Lottoland is as a company and set out our initial views on the proposed approach to the Bill.  Lottoland has been a licensed remote bookmaker in Ireland since April 2016.  We also operate across 15 markets globally, with licences held in key markets, including Gibraltar, the UK and Malta, supported by a global workforce of more than 400 employees, serving more than 15 million customers worldwide.</p> <p>  For those who are not necessarily familiar with the Lottoland brand, as a relatively small operator within the Irish market, we offer a wide range of online gaming and gambling products, including lottery betting, sportsbook, online casino, bingo and charity products, including our Win-Win charity lotto and scratch cards, which directly support our Irish charity partners, the Irish Red Cross and the Dublin Society for Protection against Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA.</p> <p>  With regard to today&rsquo;s discussion, gambling is a long-standing feature of Irish culture and a popular form of entertainment but it has been clear for some time that a modern, sustainable and sector-wide regulatory regime, with a single oversight body, is required in this country.  Progress on these reforms, while overdue, is in the best interest of not only the tens of thousands of Irish consumers who safely participate in and enjoy gaming, gambling and lottery activities each week but also, importantly, for the smaller numbers of customers at risk of problem gambling, in addition to the wider general public and the sector itself.  In this regard, we believe the proposed general scheme, while largely positive, risks not fully delivering on the consistent, comprehensive and consumer-centred approach that will be required.  Ensuring the sector as a whole, that is, all gaming, gambling and lottery operators, including the national lottery, are included within this one regulatory framework will be key to providing for a level playing field and implementing adequate safeguards for consumers across all products and services in the market.</p> <p>  In a jurisdiction the size of the Irish one, we query the effectiveness and cost efficiency of potentially having two separate regulatory frameworks for the gambling sector - one in this newly established authority and the other in the existing national lottery regulator.  We cannot afford a lack of alignment around key regulatory provisions moving forward if we are to achieve the goals set out by Government.  Therefore, we seek confirmation that all operators across the sector will be included within this proposed legislation. </p> <p>  It is also our experience from other markets that by providing for and establishing clear, fair and streamlined processes founded on open consultation between a well resourced regulatory function and operators from the off, we will be able to deliver an appropriately regulated environment here in Ireland.  To this end, we also recommend that provisions be made for the proposed authority to consult regularly and effectively with the sector, particularly on the formation, governance and ongoing operations of any social impact fund introduced. </p> <p>  We thank the committee for the invitation to provide our views as an existing operator on the draft Bill and we firmly believe such co-operation with the sector will be pivotal to informing the necessary robust and sustainable policy on an ongoing basis.  I look forward to responding to any queries members may have and providing clarifications on our submission throughout this session.</p></speech>

She has three minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.825" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022030800002#F00700"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for inviting the Irish Bookmakers Association, IBA, to participate in the committee's review of the scheme of the gambling regulation Bill.  Our association represents approximately 750 of the 800 betting shops in Ireland today.  Our members range from the large operators such as BoyleSports, Entain and Flutter to many of the independent bookmakers around the country with one or more shops.  We are long-standing supporters of the regulation for our sector and we believe effective, practical regulation and enforcement is necessary to ensure the highest standards are adopted across all types of gambling operators.</p> <p>  Betting shops provide entertainment in a comfortable, licensed, adult-only environment and are an important source of revenue to the Exchequer and to the horse and greyhound industries.  Betting shops and their head office locations employ more than 6,500 people.  They do not permit entry to those under the age of 18 and have been practising a Think 21 policy for several years.  I stress that applies to IBA members, not to the 50 operators which do not subscribe to the IBA codes.  With our fully trained staff, our members operate a self-exclusion scheme in every betting shop along with providing information around safer gambling and the support services available for anybody affected by problem gambling or gambling addiction.  They are also trained to intervene when a customer has been identified as displaying some signs of problem or addictive gambling.</p> <p>  With the absence of regulation for our sector, our association has been developing codes of practice in several key areas to try to ensure our members are operating in a socially responsible manner and affording customers a high level of protection and information.  The IBA-led developments, that is, our trade association developments,  include safer gambling training for staff, in-person and online; we funded a national problem gambling helpline and a network of counsellors in every county in Ireland; we started a Think 21 campaign, which prevents admission of those under the age of 18 to our member shops; we introduced a safer gambling code that went live in January of this year, which introduced safer practices around advertising, age verification, customer identification and payment methods; and we started a safer gambling week campaign four years ago, which is now an annual national awareness campaign that has proven to be very successful.  Our members also contribute to the Gambling Awareness Trust, which is an independent charity that provides vetting, supervision and funding for operators that provide problem gambling or gambling addiction services in Ireland.  </p> <p>  We believe the regulator should be fully resourced to ensure supervision and compliance can be consistent, effective and have safer gambling at its core.  This will ensure a high level of customer protection and standards across all operators and provide a level playing field for operators in the sector within which to operate.  The regulatory authority and its processes should also be flexible and proactive so that product development and consumer choice and protection are not hindered by the lack of relevant codes.  Our members are dedicated to continuing to improve our safer gambling measures both now and in time under the guidance of a dedicated regulatory authority.  I am thankful for the opportunity to present to the committee and I look forward to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

The first member offering is Deputy Carroll MacNeill, who has seven minutes for her questions and answers.</p></speech>

I hope they will excuse my voice today.  I have two questions.  The first is for Mr. Le Jeune and relates to the comment he made suggesting that online gambling is no more unsafe than retail gambling.  Will he go into that a little more?  Mr. Le Jeune is on mute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Le Jeune" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022030800002#G00300"><p>I am indeed on mute and I apologise.  I thank the Deputy very much for the question.  The reason I say that is that we in the UK have been measuring rates of problem gambling over many years, including the period in which online gambling's share of the market went from effectively zero to a substantial proportion.  Despite this, problem gambling rates as measured by the Gambling Commission, which is an official UK body and not an industry body, have either remained static or, in fact, dropped.  More dramatically - and even I was surprised by this - during the period up to September 2021, which covers the period of lockdown, problem gambling rates went from 0.6% of those who gambled at least once a year to 0.3%.  That is a remarkable figure.  The only deduction one can make from that is that there is no inherent difference between online gambling and retail gambling as far as problem gambling is concerned.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also made a comment.  This speaks to what the committee and the Oireachtas are so concerned about, that is, safety in gambling.  We have all had a number of constituents highlight the difficulties this issue has created in their lives and the lives of their families so it is of great concern to the Oireachtas.  I know that Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in only recently joined his organisation but he mentioned that it made mistakes in the past.  What were those mistakes?</p></speech>

It depends on how far back the Deputy wants to go.  All industries learn and this industry is evolving quickly.  It is a digital industry in the same way as the rest of the world is digitising.  If you have the number of customers a company like ours has, it is absolutely inevitable that there will be some errors.  The important thing is that we learn from them and we have done that very consistently.</p></speech>

As we have grown our market and the size of the company, we have equally scaled up all of our efforts with regard to safer gambling.  As I said, we have 180 people across the UK and Ireland who are very dedicated and entirely focused on safer gambling.  Behind that, we have very developed technological models.  I may ask my colleague, Mr. Grant, to come in on that point.</p></speech>

I am sorry to cut across Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  It is not my style but we are very limited on time.  I apologise for that.

Across our UK and Irish division, we intervene every month and review approximately 28,000 accounts.  Of these, we take action on approximately 7,000 accounts across the UK and Ireland.  The form this action takes ranges depending on the risk.  The fundamental difference between retail gambling and online gambling is that we have much greater access to data on people's behaviours in respect of online gambling.  With the model we have invested in, we can make predictions.  This is quite an important point with regard to how the online business is different.  This model allows us to intervene with customers.  We have 24-7 monitoring.  We know the indicators of harm and when we see them, we step in.  That can involve conversations to slow people down or pre-emptive action such as placing deposit limits on customers' accounts.  That is where there online business gives a greater level of protection than the retail business historically has.</p></speech>

I apologise that the start of the meeting was delayed by members' Oireachtas commitments.  Everybody is free to answer my first question.  Who here is actually seeking the introduction of licensing of fixed-odds betting terminals in Ireland?  I take it from the lack of response that none of the witnesses is seeking the legalisation of fixed-odds betting terminals in Ireland.  Am I right in that?</p></speech>

Where is the pressure for fixed-odds betting terminals, FOBTs, coming from?  Why is the matter included in this legislation?</p></speech>

The Irish Bookmakers Association has made several submissions in respect of the various schemes over recent years and has not called for the introduction of FOBTs.  I do not see them mentioned in this general scheme.  I certainly see mention of random number generator products, which would cover the virtual racing we have had in our shops since foot-and-mouth disease, but at no stage in recent years have we called for fixed-odds betting terminals.  I am not sure where the Senator is seeing pressure for their introduction.  I am not aware of anybody who is looking for their introduction to the Irish market at this time.</p></speech>

There seems to be mention of the possibility of the introduction of fixed-odds betting terminals and discussion as to the degree of reporting and scrutiny that is required in that regard.</p><p>I am happy to hear the important groups mentioned are not seeking the legalisation of FOBTs.  I can imagine they are a nice little earner in a bookmaking shop, but it would change the nature of bookmakers' premises and turn them into mini-casinos if FOBTs are permitted.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>

There is no result for "fixed odds betting terminal" and I do not recall it.  Our shops need to develop in line with technology and customer demand but to do so safely.  That is where a regulator is important.  He or she will be armed with the latest research and figures in an Irish context and will be able to recommend safe products which licensed members can offer to customers safely.</p></speech>

On television advertising, I confess that when channel-hopping using my Sky package, the amount of advertising of lottos, bingos and all sorts of things, especially on satellite channels, seems to be growing exponentially.  Is it necessary to have such extensive advertising?  It cannot be prevented from appearing on the side of football pitches during Premier League matches and the like.  Is it necessary to normalise gambling through bingo and lotteries to the extent that is happening in the UK?</p></speech>

From our perspective, advertising is an important mechanism for licensed operators in a regulated market to communicate with customers.  We strongly believe we should have the right to advertise.  We think this should be at the heart of a regulated market.  There is an ongoing discussion to be had about the frequency and tone of advertising.  In the UK, there is a pre-watershed ban in the market on the products the Senator referred to.  There is a right to advertise for regulated operators and that is an important part of any regulatory framework and legislation.  We have to continue to evaluate the tone and frequency of that advertising.</p></speech>

Is there any objection to giving local authorities a veto on such matters under the new legislation such as they have under the 1956 Act?  I take that silence to indicate there is no objection to it.</p></speech>

I take up where Senator McDowell left off.  Mr. Finlay said in his opening remarks that sport and betting have become deeply intertwined.  I am sure that some if not all of our witnesses will have a significant presence in the coming weeks in Cheltenham.  For the majority of people who attend, it is an annual ritual involving responsible gambling.  However, there is an element of excessive gambling involved as well.  Do the witnesses believe the link we see between participants in these sporting events and large betting companies undermines the integrity of the racing industry?  Should there be, whether by virtue of the regulator or the racing industry, greater distance between participants in sporting events and the offering of betting advice to the public on individual races?</p></speech>

It is apt he asked it now because, travelling through the countryside, one notices many Cheltenham preview nights taking place where various participants in sports sit on a panel for the evening and give people their opinions on what will happen at the festival.  There is the potential for a healthy engagement between people who want to bet on sport and participants in it.  There can be positive relationships between the community and the turf and horse racing as a whole.  I do not think it would do that much to say jockeys, trainers and these people could not give opinions and chat about the sport and asking for separation-----</p></speech>

I do not think a jockey will say the financial outcome of the horse suits the bookmaker sponsoring him or her if the horse does not win.  I do not anticipate that being a problem.  I am not a jockey and am probably too overweight after Covid to sit on a horse, but that is my opinion.</p></speech>

Maybe Mr. Le Jeune, Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in or others wish to comment on it as well.  Do the witnesses accept that, in principle, gambling on credit is de facto problem gambling?</p></speech>

Part of it is a ban on credit card betting for online and retail.  I note the scheme of the Bill proposes a ban on all credit and does not mention credit cards specifically.  We have asked members to recommend that credit cards be included.</p> <p>  On the previous question concerning jockeys giving information, the Deputy might be interested to know the Irish Bookmakers Association has a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, and the GAA.  Some of the larger companies have MOUs between the exchanges and the British racing board.  Any irregular betting patterns or unusual information that might affect a market, a price or a runner is fed back.  We have a good relationship with the regulatory bodies and share any information that comes to light.  What the Bill proposes in this area will be welcome and the regulator will have an important role to play.</p></speech>

Mr. Le Jeune has covered a great deal, but I wish to emphasise that we run the largest betting exchange in the world &ndash; Betfair &ndash; and, as Ms Byrne said, we have a number of agreements with horse racing authorities.  If we had information about suspicious betting patterns, we would share it with the relevant authorities to ensure the integrity of the sports in question.  That is paramount.</p></speech>

I believe it was Mr. Ross who referred to Gibraltar and Malta, although I am not sure in what context.  This is a global industry and we live in the digital world.  Where operators are less stringent or regulated, is it possible for us to deny them the opportunity to operate within the Republic, elsewhere in Ireland or in the UK?  What was the relevance of the reference to being based in Malta or Gibraltar versus being based in Dublin or London?  Mr. Ross might elaborate.  He might also speak about the less scrupulous and unregulated operators and how they might impact on those who wish to run regulated, compliant and safe gambling operations.</p><p>I apologise if the thrust of my questioning appears to be excessively around the minority for whom gambling is a real problem, but that is the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of this legislation.  It is a significant problem; we can all see it in our constituencies.  The general impression is that it affects young men, but it is not exclusive to them.  I have constituency experience of an elderly gentleman who is about to lose his family home, unbeknownst to his wife and children, because of problem gambling.  It affects people across the board, and we want to address the issue while recognising that, for the majority, this is an innocent pursuit.  We need to have the most stringent regulation to address gambling addiction.</p></speech>

The one comfort in this approach is that Irish customers have a regulated experience when they bet with licensed companies.  Those regulations are not Irish regulations, though, and they should be.  There is an opportunity for Ireland to take the best practices from across the various jurisdictions &ndash; the UK, Malta, Gibraltar and others &ndash;  and create a world-leading regulatory approach for online and retail betting customers.  There are many positives to take from all of our experiences across a multitude of jurisdictions, but Irish people's customer journeys are not regulated here.  They need to be.</p></speech>

I wish to go into the issues a little.  The cohort of people about whom we are most concerned are those who become addictive and compulsive and who lose everything because of gambling's addictive nature and the buzz they get from it.  I wonder at the figures sometimes.  I have read through some of the analysis.  Were I asked in a questionnaire whether I gambled, I would have to say I did because I do the lotto occasionally and I might put a bet on something rarely.  As such, I would be a gambler in the statistics.  I imagine there are many people like me, and they represent a large proportion of the statistics.  There is also a large number of people who make a bet a little more regularly, but it would not be a major part of their lives.</p> <p>  Then there is a large group of people who are regular gamblers.  They gamble regularly, have a bet a couple of times per week, are always studying the form of horses and so on.  I imagine that a larger proportion of this group of regular gamblers versus the other cohorts fall into the category of what are termed "problem gamblers" or people for whom gambling is compulsive or addictive.  In that context, saying that the number of people addicted to gambling lies somewhere between 0.5% and just over 1% is massaging the figures, if the witnesses will excuse the term.  If we examined the proportion of regular gamblers who became addicted, I believe we would find the proportion to be higher.  That is where we should focus.  These are the people whom I see going into betting shops regularly.  They are always studying horses' form, they are always watching games, etc.  A large proportion of them end up addicted and getting into difficulty.</p> <p>  Our emphasis is on putting something in place to protect these people from themselves.  That is what we have to do and we want to work with the industry on doing so.  We recognise that there is an industry and that it has a job to do, but we also recognise that, to date, enough has not been done.  This has been acknowledged.  What more do the witnesses believe needs to be done to ensure that that cohort of people are protected and do not end up having their homes taken off them or ruining their lives and the lives of their families?  What measures need to be taken in addition to what has been laid out in the general scheme of this Bill?</p></speech>

Fundamentally, this is where the legislation and regulatory framework have to help us.  Those numbers do not show a true picture.  We have the overall gambling prevalence numbers, which are the ones the Deputy quoted.</p> <p>  What we need to do and where we need to do more are questions that we have been considering a great deal from a business and online perspective.  In the past six months, we have implemented what is called an affordability triple step.  A gambling disorder is complex and there is no silver bullet, so we have to view affordability as a key part of our prevention measures.  It is critical that there be proactive prevention of gambling disorders.</p> <p>  There are three key steps in the affordability model that Flutter uses in the UK and that we have also implemented in Ireland.  The first step starts at registration.  In the UK, we carry out background checks where we look for financial vulnerability.  We cannot do that in Ireland because the same systems are not in place.  We would call on the regulator to help us to implement them.</p> <p>  Regarding the second step, Flutter has invested a great deal in algorithms that help us to predict gambling disorders.  We have the data and we can see step changes in people's online environment.  This interaction and intervention with customers is where the sea change has occurred in recent years and where the industry has collectively made great strides.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked us what we were doing.  We are intervening with customers because we can see what is happening.</p> <p>  These are key steps.  We also need to take a risk-based approach to the issue because different segments have different risks.  For example, we see younger people &ndash; under-25s &ndash; being at greater risk, in that their prevalence rates are slightly higher.  When using our affordability and interaction strategies, it is critical that we step in and intervene at the right points in the customer's journey.  We must get this part right.</p></speech>

It needs more people to gamble more because when that happens, the industry increases the likelihood that more people will become addicted and will become problem gamblers.  There is a contradiction in the position that our guests put forward and everyone sees that clearly.  That is the difficulty we have here.  We need the very firm hand of a regulator to deal with that.  </p><p> I note from all the correspondence the committee has received and from our guests' opening statements that the industry has various voluntary codes of conduct in place.  However, they do not deliver and have failed to deliver up to now.  I have not heard a clear answer to my question about what additional concrete steps our guests feel need to be taken to ensure we avoid the problems we have had in the past.</p></speech>

I will try to unpick the issues involved and give the Deputy an answer on each.  Everybody around this table who provides gambling and betting services to Irish customers is 100% behind a regulator that will develop evidence-based regulation, tackle problems and look at some of the issues the Deputy has talked about.  We want to operate in a well-regulated market because that would allow us to build a sustainable business over the longer term.  We genuinely welcome the idea of a regulator who is going to take an evidence-based approach to the kinds of things the Deputy has talked about.</p></speech>

Ms Byrne should have been brought in before Mr. Le Jeune.  I call on him to be brief.  Deputy Martin Kenny asked about actions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.893" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Le Jeune" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022030800002#K00600"><p>I will make only one other point.  The Deputy talked about people who are not problem gamblers, <i>per se</i>, or addicted gamblers.  Those are not the same category but we do not have time to explore that distinction now.  There are people who bet regularly but the number of people who exhibit problem gambling behaviours is declining, according to UK research, alongside problem gamblers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.894" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022030800002#K00700"><p>We need the regulator to ensure that our codes of practice and the new codes of practice the regulator will bring in apply to all operators.  I can only encourage my members to adhere to the various codes we have brought in.  I ask the committee to believe me when I say those codes are effective and are working.  I must appear on Google when a customer googles, "How to complain about a bookie" because my phone rings every day of the week.  A person might tell me that Paddy Power has asked for a wage slip and will not let that person have a bet until he or she supplies the wage slip.  Another person might tell me that someone in the bookmaker's took them into the corner and told them over a cup of tea that they have a gambling problem.  That person then might talk about suing the bookmaker for defamation.  I regularly get communications like that.  We must ensure that the codes and guidance apply to all operators.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny also referred to problem gambling rates and what codes of practice should apply to punters.  Research has been conducted by the Gambling Commission.  Recent Irish research was published a few weeks ago.  It would be helpful to see regulator-led research that would be purely Irish.  The regulator will need such research to arm itself with facts and evidence so that it can make decisions for Irish punters based on Irish evidence.  That would be the safest and most effective route for the regulator and the operators.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.895" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022030800002#K00800"><p>I had some other questions to ask but having listened to the contributions that have been made, I am going to stick to the issue of problem gambling.  I have worked in addiction for 20 years.  To be honest, gambling is the hardest thing with which we in the addiction sector have ever worked.  When I hear about interventions, wage slips and someone being told they are a problem gambler over a cup of tea, I think that is not an intervention.  It is not an intervention into the life of someone who is losing a lot of money.  If a conversation and the freezing of an account was all it took, the addiction sector would have mastered how to help people to stop problem gambling long ago.  As Mr. Grant said earlier, it is a complex issue but I do not think that anybody who has contributed so far understands the complexity and what is needed to address problem gambling.  I find that disturbing.  How are our guests defining problem gambling?  Are they saying they have a measurement that can tell them when an intervention is needed?  Problem gambling means gambling is causing a problem in a person's life, whether that relates to family, relationships, missed bill payments or saving money on rent to spend it on a bet.  I do not understand how the bookies know if a situation is one of problem gambling.  What are they measuring?  We can come back to the question of how bookies understand problem gambling and how they provide an intervention in those circumstances but I do not understand how they would have the data to do that.</p> <p>  I wish to talk about the assertion that there is no difference between online gambling and in-person gambling.  I would like to know what our guests are measuring other than instances of gambling.  In the recovery aspect of gambling, there is a big difference.  When we shifted from in-person gambling to online gambling, the much more immediate action of online gambling allowed more easily for relapse.  The process of leaving one's house and walking to the betting shop can mean one walks oneself out of a craving to gamble.  What are our guests measuring when they say there is no difference between online and in-person gambling?  There is a big difference to the person who is gambling in private and not doing so when their friends are around to call attention to the fact they are in the bookies again.  There is a big difference.  What do our guests understand as problem gambling?  How do they define it?  How do they know when someone is a problem gambler?  They do not have access to information about gamblers' relationships and do not know who is picking up the bills that the gambler cannot pay.  What data are they measuring when they say there is no difference between online and in-person gambling?  Do the data include people's actual experiences and the impacts on how they engage with gambling?</p></speech>

In response, I will call on, in order, Mr. Finlay, Ms Byrne and Mr. &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  Considering we have only four minutes remaining, I ask our guests to be specific in their responses.</p></speech>

One of the data points that indicates a problem is that the stakes are accelerated after each losing bet.  In other words, a gambler who backs a loser then increases his or her stake on the next bet to recapture the losses experienced on prior bets.  If that pattern is continued over five or six bets, that can clearly indicate a person who has a gambling problem.</p> <p>  From a retail perspective, there is a proposal in the Bill to form a new registrar of self-excluded punters or gamblers.  Through smart technologies such as facial recognition cameras in retail environments, we can pick up the presence of people with gambling problems in betting shops and take immediate remedial action by getting that information across to staff in betting shops.  At an electronic point of sale, the opportunity to bet can be resisted at that time.</p></speech>

I will allow Mr. Le Jeune to respond in the time remaining in my slot.  Mr. Le Jeune made a comment that I know the Senator wants to address.<br/><br/>I may have misled the Senator when I referred to interventions in a shop.  None of our staff are trained addiction intervention specialists.  They are retail betting shop staff.  The training we conduct is how to spot a potential problem gambler because a person's behaviour has changed, or a person is betting more, running out of money and trying to borrow money from their friends.  Our training explains how to step in gently and confidentially when no one is watching and say to that person that there may be a little problem here because he or she has spent a bit more than last week.  The staff member could ask the gambler to take a break and provide him or her with an information leaflet for the Dunlewey Centre and <i>gamblingcare.ie</i>.  There is also a freefone service which gamblers can ring seven days a week.  There are counsellors in every county in the country.  There is also technical support available from Helplink, which is supported by the Gambling Awareness Trust.  There is also residential treatment, which is looked after by Cluain Mhuire.  That is the type of intervention I meant.  We leave the addiction intervention to the professionals in the Dunlewey Centre and Cluain Mhuire.</p><p>I hope that addresses how I might have misled the Senator.</p></speech>

If there is an intervention and a conversation is had with someone, it would be kind of fruitless if there are no options for that person.  There is somewhere between &euro;6 billion and &euro;8 billion in gambling revenue in Ireland.  What role should the industry play in funding residential treatment intervention for people who have got to that point?</p></speech>

We fund the helpline and all the counsellors.  We set up the national helpline 14 years ago.  We have been funding counsellors in every county since and not once in those 14 years has the service run out of funding or needed more.  It has never been short of anything.  We have provided those resources every step of the way.  It is done by the betting sector and some of our large operators are very generous and helpful in the area.  The Irish Bookmakers Association collects the money and gives it to the Gambling Awareness Trust, so no gambling operator funds this directly.  Mr. Le Jeune might answer the other question.</p></speech>

The Senator has put her finger directly on the problem.  It is very difficult in advance to recognise when a problem is happening.  We are very well equipped to do this and we have become very sophisticated at doing it because we have online data for people.  We have very sophisticated algorithms with more than 200 indicators that will show us the issue.  We do not know if it will necessarily always be right.  I would love to invite the committee to Clonskeagh to show it exactly what we do in this area in terms of early identification and intervention.  We really want a properly resourced regulator, as mentioned by Ms Byrne, which does Irish research for Irish people so we can all agree on what it is we are trying to prevent, when we prevent it, when we step in and how we do that.</p></speech>

I am not expert enough to be able to tell the Senator the full scope but I encourage members to come out and we can give a full demonstration and get into the detail of how this works exactly.  It is very complicated across very different types of people with different behaviours and amounts of money.  There are also different risk profiles in terms of addiction.  We have worked really hard to do this and struggle hard to get it right.  We would love to get on a basis with an Irish regulator so everybody can agree what we should be doing.</p></speech>

There are data indicating people on lower incomes tend to play more and spend more than richer counterparts.  I read that either in a submission or in the lead-up to today.  When problem gambling is measured, is consideration given to the income of an individual?  That is instead of setting a threshold at a particular amount for indicating something.  It may not be appropriate if a person is on social welfare when compared with somebody earning &euro;100,000 per year.  Are the problem gambling identifiers varied relative to a person's position?</p></speech>

That is why we try to get the information.  That relates to affordability limits.  There are two key points, which are affordability and gambling disorder.  We are trying to get more controls around affordability so it does not lead to gambling disorder.  We do not have the full picture but we are working very hard to get it.</p> <p>  In the UK in particular we work with many experts and people with lived experience.  We have a gambling board of non-executive people who come in to advise us.  One is an addiction expert, the leading female gambling addiction expert in the UK.  We have people with lived experience who train our staff and help us look for the intangibles.</p></speech>

I would love the opportunity to show her what we are doing and learn from her experience as somebody who has worked in addiction services.  This is very complex and we must work together.

The session has been very useful and informative.  If you excuse the pun, a punter may be looking at this today with a family member who has a gambling problem and would like to take something from the presentation about there being safeguards in place to identify the problem before it gets out of hand.  It may be difficult in one sense.  Some may say the gambling industry is a legitimate business and there to make money.  That is quite understandable, and if people are not making money, they will not be in that business.  There is legislation in place in the UK but do we have data on what effect it has had on gambling, particularly problem gambling?  Is there any information in that regard?  Is there anything we have not put into this legislation yet that the witnesses feel should be there to provide further safeguards?</p> <p>  Ms Byrne represents what are traditional bookies, with 750 members of the 800 retail betting shops.  I might go to a local betting shop and have a clear problem.  Mr. Grant and others spoke about accounts being closed, but what number of accounts are being closed in provincial towns?  If I am in a local bookmaker office in Ballydehob, what number from the members of Ms Byrne's organisation would cease my account or bar me from the premises? </p></speech>

We have the comparative evidence indicated by the Senator and it shows that for the past 15 years, levels of problem gambling as researched by the Gambling Commission in Great Britain have remained comfortably below 1%.  In the past year to September 2021, they have fallen from 0.6% of those who are monitored and had a bet at least once in the previous year to 0.3%.  I draw the attention of the committee to this because it covers a period during lockdown when there was much fear and concern about whether people betting online would develop more problematic play.  It looks as if problem gambling, at least in that jurisdiction, is very static.  We will find out if that is the case for Ireland once there is a regulator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.917" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022030800002#L01900"><p>I do not have the exact figures for the Senator off the top of my head.  Along with our codes of practice and training developed over the past ten to 14 years, we have created what is called a social responsibility folder.  Inside that we have put a template for the four pillars of social responsibility, including that the activity should not include those under 18, tackling problem gambling and measures against money laundering.  In each section we have categories of data the operator should be recording when the bookmaker's intervention occurred.  To be clear, that is not an addiction expert intervention.</p><p>The information would be provided when were are spoken to, if they had signed up to the exclusion register.  If someone signs a self-exclusion form in a shop and provides a photo, that is immediate and that bookmaker would then circulate this to their branches close by to make sure the staff know that this particular punter is excluded.  I have provided the operators with as many tools and guides as I possibly can, but not all operators are members of my association.  I am not a regulator so I cannot force them.  I can only do my best to provide them with as much information as I can.  Perhaps Ms Murphy or the others would like to speak to how many they have. Perhaps they would be privy to those numbers.</p></speech>

I do not have the number of self-excluded customers that we would have countrywide, but I will reaffirm what Ms Byrne said.  Not only do we keep a record of all of the self-exclusions and interactions that our staff would have with any customer, we train all staff when they join us.  They also complete refresher training at regular intervals.  They do online modules and one-to-one training with their managers where they get to role-play out some of these situations. Some of these conversations can be very challenging because, as referred to earlier, customers can get a little bit upset and might start threatening about defamation.  The bottom line is that our people are looking for changes in behaviour, changes in staking levels, and changes in how people conduct themselves in the shop.  Customers can become aggressive if they have been losing money.  They can start to hassle other customers to borrow money and so on.  Our shop staff look out for all of this and they engage with the customer.  This is not done in a confrontational way; it is very much supportive to say, "Let us sit back to take a little time to think about where you are and how your gambling is impacting on you day-to-day, and here is the information".  We hope that when they avail of that information, this would take them to the proper addiction services if they are required.  It is a difficult situation in retail because we do not have the level of information that one would have online where every transaction is recorded against the customer.  The positive aspect of retail is that the majority of our customers are regular customers who know our staff, and our staff would know if the customer's behaviour is different or is changing.</p></speech>

What I am trying to get to today, and I am encouraged by what I am hearing, is that the industry <i>per se</i>is looking forward, dare I say it, to the regulator coming on board and this legislation being put in place.  I am heartened by that.</p><p>No more than somebody who has an addiction to alcohol, there will always be an avenue whereby the person will find an outlet.

Ms Byrne spoke about self-regulation on credit cards.  I have brought forward the Betting (Prohibition on Use of Credit Cards) Bill 2021, which is on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il at the moment, for a complete ban on the use of credit cards for gambling in shops and online.  I do not believe that people should be able to gamble with money they do not have.  I am aware that many of the bookmaker organisations have signed up to it, but I believe that it must be a complete ban or it will not be enforceable.</p> <p>  The Irish Bookmakers Association has 800 retail betting units.  How many of those are independents?</p></speech>

Of those 150, one operator has about 55 outlets, two operators have 15 outlets and the rest are operators with one, two, three, or five shops each.  Unfortunately, we have a lot fewer than we used to have.  In 2008, there were 1,385 shops and now we are down to 800.  They are almost all independent, apart from some shops that Ladbrokes had to close in a process it went through a few years ago.</p></speech>

This is 80.  That 150 is now down to fewer than 70.   The days are gone when a betting shop may have been a family run small business, because of the 800 shops, fewer than 70 are family businesses.  Betting shops are big business and the vast majority are run by big companies.</p> <p>  In the Irish Bookmakers Association opening statement, Ms Byrne spoke of the self-exclusion scheme in betting shops.  Will Ms Byrne please expand on that?  There is a national register.  Ms Murphy referred earlier to a photograph of the person being used.  How does the association make sure of that?  If a person is looking to self-exclude surely a photograph could be taken in store?  We do not want a person who is self-excluding from one store going down the road to another betting shop.  If a person is excluding themselves, it should be from all betting shops.  How does the association make sure that this works?</p> <p>  How long has the scheme been in operation?  How is the success of the scheme analysed?  Has the association done an analysis and is the scheme seen to be successful?  Does the association have data on that?  How does a scheme operate for online betting?  Was this information included in the association's submission on the voluntary code of practice for all operators, online and retail, and if not why not?</p></speech>

The self-exclusion scheme in retail has been in place since our very first code of practice, which we developed when we started with the Dunlewey Centre and the national helpline, which was 14 years ago.  The form has developed and morphed over the years.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about taking a photo in the shop.  Originally, there were GDPR issues around maintaining files with photographs of people.  The anti-money laundering legislation that came in two years ago for our sector has overcome that because we must now, for legal reasons, take customer identification documents.  I do not believe the lack of a photograph is an issue anymore, but a photograph must accompany the self-exclusion form because it would be virtually impossible to recognise a customer.</p></speech>

If a person walks into a betting shop and does not want to bet any more, is the information given to every other betting shop, of the 800 betting shops, that this is a person who does not want to gamble?  If this person says they have a gambling problem, does this happen?</p></speech>

This was trialled in the UK and it had issues with so many shops trying to remember so many people.  One must remember that a betting shop could have 100 to 150 different faces per day coming in.  For all staff to be able to remember all faces on the register would be impossible.  It works a lot better when the local shops for that operator have the latest photo for their excluded customers.</p></speech>

Once a customer registers on GAMSTOP then he or she is instantly prevented from betting at any licensed online operator in the UK.  In our submission, we fully support that model here.  We have suggested that maybe the regulator would discuss it with GAMSTOP.  I have spoken with GAMSTOP and it is willing to extend this to Ireland, and to discuss it with the regulator.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  We do not have that system in Ireland at the moment for those who are at risk of problem gambling.</p><p>That safeguard is not there for those who are at risk of problem gambling or might be on the verge of being in the throes of addiction.  That is one of the reasons we need strong regulation and a strong regulator.</p><p> With regard to Entain, Lottoland and Flutter Entertainment, does the pre-watershed advertising ban apply to advertising on social media?  How is it ensured paid advertising on social media is not shown to those who are underage?  I know that Meta, which is the new name for Facebook, and Twitter have banned the targeting of gambling advertisements at under-18s, but neither of them has implemented measures to prevent those aged under 18 seeing these advertisements.  Have our guests raised with Facebook and Twitter the issue of banning those advertisements from being seen by under-18s?</p></speech>

Those are over the counter, which is the conventional betting slip and biro, and an increasing number of self-service betting terminals.  It is my view, and it may be that of some of the other participants in this discussion, that the prevalence of self-service betting terminals, SSBTs, will continue to grow, perhaps to a point where the over-the-counter trade might be economically redundant.  The role of staff members in betting shops may be more as customer service agents than transaction hosting agents.  My hope is that when all sales are channelled through SSBTs, the digital tools outlined previously by the likes of Mr. Grant of Flutter Entertainment will be implemented at a retail perspective, by which I mean channelling big data to use algorithms to identify people showing signs of problem gambling.  It also goes back to a national register of self-excluded faces.  It would be possible to place a facial recognition camera on every self-service betting terminal such that when a customer comes up to place a bet, the national database is polled as to whether this face is permitted to bet or it is self-excluded.  If it is self-excluded, the person will not be enabled to commence a betting session on these SSBTs.  These technologies are coming and they are implementable and I want to make sure the Deputy is aware of that.</p></speech>

First, I fully endorse the Deputy's views on the need for strong regulation, particularly in respect of self-exclusion schemes.  My second point relates to his question on online advertising, which has not been answered.  We specifically target those aged over 25.  We work with the firms to which the Deputy referred and we have targeted those aged over 25.  We also have what we call industry negative keyword lists.  We eliminate certain words that we know that can cause people issues and we focus hard on this because it is very important.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what has been said about the welcoming of regulation generally in this jurisdiction.  It is not a surprise to me.  Having met many of the companies represented here, I was aware it is the case.  How strong that regulation is and how much power and resources the regulator has are matters for the committee.  I favour strong powers and resources for the regulator.</p> <p>  An issue raised by several speakers is the efforts the various companies make in respect of problem gambling or gambling addiction.  I believe those are different categories.  The difficulty I have with the responses we have received so far today is the reliance on UK research.  For example, the figure of 7,000 was given to my colleague Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  To my mind, as that is a figure across the UK and Ireland - I even find the categorisation of the two things together in that order a little unhelpful - it is essentially useless because we do not know how many of those are in Ireland.  The constant reliance by betting outfits on UK research is of no assistance to us whatsoever in assessing the depth of the problem in this jurisdiction.  We have wildly different regulatory environments.  I think we have very different attitudes to gambling generally in the two islands, so I find that research totally unhelpful.</p> <p>  Are any of our guests able to indicate how many Irish-based gamblers have been stopped from gambling?  I think the answer will be that they cannot say.  It may be an issue on which they can revert to the committee.  Why do our guests continue to conflate these two markets that are so different and have such different parameters and habits in the context of gambling?  Why do we always talk about the UK and Ireland in the context of gambling rather than talking about Ireland and the Irish people and residents who are gambling here on our guests' various offerings?</p></speech>

On a point of clarification, the specific number I referenced to Deputy Carroll MacNeill is the number of accounts with which we intervene in our business.  The Senator is correct that the figure is across the UK and Ireland.  I commit to reverting to the committee with a detailed breakdown of our Irish numbers and what we do.  I get his frustration.  I am an Irishman living in England and running a business in the UK and Ireland.  For me, the Senator nailed it.  There are cultural differences.  In the absence of a strong and effective regulatory framework and legislation, we have implemented our learnings from other jurisdictions, with the UK being the one we have most commonly adopted.  I am not saying that is right but it is what we have done because we recognise there is a desire to improve.  We need to do more and focus more on minimising harm.</p> <p>  Many terms have been thrown around today.  We talk about problem gambling and gambling disorder.  In the UK, we commonly refer to gambling disorder.  The academics and specialists do not use the term "problem gambling" as much.  Rather, they talk about gambling disorder.  It is not sufficient to apportion blame to an individual on this; it is a shared responsibility for operators and individuals.  That is why we use that terminology.  I think we are saying the same things and we certainly want the same outcomes as the Senator does.  I acknowledge and understand his frustration.  I agree with it.  It is fundamental we get effective regulation and it is evidence-based and gives the regulatory authority the powers to have clarity in respect of the numbers we all need.</p> <p>  We will come back to the committee with the Irish numbers.  We have nothing to hide.  We want to be fully transparent.  We are supportive of what the committee is doing and we want to work with it, as we have done in other jurisdictions, to enhance the protection for our customers.  That is fundamental.</p></speech>

It is really interesting.  I endorse what Mr. Grant has said.  If the new regulator does anything, one of the most crucial things it must do is improve the research base we have for understanding gambling behaviour in the State compared with Great Britain.  That is fundamental.  There simply is not enough research.  A point worth making, however, is that research that has been done in the Republic, such as the recent report on gambling behaviour in Ireland by the Health Research Board, HRB, looks remarkably similar in terms of the prevalence of problem gambling and other issues to the Great Britain market.  While I would never apply a set of data to another country and say they must be similar, there are similarities with which we can work and the regulator will be able to prove or disprove that proposition.  That is one of the best reasons for having it.</p></speech>

I am not clear on where our guests draw the line between what they refer to as problem gambling, which I think is a sanitised term, to be honest, and people who face serious gambling addiction issues.</p><p> In my other life, I represented people who turned to crime because of debts owed to gambling companies.  It is an acute problem.  The companies conduct research, but that research does not appear to be based on the position in different jurisdictions.  Again, even that research by the companies never mind that done by outside bodies appears to conflate the two jurisdictions as if they were one.  While I accept what the witnesses say about there being similarities - because, of course, there will be - the reality is that you will not find slot machines in Irish pubs or a prevalence of betting shops in streets here in the same way you do in certain cities in the UK.  As a result, I do not accept that the culture is the same with regard to gambling.  The reality is that a lot of it has moved online and may be difficult to assess from that perspective but if the companies are going to conduct research, surely they should do so in a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis rather than conflating them - leaving aside the research done by outside agencies.</p></speech>

We need to understand, as does the regulator, the Irish market more fully than we have ever done before.  There are similarities and differences in the cultural approach to gambling but the evidence base we have is not sufficient to prove or disprove that point.</p></speech>

We have all seen in our constituencies and working lives the detrimental impact of gambling on mental and physical health and the health of a person's family given the catastrophes it can cause for families.  In my view, this is because of the overexposure of people, particularly young people, to gambling.  These pieces of technology have made gambling so accessible.  It involves our phones.  As we know, for very young children and adults, phones are part of the everyday pieces of technology they carry around with them.  We can turn on our televisions and see advertising from many of the gambling companies represented here, switch on our phones and be exposed to more gambling or walk down our main streets and see gambling shops everywhere.  We took the very brave decision to ban the advertising of tobacco and now we can walk into a shop that used to have cigarette machines or displays and not see anything advertising tobacco.  It was done for a very good reason, namely, the detrimental effect of tobacco on people's health, the fatalities it has caused across Ireland and the pressures it has put our health system under.  If we were to remove that overexposure or any exposure to gambling, what would be the response of the witnesses to that as a measure to protect people from falling into the depths of problem gambling?</p></speech>

We see it as a complex issue and a nuanced question.  The work of this committee is so important.  Once we set up an Irish regulator, the committee should want to have every Irish better betting with an Irish-regulated company because that is how we keep people safe.  One of the many differences between tobacco and gambling is that there are plenty of offshore operators in our space.  If regulated companies with all the safeguards imposed by the regulator and agreed are not providing a service to those customers, they will go to offshore companies over which there are no controls.  One of the problems with banning advertising entirely is that it equalises the position of unregulated offshore providers and regulated on-shore providers.  Once we have a regulated body of operators in the system, it is very important that they are able to get their message out to the Irish better.</p></speech>

It would mean that licensed companies within the Irish system would be prohibited from advertising while those outside the system would have an advantage over us, which would be to the detriment of Irish consumers.  If I may risk once again referring to a UK comparison - and I know I have been called out on this before but I think it is valid - we instituted legal gambling advertising and continue to measure over ten to 15 years where that has existed levels of problem gambling among British consumers.  They remain static.  If it is assumed that there is some harm in gambling advertising, one would expect to see that reflected in the figures so it is difficult to see what the justification would be for prohibiting a perfectly normal form of commercial communication.</p></speech>

As a result of not permitting betting shops to be able to advertise any further, the economic situation of the remaining shops would fall further resulting in more shop closures and not too dissimilar to online, what then pops up is-----</p></speech>

I certainly saw it on my way to a wedding in Navan one day.  We stopped in the pub for a drink on the way, the racing was on the television and here was a guy sitting in a corner with a laptop taking bets.  Out of curiosity, I went over to have a look.  His screen was behind him with all the betting on it, he had a wad of cash as thick as one you would see in the movies or on "The Sopranos" and he was taking bets with not a bother on him.  There was no betting tax, no age controls, no safer gambling measures - nothing.  This is an issue we repeatedly raised with the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is prevalent all over Ireland.</p> <p>  Regarding banning advertising, our operators are licensed.  It is a licensed product for adults.  We advertise our products within the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland guidelines and the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland guidelines.  To enhance those guidelines, we brought in our safer gambling code at the beginning of January.  This includes a pre-watershed ban on Irish channels, including a whistle-to-whistle ban on those sporting programmes on which we advertise.  However we have a difficulty in that we cannot stop international operators advertising on channels that are not Irish such as Sky channels.</p><p>This is another reason that the regulator is so important.  It can bring in guidelines, more suitable to the Irish marketplace and apply them to all operators and all channels.  The sooner the regulator comes into place the better.</p></speech>

It is easier to book a flight on a phone.  It is easier to buy groceries or a pair of shoes because it is there all the time.  What Senator Ward said about the data and the conflation between the UK and Irish data is important.  I asked Mr. Le Jeune at the beginning why he thought online was safer than retail.  He used those data and I said I did not necessarily accept the correlation.  Would he like to add anything else?</p></speech>

I think is absolutely correct to say that just taking UK data and applying them to the situation in the State would be rash.  One of the reasons people around this table are in favour of having a regulator is that it would have the ability to raise those data.  It is as simple as that and I am not disputing the possibility that the comparisons may not be 100% valid because I do not know.</p></speech>

To have a regulator simply to generate data is an unfortunate reason to need it.  The written submissions the witnesses have made show the effort by their organisations, some of which are extremely large, profitable, capable and sophisticated, in their research models, behavioural planning, attitudinal analysis and the psychology around all the different things behind that.  It is curious that the industry would need to depend on the establishment of a regulator to generate data in that respect.  It is an observation.</p></speech>

The point I am making about it is about the committee coming to this from a protection perspective.  Having regard to the statements the witnesses have made, I am trying to probe some of the work that has been done to date.  I heard Mr. Grant tell Senator Ward about the difficulty with the 7,000 figure and I acknowledge that he will come back to the committee with a better breakdown, particularly in respect of the Irish market.  Did he also say 183 people are working across his organisation in this field essentially to identify, try to support and intervene?  Am I correct in that figure from earlier?</p></speech>

I just want to raise two other points.  The European school survey on the use of alcohol and other drugs, ESPAD, found that 3,400 15- and 16-year-olds in Ireland were engaged in problem gambling.  For the in-store bookmakers how many underage people have been stopped in the past 12 months?  Are there data over recent years on how many under 18s have been trying to access shops?</p> <p>  Mr. Grant spoke earlier about the technology.  What are we doing to ensure that no one under 18 is able to access online gambling?  I know there is a 72-hour period.  However, the technology is now such that no one under the age of 18 should be able to access gambling.  My first question is about the 3,400 kids who have been identified to be problem gambling.  My second question is whether we have data on people under 18 who are denied access to gambling shops?  I have serious concerns about young people being targeted.</p> <p>  Over the weekend, I watched soccer on the television.  I think I counted that at least four or five big soccer clubs in the Premier League in England are sponsored by big multinational gambling companies.</p></speech>

The code we introduced, which went live in January, includes the age gating requirement for online advertising.  When operators put up an ad, they get to choose the target market, the demographics.  They must click "over 25" on that.  The Deputy's point highlights our issue and one of the reasons we are calling for a regulator.</p><p>I cannot force everyone to subscribe to this code.  I did everything I could to try to persuade as many of those on the Irish licence register put up by the Revenue Commissioners to subscribe but I did not get them all.</p></speech>

This is why this legislation is so important and this is an area with which the committee can help us.  The technology exists in other markets and we want to get it in Ireland.  We manually intervene with every single customer who registers to validate their age, but there is automated software that can do the verification checks.  We would love to see that brought in.

I am speaking from an online perspective.  I am aware that a Bill was drafted previously but technological advancements meant that it had to be redrafted to reflect the new technological landscape.  As I have pointed out previously, retail is going to be subject to increased digitisation in terms of point of sale, various points of consumption for customers and so on.  New tools will enable retail to get its hands on the type of data that the online market is using to implement better policies around problem gambling, money laundering and age verification.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of discussion today about research, which is absolutely required in an Irish context.  There has also been a great deal of discussion around the ability of operators to identify behaviours and to intervene but the middle piece is getting the data on age verification and affordability checks.  If robust data on that middle piece is not available, which it is not at present, then the regulator is going to be hamstrung in terms of doing its job properly.  It is absolutely critical that that piece is addressed.  The other issue that was not really addressed in our conversation today is the risk of having two gambling regulators in the Irish market covering the national lottery and the rest of the industry.  That really needs to be addressed because we are talking about responsibility being split between different Departments and potentially different committees.</p></speech>

It relates to self-exclusion and the fact that there is no central, online database for exclusion for online operators in Ireland.  While there may be no central database, there is an option for customers to self-exclude.  They will not get on with the online operators once they exclude on the site.  The setting is instant.  It takes approximately five seconds to select and save it.  There are protections there but there just is no central database for online operators yet.  We really welcome the regulator bringing that in, as well as all of the other measures this committee is proposing.</p></speech>

In the online space, we have a lot of very sophisticated operators and all are working very hard to do the right thing in terms of safer gambling.  However, there are a few things that we cannot do.  We cannot aggregate data among ourselves in Ireland.  We cannot share data but a regulator can.  A regulator can look at the entirety of the scenario.  We do our own research and we should do more on a country by country basis but to be honest, the research we do is discounted by everybody because it is the industry conducting it.  In that context, it is much better to have a well-funded, sophisticated regulator that can do the research and do its work objectively.  We will absolutely abide by what the regulator says.  We need to get into a level of balance in society and a strong regulator in Ireland is the key element in that regard.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for participating in what was a very useful session.  I apologise for not being here for the full meeting and thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for stepping into the breach when required.  The committee will consider the points made at today's meeting as well as points made in written submissions from various organisations.</p><p>We have a follow-up meeting on this topic scheduled in a couple of weeks when we will be hearing from other groups and organisations that have an interest in the matter.  On foot of both meetings and other submissions, we will produce a report which will then go to the Government and also become public knowledge.  It is a very helpful process and it is always worth taking the time to review inputs as we have done today and as we will do in the second meeting on this Bill a couple of weeks hence.</p><p> I again thank the witnesses and organisations that attended the meeting today for their participation and inputs, which have been valuable.

I remind the members of the select committee that there will be a meeting of the select committee at 7 p.m. this evening regarding a request for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny of the proceeds of crime Bill.  Apart from that, the next meeting of the joint committee is on 22 March for the second part of pre-legislative scrutiny of the gambling regulation Bill.  As no member wishes to raise any other item, we will wrap up the meeting.  I again thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for taking the Chair.  I hope the members enjoy the St. Patrick's Day weekend.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome the representative of the Western Rail Trail, Mr. John Mulligan; from West on Track, Mr. Colm&aacute;n &Oacute; Raghallaigh - I hope I pronounced his name correctly - and Mr. Peter Feeney, who is well known to us all; representing the Atlantic Economic Corridor Business Forum, Mr. Mike Devane; from the North Tipperary Community Rail Partnership: Mr. Graham Lightfoot and Mr. Edward Kelly - Mr. Hassard Stacpoole has been delayed but he will join us at 12 noon; and Mr. Richard Logue, managing director of RL Consultancy Limited.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p><p>Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p><p> I call Mr. Mulligan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

These three separate, but aligned, campaigns enjoy significant public support.</p> <p>  Collectively, we seek to have a greenway built on or alongside the various closed and disused rail lines that connect Athenry, County Galway with Collooney, County Sligo.  Collooney is already a starting point for a cross-Border greenway project to develop a greenway from Sligo to Enniskillen, using parts of an old rail alignment and some private lands.  The complete greenway from Enniskillen to Athenry, with a potential connection to the Great Western Greenway at the Turlough Park House museum, would create the longest greenway network in Ireland and would be a game changer for tourism, leisure and the quality of life needed to attract and retain remote workers in towns along the Atlantic economic corridor.</p> <p>  The committee will hear from rail lobbyists seeking to have a railway built on some or all of this alignment.  We do not oppose this proposal although we recognise that it may not happen in whole or in part for several decades.  This is a key point and we ask that the rail review take account of this reality.  All recent reports on the viability of rail on this route have found against rail investment and we take a pragmatic view that if such investment is ever forthcoming, it is a long way into the future.  In the meantime, while keeping rail as a priority, we seek to preserve the route with a greenway, not only to provide jobs and amenity now but also to stop further encroachment and loss of this asset to public ownership.</p> <p>  Costings around the Sligo greenway project showed the cost of building on the existing track bed to be approximately one third of the cost of building the greenway alongside the scrap line.  Retaining a rusting and rotting line for future rail use makes no sense; we believe that the cheaper option of building a greenway on the track bed should be chosen now.  In the event that a rail project is ever funded on the route, the greenway can at that time be relocated to the edge of the alignment as part of the rail construction project.  This is the plan for the Sligo greenway, and the model is successful elsewhere with projects such as the Athlone to Mullingar, Waterford to Dungarvan and, indeed, Navan to Kingscourt greenways.</p> <p>  We spoke to Irish Rail on a number of occasions in this respect and it has no objection to the stone ballast being used as a base for a greenway, and it agrees that this is not in conflict with the primary use of the asset for rail in the future.</p> <p>  In summary, I will make these following few points.  There is currently no viable railway in existence on the alignment from Athenry to Collooney; what is there is scrap and of no value in any future rail project.  Retaining what is there has no bearing on any future use of the asset.  The regional spatial economic strategies, RSES, support the interim use of the asset as a greenway, and this is clearly identified in the recent RSES for the west and north west.  Our proposal and our aims are not in conflict with the aims of the rail lobby groups that seek to have a railway built on the route.  In fact, we believe they complement them as a greenway will protect the route in public ownership in perpetuity, should a railway ever be feasible.  There is also a potential future synergy between rail and greenway on the same alignment.</p> <p>  We recognise that the list of mooted rail projects in Ireland is a long one, and that routes where passenger numbers are far in excess of the most optimistic projections for the so-called western rail corridor will of necessity get priority within this list.  Any rail project on this route is likely to happen well into the future and all we ask is that available funding is used now to preserve the alignment with a greenway in the interim.  Report after report have firmly refuted any case for a railway but were delivered with political get-out clauses that suggested that this may change in the medium term.  This political fudging and indecision helps nobody.  We have been engaged in this debate for over a decade, and in that time the railway is no closer to being delivered.  We ask that the all-Ireland rail review draw a line under this matter and decide whether all or part of this route will ever be used for rail, and if so, when.  If rail is a viable option, build it and build a greenway alongside it.  If it is not a viable option at this time, build the greenway and when rail makes sense, build a railway and relocate the greenway to run alongside it as is done successfully elsewhere.</p> <p>  We are asking for the all-island rail review to clearly state that the closed railway from Athenry to Collooney must be preserved in public ownership until such time as a railway is possible.  We want the report to recommend the route be protected using international best practice of allowing the route to be converted to a greenway, with future rail use as a priority.</p> <p>  This is about asset management, leveraging a State-owned asset to provide jobs and amenity now, while protecting it for future rail or other transport use.  I ask the committee to ensure that decisions that condemn towns along the route to no investment of any kind are not made yet again.</p></speech>

It is made up of a large and diverse membership including many community groups, chambers of commerce and local development organisations and enjoys wide support from political representatives of all parties, both at local and national level.</p> <p>  The western rail corridor, WRC, is the term commonly used for the line from Limerick to Sligo but traditionally, it also includes the links to the Port of Foynes and the inland port of Ballina.  It forms part of an Atlantic railway corridor that runs from Rosslare all the way to Sligo.</p> <p>  The case for the reopening of the WRC line to serve the west and north west includes the multiple social, tourism and business benefits which would accrue from its revival.  The route links three city regions, as set out in the national planning framework, namely, Galway, Limerick and Cork, four major hub towns, that is, Ballina, Sligo, Castlebar, Tuam and Ennis, as well as connecting by rail the destination town of Westport, three international airports, three universities and four institute of technology campuses which have recently been rebranded as the Atlantic technological university.  It also affords the possibility of further linking northwards to Letterkenny and Derry.  By any standards, therefore, the western rail corridor constitutes critical economic infrastructure.</p> <p>  Regional policy objectives, RPOs, 6.13(a) and 6.13(b) of the regional spatial and economic strategy published by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly explicitly support the restoration of the WRC missing link from Athenry to Claremorris and from Claremorris to Sligo for passenger and freight use, recognising the strategic importance of the western rail corridor as a growth enabler for the region, and its potential to link the economies of large urban centres along the western seaboard.  The strategy also recognises the potential of the WRC in consolidating the Atlantic economic corridor.</p> <p>  This is also the stated objective of the respective county development plans of Galway, Mayo and Sligo.  In summary, there is now the potential for Westport, Ballina, Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Sligo to have a passenger intercity and commuter rail link with the regional capital of Galway, and a direct rail-freight route to the southern ports of Cork and Waterford, the new Foynes Trans-European Transport Network, TEN-T, core port and the proposed new port facilities in Galway.  The question now is whether Arup will recognise this potential or, indeed, be allowed to recognise it.</p> <p>  We are conscious that the social and economic future of large areas of Ireland may depend on the outcome of the work Arup is now doing and we wish it well in its endeavours.  Arup now has the opportunity to restore public confidence in such consultation processes.</p> <p>  In January 2021, the EU declared that the Northern and Western Region had regressed from "Developed Region" to "Region in Transition" status.  Amongst the key reasons for this decline is the lack of investment in the region's railway infrastructure on a north-south axis, resulting in the absence of modern rail transport and sustainable access to our ports.  We believe it imperative that the all-island rail review would directly address this regression by strongly recommending the redevelopment of railways, including existing unused lines, in the northern and western nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS, 2 region.</p><p>The rail review should also consider the application by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, to the European Commission, dated 9 August 2019, in which he stated &quot;Ireland believes that there is a need to amend the TEN-T Regulation and requests that the European Commission considers the existing requirements for the Ten-T Core Network with a view to including the Atlantic seaboard region of Ireland on the Ten-T Core Network&quot;.  Despite a positive response to the Department from the EU on 10 October of that year, the recently published draft TEN-T revision shows no such change.  Instead, it is clear the only addition by Ireland is the inclusion of the multibillion DART project for Dublin.<br/><br/>The consultation paper for the all-island rail review, dated November 2021, sets out the ambition for the review as follows: &quot;This Review will consider how the rail network on the island of Ireland can improve to promote sustainable connectivity into, and between, the major cities, enhance regional accessibility and support balanced regional development ... and look at how the railways are used, how they could be used in future and how the network can evolve to serve the people on the island of Ireland&quot;.  This declaration is, of course, entirely commendable but it remains to be seen whether the all-island review will deliver the radical and ambitious plan that is needed for every part of Ireland.  We are sure members will agree that in the context of developing genuine strategies for dealing with carbon emissions, Ireland must urgently recognise the enormous value of all its existing rail assets and, in particular, its strategic rail corridors.  It is imperative that, from now on, such rail assets are fully protected for future rail development and not given up for any other purposes whatsoever.  Ripping up railways is not a way of protecting them.<br/><br/>In 2021, following the publication by the Department of Transport of a report by EY, West on Track commissioned an independent economic appraisal of the Galway-Mayo rail link by an economist, Dr. John Bradley.  A copy of that report, together with a summary of its findings, was sent to the members of this committee last June.  Its key finding was:</p><blockquote>	A cost benefit analysis of reactivating Phases 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Western Rail Corridor (WRC) yields a positive net present value (NPV) and benefit-to-cost ratio of &amp;gt;1.0.  When additional non-monetised benefits of a project appraisal are considered, a strong business case exists to carry out the project. </blockquote><p>A copy of Dr Bradley's report has been sent to Arup as part of our submission.  We believe his conclusions would be affirmed by any serious independent review.<br/><br/>Both An Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, are on record as supporting the redevelopment of the western rail corridor  <font color="#050505">Speaking in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 24 September 2020, the Minister said: </font></p><blockquote>	<font color="#050505">Developing those two small links [from Athenry to Claremorris and from Limerick city to Foynes] would give us a national rail freight service connected to two international deepwater ports.  I would go to Europe with that proposal.  I would take it to the EU's climate action recovery fund and say that this proposal makes economic sense.  This is a region with clean power, clean water, manufacturing expertise and two deep-sea ports that can be connected by rail freight.  I do not see why it cannot work.</font></blockquote><p><font color="#050505">Speaking during the launch of the revised national development plan, NDP, in Cork on Monday, 4 October 2021, An Taoiseach stated that the Government would &quot;enthusiastically&quot; support expenditure on the western rail corridor going forward.  He said: &quot;I think you can be assured the Minister for Public Expenditure [and Reform] will support the Western Rail Corridor very enthusiastically&quot;.  </font>We now look forward to seeing these unequivocal declarations of support reflected in the findings by Arup.</p></speech>

Thanks to the extensive network cuts of the 1950s and 1960s, large parts of Ireland are entirely without a railway service.  The western half of Ulster, including Donegal and Tyrone, and much of west Cork have not had a railway service in more than 60 years.  Other areas have a very infrequent timetable.  Experience shows, however, particularly on the Belfast-Derry line, that if a better service is offered, passengers will use it.  That particular line was under threat of closure in 2004 due to low passenger numbers.  It had an infrequent timetable and the trains on the line were dilapidated.  Following a major campaign to save the line, led by Eamonn McCann, Jim McBride and the late Colm Joyce, it was saved.  The investments subsequently made to date in new trains and better track on the Belfast-Derry line have produced a sixfold increase since 2004 in passenger numbers of up to more than 3 million annually.  This increase has far exceeded the conservative forecasts NI Railways made in its initial investment plan.</p> <p>  There are a number of quick wins we could apply to improve the existing rail service.  The railway needs to run on all lines from early in the morning until late at night and, in some cases, all through the night.  Intercity passengers should expect to be able to arrive at any destination across the island before 9 a.m.  Timetables need to be designed for 21st century needs, ensuring there is a train service available when passengers need it.  Journey times must be quicker than their equivalent by car.  The existing rail network must be updated to allow higher speed running on all existing lines, up to 125 mph, and all speed restrictions need to be eliminated.  Ideally, all tracks should be double, but more and longer passing loops would significantly ease current restrictions on single-track sections.  Understandably, this will require significant investment.  A change that requires less investment is ensuring bus and railway timetables are aligned such that bus services connect with railways to allow seamless transfers.  It is worth pointing out that the modal shift from private cars to public transport will not happen if bus-only public transport is offered.  Buses must complement the rail service, not wastefully compete with it.</p> <p>  There also is a need to link the railway to the runways.  Despite being the busiest entry point to the island of Ireland, Dublin Airport has no railway connections and is entirely dependent on the road network.  If we compare Dublin with Manchester, which has a similar-sized airport to Dublin, Manchester has both a tram or light rail link to central Manchester and an intercity heavy rail station taking passengers from all over England to the airport.  A similar heavy rail connection at Dublin Airport, branching off from the Dublin-Belfast line and going towards the city centre, would not only allow intercity trains from all over Ireland to serve the airport but also would have to resolve the notorious bottleneck on the railway between Malahide and Connolly, where intercity trains must travel slowly behind the frequent DART services, causing significant delays.</p> <p>  The DART tunnel is regarded by many as the key to unlocking Dublin's rail network.  The DART underground line would link Dublin city's badly connected railways into a coherent network.  Not building it or putting it even further on the long finger does not make any sense.  The route linking the Belfast and Cork lines is already part of the EU's TEN-T core network.  Putting the tunnel in place and linking it into the network would allow for a reconfiguration of DART routes, allowing new Malahide-Kildare services, for instance, or Kilcock-Greystones services.</p> <p>  The mothballed Atlantic rail corridor, also known as the western rail corridor, is one of the most strategic links on the island of Ireland as it offers the most direct rail link possible between the west and the north west and allows for a direct connection to the increasingly important southern ports of Rosslare, Waterford, Cork and Foynes.  The corridor should be used as the basis for a major railway linking the island, including Shannon and Knock airports, and would be the second major cross-Border railway on the island.  A further new line linking Sligo to Derry via Donegal town and Letterkenny would add immense benefits, particularly for the north west.  The Atlantic rail corridor is a strategic route for the whole island and must be designated as part of the TEN-T core network.</p> <p>  I turn now to organisational issues.  From an organisational point of view, the National Transport Authority, NTA, only has a statutory role for the greater Dublin area.  Furthermore, my understanding is the authority does not currently have anyone at board or executive leadership level with rail expertise.  There would be a massive benefit if it were to bring somebody on board with that experience.  The railway services that start and finish outside Dublin should be managed by a dedicated regional railways undertaking, with a specific remit to develop services and increase passenger traffic.</p><p>Finally, the reason that I am putting this forward is not about the trains.  The reality is that we are facing an increased growth in the population of Ireland over the next 20 years.  Do we continue as we are, and cram more and more people into the greater Dublin area, or do we take the opportunity now to rebalance Ireland to allow that population growth to be absorbed across the country?  Providing a comprehensive and electrified passenger rail network provides a backbone of infrastructure that allows businesses to be based away from Dublin.  We have the chance to develop Ireland in a balanced way, to resolve dereliction in our towns and to give our citizens a place to live with a good quality of life over the next 20 years.  Let us take that opportunity. </p></speech>

As the Chairman knows, the issues we raise have been highlighted here a number of times, most recently when the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, appeared before the committee on 26 January 2022 and when Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann CEO, Jim Meade, appeared on 17 February 2022.<br/><br/>The partnership has quarterly meetings with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann management to promote the line, secure improvements in services and to provide in-depth feedback to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann from users and potential users. We also engage with the National Transport Authority and local authorities.  The rail review gives us an opportunity to highlight several issues, including our particular concern that there is no policy for the development of rural or regional railways at Department level or within the NTA or Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Strategy 2027 makes no commitments to improve regional rural services, except for improving services in the four metropolitan areas of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  The NTA's remit does not currently include developing regional, rural or intercity rail, even though it is responsible for the public service obligation, PSO, contract, allocating PSO funds and approving the timetable. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's own position in developing services is outlined in an email we received from local management telling us that it is not within its remit, but up to the NTA via the PSO contract, to determine the timetable.  It could propose an additional service for the NTA, for approval but it does not currently have the resources for this.  Both Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the NTA describe our line as &quot;lightly used&quot;.  This unfortunate tag is due to the lack of useful journey opportunities making it irrelevant and largely unusable to the population it serves; the failure by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's railway undertaking, RU, to promote the line to these communities; and the failure of the NTA to challenge the railway undertaking to improve the level of services being operated to meet local needs.  All other routes operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have seen services upgraded from the traditional two trains a day to either an hourly or, at worst, three-hourly off-peak service, with an almost hourly service at peak times.  The sole exceptions are the north and south Tipperary lines, which maintain a very basic service.  The timetable has essentially not changed since the restoration of full services after the emergency and fuel crises of 1947.  The only change has been the loss of direct services to Dublin, since 1986.  Except for a brief period in 2012 and 2013, all passengers must change at Ballybrophy to access stations on the line.  The line suffers from a lack of consistent and reliable services. There are currently 31 passenger trains a week, or 1,567 a year.  However, in each of the two years before Covid, over 200 services were replaced with buses, the equivalent of seven weeks of services.  Due to Covid, there were significant periods when there was no service on the line; for example,162 days from January to June 2021. <br/><br/>When driver shortages occur, our line's services are the first to be replaced by buses.  This creates a perception that the line is closed or unreliable and is not helped by the fact that none of the stations on the line have real-time information on display to update passengers.  In the ten-year period from 2011 to 2020, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann invested &euro;22.8 million on improvements, with a further &euro;22.7 million spent on day-to-day maintenance, resulting in a total infrastructure funding of &euro;45.5 million.  There has been no significant improvement of services in terms of faster journeys or more train services.  There are no rail services from Limerick to Ballybrophy between 6.30 a.m. and 4.55 p.m., and from Ballybrophy to Limerick between 10.05 a.m. and 5.05 p.m.  There are no services on Sunday mornings or at all on the Sundays of bank holiday weekends. <br/><br/>As of today, 24 miles of the line has been upgraded with continuous welded rail, CWR, but it still has a temporary speed restriction of 30 miles per hour.  We would like the committee to note that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's own CCE-TMS-321 track maintenance requirements and tolerances standards allow a maximum speed of 70 miles per hour on lines like the Limerick to Ballybrophy line, but Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has said that it will not look at a speed limit higher than 50 miles per hour.  Raising line speeds could result in a large reduction of journey times.  For example, it takes an average of 48 minutes to cover 24 miles of CWR at 30 miles per hour.  At 50 miles per hour, it would take 28 minutes and 48 seconds, a potential reduction of 19 minutes 12 seconds.  It is only after persistent challenges by the campaign that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s infrastructure manager agreed to review the line speeds for the new timetable due out later this year.  The proliferation of level crossings on the route impacts significantly on line speeds, with 12 being legacy gated crossings that require a gatekeeper to operate them, at a cost of approximately &euro;1.2 million per annum.  There is no programme or funding in place to convert attended crossings to automatic crossings or to abolish farmers' crossings through land swaps or buying out rights of way.  We would like to see further funding made available to allow this to happen as this would improve safety, allow better journey times and significantly reduce the operational and wage costs attributed to the line and allow it to be available to traffic 24-7.<br/><br/>On a typical weekday the line requires 68 people to operate two and a half return services a day.  We believe that with these fixed costs, the line should be offering more services.  Running more passenger or freight services will be a marginal cost, as the farebox should have the potential to cover the cost of operating more services without the need for any significant adjustment to the PSO.  Our first goal is to make the line user-friendly and relevant to the population it serves by the introduction of a third return service, seven days a week, utilising the existing available rolling stock allocated to the line.  This additional service will help significantly increase choice and journey opportunities for passengers, and should result in greater usage and greater farebox revenue.  We note that the Minister for Transport told this committee on 26 January 2022 that there is a need to invest in the line and that strategic use needs to be made of the line.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Do we let them just chug along at bare minimum use or do we want to make strategic use of them?  I think we should make strategic use of them.  I think we should build new stations along that line. </blockquote> <p>The line should be part of the vision for commuter rail into Limerick, with the delivery of an hourly service from Nenagh to Limerick.  This would serve the proposed Ballysimon Parkway station and the reopened station of Annacotty.  Annacotty could then serve the university and local industrial estates and be integrated with the M7 park and ride bus station, as proposed in the Limerick Shannon Metropolitan Area Transportation Strategy. <br/><br/>Integrating timetables and ticketing between rail and bus services would expand the catchment area of stations along the line in counties Tipperary, Clare, Offaly and Limerick, allowing flexibility and encouraging a modal shift from the car to public transport.  For example, we would like users of the Nenagh commuter service to access the later Bus &Eacute;ireann 323 or 72 service back to Nenagh after the last train has gone.  It is key that bus services call at the railway stations to connect with train services.  The responsibility for promoting and co-ordinating local bus services with rural and regional rail should be mandated to the Local Link co-ordination units where appropriate.  In order to ensure effective connectivity, Leap Card use should be extended to all rail and bus services throughout the country. </p></speech>

They have considerable experience of railways and lobbying for railways.  They want to see railways upgraded and restored throughout the county.  I am also conscious we have with us representatives from the Great Western Greenway.</p> <p>  I particularly compliment the submission of the delegation from north Tipperary.  It was well researched and got down to the nuts and bolts of what it is to try to run a rail line in terms of costs and staffing measures.  It suggested some deliverable objectives that could bring that line into greater use.</p> <p>  As I am sure our guests and many other railway enthusiasts and people with an interest in railways do, I sometimes look at the 1908 Vice Regal Commission map of Ireland and its light rails and railways.  It shows what a proliferation of railways we had, serving all our communities.  I am realistic enough to know we can never replicate that situation.  What damaged the railways in the regions most was the advent of motorised vehicles, including motor cars.  For approximately 60 years thereafter, we planned everything around the car.  We now have dispersed settlement, which makes it quite difficult to run public transport services to serve those dispersed communities.</p> <p>  If we are to be realistic and want to invest millions or billions in our railways, we need to match that with proper planning.  We need compact growth.  We need to pick one or two towns along each rail line in which we will have compact growth.  The people in those communities must be willing to accept the zonings and densities required to allow for the efficient running of the railways.  The backbone of a railway is constant, measurable commuting traffic.  Tourism alone is not enough to support a rail line but tourism can follow when a rail line supports itself.  Along the rail lines in the areas our guests represent, are the communities willing to accept higher density growth within their towns and those parts of the planning system that communities do not take to too quickly?  I invite Mr. Logue to answer that first.</p> <p>  There is another group I feel should have been represented at this meeting and I take responsibility for not suggesting we extend an invitation to it.  South East on Track has done tremendous work.  That area is an important part of the arc we are talking about from Sligo to Wexford.</p></speech>

I strongly suggest we write to the group the Deputy has mentioned and request written submissions.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Logue will respond to my questions.  Transport-orientated development is what I am talking about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1026" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#E00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  One of the most obvious candidates at this stage is probably somewhere such as Letterkenny.  It is a part of the north-western city region that has been established between Letterkenny, Derry and Strabane.  I attended a webinar yesterday that was hosted by Derry City and Strabane District Council.  The council very much sees Letterkenny as a core part of the area.  As we all know, the current public transport arrangements within Letterkenny and Derry are somewhat sparse.  I was forwarded the current bus timetable this morning by my brother, who lives in Donegal, and it is insufficient to drive a modal shift.  However, Letterkenny is expanding significantly.  We are looking to establish a university there on the back of the existing Letterkenny regional college.  There is a lot of support from Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce.  I met the president of the chamber online last year on this issue.  Letterkenny would be like pushing an open door when we consider where to start development.  We realise that railway lines cannot be put everywhere because that is impossible but Letterkenny would be a good place to start.</p></speech>

I believe we should sweat the assets we have rather than aiming for the very long term.  To build a greenfield railway takes a long time, a lot of investment and massive planning.  We have lines in place already, including, for example, the Nenagh branch we are talking about.  We need to sweat those assets.  We need compact growth in those towns and along those lines.  That is where we should concentrate.</p></speech>

If the Limerick line was managed in a better way, there would be potential for a shorter direct route between Dublin and Limerick.  A continuously welded rail line in that area would mean the potential for running trains at a significantly higher speed.  The major blockers on that line are primarily things such as the multiple accommodation crossings and the multiple manual level crossings.  If one is looking at developing, Nenagh, for instance, is suitable for major development.  From an intercity point of view, it would provide for a shorter direct journey between Dublin and Limerick but a curve would have to be built at Ballybrophy to accommodate direct trains.  No such curve exists at the moment.</p></speech>

That is why we have worked with the local authorities in areas the line goes through or near.  We have also worked with public representations like the committee members.  It is quite important to make that link between the operation of a train service and the development of the rural areas through which that train service passes.</p></speech>

I do not think transport and planning can be done separately even though we have done that for many years.  That approach has failed.  We have an opportunity now.  I have never seen so much enthusiasm across the Oireachtas for investment in railways as I have seen in the past two years.  I hope that continues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1031" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Feeney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#E01200"><p>In response to a question the Deputy asked, there is a very interesting case study in Oranmore.  The station at Oranmore was built under phase one of the western rail corridor and there was no station in Oranmore until then.  It is at somewhat of a remove from the village but is now well connected.  It now has 60,000 users a year.  Its car park is no longer able to take the number of cars that require parking.  The area is the focal point for a new suburb of Garraun, which will be built by Galway County Council.  That will link to Ardaun and the industrial estates at Parkmore, where we have all our medical technology companies.  We built the station in Oranmore.  We built it and they came.  The people use it.</p> <p>  The next step is to Tuam, which is the biggest town in the county but is not connected by rail to the western rail corridor.  It is a large industrial base that was recently bypassed.  It has a big population and is the capital of north Galway.  Irish Rail has a substantial land bank in the centre of the town.  Everything needs to be working together and every synergy must be capitalised upon to deliver what would be an important piece of public transport infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1032" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#E01300"><p>Mr. Logue has made very good points about the amount of work that needs to be done on the rail network and the sheer volume of improvements required.  The Sligo to Dublin line has an average running speed of 40 mph.  That is Third World stuff.  The economic corridor for the north west at the moment is that Sligo to Dublin link.  We need a railway on that route.  We need that to be done.  While recognising the value in what the representatives of West on Track have said about linking Sligo with Galway, the reality is there is a huge stack-up of work to be done before that happens.  All we are saying is that in the interim, that route should be preserved with the greenway.</p><p>Green transport is also transport.  Short commuting with electric bikes, or whatever, is popular and growing.  If one can put the greenway into all of those towns, one can facilitate commuting off the road.</p><p> My final point is that the section of that line north of Claremorris, between Claremorris and Sligo, where again somebody referred to the number of crossings on the line, has 400 such crossings on it, .  It was known as the Burma Road because of the slow rate of trains on it.  I humbly suggest to West on Track that, with the improvement of the N17, they would also look to incorporating a direct rail alignment in that to cut out all of those crossings.  If one looks at somewhere like Athens to Corinth rail route, where it was a similar type of slow and twisting railway, they built a motorway and railway beside it and just abandoned the railway.  It has created a proper commuting service compared to what was there.  I do not want to be seen to knock the notion of the western rail corridor.  It will be grand when we get it, if we get it, but in the meantime all I am saying is to ask all of the Deputies here to please make a decision and not to leave this as a can to be kicked down the road for another 40 years because we are just sick of all of that dereliction.</p></speech>

I should stop now as it is all downhill from here.</p> <p>  Again, as a person who has sat on school boards for 18 years and I am still on one, and have looked at numbers where we had 200 to 300 people applying for 90 places, Dublin is oversubscribed.  My grandfather came from Mayo to Dublin.  Eight of his siblings went to America.  The reality is that we need a better regional balance.  I believe that we are the only country in Europe now that has a population that is lower than it was 200 years ago.  </p> <p>  We must have a better regional balance and the railways can play their part in that.  I completely agree, however, with Deputy Matthews on the idea of compact growth and planning growth along the lines because if one goes to places like Hungary or a place in central Europe, the reason one can have trains every ten or 15 minutes is because when one goes outside of those train stations, there are a great many apartment blocks of ten to 15 storeys.  I am not suggesting that we put ten or 15 storey blocks in Ballybrophy or anywhere else but a railway line needs volume.  </p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Logue may contradict me if he wants to or agree with me if he likes, but it is about volume because the fixed costs are high and the extra revenue and passengers are needed once the railway line is running.  It surprises me a little bit to realise that it takes 68 people to run a service that only has two trips a day.  It seems like a tremendous amount of effort for such a small return with all of these people having to do these jobs.  One would have to have the volumes there for the service.  </p> <p>  To echo again the points made by Deputy Matthews, when we moved from trains to cars back in the day, that was seen as progress at the time.  Realistically, however, I live close enough to Leinster House - I did not do this today because it was lashing rain and I have to go to a few other places &ndash; but by and large, I will cycle rather than drive if I can.  The challenge we have is that if I want to get a train to Limerick or Cork, I have to get to Heuston Station, go from there to Limerick, from Limerick city to wherever I am going and I can jump in the car.  The motorway network, which is fantastic, has made the competition for rail all the greater as the road system has raised its game and has made rail relatively less attractive.  If the roads were worse, rail would be more attractive, and so on.  Rail has to up its game now in going from the 30 miles per hour to 50 miles per hour and to faster speeds.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Logue a question, because he is not looking specifically at one area, and then I will bring in some of the regional groups.  On the connection to the airport - we know that the metro is going to be a while away - but bearing in mind Ireland's infrastructure issues, planning processes and so forth, how quickly does Mr. Logue think that a Dublin Airport heavy rail link might be established and at what cost?</p></speech>

One also has to consider that at the moment one has got just a two-track railway down from Malahide to Connolly.  One would need to build two further tracks to be able to incorporate additional trains.  I am actually surprised that the DART coastal consultation does not include additional capacity on that route because that route is already beyond capacity, where one has Enterprise and Tara Mines trains crawling behind the regular DART trains.

If one had been realistic, I will give the Senator a ballpark figure now, which is a cost of around &euro;350 million to &euro;500 million, which would still be a great deal cheaper than building additional roads.  What people do not realise is that the construction cost of railway is cheaper than road but, as Senator Horkan has rightly said, one needs to have the volume.  Dublin Airport has the volume for that, in addition to MetroLink.  It is not a case of either-or nor should it be because the National Transport Authority chose its preferred route for MetroLink in the context of the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 &ndash; 2035.</p> <p>  I am talking in the context of a national strategy.  I actually arrived at the airport this morning from London, where I am based, and managed to get a train down but I took a local bus through Swords and Malahide to see for myself what the traffic is like down there.  There is a great deal of traffic and it took me 45 minutes to get from the airport to Malahide Station.  It took me 35 minutes to get to Pearse Station from Malahide, which I thought was pretty decent.  We need to also look at the airport in the context of the national connections.  One would also then have resolved a significant bottleneck on the existing railway which would give a benefit beyond the narrow benefit of getting trains to the airport.</p></speech>

One would expect, if one had an uncontentious application and it was going through the normal planning process - the railway order as we know is a separate planning process from the normal planning process for local authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la etc. - it should take two to three years because one still has to produce a cost, get approval, raise funding from EU or other sources and all of that takes time.  One has to build a business case and to make a feasibility study, so one could be allowing for a further two to three years.  I know that my friend and colleague, Mr. Hassard Stacpoole, is on the call as well and I ask him to feel free if he wants to jump in to answer this question also.  I estimate that it would be a timescale of around about five years if the decision was made to go ahead.</p></speech>

I particularly chose Manchester because it is a good comparison where one can have the best of both.  There is the local public transport connection with the light rail service, ironically, the Manchester Metrolink, and the intercity rail network, which plugs Manchester Airport into the major cities and towns across the north of England.  To my mind, that is a win-win situation.  The only thing restricting us in this case is the political will and, obviously, the budgets to be able to fund all this.</p></speech>

The great obstacle is the planning process, which was raised in this committee by the chief executive officer of Irish Rail and Mr. Peter Muldoon, who is head of new works.  The planning process is the greatest obstacle.  In terms of actual delivery, there is a two-year to three-year construction period.  The key advantage of plugging in the airport is that one connects it into the whole network.  It means one can run trains from Limerick into the airport, potentially.  With the Shannon rail link, which we are discussing as well and which has been discussed in this committee, it makes rail more attractive and connected into the whole network.  One is not just serving the hinterland of the airport but the whole country.</p></speech>

One cannot but be struck by their commitment to rail and the contribution it can make to travel in Ireland.  I especially welcome the representatives of the North Tipperary Community Rail Partnership.  I work with them and I understand where they are coming from.  Were it not for their efforts, which have been magnificent in recent years, we would not have a rail line open between Ballybrophy and Limerick.  The Minister has said he is committed to that rail line.  He has been very forthright in his policy initiatives in terms of bringing rail on line and making rail more accessible to more people.  We can only do that by investment.  I am surprised to see Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's strategy to 2027 making no commitment to improve regional rural services, and from comments heard from the National Transport Authority, NTA, it appears that both of those organisations are out of step with the Minister.  It is important they catch up and realise that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve our rail network.  The Minister and the Government are committed.  In the history of our country we have never designated so much funding for the improvement of our rail network.  We must take advantage of that now.</p> <p>  The Limerick to Ballybrophy line is a serious problem.  We have made progress but it has been very slow and meagre.  There is a lack of frequency in the service on the line.  There is a poor timetable which is not aligned for work times.  There are painstakingly slow speeds on the line.  Motorised cycles would actually travel faster than the trains on that line.  The carriages are old and the comfort leaves a lot to be desired.  In my view, people will travel on rail lines if the timetable and frequency are available.  Nenagh to Ballybrophy is a typical example.  I live in Thurles, which has a fantastic rail service on the Cork-Dublin line.  Every week, hundreds of people travel a very bad road from Nenagh to Thurles to avail of the timetables from Thurles.  There is a need there.  People are looking for a service.  If they are provided with a service, they will use it.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann says it is lightly used.  Of course, it is lightly used.  That is because of its neglect of the line for so many years.  If we invest, we will get a return.  As well as getting a return, it will also improve and enhance rural communities.  It will bring people into rural communities to live and to work.  It should be part of our regional development plan.  It removes cars from the roads, avoids pollution and, above all, it avoids huge delays entering our towns and cities.</p> <p>  I would like to hear more from the North Tipperary Community Rail Partnership about the commuter service it is proposing between Nenagh and Limerick.  This is very much needed.  Limerick is a university city and Nenagh is effectively a satellite town.  A massive number of people are moving between the two areas.  On the outskirts of Limerick there is a big catchment in the areas that have been pointed out.  Chairman, I will be proposing and encouraging my colleagues on this committee to have a submission on behalf of this rail line included in our report to the Department and the Minister.  I hope to see the inclusion of a request for funding in the 2023 public service obligation, PSO, budget for additional services on the line.</p> <p>  I wish to make another comment.  We have an issue with our crossings.  The only way to improve the speeds is to improve the line and then to remove as many of the crossings as possible.  They slow down the transit of the train.  With regard to farm crossings, the committee should request the various county managers to give priority to these planning applications.  I am dealing with a number of farm crossings and it is very slow and difficult.  There is too much bureaucracy involved in getting permission for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to install an undercrossing to assist farmers with their animals.</p> <p>  The contributions that have been made at this meeting are excellent.  I firmly believe we are way behind when it comes to connectivity from Dublin Airport to the city.  As has been pointed out, we need to catch up.  I will give the rest of my time to the representatives of the North Tipperary Community Rail Partnership if they wish to respond or, perhaps, prioritise what their requests are for the current year.</p></speech>

The fundamental problem is the NTA, which is responsible for the PSO, does not have a statutory role in the development of either regional or intercity railways.  However, it is in charge of the PSO.  Likewise, Irish Rail says it will not put on services unless there is a PSO or there is a demand.  It is a chicken-and-egg thing.  The problem we have with the north Tipperary line, as mentioned in our opening statement, is that the services have not changed for 75 years.  We run two trains per day, one in the morning and one in the evening.  In recent years, as the railways modernised, the line, which used to be the main route into Limerick, was not modernised.</p> <p>  For railway management and how Irish Rail runs the Limerick area, the priorities are the intercity service to Dublin via Limerick Junction, Limerick to Ennis and, perhaps by extension, the services to Galway.</p><p>There is a fundamental disconnect.  We need somebody there to put key performance indicators, KPIs, in place.  The first starting point is the upgrade of the track, to which we alluded in our opening statement, and that is part of our campaign.  Getting that speed up would cut journey times and increase efficiency as it would allow the trains to run quicker and produce shorter journeys.  The existing train that operates on the line sits idly in Limerick for the best part of six or seven hours a day, so providing a service in the middle of the day is the starting point here.  Irish Rail will have an issue with that because it will say it needs to be funded and the PSO must be increased.  The Minister has indicated it could be a matter for the NTA.  Again, it is a chicken-and-egg thing.  We are waiting for a reply from the NTA to Deputy Kelly, who asked whether it would increase the PSO.  Deputy Lowry has also asked the NTA to do that.  We need to get that funding in place but, fundamentally, you cannot run a train service without drivers and the procurement of drivers is an issue.  We need Irish Rail to put together a programme, particularly in Limerick, to provide consistency of service, because we do not have consistency even as it is with two trains a day, but also to put drivers in place to operate that service going forward.</p><p> Going back to the NTA, the other issue is that the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan strategy stops at the County Limerick border.  It does not actually look at the railway lines.  As the Chairman knows, we have had to go back to the NTA and ask it to look again at the proposals for rail.  In theory, when looking at rail in the Limerick context, we should be looking at Limerick to Nenagh, because Nenagh into Limerick is one market.  There is then a second market that consists of intercity traffic to Dublin and people commuting from the county town, which is Tipperary town, to places like Dublin.  That is an issue.  If that funding is provided, as new rolling stock comes on as a result of the DART+ programme and diesel rail cars are displaced, we would like a minimum of a two-hourly service put on the line and an hourly service into Limerick at peak.</p><p> One of the fundamental issues with line speeds is the crossings.  We have 12 manned crossings, which come with a high operational cost.  We would like a programme to be funded to get rid of them, which would ultimately cut the operating cost by a significant amount.  More important, it would give 24-7 flexibility, whereas we are currently reliant on the gatekeepers to operate the shifts.  The other big issue is farmer crossings.  We need a programme to allow farmers to farm their land safely while also allowing the railway to operate safely, because on a modern railway we want faster journeys.  No funding has been allocated for that.  This is the only line in the country that does not have a programme to get rid of farmer crossings.  Some of the user crossings are being upgraded at the moment with the modern system Irish Rail is installing.  Deputy Calleary will be aware there is a big local issue in Mayo with farmer and user crossings, but that railway runs at 70 or 80 mph and the north Tipperary line should be no different.</p><p> We need responsibility to be taken, not only by the NTA in how it procures regional and rural railways but also by the Department of Transport so the sector has the ability to implement this.  It fundamentally comes down to the two authorities that procure rail services to instruct the railway company to deliver it.  They do not have in-house railway expertise.  They are reliant on consultants and they do not understand how rural and regional railways should and can operate for the benefit of the whole country.  It is not just about connecting the radial lines into Dublin.  We have a great opportunity with the regional rail review to connect communities.  People in Nenagh, Cloughjordan or Roscrea should be able to hop on a train and go into Limerick, go on to Galway via Ennis or go seamlessly to Waterford via Clonmel or down to Cork.  It should go beyond just going to Dublin.</p></speech>

It has been an interesting forum.  All the rail reviews to date seem to have been based on demand.  However, the Irish ways of measuring demand have been proven to be flawed by the cases mentioned here today.  Mr. Logue mentioned the Derry line.  He described the forecasts for the Belfast-Derry line as conservative, which was quite diplomatic.  Mr. Feeney also spoke about what is happening with the Oranmore service.  How reliable are these forecasts?  How do the Irish forecasting models for rail usage and passengers numbers compare with other international systems?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the whole area of service.  The review will more than likely make conclusions based on demand, as all reviews have to date, which brings us back to my first question.  The witnesses from Tipperary have explained very well the lack of service, consistency and comfort of a rail service that is to all intents and purposes operating on timetables from the foundation of the State and even before that.  Have other rail systems changed their timetabling beyond recognition to better reflect modern consumer demand, modern work pressures and the education pressures Deputy Lowry referred to?  Is the Irish rail system, on both sides of the Border, stuck in a time warp or is it similar to other systems internationally?</p> <p>  The western rail corridor is crucial to the Atlantic economic corridor.  An all-island rail review, which Mr. Logue put in context, would look at the Atlantic economic corridor.  That seems to have slipped down the priority list of this Government.  I am referring to the corridor from Derry to Cork.  For that to be successful, it needs a cohesive rail line and service.  I welcome Mr. Mulligan's reiteration that these two services can operate alongside each other.  My worry is that if we proceed with the greenway, as proposed by Mr. Mulligan, we will never see the rail line.  The greenway will be used as an excuse.  There is nothing to prevent a greenway being developed alongside the existing rail service.  We should still pursue the creation of a rail line and an all-island Atlantic economic corridor in the context of the all-island rail review.  Rail demand and rail service probably need to be looked at completely differently from how they have been looked at to date, not just here but on the entire island.</p></speech>

I have been involved with the Into the West rail campaign, so we are very aware of how the estimates from Translink and Northern Ireland railways come about.  The model Translink used made several assumptions about increasing the passenger capacity on the line if further trains were run.  It is safe to say that once the new timetable was introduced, and especially when the new trains were brought on stream, Translink put a lot of effort into promoting the promotional fares.  For instance, there is a very cheap fare on Sundays right across Northern Ireland.  The model Translink used to put together the original estimates when it did the internal business case for further investment came out way below the actual figures.  It estimated it would reach around 1 million passengers by the end of the second year but it reached that point six months in.  I would have used that service myself for many years.  My family are from Donegal and I used that train for several years in the past when it was a rattly old diesel engine.  There would be six people, including me and the driver, on that train coming out of Derry.</p><p>It is a different situation now.  There is a regular clock-face timetable so people know the train is going to leave at a specific set of hours of the day.  There are very good quality, air conditioned trains.  They have recently introduced walk-through trains on that line as well.  Customer demand outstripped what the managers predicted.</p><p> One of the big things we hear from Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority is that they run a railway census every year.  The NTA tends to run it in a middle week around November.  They are looking at the minimum number of passengers who might board those trains.  It is worth pointing out that this is a tactic used by Richard Beeching when he was chairman of British Rail back in the early 1960s.  He used the idea of the censuses as a stick to show how lightly used certain lines were.  The other issue is that when services started to reopen after the Covid restrictions, people were already complaining about overcrowding.  That has shown there has been more demand.  A key point that Mr. Mulligan raised very well is the slowness of, for instance, the Sligo trains.  Those trains are running on speed restrictions, which dampens down demand. </p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Stacpoole, to follow up on further questions Deputy Calleary raised.</p></speech>

I work for Network Rail and have worked in the UK railway industry for the best part of 20 years.  We use something called the passenger demand forecasting handbook, which Mr. Logue will be familiar with.  That is how we identify demand.  It works quite well as a model.  It does have its flaws because it is perhaps more suited to cities and interurban rail than regional or rural rail.  The forecasting really does come down to the level of services, as I noted in the previous answer.  Frequency is the key.  When Dick Fearn was managing director and we had the modernisation in the early part of the 2000s, frequency was a key and we saw massive growth in demand.</p> <p>  In terms of railway modelling, the first phase of the western rail corridor, the Limerick to Galway intercity route, was forecast to have 200,000 passengers within two or three years.  It exceeded its predicted passenger numbers quite quickly despite a recession.  In 2019, the last year before Covid, it was carrying over 550,000 passengers a year.  The timetable on that is not very good.  For example, my father wanted to go from Limerick to Galway last week to go to a hospital appointment.  He could not get a train there and back in the time because the timetable was not conducive to allowing him to do so and the journey time is still slow and can be improved.  Consequently, he got a taxi at horrendous expense.</p> <p>  It comes down to the service levels we are going to offer.  The experience we have had everywhere so far has shown that when we put more trains on, the demand is there.  Obviously in very rural areas that may not be the case.  Going back to what Deputy Matthews said, where we have planning we put in more housing.  In Nenagh, 140 houses are going to go right next to the station.  That is going to create potentially at least 300 people travelling in to Limerick or going to Dublin.  I do not think rail planning takes account of that.  It is always very short-term planning rather than medium to long term.  That is the problem, because we do not have that rail expertise in the NTA or in the Department to ask Irish Rail to procure rail services.</p></speech>

Demand is one thing but service level, consistency and quality of service, and frequency are also issues.  The Bradley report has shown an economic demand.  I know that has been forwarded to the committee.  I commend Western Rail Corridor on commissioning it.  I thank all the witnesses.</p></speech>

I lived in Cloughjordan for a while about ten years ago and the signpost indicating the station, which was just over 1 km outside the town, showed a steam train.  I wondered whether people thought there might not have been a service there at all.  As part of any funding package for improving services there needs to be clear attention given to the way in which those services can be promoted and the information about them.  It is not good enough to say people can look it up online.  Much more subtle things are required to change people's behaviour.  It is really important that is put into any budget on new lines, stations or openings or on new or additional services.</p></speech>

I want to scotch that rumour, which is widely believed but not true.  The licensing agreement between CI&Eacute; and the county councils on greenways is very specific in that rail is the priority use of the asset at all times.  Putting a greenway on a rail route does nothing but preserve the route for posterity.  Donegal was raised earlier.  In Bundoran the railway alignment has been absorbed by some of the roads.  As Jim Meade said, and Deputy Calleary was the one who extracted this comment from him last month, a greenway is a win-win because it keeps the asset under State ownership and keeps it utilised.  If there is a decision at some time in the future for it to go back into public transport mode, the licensing arrangement is such that it can do so.  That is very clear and unequivocal.</p></speech>

That is the key.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1075" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Devane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#J00700"><p>There are basic issues with the EY report around accuracy.  Having been involved at the front end of the report where we set the terms of reference, some of them were not adequately met in our opinion, particularly around what the future opportunity was.  That is the more significant issue.  That gets me into the Deputy's comment on the importance of the Atlantic economic corridor, AEC.  The first Deputy made the point about how the communities along the axis will respond to building up more density.  Very clearly with the AEC we have already gone after that, we have looked at all of the chambers along that axis running from Kerry to Derry, getting them to support what we are doing.  The issue becomes one of defining what exactly we are talking about.  If we do an all-island rail review, the critical issue is what economic guidance is going to be given to the people doing the review.  We have concerns today that freight business in the north west needs to have access to the Foynes port to be successful and <i>vice versa</i>.  If we look at the medium and longer term, a critical economic issue needs to be addressed in respect of all the regions that run from Donegal down to Kerry.</p><p>In those counties the gross value add per person, which is the real economic measurement to look at, is about half of the average.  The greater Dublin area is at approximately double the average generally speaking.  When we talk about an economic corridor running from Derry to Kerry, we are talking about a practical application of the assets we have in a continuous form to give us a city of scale so that we can attract the kind of inward investment we need to build that. We know from the study Dr. Bradley did in Mayo - Mayo is like all the other counties - that five large companies contribute the majority of the GDP of that county.  If any one of those were to go, the GDP would be likely to drop by a significant amount.  This is important because Dr. Bradley's report also shows there are very high dependencies in Mayo and in the other counties.  By dependency I mean there is a demographic issue with many younger people and older people.  We do not have the people in the centre aged between 25 and 50 and that demographic is hollowed out.  We know this because we have seen migration out of the regions for a long time; that is the old story.</p><p> We are talking about correcting this gross value add.  We are talking about building up.  When we are talking about regional balance, we are talking about getting the net contribution to GDP per region or per county to be at least equal to the cost of that county in terms of what is dependent.  In this case, dependent includes people working in the public sector, people working in farming who are subvented, pensioners who are paid etc.  The idea of balance here is to increase gross value add so that it can pay for its county and every county can wash its face basically.</p><p> The idea of the corridor is to use the assets available in a very practical way and create one backbone that runs from north to south.  When that backbone is built, we can at least attract the kind of investment about which we are talking.  We need to bear in mind that two large investments were considered for Galway, one employing hundreds and the other employing thousands.  We were not able to lock in either of those for many reasons.  A major reason was people's mobility and the ability to move people quickly from place to place.  That is the idea of the corridor.</p><p> I would make another point about greenways.</p></speech>

I do not have a problem with greenways in any shape or form, but I would make the point that north of the Dublin-to-Galway line we do not have sufficient grid capacity.  If we had the companies in the morning ready to set up in Ballina, Letterkenny or wherever, we could not handle it.  Our recommendation has been that the railway system itself can be also used to service utility distribution, particularly with power.  Ultimately railways will use electricity in the majority of cases.  When we look at the all-island review, there is an opportunity for us to decide to use this public land to run the utilities and in particular to distribute power on a DC basis under the railways and bring it up into the grid where it is needed.  My point is that other utilities could use the rail networks and that also needs to be considered from the railway viewpoint.</p></speech>

I really wanted to be here to discuss this matter.  Obviously like Deputy Calleary, I am from Mayo.  In the context of its importance to the Atlantic economic corridor, is the western rail corridor shovel ready if the funding were to be provided tomorrow morning?  I have read the report by Dr. John Bradley and other reports which make a strong business case for it.  If population is to be the overriding variable in any cost-benefit analysis, we will never get anything done.  We in the west and in Mayo are getting really tired of the doublespeak about the western rail corridor and the Atlantic economic corridor.  I was delighted with the Atlantic economic corridor because I thought at last this is the vital piece of infrastructure on which we can hang everything.  We know where we are going and there is a strategic joined-up approach here.  I commended Government and everybody involved on it.  I will come to Mr. Devane shortly.  Where has that gone?  Why is there so much doublespeak on these projects and initiatives?  The first question is: is the Atlantic economic corridor shovel ready?</p></speech>

Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that to us.  If it got to go ahead, it would be prepared to move on it without delay.  The first thing that would need to happen is that further clearance on the track would be required.  The plans would probably be revised because although the plans are already in existence they would need to be tailored for the present situation.  If the Government were to finance the western rail corridor, according to Dr. Bradley's estimate, it would cost &euro;154 million.  It could proceed without very much delay and could be completed within three to four years.  We are talking about the section from Athenry to Claremorris, which would obviously link Ballina inland port to Shannon Foynes Port and on to Cork and Waterford.  It would obviously link the towns of Claremorris, Castlebar, Westport, Ballina and Tuam to our regional capital in Galway.</p></speech>

This is why I am confused.  Every politician I speak to, with very few exceptions, seems to recognise the importance of it.  If there is so much political support for it, why is it not happening?  Why do we get a TEN-T report which leaves it out of the core projects again?  During the Covid pandemic, there was a sudden realisation of the imbalance of the regions.  We said we would do things differently and that we would not go to back to the way we were before.  It now seems that everything is settling back again and we will not address regional imbalance.  I ask Mr. Devane to outline the status of the Atlantic economic corridor.  How important is rail infrastructure to that?</p></speech>

When we first raised the concept, we needed to get buy-in from people, particularly from the business community, and to get people along the axis to work together.  The task force that was formed by Deputy Ring worked very well for a number of years.  That task force basically went about making very specific enabling changes that have helped us quite a bit.  The ten local authorities started to work together and that has proven to be very good.  When the former Ministers of State, Senator Kyne and Deputy Canney, were chairs, they drove that.  They drove the funding and drove the people in the local authorities along the corridor to focus specifically on working together.  That collaboration is working.  At the outset, local authorities worked very much in their own framework.  We now know of several instances where they are coming together.  In the case of Ireland West Airport, local authorities are working together to ensure that happens.  We have a better example in the Shannon Estuary with Shannon-Foynes-----</p></speech>

I have never heard any objection.  We have gone through that phase.</p> <p>  The problem we have now is that it is about ambition and where people want to go.  That is why I gave the numbers on gross value add, GVA.  In order to move the dial on GVA and correct the imbalance, we need to make significant investment to create some form of value-add activity, such as large fabrication plants, large biopharma plants and so on.  That requires having this backbone with all the utilities prioritised on it so that those utilities can be used.</p> <p>  The proposed development of a data centre outside Galway was possible only because it is the only place-----</p></speech>

If those were set out correctly, we would not be here talking about opening the railway.  It would be a done deal because it would be obvious it would have to be done.  The political and governmental system does not have the necessary ambition and is not setting out the economic guidance that is required to allow the type of investment we are discussing.</p></speech>

Those aspects have caught up with us since.  Climate change, the fact it now costs &euro;2 per litre of petrol and so on have bolstered the case for reopening the western rail corridor.</p> <p>  I will highlight a microcosm of the situation.  There are 1,000 acres of State-owned land earmarked for development between Athenry and Galway city.  Every acre of that is served by the railway.  Mr. Devane spoke about the possibilities for growth.  By the way, no decision has been made on the largest of those projects.  It looks slightly to be at a remove now, but no decision has been made.  Someone could get on a train in Claremorris or Castlebar and get straight to a site on 1,000 acres that are earmarked for economic development.  Those places are going to drive the west.  We cannot give up any inch of advantage we have, and the western rail corridor is a fundamental part of that.  We have the Bonham Quay office development in Galway city.  It has no parking because it is right beside the rail station.  It got its planning permission because it was right beside the rail station and involved minimal parking.  There are 1,000 office jobs there.  People will have to travel in by train to go to work.  Rail is the future.</p></speech>

We search and lobby in Brussels to find out how it can be moved forward.  As recently as an adviser speaking two days ago, the answer has always been that Brussels thinks what we are doing is a great idea, important and within what Europe is trying to do, but the Irish Government is not supporting it and Brussels is not hearing about it from the Government, so we had better convince the Government we want to do this.  That is my understanding as to why this piece of railway is not included in the TEN-T.</p></speech>

We have gone to Brussels and got the same answers.  There are serious questions to be answered.  The rail review is our last opportunity.  I believe the Minister has said it will be published in late summer.  We need to see this project being properly recognised in the rail review.</p> <p>  I am also on the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and all stakeholders are concerned about the lack of transport.  We will soon have the technological university, which we are thrilled and delighted about, but its impact will be curtailed if we do not have the public transport infrastructure to go with it.</p></speech>

Last Thursday, the Minister told the D&aacute;il he expected the report to be ready around the end of the year.  The timeframe is moving back continually.  I agree with everything the Deputy has said, particularly about education, in which I have worked for all my life.  It is one thing to educate the young people of the west and then give them a ticket to go and live in Dublin or somewhere else, but what we in the west need to do, and this speaks to what Mr. Devane described, is to educate our young people, which we do in Sligo, Galway and Limerick, and then keep them in the west.  The main beneficiary of that will be the greater Dublin area, which as we all know is suffering greatly from overcrowding, traffic and other issues.</p> <p>  This is not an east versus west confrontation by any manner or means.  We all have relations in Dublin.  I was educated in Dublin and I have no issues with any of that.  Instead, we are dealing with a situation where a large part of Ireland north of a line from Galway to Dublin has been seriously neglected, namely, the Border, west and north west region.  If Arup does not recognise that and make proposals on the development of rail in that area alongside the billions of euro that have been earmarked for Dublin and the wider east &ndash; we do not begrudge them that money because they need it, as we have heard today &ndash; and if it cannot give us a meagre &euro;154 million to open a key piece of infrastructure, it will tell us a great deal about how Arup was set up to arrive at those conclusions.  The Deputy has asked questions that would be better addressed to the Department of Transport on why these reports keep coming up with the same answer.</p> <p>  According to the CEO of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, &euro;1 million has been given to Arup.  It is a reputable group of people and I am confident they will recognise, irrespective of what kind of steering group is running the review, that there has to be development in the rest of Ireland on the basis of fairness alone.</p></speech>

This has been an insightful and engaging conversation and I compliment our guests on their opening remarks.  I had to smile when Mr. Feeney used the phrase &quot;We built it and they came&quot; in respect of the Oranmore station, as demonstrated in its strong patronage and increased passenger numbers.  In our case in Mayo, the headline in <i>The Western People</i>about the official opening of the then Connacht Regional Airport in 1986 was &quot;And they said it couldn't be done&quot;.  In the lead-up to the airport opening, political will for it was practically non-existent.  The airport, on that boggy and sometimes foggy site outside Knock, reached nearly 1 million passengers yearly before the pandemic.  The initial conservative forecast was for more than 8,000 passengers.  We have seen what can be done.  As Mr. Devane outlined, the western rail project is a golden opportunity in the wider strategic context of economic development, and that should not be forgotten.</p><p>My question is on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's recently published Rail Freight 2040 strategy.  It is incredible it ignores the rail freight potential of the western rail corridor.  It suggests that rail freight from Mayo to the nation's newest tier 1 port in Foynes should travel via the greater Dublin area on a potential 850 km route instead of going directly down the western seaboard via Galway and Clare, offering those counties access to rail freight as well as the connectivity Mayo currently enjoys.</p><p>I would like to get an understanding from West on Track as to whether it was aware that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was working on this rail freight strategy and what is its views on the current situation.  Certainly, Mayo has a strong presence in terms of all intermodal shipping traffic to Irish Rail for the past 16 years and it has been certainly seriously disadvantaged by this strategic review.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is well made about the rail freight strategy that was published, if you could call it "published", before Christmas.  It was widely expected that the western rail corridor would be included in that.  It is my belief that if Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had its way it would have been included in that, but for some reason it was not.  It was taken off the map.  The question we have to ask is, why are these kinds of decisions being made?  I am afraid I am not in a position to answer.</p> <p>  What I can say with certainty is that this week there will be 18 freight trains from County Mayo - nine into the county and nine out of the country.  Eight will be coming from Ballina and one will be coming from Westport.  Four of the outward bound services will be going to Waterford and five will be going to Dublin.  That will increase in the next few months when XPO launches its second freight service to Waterford from Mayo.  That is why it is difficult to see why the potential for that was omitted, as the Deputy says, from the rail freight strategy.  I cannot tell the Deputy why.  Maybe Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann can tell him why.</p> <p>  The reality is this freight exists because in the early 2000s it was decided that Ballina freight port would be closed and West on Track was instrumental in ensuring that it did not close.  Working with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Mayo industries, the situation was brought about where the freight that the Deputy sees today was put in place and different operators have operated over the years.  What is significant about this is that IWT and XPO are two Dublin-based international companies shipping to Europe and they are shipping from Ballina.  IWT has appeared before this committee and stated that it requires the western rail corridor, in its view, to expand its operation and to expand out into neighbouring counties such as Galway and Clare.  The Irish Exporters Association has made it clear that it supports the reopening of this corridor as a freight route in the context of the reopening of Foynes, as the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said on several occasions.</p> <p>  The Port of Waterford and Foynes port both wrote to Dr. John Bradley, when he was doing his report, strongly supporting the link between Ballina and those ports using the western rail corridor.  It might be said that 18 trains a week, or 20, as it will be, hopefully, later in spring, is a relatively small number of trains but if you had another 20 from Galway and another 20 from Clare, that would be 60 trains a week.  The 18 trains out of Mayo this week are taking 324 articulated lorries off the road and I would submit that is the vision the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, puts forward as far as climate change and all of that is concerned.  That illustrates how green the movement of freight by rail is.  As Deputy Dillon says, it is ridiculous to think that when Foynes port is opened, if the situation with the map on the freight strategy continues, all of that freight will be moved from Ballina to the greater Dublin area and then down to Limerick and out to Foynes.  That does not make any sense.</p></speech>

What changed in terms of the momentum in his campaign at that stage?  Was the political will or buy-in there during Mr. Logue's initial exchanges with Ministers and Government officials?</p></speech>

When we could not at times engage with Ministers, we had to engage directly with the civil servants.  However, the campaign really worked because local politicians right across the spectrum, regardless of whether they were unionist, nationalist or other, were engaged and realised that this was something that had to happen, as otherwise Derry and the entire north west would be cut off completely because the original proposals were to close the railway after Ballymena.  Getting the buy-in from politicians was not that difficult.</p> <p>  The key was making sure that the business case was put forward.  People realised that they would get better trains, and they got better trains.  The old trains were not in any great shape and were very much life expired by 2004.  Translink withdrew those trains probably as late as 2005 to 2010.  With the new trains coming on stream and, importantly, the timetable, it really fired the imagination of the locals around Derry because suddenly there was an attractive service that they could use.  It was not as quick as it could be but the fact that you are running a reliable timetable and running clean, comfortable and modern trains means it is attractive.  As I say, Translink provided good promotional fares.  In fact, they still provide a flat fare right across Northern Ireland on a Sunday of &pound;8.  You can travel from Derry to Newry for &pound;8 on any Translink service.</p></speech>

In particular, we have got the railway running past the city of Derry port of Lisahally.  We have engaged.  Into the West is continuing to engage with the managers of that port.  There is potential for freight because Lisahally takes freight coming by sea into places such as north Donegal and Sligo.  It is an important cross-Border port from our point of view in the Republic.</p> <p>  The railway, as I say, runs right past that.  The capital investment involved in providing a small siding and some points would not be that big.  Listening to the webinar from Derry City and Strabane District Council yesterday, a senior civil servant in the Department of transport stated that the Department is watching closely the outcome of the strategic rail review in the context of freight.  The last freight trains were run on Translink's network, probably as long ago as 2002 but there is very much a need in the North, as there is down here, to reduce the amount of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, on the roads.</p></speech>

Senator Horkan spoke earlier about the fact that our guests are all volunteers.  They all do this for reasons that are dear to their hearts in terms of how they want to see the west of Ireland developing and I thank them for that work.  Many of them have been doing this for a very long time indeed - those who have advocated for the reopening of the western rail corridor for decades at this point and people such as Mr. Mulligan, who are looking to see that rail route protected until such time as it makes sense for that development, advocating for a holding position of a greenway.</p> <p>  All of us who live in the west can see the benefits that would accrue from the development of this line as a rail service providing some of the benefits spoken of by those advocating for that this morning but we also need to be pragmatists and realists here as to what is possible now, in the medium term and in the long term.  We do the people we serve a great disservice unless we do exactly that - look at the facts as presented to us right now and try as best we can with the aid of people who are far more expert than we are in the development of national rail infrastructure as they advise and guide us to make the right decision as to how this asset is used to the best effect for the people we serve.</p><p>Every report commissioned in recent years has drawn roughly the same conclusion, either that it does not make sense to develop the western rail corridor north of Athenry at this time or that it does not make sense to do so in the long term.  The most recent report commissioned by the Department arrived at that conclusion.  It was then sent by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to an entity with the European Commission, Joint Assistance to Support Projects in the European Regions, JASPERS, which is acknowledged as being expert in the development of rail infrastructure across the European Union.  It drew the same conclusion, that is, there is no social or economic benefit accruing right now from the development of the line within the region which it serves.<br/><br/>As regards the political perspectives on this issue, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, stated in 2017 that he could not envisage the return of rail services on the line, given the lack of a strong economic case to support it.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, stated in 2014 that the Government had no plans to extend the western rail corridor or any other heavy rail line in the State.  The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, stated while Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2015 that his Department was supportive of a proposal to develop the disused Collooney to Claremorris rail line as a greenway.  As recently as last week, the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated in the D&aacute;il:</p><blockquote>	Once one goes north of Claremorris, the line is not extant.  Everyone is agreed that the section north towards Collooney and Sligo is highly unlikely in the immediate future to be considered for rail services.  </blockquote><p>He also stated last week:</p><blockquote>	[I]s there is a demand for commuting from Claremorris or Tuam into Galway on rail?  The answer is clearly 'No', as ... JASPERS, said. </blockquote><p>Those are the facts presented to us right now.  The facts oblige us to make decisions that are in the best interests of the people we serve.  As I said clearly to the Minister in the D&aacute;il Chamber last week, we need to make a decision now.  We need to make a fundamental decision about how exactly this key piece of public infrastructure is going to be used in the coming five, ten 20 or 30 years.<br/><br/>The experts within Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann who are charged with setting out a rail freight strategy for the country arrived at a conclusion published in July last year that it makes no sense right now to develop any freight services along that line, but they also said it makes absolute sense to develop a regional freight hub in Athenry, adjacent to the rail station.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, recently stated that the most urgent rail investment we can make in the west of Ireland is double-tracking the line from Athenry to Oranmore, bearing in mind that there are more people commuting to Galway city from Athenry and Oranmore than there are from the whole of County Mayo.<br/><br/>These are the facts as presented to us right now.  All I am asking is that we act, as I am sure all present intend to do, in the best interests of the people of every village and town from Athenry to Collooney and, in a spirit of hands across the Border, all the way to Enniskillen.  They are sick to the teeth looking out their window for the past 30 or 40 years and seeing this piece of infrastructure rotting away into the ground, serving no purpose whatsoever.<br/><br/>My question for Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh is the following.  We will have the outcome of yet another review at the end of the year.  I dearly wish that it will say it makes both economic and social sense to begin developing that rail line connecting Athenry to Claremorris and perhaps even further north.  If it does, I will be delighted and as that development gets under way, I will begin advocating for the development of a greenway alongside it which, in the greater scheme of things in terms of the cost of the development, would not represent a very significant investment.  If the rail review arrives at a different conclusion, however, such as yet another fudge or kicking the can down the road again, does not reach any firm conclusion on whether we need to begin developing a rail service on that line, would it not make sense then, at least in the interim, to use the line to serve the interests of the people who live along it?  The people of every village and town along the line are seeing millions of euro being pumped into greenway investment across the country.  For example, I refer to the benefits it has brought to places such as Westport and Newport in Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh's county, the beautiful County Mayo.  Newport is re-energised and re-visioned for the future as a result of that development.  Places such as Kilmacthomas in Waterford are seeing an extraordinary turnaround in their fortunes, both in terms of their economy and the quality of life in those places.<br/><br/>The worst thing and the greatest disservice we could do to people in the west of Ireland is to say they are going to have neither a rail line nor a greenway.  Mr. Mulligan made the case earlier and I will reiterate it.  In August 2013, Barry Kenny stated Irish Rail would license the routes to local authorities to enable them to develop cycleways and greenways on them because there was no doubt they are a fantastic tourism opportunity and it protects the alignment in the longer term.  He stated the railways are protected by the very existence of the cycleways should they be needed in the future.  Jim Meade told this committee in February 2021, &quot;The greenway is a win-win ... because it keeps the asset in State ownership&quot;.  That is all we are asking.<br/><br/>I am deeply fearful that by the time the review is published at the end of the year, we will be left with nothing.  Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh will be waiting and those advocating for a greenway will be waiting and that is not the outcome we want to see happening.  I am asking a very simple question.  If it transpires that when it is published at the end of the year the rail review concludes that right now, and perhaps for the foreseeable future, it makes no sense to develop that line, will he then advocate for the development of a greenway as a holding position to protect the asset and to begin bringing some degree of economic benefit to the communities it serves?</p></speech>

The only way of doing so is to set out an economic strategy that corrects it.  We know from the work we have done that such a strategy must include large infrastructural development to support the type of industry investment that will drive up GDP and create the gross value added, GVA, that is needed per person.  That is what is needed now.  The Deputy is right.  We do need to make a decision.  We need to make a decision that we are either doing something about it or we are not.  With all due respect, I am all for greenways and recreation and people enjoying the fresh air.  I live in the countryside and I am all for that.  By far the more important thing, however, is that key assets and infrastructure that are required for future development are protected for that development and are immediately put into use.  We are talking here about a piece of infrastructure that can immediately be put into use that will protect existing investment in the west and will attract other investment.</p> <p>  I have spent most of my life working for large corporations and in the US, arguing for investment for Ireland.  I understand exactly why people invest and why they put things in places.  We do not have that much to sell when one goes north of the Galway-Dublin line.  The Deputy is right - we do need to make a decision.  The decision we need to make is whether we are going to fix this problem or not.  That guidance, whatever it is, should be given to the rail review people and they should be told that either we are going to use this as part of our economic backbone or we do not care about it, in which case they can do whatever they choose.  That is the decision that needs to be made.</p></speech>

It is exactly the decision that needs to be made.  Is Mr. Devane suggesting that in giving guidance to those carrying out the rail review, we should seek to pre-empt the outcome of the review and direct them to arrive at a particular conclusion?</p></speech>

If one does a rail review or any kind of review of assets and one considers whether there will be a return on a further investment on those assets, one has to start with the perspective one has with respect to its future use.  The future use of that rail line is entirely down to the economic guidance that is given by the State and the political system.</p><p>We are clearly saying that it needs to be used and that it is essential for the correction of the issues we are dealing with.  With all due respect to the Deputy, the question is back to the members and what they want us to do.  It is not about rigging or pre-empting any endpoint; it is about setting out a set of scenarios that one can plan with.  Those scenarios include the use of that infrastructure and those assets to create the economy that we need in those regions.</p></speech>

The Deputy quoted the T&aacute;naiste, who stated in 2014 that there would be no further investment in or extension of the heavy rail system.  We are extending the heavy rail system now.  That is gone.  We also have petrol at &euro;2 per litre.  In addition, we have to deal with climate change.  All of that is based in this building.  All decisions are made here, whether we like it or not.  This is public money, public infrastructure and public policy.  We have bolstered the reasons for reopening rail in recent years.  In the past number of weeks, they have only been bolstered again.  I put it to the committee that it must be opened.  The amount involved is &euro;150 million.  It would be a boon to connect Galway to its hinterland to the north by means of proper public transport infrastructure.</p></speech>

I agree wholeheartedly with everything the witnesses said.  I also agree that, ultimately, the decision will be made within these walls.  Every decision that is made within these walls is guided by a number of factors including the socioeconomic impact of whatever decision we make, be it negative or positive.  The return on investment ultimately to us, as taxpayers, is also a key element of the decision-making processes.  All that I, John Mulligan and the 25,000 others who have signed a petition asking for a greenway are asking is if there is an interim policy.  If there is not, that is wonderful.  If the rail review is published at the end of the year and states that &euro;150 million should be invested right now or over the next ten years, we would be delighted.  Then we would sit down with the Minister and whoever else to ask for a greenway to be developed alongside the line.  Reading every past rail review and the conclusions they arrived at, in particular the conclusions arrived at by the very people we would be seeking to invest, namely, the European Investment Bank and JASPERS, I cannot pragmatically or realistically see a conclusion being drawn that this is going to happen.  All we are asking is that, following the advice of the people who manage our national rail network every day of the week, we retain that key State asset in public ownership by means of the development of a greenway - rather than anything as significant as a rail line -  and bring significant economic benefit to places that have not seen it in a very long time.  That is the case I make.</p></speech>

JASPERS states in its project screening note: "... our note is not a critique of the EY report, but is instead a broad assessment of the maturity and feasibility of the project based on material that has been published to date."  When we consider the number of errors in the EY report, it did require a peer review.  JASPERS did not offer a peer review of the detail of that report.  Had they done so, they would have found that many of the points made by EY were totally inaccurate.  They gave the population of Tuam at 1,100 and they said that nobody, zero passengers, would transfer from their cars to a commuter train to Galway if such a commuter train was available.  These were the kinds of errors that led to dismay in the west of Ireland when the EY report was prepared.  This is why Dr. Bradley undertook his report.  He systematically demolished the arguments against the railway line.  He noted, as I have read out to the committee, what JASPERS actually said.  JASPERS did not do a comprehensive peer review of the EY report.  It did less than eight pages of commentary.  It was broad and general commentary.  It alluded to the fact that our current status in the European Union meant that Ireland would not have access to EU funding.  Even if we never had EU funding, which would be 30% of the &euro;150 million, &euro;150 million would not build three miles of motorway.</p> <p>  I put it back to the Deputy that I know where he is coming from with this.  I am prepared to accept the Deputy's bona fides that he is dying to see this railway being reopened, and if he is, I suggest that the Deputy goes to speak as loudly as he can for its reopening to his colleagues in Fine Gael and to his colleagues across the different parties here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We need urgent remedial action in the west of Ireland as our status is slipping.  The European Union is recognising that.  I am not convinced that greenways, however welcome they are, will provide us with the sinews of war to fight the battle for the future development of the west of Ireland.</p></speech>

As one who comes from the west of Ireland and having served as a Minister of State in the Department with Deputy Ring, while I would not say it is a conflict of interests, I must confess that Peter Feeney worked with me at one time when I was in the Chief Whip's office, and is a good friend and former colleague on the county council.</p> <p>  As a west of Ireland man I want to see the western rail corridor opens reopened.  I also want to see greenways rolled out across the country.  If, in order to achieve what Deputy Cannon wants and what many other people want, which is a greenway, we lost key critical infrastructure that is the western rail track, it would be a great shame.  To do that would be a retrograde step as it has been there for a period of time.  I accept that there is huge frustration.  I have met people who were supportive of reopening the line and a train running, but who have since said that nothing has been happening so let us build a greenway.  I accept that there has been debate and that it is realistic.  This is why I am disappointed we have not been able to make more progress during the period in Government with regard to reopening that key piece of infrastructure.  We have protected it and we have kept it there for future use.</p> <p>  Deputy Matthews made a point earlier around the development of key areas, and Mr. Feeney also acknowledged this, such as Oranmore, Athenry, Tuam and Claremorris, with the largest of those towns being Tuam.  The case for protecting the line and reopening it for rail is, in my view, made.  That is absolute.  If a service is provided, if it is reliable and if there is high-frequency capacity, it will be used.  We could develop those towns along the corridor with sufficient capacity.  We need houses for people to live in and we need economic development in the west of Ireland.</p> <p>  I disagree with Mr. Mulligan's point.  I am not sure if Deputy Cannon reaffirmed that or not.  If we built a greenway on the line and then suddenly changed our mind in the future, I do not believe that it would just be a case of taking it up.  There would be a huge campaign, and rightly so, by people who would say that they had fought for the greenway infrastructure and that they do not want it removed for rail.  I do not accept that point.  This is not to say that there could not be agreement somewhere else along the corridor, or elsewhere, but I just do not buy that argument.  I have seen this too often in relation to local campaigns that can get difficult.  There might not be questions in my contribution but there is a lot of commentary on what I believe is positive and possible for the west of Ireland in protecting that key line and its potential.  It is all the more pressing in the context of climate change, sustainable development and regional development.  I certainly hope that the Government does not just protect the line to look at it, but also protects the line to build it, and supports the development of a greenway alongside or appropriate to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm&aacute;n &Oacute; Raghallaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#O00800"><p>I thank Senator Kyne for that commentary.  I agree with everything he said.</p><p>I wish to underline that we have no difficulty with people building greenways.  The only issue we have with the greenway business is the idea that it must be built on a railway.  There is no sensible reason a railway has to be taken over just because it happens to be in public ownership.  County Mayo has been to the forefront of the development of greenways in this country.  I note that major greenways that have been successful are predominantly in areas of high scenic amenity.  Regarding the development of our towns, the county councils in Mayo and Galway are prioritising planning to make sure housing is developed as close as possible to the centre of towns, which means railway stations will be in an ideal position to take people from those places to wherever they want to go, for example, if they want to go to Galway or work in Tuam, where a large number of people from Claremorris work.  </p><p> What was said about the development of our towns bears out the thesis behind building a western rail corridor.  It is about connectivity or creating an economic corridor.  We support that.  We are not prepared to concede that the development of a railway should wait any longer.  It is down to the politicians to make the decision.  They cannot just close their ears to the situation in the west of Ireland.  Deputies from all parties understand the situation.  The EU has told us and we need to listen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#P00200"><p>All of the witnesses are in broad agreement about a number of issues, one of which is that, depending on the timetable and its scale, the railway corridor being reopened would be an asset to the west.  However, what is there at the moment is not a railway.  It is a strip of land that runs from Athenry to Kilclooney.  That is a State asset which belongs to all of us.  Mr. Devane rightly stated that one of the uses for that strip of land should be transmitting power.  We have been saying this for ten years.  We have also been saying that it should be used to transmit broadband because in the future, our exports will be sent not on trains but on fibre cable.  If we want to improve towns in the so-called black triangle, we need salaries, not necessarily freight trains rolling through them.  We need people working remotely and spending their money in those towns.</p> <p>  I do not know how I can get this point across.  Senator Kyne returned to it when he said that once a greenway is built on a rail alignment, that is the end of the railway.  That is the Boxcar Willie point - if the track is lifted, it is all over.  That is nonsense, however.  I have seen the licence agreement Irish Rail has with Waterford County Council regarding the Waterford greenway and it is watertight.  The main piece of that repayment is that the primary use of this asset is for future rail use.  I do not know how many ways that must be translated for that message to get across.</p> <p>  Deputy Cannon asked what if the rail review finds whatever it finds.  CI&Eacute; does not decide to build railways, I do not decide to build railways and Colm&aacute;n &Oacute; Raghallaigh does not decide to build railways.  The people who decide that are in this House and they have decided thus far not to build a railway on that route.  If they are not going to build a railway in the next five to ten years, they should put a temporary greenway on that alignment, preserve and protect it and milk it as an asset.  When and if there is reason to build a railway, build it and build a greenway alongside it.  That is a very simple concept.  A child could understand it, yet we have difficulty in getting that across to Members in this House - with honourable exceptions.  I do not know how many ways we must say that but this is an asset that belongs to us all.  Leverage it.  Do not leave it there for another 40 years.  Do not keep saying like we do with draining the Shannon, "Come back to me next time and we will do it".  We just want a decision to be made.  That is all we want.</p></speech>

I just do not believe the message.  I appreciate the interest Mr. Mulligan has and the volunteering role he plays and I accept his bona fides.  He mentioned the Waterford to Dungarvan greenway.  If there was an attempt to take up this greenway in the morning for a train, by Jesus, we would see a campaign.</p></speech>

That is the point.  If an attempt was made to take up that greenway for rail, no matter how good a case for a railway in that area might be presented in the future, there would be a huge campaign against it.  I do not buy the view that a greenway can be built on it and then removed.</p></speech>

That is essentially what we are saying here.  The people of Waterford, Dungarvan and Kilmacthomas have seen the incredible economic and social boost in addition to the quality of life boost, which we often forget.  This is not just about attracting investment or revitalising towns.  It is about delivering an exceptionally high quality of life to the people who live in those places.  What we are saying is that if we developed a greenway from Athenry to Claremorris and, ultimately, possibly to Enniskillen, and at some point in the future, a decision to reinstate a rail service was necessary, the people served by that asset would have no role to play in making that decision.

One is that we are very fortunate in having a working rail line.  The point I want to make about that picks up on what Deputy Matthews said, which is to sweat the asset.  We need to make the point that there has been investment but we have not seen any changes in service or speed levels for 32 years.  I think Mr. Stacpoole said it was 75 years.  My experience in the 32 years I have lived in County Clare going up and down that particular line is that it has got slower and slower and is not so good.  The point I wanted to make about sweating the asset is really important.  This includes some cross-committee work because it is the development of the towns, villages and communities along the line that will make it successful.  Improvements to the line in terms of service levels and speeds will contribute to that development.</p> <p>  We are discussing the all-Ireland rail review.  I presume the committee has looked at the Connecting Ireland process that is under way and will do so again.  My feeling is that maybe connecting Ireland is what we are about.  That is the whole thing.  This sort of silo mentality whereby this is rail, this is-----</p></speech>

It is not; it is an integrated model.  I have a question for West on Track.  Regarding the report by Dr. John Bradley in response to the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report, my understanding is that Dr. Bradley used the net present value model to assess the worth of building the railway.  Is that correct?  Over how many years did he do the net present value?</p></speech>

If you are looking at procurement of rolling stock, for instance, and I think the assumptions work here too, you assume a lifespan of 40 years but there is a diminishing return on investment, the older and more dilapidated the stock gets.</p> <p>  On the physical infrastructure, Mr. Stacpoole will be little bit closer to this one than me, but I would say it is usually in the period of around 30 to 40 years as well.  Mr. Stacpoole should feel free to correct me on that point.</p></speech>

What is the model that is being used at the moment that Mr. Stacpoole believes should be changed?  Is it a longer term model or does it take into account different factors?  We have umpteen reports on the western rail corridor.  We have the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report, the Bradley report and others.  I am very pro-rail.  I have taken the train service from Limerick to Dublin every week for many years.  Mr. Stacpoole will know this.  We had a public meeting on the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, plan for Limerick and the metropolitan area, and rail was not in it.  I want to see rail in it and I hope that will be adjusted.  I will come back to the issue of the Ballybrophy line but I am more interested in getting to the nub of the matter here.</p></speech>

In 2000, the Foynes line was mothballed and a decision was made not to maintain it.  At the time the then chief executive, and I worked with the port over a period, asked for the line to be maintained, as it would cost between &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000 just to keep it in a mothballed condition but where trains could still be run on it.  We are now at the point, for example, where we have been talking about reopening it for the best part of 20 years and it is obviously a key piece of infrastructure.  Depending on what standard it is reopened at, it will cost between &euro;25 million and &euro;45 million to do so.  If the line had been maintained and if we had a long-term view of what we want strategically to get out of our railway, the cost of reopening it would be considerably less.  This arises because we have not had a rail freight policy.  I believe Jim Meade has appeared in front of this committee and has said that rail freight has to widen its base.</p></speech>

When Mr. Stacpoole looks at this, is it a model that can work or does it hinder rail advancement or reinstatement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hassard Stacpoole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#Q00700"><p>The danger is it creates additional cost.  For example, the greenway to Youghal at the moment is being developed from Midleton to Youghal which is about 18 miles, and the figure being spent on that is &euro;15 million just to convert it to a greenway.  This will be done under licence from Irish Rail but the long-term aspiration is to restore the railway.  The potential problem is that if the case arises to reopen the railway, for example, you are going to have to remove that greenway, restore the railway, which will cost, for argument's sake, &euro;45 million to &euro;50 million to put even a basic rail infrastructure back, and then you potentially will have to buy land to relocate that greenway.  You are almost getting a cost and a half, and that is the danger.</p> <p>  That is why Irish Rail have said in Limerick, as the Chairman will know well, that the Foynes route is a key corridor, and while I tried many years ago, as a teenage boy, to get the railway on which the Great Southern Trail greenway is located retained, and while the right use for it now is actually as a greenway and it is a great success for west Limerick, the proposed extension of the greenway back into Limerick city will not be on the railway line because it is recognised that the line is needed.  We have to be realistic here.  Senator Kyne referred to the Waterford Greenway which is a fantastic asset.  I have been on it myself and there is a short little heritage railway on part of it.  Realistically, it is probably not going to be restored as a railway line.  The same can be said about the railway line to New Ross that has just been handed over by licence.  It is probably not going to be reopened.</p> <p>  There is certainly a case for a freight railway from Athenry to Tuam and on to Claremorris.  Part of the problem, which is always ignored, is that the policy until now, or to about a year or two ago since this Government came to power, has been that rail freight does not have a future.  It was alluded to earlier that we are hitting &euro;2 a litre for fuel.  It is going to go up in price and rail freight will become more attractive.</p> <p>  Every week a ship leaves Foynes loaded full of timber from around Tuam that is brought by road down to Limerick city to be put on a ship from Foynes and Limerick city for export.  Some of it actually goes on to Waterford by ship, to go to the Coillte factory there.</p> <p>  Coming back to overall infrastructure and looking at the reopening of railways, Scotland is a very good model to look at to see what has happened there with reopening railways.  The case is looked at over a 30-year model, and the business case is not just confined to passengers.  Network Rail is working with Transport Scotland to open the Levenmouth line, which is just north of Edinburgh, and this project is happening.  It is looked at in the long term.  In Ireland, unfortunately, we look at this in the short term in terms of planning.</p></speech>

Is there sufficient land along the length of the line to allow a greenway to be put alongside the existing track and, at no additional cost, for the railway line to be left intact?  Mr. Stacpoole will know there is a certain village in County Limerick where houses have been built on the old railway line.  This is well known.  Things happen.  They should not, but they do.  I take Mr. Mulligan&rsquo;s point that the contracts are a great deal tighter now, but that rail line can never be got back.  It goes through a very historic village in County Limerick.  Everyone wants the greenway and the rail track, but on a practical level, is it possible within the existing dimensions?  I know and Mr. Lightfoot will know from Limerick that in terms of sweating the assets, as it were, and while I would have an issue with someone nifty who knows, looks at and makes optimum use of existing assets, there was sufficient room to lay a double rail line from Limerick Junction to Limerick city and that is what should have been done.  Is it possible at this point for a practical compromise to be reached for the line in question, which is to put a greenway alongside the existing rail line, allow the rail line itself to remain, and when the greenway is being completed, for some works to be done where possible to make the route available for a second rail line or whatever?  Can that be done?</p></speech>

There are certainly places where a greenway could be very comfortably at a safe distance from the actual railway track.  This would be decided upon by the railway safety people.  There would be other places where it would be necessary for county councils to acquire small sections from farmers, which would be marginal land.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, there is a stand-off here.  Everyone wants the railway, but more people want the greenways.  The railway could be seen as a very cost-efficient way to get a greenway in place.  However, it may have implications.  It makes absolute sense to have greenways along existing rail lines and motorways.  That is the way it should be.  I am posing the question to find if there is a way through to suit everyone.  I will not even use the word compromise.  Outside of the costs, is it possible to have a greenway along the existing rail line, and also to preserve the rail line?</p></speech>

At the inaugural meeting of the Sligo Greenway Co-op, its chairman, Mr. Pat McCarrick, said we should go for a greenway, that if we get a railway in ten years' time, that will be great, but let us go for what we can do now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#R03900"><p>Irish Rail has set itself very high standards so the cost per crossing is roughly &euro;1 million.  It could do it cheaper if the standards were reduced, in particular on the more minor roads.  They are designed in such a way that every automatic level crossing has four barriers, but on a minor road or little boreen, the Commission for Railway Regulation, CRR, which regulates this, could change the standards slightly and it could be done for less.  To do that alone, we are talking about a budget of about &euro;11 million, but that would save roughly &euro;1 million a year in operating costs, so over the lifetime of the capital costs the company would get the cost back and the operating costs would be reduced.  That is a key point.  As we said to Deputy Lowry, we would like to see a programme to abolish farmers' crossings.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulligan said it is far more expensive to provide a greenway beside the existing track.  Would it reduce the cost if a greenway was to be provided now, using the existing track as a temporary measure, but not in such a way as to prevent the rail line being upgraded, and as soon as that were to happen the greenway would move from point A to point B?</p></speech>

Claremorris to Collooney was built as a light rail.  According to the Minister in recent days, it is not even on the cards at the moment.  What they are really looking at is Athenry to Claremorris, which is what they should be looking at.  It is our view that if a greenway is to happen in the next five to ten years, it should be built alongside the line where there is room to do so.  Where there is not room, there is a small cost because the edge of somebody's land needs to be taken as the greenway is not going down through the middle.  The way to deal with the rest of it, the bit from Claremorris to Collooney, is through route preservation.  Realistically, that is not going to happen today or tomorrow, but it can be preserved by putting the greenway right down the middle of the track bed.  I do not think any Deputy in this House should be concerned about a contract in Irish law not standing up.  This is the House that makes the law.</p></speech>

What is its basic objection to the proposal from Mr. Mulligan?</p></speech>

The model used in the Bradley report was 35 years.  We have no objection to the building of a greenway north from Claremorris or Athenry to Collooney and into Donegal or anywhere else.</p><p>What we are worried about is the issue Senator Kyne mentioned.  We have to put in state-of-the-art greenways because talking about temporary greenways is ridiculous.  If we are going to spend money putting in a greenway, it has to be a proper greenway.  It has to be properly appointed and up to the highest standard, as if it will be there in perpetuity.  The problem is that, if it is built on the rail track and at some point it is decided that a section of that railway, whether north or south of Claremorris, will be reopened, all that investment comes to naught.  The railway would have to be put back and a greenway built again.  What Mr. Mulligan said about having both would be a lot more sensible.  While there would be additional cost in the beginning, it would save a lot of grief and angst, as well as campaigning and fighting-----</p></speech>

We should be running greenways as well.  How can that be done, technically?  How much would it cost for everyone to coexist?</p></speech>

Reference was made to the situation between Mullingar and Athlone.  Unfortunately, in that situation, the rail track was left in place but the greenway was built into the side of the alignment.  The actual greenway is right beside the rail track so the rail track is useless.  A train could not run on that because the greenway is built into the side of it.  What should have been done, and there was plenty of room to do it, was build the greenway several metres to one side of the track and put a fence there.  That way, the rail track could be used if and when Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann wanted it.  I believe that is a strategic route that should be brought back into use in time.  If there is goodwill and if county councils are prepared to be imaginative, greenways can be provided without any difficulty.  However, giving up the rail track runs the risk that you will not get it back, irrespective of what is signed with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann or anyone else.</p></speech>

We should all be doing this together.  We are running a national greenway from Dublin to Galway and the route selection for Athlone to Galway is coming towards the end of its tether.  The ambition for north Galway - Tuam, Athenry and so on - is to get a connection to the national greenway so it becomes relevant in the overall greenway strategy.</p> <p>  We also need to do the same with the rail network.  As someone living in Tuam, I want to see it on the national rail network.  There are obvious reasons for that.  I also want Foynes opened up and rail going out there.  I want an island where we can use all that potential to create regional development.  We should not even be having this discussion.  There are plenty of ways of delivering greenways, including complementary to a railway track, wherever that is.  I was delighted to hear Mr. Mulligan say we should be delivering these things in tandem.  We should all be working together.  Our common purposes should be to deliver the infrastructure that is required in this region and all the other regions.  There has been a debate for a number of years about a railway or greenway from Claremorris to Athenry.  It is not something we should even be talking about.  We should be discussing how to connect the region to the national rail network and the national greenway network.  That is simply the way we should be doing it.  I welcome the Chairman's statement that he sees how it can be done.  We can do it in tandem and not spend money now that we will have to throw out in five or ten years if another decision is made.</p> <p>  Last Monday, I heard the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine talking about getting farmers to grow barley, oats and wheat.  Some 20 or 30 years ago, we threw out the sugar beet industry and got rid of all the tillage in the region.  Now we are trying to reinvent it.  The ploughs and harrows that tilled that land have been rotting in ditches the last 30 years.  We do not want the same thing to happen again by making decisions at a high level that do not take into account what the future might hold for us.</p> <p>  I am very taken by the approach today.  I thank the Chairman for the time and I welcome everyone who has contributed.  I am sorry I was not here for the whole meeting.  We have to take a common-sense approach to all of this.  We have to spend less time trying to outdo one another and more time putting things together so we can create all of what we need and are entitled to in the region.  The west of Ireland has been designated by the European Union as being in transition, meaning we are not investing enough money or infrastructure in this region.  We have an opportunity to do this, and to do it together.  I hope today is a watershed moment for working together rather than trying to outdo one another.</p></speech>

At the end of this year, another rail review report will be presented to us.  Either we trust in that process of deliberation, undertaken by people we all agree are experts in the area of rail and structured development, or we do not.  They will arrive at firm conclusions, one hopes, about how we sweat the asset, to use a phrase that has been said repeatedly.  We then need to make decisions.  We do not need to be sitting around this table in ten years determining what happens to the western rail corridor and how to serve the towns and villages it passes through.  It is incumbent on each and every one of us to take responsibility for that and not push it down the road for yet another rail review.  We need to make a decision, by the end of 2023 at the latest, as to how exactly to use this asset for the benefit of the people who live along the route, and for the wider region of the west of Ireland.  Indecision and kicking the can down the road are not acceptable and it will be shameful if that happens again.</p></speech>

That is particularly true with respect to utilities because we have a significant grid problem north of the Galway-Dublin line.  Communications is the other issue.  From a civil works point of view, if that were added to the mix, that investment would allow for a greenway to be built at very little cost, because all the infrastructure work would have to be done as well and other utilities and points of utility would be built onto the railway network, which would add to its significance and value.  It is very important when doing the rail network that we create these scenarios.  To go back to what I said earlier, we need some economic guidance here.  We need to be talking about where we are going with this and what must be serviced in the medium term, that is, the next ten to 20 years, and what we are looking at in the long term.  There are a lot of opportunities to create something here.  I thank the committee for its time.  We appreciate it.</p></speech>

There is a principle that investing in a road of two or three lanes creates induced demand and the road fills up, which is not good for our road system.  However, that is exactly what we want in a public transport system.  We have seen it with the likes of the western rail corridor.  When it started off the figures were low but it is a successful railway.  Linking that western corridor phase 2 would also be successful.  We saw it in Dublin city when we linked Heuston Station to Connolly Station and that filled up.  When you build it, they will come.  The exact principle should apply to our public transport that we do not want for our road system.</p><p>We need to have a conversation about roads.  One can have an entire political career in regard to the build of a road but not a railway because it is slower and it does not impact as many people as tangibly as a road.  Bringing a road to one's community is a sign that the community has not been left behind.  That takes longer in regard to rail.  The price tags on many of our roads are massive.  One has to question the benefit of the investment in those roads in terms of sustainable transport, air quality and climate emissions.  If we were to flip that investment and put it into railway we would be creating a 100-year asset that would never need to be widened and on which the frequency and the capacity can be increased with small modifications.  That would serve communities sustainably.  They are the political decisions that need to be made.</p><p> I have heard much discussion today about political decisions.  The decision is whether to concentrate on public transport or on roads.  I am not against roads.  They are important.  It is important we maintain our road systems and build the bypasses, where necessary, but we have to look at the massive price tags on those huge road projects listed in the in the TII brochure.  In terms of cost, we could do every one of its rail projects, including the western rail corridor, the Tipperary branch, the Wexford to Waterford branch and the freight system if we were to remove some of those road projects from the list.  They are the political decisions that need to be made.  </p><p> Do we make that investment in public transport over new roads?  It is currently 2:1.  Do we go to 3:1?  That is a political question.</p></speech>

The stakes in regard to this are very high for the west and the mid-west.  There has been no discussion on the Shannon Foynes Port but Mr. Stacpoole has articulated the rail issue very well.  The action plan will, it is hoped, take care of all of this.  When it is published in a month or so, we will have a discussion on it.  I want to return to a point made earlier.  I take Mr. Devane's point that there is an asset there and in regard to the timeframe in terms of looking at it down the road.  There are other factors.  I spoke about the greenway, but there is also the transfer of power and so forth.  The review is being done by the Department of Transport.  This committee will make a submission to that review based on our public hearings.  There is a particular question I want to get to the nub of.  Various reports, including the EY report and others, have stated that financially it cannot be justified.  In terms of the Bradley report, why was its analysis different?   Was it to do with the terms of reference or the financial analysis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm&aacute;n &Oacute; Raghallaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#T00300"><p>I will comment initially.  The Bradley report looked at the actual cost of building the railway.  It considered that the EY costings were exorbitant.  The Chairman may recall that two weeks ago, the chief executive of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann confirmed to this committee that the cost of rebuilding a mile of existing railway would be &euro;1.5 million or &euro;1.75 million.  Obviously, the cost of signalling and so on would be in addition to that.  Taking a round figure of &euro;2 million or &euro;2.5 million for the 35 miles from Athenry to Claremorris, you would not come in at &euro;260 million, as EY did.  The EY report factored in new rolling stock, which is not necessary because Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will have an enormous amount of cascaded rolling stock once the new trains come on stream next year.  That was an unnecessary cost.  There are various other things in the report which, when analysed, showed that the costings were exorbitant.  When one does a cost-benefit analysis, one has to examine issues like whether one is going to get value for money and how much money will have to be spent.  Dr. Bradley put forward the answer, which was checked with people who are involved in railways both in this country and in Britain, that it can be built for &euro;154 million.  As I said previously, that is the cost of approximately three or four miles of motorway.  That is a differential of well over &euro;100 million.</p></speech>

I have a question for Mr. Mulligan in regard to the greenway.  Rail is hugely important in terms of that national link-up.  Why is Mr. Mulligan so passionate about the railway being turned into a greenway?</p></speech>

I am asking the committee to take a pragmatic view.  I am trying to put a timescale on all of this.  Realistically, if a railway is reinstated on that land it will be from Athenry to Tuam, and Tuam to Claremorris in the medium term.  The section from Claremorris north towards Collooney and Sligo is way down the road.  Anybody who is honest about it will say it is way down the road in terms of build.  The cheapest way of utilising existing funding is to build on the track.  If the Government decides that it wants to build it alongside, that is fine, but it is an awful waste of money.  The payback for doing it the cheap way is five years.  It is 15 years for doing it the more expensive way.  The Government is limiting its options.</p></speech>

We have never been against the idea of building that railway.  We are asking for recognition of the realities.  Thus far, we have been correct in that the reports have found against the railway.  To be fair, the Bradley report was commissioned by a rail lobby group.  If Cadbury's commissioned on a report on whether sweets are good for people, one would expect it to say that they are.  Somewhere between the two lies the real cost.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.1227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hassard Stacpoole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022030800002#T01100"><p>It would depend on the standard to which it was to be restored.  The cost to the port is floated to be between &euro;30 million and &euro;45 million.  If it is to be used as a passenger capable railway as far as Adare, railway stations would be required.  Even though they would be relatively simple stations, on the basis of the unit cost to which Irish Rail works the cost per station would be approximately &euro;4.5 million.  The final cost would depend on the number of stations put in.  As a freight-only railway, as alluded to by Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh, the cost would be approximately &euro;1.5 million per mile multiplied by 26, which would leave little change from &euro;45 million.</p></speech>

If the Ballybrophy line is extended, obviously that would mean extra commuter services for Castleconnell, Birdhill and perhaps Annacotty.  As a commuter line, what could it do?</p></speech>

First, if the timetable is correct and there is a stop, in particular at Annacotty, it would serve UL and the industrial estate there.  It can be used as a stop on the line which can connect to buses going into the city.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending and for being so forthright in their views.  I never have an issue if views are held passionately.  People today have expressed firm views.  Deputy Cannon is correct that decisions will have to be made but, equally, it is impossible to make decisions unless people debate them and do the work on them.</p></speech>
