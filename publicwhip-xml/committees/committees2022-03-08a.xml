    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#A00200"><p>I have received apologies from Deputy Alan Farrell and Senators McGahon and Dooley.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss accelerating offshore wind, including fixed and floating offshore wind generation.  We will discuss the east coast and we are also very interested in the larger opportunity off the south and west coasts.  We will discuss supply chain and logistical challenges.  There is also the issue of green hydrogen and development of a green hydrogen economy.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Peter Coyle, chairman of the Marine Renewables Industry Association, MRIA.  I thank him for coming before the committee to discuss this very important topic.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read out the note on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction I give.  For witnesses attending from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present on the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind Members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In that regard, I ask all Members joining us online to confirm, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  I can see a number of members joining us online from their offices.</p> <p>  This part of our meeting will conclude at 11 a.m.  I invite Mr. Coyle to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#A00300"><p>I am delighted to be here this morning.  Presumably the clerk circulated a statement from me.  I am not going to read it out to the members; they would die of boredom at my droning voice.  I will just pick out the highlights.  The Marine Renewables Industry Association represents people across the island engaged in offshore renewable energy, including ten wind developers.  We have lawyers, researchers, manufacturers and so on as well.</p> <p>  To provide some context, there are two historic moments.  The first is 22 July 1929, the day the Ardnacrusha scheme opened in County Clare.  It was an extraordinary step forward for the new State and underpinned the economic development of the State in many respects for the following 50 years or so.  It was built with a capacity of 86 MW, which would be enough to light up Dundalk and Drogheda on a nice day in today's terms, but which exceeded national demand for electricity at the time.  In the early 1930s, we saw the start of the industrialisation policy, which took place during the Great Depression behind tariff barriers, quotas and so forth.  Ardnacrusha underpinned that policy and our economic life, such as it was, throughout the 1940s and 1950s.  It helped to create a body of managerial expertise and industrial skills that enabled us to go on to the next stage of development in the early 1970s when we joined the EU.</p> <p>  The second historic moment was 23 December last with the passage into law of the Maritime Area Planning Bill.  It is a monumental body of work and a great tribute to the legislators, policymakers, lawyers and those in industry who contributed to its creation.  Just two years ago, we really had nothing on the Statute Book or in policy in respect of any form of development at sea.  We were dealing with the Foreshore Act of 1933.  In practice, if one looks back at the Oireachtas debates of the time, it was all about dealing with fishing rights around large estates.  In the past two years, Ireland has put together a tapestry of legislation and policy which enables us to develop our offshore renewables, among other things.</p> <p>  Why should we develop our offshore renewable energy?  It is an extraordinary resource; we have Europe's most bountiful and available winds and the most bountiful waves in the world also.  Wave technology will come on stream in the 2030s.  The first reason to develop it is our enormous energy insecurity.  We are rated by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, as the fourth most insecure country in Europe.</p><p>We have had a very calm couple of years, which has meant the lights have been kept on most of the time.  More than half the load has been borne by the coal plant in Moneypoint in County Clare and by gas.  That coal comes from Russia and, to be blunt about it, there are not that many alternative sources of coal any more.  Currently, the contract is with Russia and Moneypoint continues to be absolutely critical to keeping the lights on.  The other big contributor has been gas, with half of our gas being imported, some of it from Russia.  By 2030, according to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, 90% of our gas will be imported.  We will be in an abject position by then unless we deal with our renewable resource.  That is before we even get to issues like EU targets and all the rest of it.</p><p> The immediate and most obvious challenge for our industry is to put in place the minimum of 5 GW of offshore energy that is called for by Government policy.  To put that in perspective, we have less than 5 GW of wind and everything else, including bits and pieces of solar energy and so on, on land at this time.  It is an enormous task and eight years is like two and a half weeks in energy terms.  These projects take a long time to plan, get permission, be built and all the rest of it.  The big challenge for us and for everyone else is to get that up and running.  For the Government, it is a question of getting the new machine in order, including the legislation, all of the policies and the new maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, which is due to open in Wexford in the first quarter of 2023 and will, we hope, be a great new addition to public life.  The next call in this area for the Houses of the Oireachtas will be marine protected areas.  That legislation is somewhere in the works and will be critically important to finding a way of having a harmonious and constructive relationship between the exploitation of our offshore resources and the preservation of our offshore environment.</p><p> As I am conscious of running out of time, I will briefly mention four strategic issues.  First, it is vital that our coastal communities are engaged in all of this.  There is provision to safeguard their interests under the new Maritime Area Planning Act.  There are community benefits that will, for many years, bestow millions of euro per annum on relatively small communities for community projects.  Nonetheless, we need to do more to ensure they are involved in, understand and are engaged with planning the offshore future of their communities.  There is a model of coastal partnerships in the UK that is working well.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has talked about setting up experimental partnerships here, possibly in Wexford and Donegal.  I certainly urge the Oireachtas to support the Department in this and prompt it to do so as quickly as possible.</p><p> Second, we now have a vibrant offshore renewable energy policy, which is first-class and on which a lot of work continues to be done in refining and developing it.  It is not yet matched, however, on the part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which needs to develop a very high level of determination to build a global supply chain in this area.  This will not happen between now and 2030 in the case of the stuff that is primarily going into the water, namely, bottom-fixed wind, principally on the Irish Sea, because that is ubiquitous technology and the home of most of the enormous jobs and income that were created as a consequence of that technology is Denmark, which has some 23,000 people employed in this area.  That is done and dusted in many respects.  We will, of course, have installation jobs and operations and maintenance jobs but most of our resource in the Celtic Sea and off the west coast will have to be exploited by floating wind and by wave.  There are no established players, nationally or internationally, in that field at the present time.  As a consequence, there is an enormous opportunity there.  The Department needs to get involved and engaged and must drive its renowned agencies, namely, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in which I had the privilege of serving for many years, to develop a policy to exploit that opportunity.</p><p> Third, we need to find a way in, in all our forthcoming provisions for offshore renewable energy, for floating offshore wind.  One of the reasons this is necessary is the industrial opportunity it presents in terms of the jobs and incomes that could be created for communities to which it traditionally has been difficult to attract investment, such as Arklow, Wicklow, Wexford and Bantry.  I spent much of my life trying to attract investment to those towns and, for reasons that somewhat escaped me, it never really happened.  It really could happen now if we get our act together.  It must be done not only for industrial purposes but also for the purpose of ensuring our offshore resource is properly exploited.  We need to find a way into our various support schemes for floating offshore wind.</p><p> Fourth, we need our legislative leaders to be at the forefront in this effort, alongside industry and officials, who are playing a blinder in this whole area and really are doing an extraordinary job in the difficult circumstances the Covid crisis has imposed on us.  We need members of this committee involved in explaining and communicating the changes that are going to come offshore for our coastal communities.  These changes will include, for example, the issue of port capacity.  We do not have the port capacity nor does anywhere else nearby really have that capacity because they have ambitions of their own, including in Wales, the south west of England, the west of France and the north of Spain.  We do not have the port capacity to work at scale in this area.  We will get by with what we have, plus some investments that are in the pipeline, particularly in Cork, to get to the 5 GW target, but the 30 GW target, which is the Government's aspiration for the 2030s, and the great dreams we have of developing offshore green hydrogen plants and so on can only be realised if we invest in ports.</p><p> Finally, I want to give the committee an example of the vision that is now surrounding this industry and which we need to continue on from the work that is being done on the Maritime Area Planning Act and other policy instruments.  The Danish coalition Government decided in June last year or the previous year to invest half of the &euro;35 billion required to build a new island 80 miles west of Jutland in the North Sea.  It is a true island that will have a harbour, people living there and a huge substation that will help to ensure an efficient distribution of electricity from the wind farms in the middle of the North Sea to surrounding countries.  We need that kind of vision and imagination for Ireland for the 2030s.  We could not only be self-sufficient in energy from our own offshore resources but we also could export electricity through interconnectors and have many beneficial developments such as islands out in the Atlantic and off the Celtic Sea.  The consequences in terms of income and job creation in this very labour-intensive industry are extraordinary.  I commend offshore renewable energy to the committee and apologise for talking for so long.</p></speech>

I am very happy that he framed it around Ardnacrusha and the really brave gamble the State took 100 years ago, a gamble that ultimately paid off.  It was a serious vision and a huge step for the State to take.  We are at a similar point now, when we can take steps as big as that.  I know Ardnacrusha very well as it is only up the river from my home city of Limerick.  I used to row up the tail race right up to Ardnacrusha.  I know it intimately and my grand-uncle worked on its construction.  Mr. Coyle is right to frame the challenge we now have around the success and achievement we had 100 years ago.</p><p>Speaking to that bigger challenge we now face, I am very mindful of the conflict happening on the other side of Europe.  When we set out these sessions, we were very much thinking of the climate crisis but now, of course, we have a security emergency and energy crisis as well.  It is timely if not coincidental that we are having these sessions now.  They are very relevant to the discussion that is happening across Europe at the moment.  There was a very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning by Dr. Hannah Daly, Dr. Paul Deane, Dr. Diarmuid Torney and others in which they talk about Ireland not only providing its own energy needs from its offshore resource but also contributing significantly to Europe's needs.  That is the vision we must have and it is one we can achieve.  Depending on who one talks to, there is a possibility of harnessing something like 50 GW to 70 GW, maybe more if we take into account the wave resource.  I am interested in Mr. Coyle's thoughts on wave energy.  I ask that he elaborate on the bigger vision and the industry's view on how that can be accelerated and expedited, accepting that the 5 GW target is a huge challenge as it is.</p><p> Officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are going to appear before us in the next hour.  This is an opportunity for Mr. Coyle to tell us what we should relay to them if we are to pursue and achieve that bigger vision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#C00200"><p>Far be it from me to criticise the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as I effectively worked for it for 35 years, but I will take the last issue first.  To some extent, we are a victim of the siloed aspect of Irish government, in that Departments are tribes in their own right.  To put it crudely, they are interested in their own territories and are not very interested in other people's territories.  This reflects the fact, which is an issue for another day, that there has been no fundamental examination of the public service since 1969 with the Devlin report.  It must be the only institution in the world that has not been examined in more than 50 years.</p> <p>  Some of the mechanisms that are being put in place behind the scenes, which to non-bureaucrats appear to be unwieldy and bureaucratic, are designed to get over that silo effect and improve communications.  There is no ill will between these people.  It is just that this matter does not feature as much on that Department's radar as it does on that of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I do not mean this to appear critical, but the latter has sucked in a great deal of the talent in the public service in recent times because of this very important issue, which is extraordinarily complex to address.</p> <p>  We have the two most renowned agencies in the development agency world in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  I have worked for both of them, so I am biased, but they are world renowned and the best in the business.  If they are given a political direction and a Civil Service direction to go big and have ambitions in this area, they can achieve great things.  They will not be able to do anything in the short term about bottom-fixed offshore wind energy, though, because it is an established industry.  It did not exist 22 years ago.  The first offshore wind farm was built in Denmark in 2000.  The second in the world was Arklow with its little 25 MW, which opened in 2004.  We did not take up that opportunity, though.  I am one of those who was responsible for not taking it up because, unusually and uncharacteristically, we in the IDA scoffed at offshore wind energy in the 1980s and, in particular, 1990s.</p> <p>  There are some excellent pioneers in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland working on this area, but I do not believe that the organisations have been given a vision or a demanding goal of making Ireland a global player in the provision of parts, services and so forth &ndash; it does not have to be full-scale rigs &ndash; in floating wind energy and wave energy going forward.</p> <p>  I will speak to a point that the Chairman did not mention, although he used the word in a different context, that being, security.  As an industry, we made strong representations to the Commission on the Defence Forces.  They are published on our website as well as the commission's.  Our offshore world has changed and we are going to become dependent on it for our domestic security and exports.  We need proper security provision.  The commission recommended the drawing up of a maritime security plan.  We back that and want to be involved in it.  There is ample scope for bad actors, not so much to damage particular turbines, given that we can remove and replace them, but to damage the big wire that goes ashore and the substation that pulls all of the wires together and steps up or steps down &ndash; I can never remember which it is &ndash; the voltage.  A substation is as complex as an oil rig.  It takes years to build and is not bought out of a box.  In many instances, a substation costs hundreds of millions of euro.  The cable that runs from the substation to the shore is extraordinarily expensive.  There are back orders of approximately two years, it is complex to lay, etc.  The Naval Service would not necessarily need to be significantly involved, but it needs to be given a clear mandate to make it responsible for pulling together the maritime security plan whenever that is drawn up, which I hope it will be urgently, and dealing with any contingency that might arise as regards the substations and the cables going ashore.  This needs to be done urgently because we will have 5 GW in the sea in eight years' time.</p></speech>

Let us speak about Ireland's energy security opportunity to go big and go faster.  Is there an industry perspective?</p></speech>

We have major facilities that were bought with money that was scraped up from all over the place and built in 2015 during the height of the recession for &euro;15 million or &euro;20 million in Cork.  They provide us with world-class test facilities for devices and help ports to test out their new facilities and arrangements.  They are probably the leading facilities in Europe.  We have expertise in underwater unmanned vehicles in Limerick.  There is expertise in Galway and Maynooth and considerable expertise in Belfast.  I happen to be fortunate enough to chair the Bryden Centre in Queen's University Belfast.  The centre is a leading light, particularly on the wave energy side.  There are facilities at Strangford Lough.  We have a major intellectual advantage.  We have many people who are good in this area, we have many facilities, we have resources and we have an opportunity.  There is a great deal happening, but we need to pull it all together and match it with a large industrial development opportunity.  There are indications that, if we can get beyond the installation, operations and maintenance and into the manufacturing and services area, there are significant job creation opportunities, particularly in terms of floating wind and wave energy.  We have a large wave energy opportunity as well.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  The wind energy industry frequently raises with me its concerns about grid connectivity and grid capacity.  Does Mr. Coyle have concerns about our ambition, planning and progress in terms of developing our grid?  Does he believe that we will have the grid infrastructure we require when we need it in order to fulfil our renewable energy potential?</p> <p>  Mr. Coyle mentioned marine protected areas and how it is important to get the balance right between preserving and enhancing our environment while promoting harmony with other stakeholders.  Given that the planning legislation is progressing much more quickly than the legislation on marine protected areas, are there challenges in getting the balance right if marine protected area legislation is not in place?  How will the industry ensure that the goal of protecting and enhancing the environment is undertaken at the appropriate time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#C00700"><p>I will take the latter question first.  As I understand the matter, there is marine protected area, MPA, legislation in the works.  I do not know what it contains, but bear in mind that there is an extraordinary ambition as regards marine protected areas.  At the moment, 2.5%, or a little less, of our huge maritime area is designated as an MPA in one fashion or another.  The ambition is to increase that to 10% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.  This is a huge issue.</p> <p>  There is a great deal of expertise and experience in this area.  Generally speaking, the relationships between this industry and the various experts in the field, such as the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, BirdWatch Ireland and others, are good and open.  They are experts and bearers of a great deal of scientific knowledge in this field.  As long as we talk to one another and there are reasonable structures, legislation and so on in place on both sides of the picture, we will find ways and means of getting along.  There will be individuals who object, of course.</p><p>There will be concerns in various areas but generally speaking, the MPA bodies, the NGOs and experts in this field, are positive and constructive and are trying to find solutions as we are.  There is good experience.  Let me give one instance.  At our annual forum, which is a big get-together, held a couple of weeks ago we looked at scientific research in Scotland, which was looking at what happens to seals.  The research was monitoring seals in an area in the Pentland Firth in the north of Scotland with underwater blades rotating under a tidal machine.  We do not have a tidal resource in the Republic; there is one in Northern Ireland.  There were no instances of collision between a seal and this underwater blade.  Similar experiences are being shown in regard to birds for example with offshore wind farms.  We are optimistic that wildlife has some sort of learning capability to stay away although there is still a road to be covered.</p><p> On the issue of grid, everything in this area is happening at warp speed by the standards of an extremely capital intensive and technically complex industry.  I am not an engineer but it is truly complex stuff.  Putting new grid in place takes time.  We believe there is more grid available than the 5 GW available to the offshore industry identified by EirGrid.  In various submissions we and other organisations advocate a fresh look at that situation.  In the longer term, grid is one of the most challenging areas for us to exploit our resource.  There are many ways forward in the 2030s, called non-grid off-takes, where you do not need grid.  You do not necessarily need grid to make hydrogen to, for example, make ammonia.  You could actually have a hydrogen plant offshore alongside a wind farm and just pump the hydrogen ashore.  Overall we need much more grid.  We are fortunate in having an excellent and responsive body in EirGrid.  While we of course have our rows and arguments with EirGrid, it is a terrific body by and large.  We are optimistic that we can find solutions but it is a challenge.  </p></speech>

People are perhaps slow learners, catching up with him in his vision for this sector.  Given his experience in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to what extent is this concept on their agenda?  He talks of a political direction but from my relatively long experience in that Department, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are regarded as the most professional and well-informed in identifying sectors where Ireland can become very competitive in the long term.  Political decisions did not lead to electronics, biopharma or some of these major sectors.  To what extent have the IDA and Enterprise Ireland developed their internal familiarity and thinking about the sector in order that they could sustain the case that this is not only a key opportunity in energy terms but also in industrial policy terms?</p> <p>  In regard to the national development plan, NDP, as recently revised, which represents &euro;140 billion investment over six or seven years, in Mr. Coyle's view, how would that need to change?  There is intense competition for resources between the climate challenge, retrofit and all the other issues, as well as the existing ambitions on the wind and offshore front, compared with education and hospitals.  On this issue of making room in the investment programme, in his view how much more room needs to be found to do the sort of things he has identified?  The Danes have done these things by state-led investment.  At what point does he see a floating wind segment in an auction?  The State is right to proceed by way of auction in order that every technology gets a chance to compete.  However it recognises that some sectors need a lead time.  While segmented pieces for floating wind is an acceptable proposal, how soon does he think that ought to be considered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Coyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022030800002#D00300"><p>To answer the last question first, there will be an auction of support because bottom-fixed wind even cannot compete with traditional forms of energy generation.  It is normal to provide support, which ultimately is paid for by the consumer through the public service obligation.  There will be one auction of support next year which will deal with the initial batch of projects which will be bottom fixed in the Irish Sea.  Floating offshore wind will not feature in that.  There will be a second auction, probably around 2025, and that conceivably is the last auction that will be held that can actually bring projects on board before 2030 which is vital.  Our view is that floating has to be incorporated in that second option.  Floating is vital to achieving the 5 GW target.  Much of the available grid for example is off the Dublin and Wicklow coasts.  It will be challenging to concentrate so much development there.  Another driver in this is the EU state aids approval, which only extends until the end of 2025.  Floating has to be involved in the second offshore renewable energy support scheme auction, ORESS 2, or it will not feature until well into the 2030s and we will not achieve our 5 GW by the 2030 target.</p> <p>  In regard to the question on the NDP, I am not particularly an expert on the NDP.  I would suggest that we have gone off the boil in regard to providing support for early stage developers in wave and tidal, in the new technologies generally.  There currently is not an appropriate grant scheme to help them along.  It is worth bearing in mind that of the 250 or so small companies in wave and tidal in the world, more than half are in Europe.  More than half the patents are held in Europe.  The European Commission has now set a target of 100 MW to be wave and tidal by 2025 and 1 GW, which is huge in terms of a new technology, by 2030.  We need to put money into supporting small Irish companies.  There are some excellent small Irish companies in existence.  A modest modification in respect of the NDP in that regard is called for, as is anything that can be done to gear up grid for domestic purposes.  We have to bear in mind the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications forecast for an increase in local electricity demand of 50% by 2030.  We have a huge growth envisaged in our domestic market but there are also opportunities for export and such things as hydrogen creation.  </p> <p>  In regard to how the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are gearing up, I am more familiar in recent years with Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has some excellent people now working on this, who have been working away for years.  It has a new department that will involve this area but I do not think it is where it ought to be.  I suspect the IDA is not either.  What is missing is a conviction being communicated to those agencies by their political leaders - I am not particularly talking about the T&aacute;naiste, I am not tying this into personalities - and by their Civil Service masters, particularly in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, communicating a vision or demand that we grow in this space.  The agencies have the ability and the people.  They can attract the resources but they need now to be given a remit to grow a big global supply chain particularly in floating wind, wave and tidal, and then they will get on with it.  They are not getting that, I suspect, at present.  Therefore their response is not at the optimal level.  </p></speech>

It is good to see the scale of ambition being talked about again.  Reminding ourselves of Ardnacrusha is a good way to start.  Some of my questions build on Deputy Bruton's.</p><p>In Denmark, these new energy islands are a state-led project.  They are approximately 51% state-owned.  We know, for example, that facilities like Ardnacrusha were huge State-led initiatives.  It seems we have a tendency in Ireland to wait or try to create market conditions in the hope the leap forward will emerge when, sometimes, the State perhaps needs to leave the leap forward and then industry will follow around that, which seems to be when we are making the level of change that is needed.  That is certainly what happened with Ardnacrusha.  It seems that countries like Denmark are now taking that same leap.  I would be interested in Mr. Coyle's thoughts around that level of State leadership and ambition so that the State is not simply, for example, facilitating the auctions or market but is, in fact, leading.</p><p> With regard to 2025, one of the issues we discussed at our previous session was the idea of a reserved 1 GW for floating wind.  Is there potential in that regard?  Again, it is an option of support - it does not have to be deliverable - to bring that forward from 2025.  We might look at that in the next round to consider a reservation and any way floating wind might be part of that earlier than 2025.</p><p> I would appreciate it if Mr. Coyle could also expand on the macroeconomic circumstances in that we may have more flexibility within the EU rules before 2025 than after 2025.  I am also very conscious that more fiscal rules are being suspended at the moment within the wider area of investment, which may not be indefinite.</p><p> I want to ask about the circular economy part of the supply chain, which we have also looked at as a committee.  I am aware of some innovation in UCC, which has been looking at perhaps 11,000 tonnes of waste from the earlier generation of wind turbines.  In a past committee, we also heard from people who were looking at recycled plastic being part of wind blades.  Can we get a sense of how we can engage with the supply chain around wind turbines and that industry?  I have one final point.</p></speech>

We have other fish to fry, if members will pardon the expression, between now and then and many things to get done.  It is just an indication of what could happen and what we should be thinking about going forward into the 2030s.<br/><br/>I am happy the officials, who, obviously under general political direction, oversee the running of this area, are taking quite a visionary approach to all this.  In my experience in recent years, they are people of considerable ability.  The challenge is they are trying to create in detail a system of governance from nothing in a very short period over a territory that is nine or ten times the size of the terrestrial territory of the State.  It is as if we took the land mass, which is only one tenth of the size of the total territory of the State, and created from scratch laws to do with everything from waste disposal, traffic management, building regulations, health and safety and so on.  That is what they are doing at present.  At the same time, they are trying to ensure we can get stuff in the water and working quickly.  Much vision and drive is taking place at an official level.  We need to start thinking about the 2030s and the 30 GW.  We do not need to do it next week but we need to start thinking about it in the future.<br/><br/>On the supply chain and circular economy side of things, it was interesting to watch the dismantling of the Kinsale offshore gas platform recently.  First of all, it was built and served its purpose.  It is now being dismantled.I would guess it cost approximately &euro;100 million to dismantle it.  It is mostly steelwork and it has gone straight back into furnaces to become new steelwork.  The good thing from the State's perspective is that the industry that built it paid the &euro;100 million for its dismantling.  As far as I am aware, the State did not incur any cost.<br/><br/>The same approach will apply to offshore wind turbines and wave and tidal turbines.  The State will have to post a bond from the outset, which will ensure it pays for the recycling of a particular device when it runs out of life.  Industry is moving in a recycling direction.  At present, and this comes back to one of my earlier themes, we do not have the local industry that can contribute greatly to the various components etc. that go into an offshore turbine or wave device.  One exception might be &Eacute;ireComposites in County Galway, which makes blades.  It is a very advanced plastics company.<br/><br/>To give the Senator an impression of the scale that is achievable given recycling, Siemens is at present building a factory in Le Havre in north-west France just to serve the south North Sea.  It is a half mile long and will employ 700 people.  It has done more or less the same and rebuilt the port of Hull for the northern part of the North Sea.  General Electric, GE, is building a huge plant, again with many jobs, in Teesside and another big one is going into Scotland.  Recycling obviously has to play a part in all this but the economic opportunities are huge.<br/><br/>On the issue of marine protected areas, this legislation will be as complex as the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  We have wonderful wildlife and an underwater environment and we have many people who are aware of what is out there.  We need to preserve it and ensure it lives well and in harmony with economic development.  I genuinely do not know a great deal beyond that.  A very good piece of work was published by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage last year on every aspect of marine protected areas.  There was a big consultation about it.  Our response is up on our website, <i>mria.ie</i>.  That will service as the basis for the marine protected area legislation.<br/><br/>On the 1 GW, I do not think it is possible to bring the second auction forward from approximately 2024 or 2025.  A huge rigmarole has to be gone through to get there, necessarily and rightly so, under the new legislation.  It is truly complex stuff.  The system is going as far as it can but the requirement is that there is specific provision in that auction for floating wind and, indeed, a small amount of support for wave in particular in order that we can get pilot devices up and working away.</p></speech>

I have a couple of quick questions.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled an Opposition Private Members' Bill that talked about the opportunity of offshore wind and the need for an industrial development authority for the sea.  In Mr. Coyle's experience, is it more a case that the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Enterprise Ireland have the capacity but it is about refocusing , repurposing or redirecting them?  Do we need a new agency?  Do we already have the agencies to deliver this?  Is it about directing them?</p> <p>  My second question is on the focus and co-ordination and the issue of capacity.  In Mr. Coyle's experience of the agencies he has dealt with but also in terms of the Civil Service and Departments, is the capacity there at this stage?  Is there a shortfall in that regard?  Co-ordination came up at our previous hearing on Thursday in response to a question from the Chairman.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il reference a cross-government task force on offshore wind.  Is Mr. Coyle aware of that?  How would he like to see it take shape?</p><p>Should it just be for offshore wind or should it be expanded, and who should be involved?</p></speech>

One has to go through extensive turf wars that go on forever and a good outcome cannot be guaranteed.  The agencies we have, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are superb.  It is just a matter of handing them the vision and the demand to do big things and be imaginative in this area.  By the way, a very important agency that is about to be created in the first quarter of 2023, preferably in January 2023, is the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, in Wexford.  Its smooth and effective functioning is going to be very important.</p> <p>  In terms of capacity, historically there were one and a half men and women, a dog and a blunt pencil assigned to this area.  That has changed radically in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in recent times.  It does not have enough people - we never have enough people in these areas - but I am satisfied that in that Department and in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which also plays a key role in this area, there are probably adequate numbers of people involved.</p> <p>  There is a concern across the industry that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is going to be the planning authority for a significant portion of the European Union's waters, and the planning is going to be very complex, has the number of people and the expertise available to it into the future.  There is real concern there.  We want to ensure that MARA gets up and running with extensive resources from the outset.  There was a good sign recently when I heard that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage apparently has rented a new block which is being built as part of a larger development on the waterfront in Wexford.  That is a good sign the Department is taking this seriously and putting resources into it.  MARA must be resourced.  Those are the two key issues - make sure MARA gets up and running quickly and that it is well resourced and make sure An Bord Plean&aacute;la is well resourced.  Of course, there are people in the background we have to think about as well, such as the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which plays a key role in this area.</p> <p>  On the Government task force, there was an effort in this area to get Departments to pull and work together in the past.  It did not really work.  However, the involvement of the Department of the Taoiseach in ensuring the legislation was put together quickly seems to have carried on.  I have heard about the cross-government task force and I am fully in favour of it.  It is important that people in the silos are pulled together and talk together.  We should give it a chance and see what happens.</p></speech>

The east coast is the priority area for offshore wind.  Given the events in Ukraine and the need for our energy independence, how does Mr. Coyle foresee the development application and subsequent permission for wind farms on the east coast?  I apologise if Mr. Coyle has gone over this ground already, but I am interested to hear his thoughts on it.  Our need for our own wind energy and how to utilise that have come into sharp focus now.</p></speech>

It is shallow and therefore lends itself to the technology that is available today, kind of from Amazon if the committee will excuse the expression, which is bottom-fixed wind.  There is grid available off Dublin and Wicklow and there is a big market in the Dublin-Wicklow area.  It is very important that we get the first offshore renewable energy support scheme auction away.  It will focus on projects that are quite well-advanced in terms of their planning off the east coast.  If that gets held up or hindered in any way, we will have problems achieving targets in the 2030s and we will lose credibility in the huge investment world that now surrounds offshore renewable energy.  Bear in mind that while 5 GW is enormous for us, it is fairly Mickey Mouse for other people.  Scotland has just approved 24 GW of offshore wind, of which 60% is floating.  Wales has a 4 GW target of floating alone.  This is business for big companies and big developers with big pockets and big credibility in the investment world.</p> <p>  The east coast is vital.  I live in the Deputy's constituency.  I can see a bit of the sea from my attic window.  I am conscious of the types of issues and objections that may arise about visual impact.  The developers who are candidates to build these farms off the east coast, particularly off Dublin and Wicklow, are putting a great deal of effort into community support.  There are all sorts of protections under the Maritime Area Planning Act to ensure people have a real say.  They might not think they have a real say, but they do.  There are considerable benefits that will arise for the community.  To take D&uacute;n Laoghaire alone, for argument's sake to illustrate the point, the community benefit provisions that are being made by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are such that just one wind farm off D&uacute;n Laoghaire would probably pour &euro;4 million per year for approximately 25 years into that community for community projects.  That is over and above normal Government expenditure, and there will be all sorts of safeguards to ensure that it is not a substitute.  There are those aspects.</p> <p>  I throw the issue back to the Deputy.  The challenge for him and other coastal Deputies, Senators and leaders around Dublin and Wicklow, because those are communities that will be particularly affected, although not exclusively, is that they must show leadership in this area.  They have to try to get communities to understand that we need to do this or the lights will go off.  We cannot continue depending on Russian gas and coal to keep our lights on.  It is absurd.  As a country which has the oil of the offshore wind and wave world - we are like Saudi Arabia or, as the late Brendan Halligan used to say, we are Europe's battery - we cannot mess it up.  However, it will require not just people like me and others in industry but also political leaders to get out in front of this and deal with the objections and issues that will arise.  That is not always going to be easy to do.  I am the first to admit that.</p></speech>

I welcome what Mr. Coyle said about An Bord Plean&aacute;la being properly resourced.  He made reference to Scotland and seals and propellers.  Is there similar evidence for cetaceans?

There is a lot of expertise in some of our NGOs, such as BirdWatch Ireland and the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, which are two I have dealt with.</p><p>They should be properly resourced and able to contribute to the debate in a meaningful way.</p><p> On the issue raised by Deputy Devlin, the waters of the Irish Sea are shallow.  There is also the small fact that the line of the exclusive economic zone is quite close to the coast and there will be MPAs in the Irish Sea, so our capacity to get 5 GW out of the Irish Sea is relatively low.  As such, we are going to need floating offshore wind energy generation immediately.  We will need it in the Celtic Sea and in the Atlantic.  We need to include it in this.  Our big ask of the system at the moment is to have that in ORESS 2 because if it is not, our targets and everything else will be shot out of the water.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Christal and Mr. Curran of Enterprise Ireland, while Dr. Alan Power is joining the meeting online.  Dr. Power is also part of the secretariat to the expert group on future skills needs.</p> <p>  Wind energy will be critical in enabling our transition to a low-carbon economy.  Meeting our national climate targets will require a significant increase in the deployment rates of renewable electricity, including offshore wind, compared with those achieved in recent years.  The development of offshore wind energy will bring significant economic and employment opportunities to Ireland.  The Department and its development agencies are active in further developing these supply chain activities.  I will briefly address three of these activities relevant to the deliberations of the committee.  These are: Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities in developing SME capability in offshore wind supply chains; research by the expert group on future skills needs to identify the future skills requirements for the offshore wind sector; and regional developments, including the regional enterprise plans and the Shannon Estuary economic task force.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been working with SMEs to develop their capability in the offshore wind sector.  It has developed an offshore wind supply chain cluster of 65 companies.  These companies provide a range of products, services and skill sets appropriate to the offshore wind industry.  As per its remit, Enterprise Ireland is primarily focused on helping Irish SMEs bring this capability to export markets.  By far the largest and easiest to access market opportunity is the UK.  The London office of Enterprise Ireland has been building connections between Irish SMEs and UK offshore wind project developers, original equipment manufacturers and tier 1 contractors to ensure the greatest possible penetration of the UK market.  By facilitating Irish SMEs entering the UK offshore wind industry, Enterprise Ireland is helping these companies to build the appropriate capability and offerings to industry that not only operate in the UK and globally, but are also going to be major stakeholders in the Irish offshore wind sector.  Securing reference sites in Ireland will be advantageous for these supply chains as these companies seek to win business internationally.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has organised several sector events in the past three years in the UK, including a market study visit to Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth on the east coast of England, an event to showcase Irish capability to Dutch tier 1 contractors and a showcase of Irish capability to the Norwegian energy company Equinor.  It also commissioned a scoping study for Irish SMEs, focusing on supply chain opportunities in the UK, Denmark and Norway.  Enterprise Ireland is currently planning an industry forum to be held in Croke Park in June to focus on export market opportunities, particularly in the UK market, as well as opportunities for the supply chain domestically.</p><p>A further event in Manchester is planned in late June, where EI will take the Irish pavilion to Global Offshore Wind, an industry trade show.</p><p> From a skills policy and employment perspective, the Department is committed to identifying and driving the delivery of skills required to deliver on the ambitious wind energy targets.  The expert group on future skills needs, the secretariat of which sits in our Department, has published its study on skills to enable the low-carbon economy to 2030.  As part of this study, the expert group examined the skills needs arising from offshore wind energy generation targets in the 2019 climate action plan.  It estimated the demand for labour associated with offshore wind development will increase from the low hundreds to 2,500 mid-decade and will fluctuate around this level to 2030.  The group's modelling was based on the five phases of offshore wind energy, namely, planning, development, installation and operations through to decommissioning.  Across these phases, the expert group identified a range of skills that are required in engineering, environmental science and humanities, construction and technical services, legal and professional services, transport and logistics, and emerging and niche occupations.  As well as ongoing industry engagement with Ireland's skills development system, the report recommended the establishment of training partnerships or responses for projects between the Government, industry and education and training providers.</p><p> The offshore wind industry has significant regional employment and the Department is involved in the development and launch of nine new regional enterprise plans to 2024.  In developing these, the steering committees in each region considered how to contribute to a carbon-neutral economy.  Some of the regional enterprise plans contain specific strategic objectives of relevance to the offshore renewable wind and supply chain.  For example, the mid-west regional enterprise plan aims to harness the potential for major offshore floating wind projects off the west coast and to bring users of renewable energy physically close to the energy source.   The west regional enterprise plan specifically targets the region's potential for enterprise and job creation in the renewable energy sector.  It includes a focus on the potential of green hydrogen in decarbonising industry.  The region will work with large energy users to demonstrate the demand for this form of energy.  The north-west plan targets the growth of the wind energy industry by diversifying its existing onshore wind industry into the offshore wind industry.</p><p> The Shannon Estuary task force is being established in response to a commitment in the programme for Government.  Given the Shannon Estuary&rsquo;s deepwater port and geographical position, it is expected to assess the potential for renewable energy projects.  Existing infrastructure such as Shannon Foynes Port and the Tarbert and Moneypoint power stations will be key to harnessing that potential.  Several renewable energy projects that either have been proposed or are in planning illustrate the region's potential to complete its transition to a renewable-based economy, and these are expected to inform the work of the task force.</p><p> Achieving the full potential of Ireland's offshore wind resource offers major opportunities for the development of offshore wind electricity and associated by-products such as hydrogen, ammonia, energy storage and transmission technologies and technology services.  Large international investors are engaged with indigenous companies in a range of joint ventures to progress some of these business opportunities.  The Department and its agencies are actively engaged in building capacity in the indigenous sector for these supply chain opportunities.</p><p> I thank members for their attention.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I will provide an overview of the significant progress being made to deliver on this objective.</p> <p>  The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 has delivered the legislative basis to enable regulation of Ireland's maritime area outside the 12 nautical mile coastal zone limit for the first time.  This was an important achievement and provides certainty for offshore wind energy projects, which involve substantial levels of upfront investment.  The legislation provides the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications with powers to assess the first batch of maritime area consent, MAC, applications from a set of qualified offshore renewable energy, ORE, developers.  The purpose of this assessment will be to ensure only developers with the necessary financial and technical capability can enter the planning system.  A consultation on the proposed MAC assessment criteria was recently completed and the Minister will shortly announce the date in April when the MAC application window will open for this first batch of applications.  This will be a milestone on the critical path towards delivery on our 2030 targets, boosting international confidence in the State's intent to deliver at pace.</p> <p>  These assessments and the awarding of MACs to suitably qualified developers will be completed in quarter 3 of this year.  Developers can then apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for development permission, which will involve a full environmental assessment and public consultation in respect of their proposed projects.  The granting of MACs will also enable the first offshore renewable electricity support scheme auction to open in quarter 4 of 2022, providing a route to market for these projects.  As part of these offshore renewable energy support scheme, ORESS, contracts, significant contributions to community benefit funds, amounting to millions of euros annually, will be required from each project.  The model for the management and distribution of these funds will shortly be finalised, following the completion of a public consultation exercise.</p> <p>  Given this first phase of projects alone will not deliver the full 5 GW, a second batch of projects will need to be progressed through the development pipeline.  Again, the overriding objective must be to ensure only the most viable and realistic projects gain entry to the planning system.  The Department currently has a consultation open, setting out a range of potential criteria to identify this pool of projects, including the possible inclusion of an innovation category for non-fixed wind technologies such as floating wind.  In tandem with the work being led by the Department, a range of initiatives are under way in many other Departments and State agencies to support the development of this new sector, some of which members will hear from today.</p> <p>  It is also important that work under way in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the marine environment units of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage be progressed at pace to ensure appropriate data are made available to inform the sustainable development of the offshore wind energy sector while also ensuring national objectives regarding marine biodiversity are attained.  Recognising the range of initiatives under way, the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change recently approved a proposal to establish a delivery task force for offshore wind.  Matt Collins, assistant secretary in the Department, will chair this task force with the aim of ensuring the alignment and co-ordinated delivery of all activities under way among Departments, State agencies and related bodies.</p> <p>  Work is also being progressed to establish the building blocks required to enable the full potential of our offshore resource to be realised beyond 2030.  The policy intent is to move to a plan-led regime whereby the State, in consultation with all maritime users, will identify the areas best suited for sustainable renewable energy development.  Work on the second offshore renewable energy development plan is in progress and includes assessment of the opportunities for wind, wave and tidal technologies.  In parallel, work to assess the economic opportunity is being progressed, examining how to connect potential sources of offshore energy with large demand centres in continental Europe.  The planned Greenlink interconnector will provide a 500 MW connection between Ireland and Great Britain, while the Celtic interconnector will provide a 700 MW link between Ireland and the European internal energy market by connecting Ireland to France.  Non-electricity grid-related opportunities, particularly the potential to use excess renewable electricity to generate synthetic e-fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia, are also being assessed.  These fuels can be used to help decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors and the transport sector, especially in the case of heavy goods vehicles, maritime transport and potentially even the aviation sector.</p> <p>  In summary, significant work is under way in a range of Departments and State agencies to deliver on our 2030 offshore wind targets and this work remains firmly on track.  My colleague Mr. Finucane and I will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I am the principal officer responsible for the ongoing development and implementation of the new maritime planning system, brought about by the Maritime Area Planning Act and the national marine planning framework.</p><p>The State has undergone the most comprehensive review and overhaul of marine legislation and governance since its formation.  The two primary pillars of this reform are the national marine planning framework, NMPF, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 1 July 2021, and the Maritime Area Planning Act, which was passed by these Houses and subsequently promulgated by the President on 23 December 2021.</p><p> The NMPF is the long-term forward plan for Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area to ensure the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources.  It is also intended to support the introduction of offshore renewable energy into our maritime area.  The Maritime Area Planning Act will be the cornerstone of the new marine planning system in Ireland and brings together and creates the legal foundation for forward planning, streamlined development management and enforcement.  All future offshore renewable energy applications will be consented through this Act.  The Act will also establish a new agency, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, the role of which will be to govern the occupation of the maritime area.  With these initiatives, and guided by the NMPF, our maritime planning system will move towards being a plan-led process rather than the developer-led system it currently is.</p><p> The NMPF is a parallel document to the national planning framework, NPF.  Both of these spatial plans are concerned with the long-term future of our land and sea area, identifying opportunities for protection, growth and development so that our land and marine areas can be managed in the best interests of the public.  The NPF recognises the importance of integration and co-ordination with the land planning regime at national, regional and local levels.  In future it will be equally important, in turn, that national, regional and local terrestrial plans are consistent with the NMPF, as will be required under the Maritime Area Planning Act.  The Act also provides for designated maritime area plans, DMAPs, which are management plans for a localised area of our sea, to be developed.  Any Minister or relevant public body will be able to bring forward a DMAP proposal for a geographic area or sector which will be subject to public participation, environmental assessment and Oireachtas decision.  Once approved, these DMAPs become part of the NMPF.  This ensures a joined-up approach to marine forward planning with binding considerations for decision-makers.  I fully expect that the enduring offshore renewable energy system will be led and supported by DMAPs and will manoeuvre the system away from a developer-led model and towards a State-led model.  I thank the committee members for their interest and am happy to answer their questions.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Fiona Ralph.  I am a principal officer in the climate unit in the Department of Finance and I deal with national and international climate priorities as well as sustainable financial services.</p> <p>  The EU taxonomy for sustainable activities is an extremely important piece of work.  In a nutshell it defines what is sustainable for almost 40% of economic activities that are themselves responsible for up to 80% of our total emissions.  We know that Ireland and the rest of the EU needs to substantially increase sustainable investment over the next decade.  This investment cannot come solely from governments - private investors must also crowd in.  The taxonomy will encourage and guide investors to identify and channel money towards genuinely green investments.  I will comment on the purpose of the taxonomy and its relevance to today&rsquo;s topic before turning to the state of play in its development.</p> <p>  The taxonomy is a classification system developed at EU level.  It aims to specify technical, science-based criteria for assessing whether specific economic activities make a substantial positive contribution to climate change while doing no significant harm to the environment and simultaneously meeting minimum safeguards.  The taxonomy will evolve over time with more activities being added.  It will also reflect technological advances.  The Commission&rsquo;s website offers a useful taxonomy compass tool, which can be used to check the requirements sector by sector.  For example, the taxonomy sets out the conditions that a variety of activities related to the renewable energy sector must meet in order to be deemed sustainable, from electricity generation, storage, manufacture, transmission and distribution to solar, wind, geothermal, renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuel and bioenergy.  It is primarily aimed at large companies and the financial services sector to guide and mobilise investments in activities to achieve carbon neutrality. </p> <p>  Although it is voluntary for companies to spend or invest in taxonomy-aligned activities, certain companies in scope must report on the extent to which their business is aligned with the taxonomy&rsquo;s standards.  The EU and its member states are also working with other countries to agree a common set of standards that can be applied globally.</p> <p>  The taxonomy should be beneficial in a number of ways.  Investors will be better able to identify opportunities and confidently invest in projects and companies that have a substantial positive impact on the climate.  Corporates and financial services firms will improve transparency on sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities due to the taxonomy and other complementary transparency legislation.  These factors should help to shift investments to where they are most needed for the transition to net zero, while helping citizens, corporates and governments to keep an eye on where the money is going.</p> <p>  I will now outline the state of play in its development.  The overarching regulation came into force in 2020 and set out six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.  To be considered sustainable, an activity must make a substantial contribution to one or more of those six objectives and do no significant harm to the other objectives.  It must also meet minimum social safeguards and comply with technical screening criteria related to the objectives.</p> <p>  The detailed requirements for these objectives are set out in a series of delegated Acts, one of which came into force on 1 January 2022 and covers climate mitigation and adaptation.  A complementary Act, covering the requirements for natural gas and nuclear power, was adopted by the Commission on 2 February and, unless rejected by the Council or the European Parliament, will come into force next year. </p> <p>  Reporting requirements for firms in scope of the taxonomy are also in force as of this year.  These reporting requirements are complementary to those already existing and under development under some other notable EU legislation, such as the sustainable finance disclosures regulation and the non-financial reporting directive, which is currently being amended to become the corporate sustainability reporting directive.</p> <p>  The Commission has indicated that an additional delegated Act, covering the four remaining environmental objectives - water and marine, circular economy, pollution prevention, and biodiversity - is expected later this year.  Consideration is also being given to expanding the taxonomy to cover intermediate, or transitional, environmental performance and social objectives.  </p> <p>  In addition, under the European Commission&rsquo;s 2018 action plan on sustainable finance, we are now negotiating a regulation for a European green bond standard that could come into operation in 2024 and aims to set a gold standard for green bonds to raise funds on capital markets.</p> <p>  As taxonomy alignment reporting beds in for corporates and becomes increasingly relevant for the public sector, it is reasonable to expect that Ireland&rsquo;s public expenditure should increasingly demonstrate alignment with the taxonomy.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I might ask a few quick questions.  I hope our guests can be succinct in their answers.  My first question is for Mr. Owens and relates to the EU taxonomy.  While it is not decided yet, the European Council and the European Parliament need to make their decision.  The concern in this committee is that labelling nuclear and gas as green energy in Europe could send a signal that stifles development by diverting attention, opportunity and investment away from Ireland.  We would think there is now an opportunity, especially considering the current security and energy crises, to seek to decarbonise the energy systems in Europe as quickly as possible.  Ireland is well placed in that regard and the concern is that the taxonomy might pull against that opportunity.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. McCabe from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage relating to MARA and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A guest who was before the committee prior to this session said that a concern for the industry is that both of those institutions may not have the necessary human resources to deal with the number of applications and the level of opportunity that exists.  Are we confident that the resourcing plan is sufficient to realise as quickly as possible the opportunity that is there?</p><p>Does Mr. Owens want to take the first question?</p></speech>

It is a compromise.  The Commission has worked through looking at how considerably more than 20% of electricity in the EU is generated using nuclear energy.  Not all of the alternatives are in place.  The timing of divestment from gas and nuclear technology will have to be carefully considered.  The approach of the Government has been to seek to have a slightly higher standard applied on the gas side of taxonomy.  However, we remained agnostic on the nuclear side, given that the Commission had worked hard on trying to find a compromise.  Many member states had different views for different reasons.  There are different stages of development and we judged that it was not unreasonable for the transition, at least, not to rule out any investment in gas or nuclear.</p></speech>

Significant money is looking for renewable energy opportunities at present, both domestically and internationally.  I know from previous experience working with some of the multinational development banks that they are extremely interested.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, is Europe's climate bank in which there are considerable opportunities.  There are also significant pent-up savings in Ireland that can be used to meet some of these goals.  In short, I hope it will not slow down the development of our own resource.</p></speech>

Proposals from An Bord Plean&aacute;la have been accepted and approved around the creation of a new marine unit within its organisational structure.  We remain in ongoing discussions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure that new unit is appropriately staffed.  We have to remain agile in that space because many of these are new skills for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and it needs access to those as well.  We will work closely with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on this in the short, medium and long term.</p> <p>  We are on course to have the new agency, MARA, established in the first quarter of next year.  An establishment unit has been created within the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government, the sole purpose of which is to get that agency up and running.  Part of that will be to identify a proper workforce plan very shortly.  I am confident that the right resources will be in the agency ahead of applications being accepted.  There are statutory limits on those applications in terms of how long they take to process.  These have been set out in the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  The agency will have to react to that but I do not have a concern.  I am quite confident we will be ahead of that situation.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the concerns the Chair raised on the EU taxonomy.  What sort of risk analysis has been done on the provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty to which Ireland is a signatory?  The Department of Finance officials said it was an evolving process and gas may change over time but once an investor comes and is set up, the investor will be protected for the duration of the investment.  Has a risk analysis been done by the Department on the impact of the Energy Charter Treaty and investments that may come into the country on the back of the EU taxonomy?</p></speech>

The cost of renewables came up in our earlier session in terms of the delivery task force for offshore wind.  Will that have a cost dimension?  We are an outlier in terms of the cost of renewables.  Are auctions and the potential of further auctions to deliver further high-cost electricity within the Department's mandate or area of focus?  What is it doing about that?</p> <p>  Grid capacity is related to cost.  EirGrid has outlined a schedule of works or areas of the grid that will be rated up or upgraded.  However, it has given no indication of timelines or when those works will be completed.  Will all of them be delivered?  It could be June, July or August of 2029.  Has EirGrid given the Department an indicative timeline for those projects in the shaping our energy future report?  If it has, will the Department officials share that with the committee?</p></speech>

The one thing about the long-term delivery of renewable energy is, especially as we look to develop the offshore sector, that it is a relatively new sector in Ireland.  Many work streams are ongoing in different Departments, agencies and regulatory bodies.</p> <p>  The main job of the delivery task force will be to co-ordinate and pull together all of these aspects.  A key part of that will be to ensure we are able to develop an enterprise and skill-development strategy alongside that and as the projects start to move from planning phases into construction phases and, in turn, into operation and management phases, we will have the skilled people ready to work with those projects and Irish companies available to take part in the construction and ongoing operation and management of the projects.</p> <p>  All of this is critical to ensure that projects have more certainty in terms of development.  That is a key plank to enable them to bid in the auctions in a very competitive fashion.  The support system that the project will come into is quite a competitive option scenario.  They will bid against each other which will also be a good control on cost coming into the market for us.</p> <p>  We published an offshore grid policy last April which showed that would centralise the offshore grid in a single offshore transmission system operator.  This operator is EirGrid which is working very closely with ESB networks to ensure that the development of an appropriate offshore grid strategy fits, in a timely and appropriate fashion, with the development and strengthening of the onshore grid.</p> <p>  Another of the Deputy's questions related to the grid capacity and the timing of works.</p><p>Shaping Our Electricity Future, which was published recently by EirGrid, looks at the development of the entire grid network up until 2030 so it takes on board not just the advent of onshore and offshore renewables and different technologies such as onshore wind, solar, biomass and offshore wind, it also looks at growth in demand and traditional gas and other generation units on the system.  It does this because we need to take a holistic view of grid development.  EirGrid and ESB Networks work very closely to ensure that new technologies can be taken on board; the grid is strengthened in the areas that require it, particularly around the greater Dublin area; and that ongoing replacement measures-----</p></speech>

There is a list of 48 grid reinforcement projects.  Has EirGrid given the Department a timeline for when they will be completed with dates and, if so, can Mr. Finucane share them with us?</p></speech>

The early works would be scheduled and have timelines in place.  Some of the later projects strengthening towards the mid to end of the decade probably do not have firm dates.</p></speech>

In that, we outlined several options we were considering for the final auction terms and conditions.  We looked at whether or not we would index link part of the bid prices.  All of these have impacts on how the companies will structure their bids ultimately for the auction.  Together with our financial advisers, we are working through some of those options and the responses to the consultation.  We are looking at the individual components companies put together when they are formulating their bid prices so we are looking at the different areas within that.</p></speech>

While my colleague spoke about the auctions in the short term, we recognise that to develop offshore beyond 2030, an economic analysis needs to be undertaken given that we are not as readily connected to the European Continent as other countries so there needs to be a clear pathway for how we can build and make best use of our offshore capability so that analysis has been initiated as well.</p></speech>

It is impressive to see the amount of progress that is being made and the establishment of the plan-led approach, the task force, enterprise and skills and the cluster.  My central question would be if the political system seeks to lift our efforts on offshore renewable opportunity to a higher level, what would the witnesses recommend should now be done because it seems they have put in a framework and it is hard to criticise what is in it?  Given deteriorating energy security and increasing urgency, what would the witnesses recommend we think about to take it to another level?</p> <p>  What is the scale of the employment cluster and the witnesses' ambition in terms of its future?  Are we talking about a very significant employment cluster within Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland or is this part of a comparatively middle-of-the-road opportunity from the perspective of the enterprise sector?  </p> <p>  I have studied the taxonomy and think it is a very useful tool.  My central question concerns the degree to which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has taken this on board.  We have a new national development plan and &euro;140 billion.  The impression I get from people who come before this committee is that public procurement is still running pretty much as it always did and if there is not a very strong demand from the procurer to a create the most sustainable path for procurement, nothing much happens.  There has not been that decisive shift.  Whoever is commissioning the work is the primary driver.  A taxonomy is not being applied by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to force those commissioning work down a more sustainable path.</p></speech>

We estimate that the offshore component of that will increase from the low hundreds to about 2,500 by the middle of the decade and should remain there for the remainder of the decade.  The construction component in terms of getting these developments off the ground will be a strong component of that.

We developed this scale offshore network with over 65 companies in it.  They have a range of capabilities in the offshore wind industry.  A group of the companies involved would be heavily involved in the industry and are currently working in the UK.  They would be working in the North Sea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the east coast of the US and so on.  We also have a group of companies in there that are involved in the on-shore piece - basically cable landing, substations on shore and grid engineering to bring that power on to the grid.  The third group of companies are in the broader marine engineering space and would have capability to move into offshore wind.</p><p>We have a growing capability in the sector.  Certainly all the companies that we have are tier 2 and that will be the case in the short to medium term.  We see significant employment growth in those companies.  We also see them buying new vessels for survey work for geotechnical and geophysical applications, for example.  We see a number of companies also buying crew transfer vessels, which are effectively the buses of the industry.  We see significant interest from overseas tier 1 companies and developers, particularly those in the UK.  The developers and tier 1 companies in the UK are the ones that will come to Ireland to develop projects here.  Our approach is to get as many of our companies in this cluster as possible into the UK industry with a view to them building their capability in that industry, making connections there, working with these tier 1 companies in the UK and then bringing that capability back home subsequently to maximise the local content in the supply chain for the Irish projects.</p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. Curran's points about piggy-backing off the UK's industrial heritage and economy.  However, we need to look to the likes of Germany and Netherlands where there are significant players who do want to be active in the Irish market and are knocking on the door.

Bringing them together under the delivery task force will enable that connectedness and alignment to ensure that we are progressing at pace across all different areas.  From a whole-of-government perspective, it would be good to raise the profile of our need to attain our biodiversity targets in tandem with delivering on offshore renewable energy.  The work has been initiated in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on marine protected areas.  We would like to see that accelerated so that we are de-risking the process for offshore energy projects as they move through the new planning system.  That would be an important area.  We certainly believe there is scope for both sets of targets and objectives to be met.  It is an area that could have greater focus.</p></speech>

We in the Department of Finance have not done a risk assessment on the Energy Charter Treaty.  I cannot speak for others.  It is a voluntary standard and I think the standard is higher for gas than anything that is in place at the moment.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Bruton, I will not speak for my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform except to say that I know in the national development plan it has been climate tagged.  They have gone through the projects and done some work around that.  Under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, from memory I think 37% must align with the "do no significant harm" elements of the taxonomy.  It is not full compliance but it is in line with that. </p> <p>  We also have two other sources of green funds, namely the carbon tax, which is fully hypothecated for green purposes and underlies a great deal of the climate action plan, and the green bond.  The National Treasure Management Agency, NTMA, has raised closed to &euro;7 billion, all of which is allocated for green purposes.  There is an annual allocation report, which is independently verified by a third-party company.</p></speech>

The first is achieving our own national ambitions, which are aiming at 5 GW this side of 2030.  We have outlined the different frameworks for that.  Before we have even gone to the first auction and processed the first batch of projects ready to build, we have put out a consultation looking at the next batch of projects, which closes tomorrow.  We are developing a flow of projects as we go forward to ensure that industry and all the different players have time to get their order correct so they are able to be operational by 2030.  On the second part of it, we are looking at the potential opportunity beyond our own national requirements.  In the programme for Government a figure of up to 30 GW was identified as potential for either the export markets or going beyond where we are.  We are working very closely with the European Commission in respect of the Trans-European Networks for Energy, TEN-E, programme.  The new programme has a new focus on cross-border connections and potential hybrid connections where generation can link in to traditional electricity interconnectors.  Ireland this year is chairing the North Seas Energy Cooperation where with a group of North Sea countries we are looking at speeding up the process of infrastructure and market development to get offshore wind moving at a quicker pace than is possible at the moment.</p> <p>  The unfortunate events in Ukraine and the energy response to them have very much put a new focus on engaging with the UK at national and Commission level in co-operation talks and building on the post-Brexit trade and co-operation agreement discussions that are under way with the UK in respect of cross-border energy trading.  That process will definitely be speeded up as a result of this.</p></speech>

It is not about whether gas or nuclear power exist or are invested in, but whether we are tagging them as climate renewable and sustainable.  On their attempted inclusion, the European Investment Bank has said it will not accept it.  Many institutional investors of more than &euro;50 trillion, I think, in investment funds, have said they will not recognise that.  Ireland should not be agnostic on this issue.  It is about the credibility of investment in this area and the rerouting of it.  We should move from being agnostic to being believers in really pushing green hydrogen and renewable energies such as wind energy and wave energy, which we heard about from earlier witnesses.  If Ireland is in a neutral position on this, we should champion this because there are tensions between continuation of gas and green hydrogen.  Germany now has a green hydrogen strategy.  If we could just come to where Ireland could get ahead of industry in this-----</p></speech>

On illustrating the demand for green hydrogen by partnering with big companies, it seems we need to have a State level push on green hydrogen.  We hear about keeping the lights on, but I am a bit concerned that the strategy for the western seaboard seems to involve large energy users, which I imagine are data centres, being the drivers and in control of the agenda.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the State-led approach in terms of energy security, green hydrogen and renewables.</p><p> On the issue of Designated Marine Area Plans, DMAPs, for marine protected areas, MPAs, I was concerned that the representative of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage spoke about DMAPs as an area, when every other witness that we have had from industry has talked about the MPAs as being core to the State-led approach.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the MPAs as part of the core approach and indeed, increasing the State's capacity for environmental surveys and sensitivity mapping as part of how we interpret.  There will need to be environmental assessment of projects, not just of areas.</p></speech>

The delegated Act covers those conditions that investments in natural gas and nuclear energy have to meet.  Ireland is not likely to object to this delegated Act, as it stands at the moment.

I might address some of the questions she asked around the State approach.  As I said in my opening statement, the intention is that the work that we are doing on the offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP, will inform how best we move forward with the State-led approach.  We want to move from the current project or developer led approach to the State actually identifying the best areas for offshore energy in consultation and using an evidence-based approach and data from many other sectors, including data on the environmental sensitivities.  National parks and wildlife and MPAs are all important, but they are not the only aspects that are being looked at.  It is much broader than that.  Once we complete that national assessment, the OREDP, the intention is that we then identify the best areas to move into the DMAPs that our colleague in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage referenced.  Just to be clear, there are environmental assessments to be carried out at every level of the process.  At a plan level, we are carrying out a strategic environmental assessment, an appropriate assessment.  When we get down through the DMAP, similar exercises will be carried out.  Further down, at a project level, there will be environmental impact assessments and so on.  It is very much a holistic approach that we are taking.  The framework and the legislation which the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has established is very much providing the overarching framework within which we are working.  Moving to that State-led approach will offer a lot of advantages for the State, but also for other maritime users.  It will enable the protection of biodiversity and also de-risk the process for developers.  It really is the optimal route, long term.  However, there is work to be done to get there.  We are working through that transition at the moment.</p></speech>

I think it was hinted at in the existing Climate Action Plan, but I think he is going to firm it up in the next version of it, which is due at the end of the year.  There will be work, including a potential public consultation on it in advance of that by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I also asked about the issue of partnering with large energy users.  How do we ensure that there is local energy security for keeping the lights on if renewable energy is tied very closely to specific customers, such as large energy users?  I know that I am out of time, so I am happy to receive a written answer to that question.</p></speech>

That was very much part of the reason why EirGrid produced the Shaping our Electricity Future report.

That is very clearly outlined in Shaping our Electricity Future.</p></speech>

Mr. Owens referred to the carbon tax and the fact it is fully ring-fenced for measures.  Is it not that case that it is only the increase in the carbon tax that has been applied that has been ring-fenced?  I am not sure of the exact percentage, but a significant proportion of carbon tax is not ring-fenced for carbon measures.</p> <p>  I have a question for the representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The seafood-offshore renewable energy working group was to be set up by 2021 to act as a stakeholder body.  I am wondering whether there is a progress report on that.  There are some concerns that there have been delays with it.  It is fundamental that those discussions are happening between different stakeholders to ensure that we get the right response in answer to our renewable questions.</p> <p>  I am not sure if any of the witnesses can answer this question, but I am wondering if there are any plans to dial up Ireland's preparedness to harness our natural resources in light of the events in Ukraine.  It has been a very quickly evolving situation.  There is quite a high level of risk that energy security in Europe and Ireland over the short to medium, and perhaps long, term could be impacted.  Are there any discussions within the Departments about speeding up our response to ensure that we have renewable energy in place to give us that resilience?</p></speech>

I hope that this week we will be advertising on our website for a chair of that group.  I am delighted with that progress.  We have met separately with stakeholders in fisheries and renewable energy around the formation of the group.  We have not been inactive.  It is important to note that the Bill took all of our resources.  It was an incredibly complex and difficult piece of legislation to get through.  To tie this back to Deputy Bruton's question around what can be done, I think the legislation and the framework really showed what the State can do when it puts it mind to something.  Right across a number of Departments and the political apparatus, people really got behind the legislation and got it through.  We spent 22 to 24 hours at Committee Stage alone, but everybody had a very similar vision and objective, even though there might have been disagreements around the contents of the Bill.  That really showed that when we all focus, we can get things done.  We need a similar focus now, going into the future.  We will be bringing forward a marine planning policy statement over the coming months.  We will be laying a draft before the Oireachtas.</p><p>Similarly we would like to focus on that as it could set a clear direction for all marine planning into the future.  We want to lay down exactly what are our priorities in this respect.  That covers the questions that may have come our way.</p></speech>

A key aspect is increasing the rate of deployment of energy efficiency measures every bit as much as demand and supply side measures.  There was an emergency energy Council meeting in Brussels last week and the International Energy Agency met at ministerial level last week looking at these matters as well.  The entire European energy system is really looking at how it can response by dialling up delivery of the Fit for 55 packages.  I expect we will see measures put in place in the short term to speed this up as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

In the submission from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, it spoke about significant community gain but what exactly does that mean?  What communities is the Department speaking about?  There are licences for legacy projects that should be first to be allowed go ahead.  Will that be the case or is the Department talking about other new projects in the submission rather than these legacy projects?  I am very interested to hear what the Department has to say about moving to a more State-led approach.  When might that happen?  Will it happen on time or will we end up in a position where the developers will lead the development or renewable energy when they choose to invest in something?  How will the State ensure something happens if a developer decides not to invest in it?  Our aim for 2030 is very ambitious, given where we are coming from.</p><p>In the submission from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it speaks about the Shannon Estuary economic task force and the role it will play in delivering renewables.  We and the Government parties have a concern that liquefied natural gas planning permission might be awarded.  Even the Chairman's party has put a Bill forward to stop this happening in the future.  How would it affect plans for the Shannon Estuary economic task force if the Shannon liquefied natural gas planning application was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>My final question is on the EU taxonomy, as it flies in the face of everything we heard from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that we would even consider relying on fossil fuels and nuclear power in future given how frightening the report was.  What I really want to get at is the impact of the war on Ukraine and whether it will hurt our climate targets?  Will it allow for massive importation of liquefied natural gas from the US?  I read an article in <i>The Washington Post </i>about such gas flowing from the US when it previously could not export it.  Most of that is coming to Europe.  How does that look for us?</p></speech>

It is something we are looking at in respect of how the system will operate for the offshore wind projects.  We are conscious any community benefit payments from offshore projects will be significantly bigger in volume and nature than any of the smaller onshore projects would be.  We are looking to put a structure in place so we can ensure the relevant communities would benefit from the large-scale projects as they become operational.</p></speech>

The first batch of projects that will be coming through the new regime have already significantly advanced works under the previous foreshore regime.  They will have spent many years in several cases conducting surveys, including bird or environmental surveys and so on, to provide them with the detailed information they have in order to be able to move into the planning system.  A protocol was agreed two years ago between the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to enable those projects to transition over to the new regime.  This provides many benefits for the State in that we have a much more streamlined and progressive regime that will be used to assess these applications.</p></speech>

Some of them go back a number of years and some are more recent than that.  The point to make clear is that these projects will be fully assessed under the new regime.  What they have agreed is entry into the new system.  When they come before the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in order to apply for a maritime area consent, if they are deemed viable developers in that they have the financial and technical capability, they will give up any foreshore lease they already have in return for being granted a maritime area consent.  That will then give a gateway to the planning system, allowing them go before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The projects would have to be fully assessed from all environmental considerations along with planning.  Public consultation would be part of that.  Essentially, they are moving from the old regime to the new but will still be fully assessed.</p> <p>  As we mentioned, there is also an open consultation now on how we might best identify the second batch of projects.  In order to meet the 2030 targets, the projects need a number of years to be developed - it is typically seven or more years - and we must get projects into the pipeline as soon as possible.  That phase 2 consultation is currently open for everyone to contribute, thinking of how we identify the most appropriate projects to move into the new system.  Again, the intention must be to ensure the most viable projects get into the planning system so we do not clog that system with projects that are not realistic.</p> <p>  On the question of a State-led approach, we must move forward in order to meet the 2030 targets and get these projects into the development pipeline at the same time as developing and figuring out the best approach to that State-led regime.  We are doing work this year on the offshore renewable energy development plan, looking at opportunities and constraints, and we aim to have that completed by the end of this year or January 2023.  That information will be available and used as part of that second batch of projects progressing through the development pipeline.  To move a fully State-led approach will take a number of years and it is important to acknowledge we are trying to do both in tandem.  We are trying to make the approach to assessing projects as they go through the system as robust as possible in the short term while the plan-led approach is being developed.</p></speech>

On the west coast we will not be looking at bottom-fixed as we are in the Irish Sea.  We will be looking at floating units.  We could potentially use the Shannon Estuary as a fabrication base for that industry in fabricating units.</p><p>It has a number of key advantages.  It is sheltered.  There is deep water and a significant land bank.  It is ideally placed to float those units out and subsequently tow them into place off the west coast.  Shannon Estuary has a number of key advantages that would be relevant for the industry.</p></speech>

I know the question of the development of ports is a matter for the Department of Transport.  To get our ports ready generally, whether Shannon Estuary or other ports, is an enormous infrastructural task.  Does the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment see it as an urgent task or will we be into the next decade before we see delivery?  The reason I ask is because I think it is something we can expedite.  It would be important for the Department to seize the opportunity that could be delivered sooner rather than later.  It would also be important for that Department to liaise with the Department of Transport to develop the infrastructure that will be necessary to realise the resource.</p></speech>

We have had a series of meetings with the Department of Transport in recent years.  The ports are all privately owned and independent but we would see this as a key area where the delivery task force will need to zone in on to ensure we have all the different strands in place to expedite these developments.</p></speech>

In the very short term, one of the options to be examined is increasing the transport of liquefied natural gas that may otherwise have gone to the Asian market or other global markets to the European markets.  That would be an immediate response to the Ukrainian crisis as opposed to a long-term plan.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022030800002#A00400"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to present details of the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide the necessary funding for the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme within the energy transformation programme of my Department.</p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the impact of the rising cost of living on households, including the rising cost of electricity and gas prices caused by international conditions.  Wholesale natural gas prices have been increasing since the second half of 2020 and current indications are that these higher prices will continue for the foreseeable future.  These higher prices feed directly through to retail electricity prices, as gas is used for electricity generation.</p><p>To address the growing impact of rising costs on vulnerable households, the Government increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5 in budget 2022.  There were also increases to the qualified child payment and the living alone allowance, and an increase in the income threshold for the working family payment was introduced.  In addition, there were adjustments to basic welfare, pension rates and income tax bands, which were introduced primarily to cater for the cost of living increases driven in part by energy prices.</p><p>Since then, however, the continuing rise in the cost of living has further significantly impacted citizens' lives.  Recognising this on 10 February, as part of a suite of policy measures designed to support households, the Government announced an increase in the electricity credit from &euro;100, excluding VAT, to &euro;200, including VAT.  The total cost of this scheme has been set in the relevant legislation at &euro;400 million.  This will allow for the payment of the electricity credit to all domestic electricity customers registered on an agreed date, including pay-as-you go customers, from this April.  Approximately 2.25 million account holders will benefit from the scheme with a one-off exceptional payment to their electricity accounts.</p><p>This scheme is part of a range of measures being taken by the Government to mitigate the impact of rising energy costs, including a fuel allowance lump sum payment of &euro;125, a drug payment scheme reduction to &euro;80, a front-loading of the working family payment, a 20% reduction in public transport fees from the end of April until the end of the year, and a reduction in caps for school transport fees.</p><p><b></b>The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, which provides the legal basis for the scheme, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 2 March.  The scheme will be operated by the distribution system operator - ESB Networks - and electricity suppliers and will be overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.</p><p>Based on the number of domestic electricity accounts, ESB Networks will make payments to the individual electricity suppliers who will then credit each domestic electricity account held with them.  ESB networks and suppliers will be required to make all books and records relating to their functions under the scheme available to an auditor to be appointed by my Department.</p><p> The Revenue Commission has advised that VAT must be applied on the bill balance after the credit has been applied.  On that basis the credit of &euro;176.22 is being applied exclusive of VAT on each account.  Inclusive of VAT, the total reduction on each household electricity costs will be &euro;200. </p><p> The total cost of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is estimated at &euro;400 million.  The cost of the scheme is being funded by my Department through a reallocation of &euro;128.6 million from subhead B4 &ndash; residential and community retrofit programmes to subhead B11 &ndash; electricity credit, along with additional Exchequer funding of &euro;271.4 million being made available by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this Supplementary Estimate.</p><p> My Department is maintaining the planned delivery outputs for the residential and community retrofit schemes by allocating &euro;267.2 million in capital funding to the programme in 2022.  This is comprised of &euro;184.2 million, including capital carryover, from the Vote and &euro;83 million of funding from the energy efficiency national fund.  This is the highest ever allocation for the programme and will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes to a building energy rating, BER, of B2.  This nearly doubles the number of homes delivered to B2 standard in 2021.</p><p> In the longer term, the best protection from rising prices is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and to improve the efficiency of our homes.  The 2021 climate action plan has set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a BER of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of 2030.  The national retrofit plan, which was published last November, is designed to address barriers to retrofit, identifying a range of measures aimed at driving demand, expanding the size and capacity of the supply chain and making retrofits more affordable.</p><p> New initiatives launched last month to deliver on this plan include a new national home energy upgrade scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard and a special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation.  These new initiatives will be funded by the national development plan financial allocation for residential retrofit of &euro;8 billion to 2030.  Over 60% of this funding, equalling &euro;5 billion, will be from carbon tax revenue.</p><p> Government also recognises that for many homeowners, even with enhanced grant rates, there will be a need to access finance to fund their upgrade.  For this reason, my Department is working with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Finance, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the European Investment Bank and financial institutions to design a new low-cost loan scheme for retrofit.</p><p> I am very happy to take questions from the committee on this Supplementary Estimate, which will provide the necessary funding for the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme payment.</p></speech>

I know the Minister does not have a crystal ball and none of us do but given the seriousness of the geopolitical situation we are in, does the Minister agree that energy costs will continue to rise, and rise severely?  Does he believe that this &euro;200 subsidy to each household will be enough?  I would argue that a lot more will need to be done for long-term alleviation of the problem.  Has the Minister thought about looking at methods that other countries, such as Poland and Spain, have brought in?  Those countries have capped the prices of energy.  Has the Minister considered looking at the profits of the energy companies?  My understanding is that the profits of the companies to which we pay our bills have been handsome in recent years.  Are there ways to retrieve anything from those companies to alleviate the hardship on people?  I am sure the Minister will agree this is a very challenging and serious situation and it will worsen over the coming period, given what is happening on the planet.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, she is also correct when she says that the likely prognosis is for ongoing high energy costs.  We had thought, prior to the invasion and war, that energy prices would start to come down because they were already very high.  That is now less certain.  For the immediate future, this year and probably next year, there will be no relief.  For that reason, the Government is looking to see are there additional measures it can take.  We said clearly that we thought additional measures unnecessary and that we would wait until the budget in October before further reviewing the situation but we will have to act quicker than that.</p> <p>  We will not be able to cover the full cost and cushion the full blow.  The price of gas, oil and coal has risen to unprecedented levels.  They may vary slightly.  To take the example of the cost of gas, it will not decrease immediately or significantly because even if there were an immediate resolution of the war, Europe would look to increase gas storage and that would see an ongoing demand.  We will need additional measures.</p> <p>  There is another core solution we must consider that might take slightly longer but which must be centre stage, that is, we need additional measures that reduce our use of fossil fuels.  We must look at radically accelerating energy efficiency measures across a whole range of different sectors.  I am working on that in my Departments, as well as working with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and, critically, with the European Commission on its toolbox, which it is going to revise and update in the next two or three days.  A united European approach is best.</p> <p>  With regard to the example of the Spanish and Polish price caps, I think every country has different circumstances and I do not believe our circumstances would allow for those mechanisms to work.  Taking Spain as an example, there are many complex reasons its market is particularly exposed because of the way the market is designed and so on.  My understanding is that much of that cap applies to companies that do not have any fossil component but may include a large nuclear-powered generator that has experienced no real cost increase but has benefited from the market price increase.  None of our suppliers are characterised in that way.  All of our main generators are typically using a mix of fuel.  In the case of the ESB, that mix comprises coal and gas and most other suppliers are supplying gas, albeit they also have renewables.  The increase in the price of coal and gas has hit most of the large generators and, therefore, there is not the same extent of supernormal profits that one might see, for example, in the case of a nuclear generator.  We do not have those.</p></speech>

That happens, for example, through dividends to the State.  The ESB has a critical role in the roll-out of new renewable generation, which is how we will reduce our dependence on Russian fossil fuels.  It also has a critical role in the building out of the distribution grid, the smart metering network and the energy efficiency measures that we need to deliver.  ESB has a massive capital programme and its profits in comparison with that are actually very small.  The ESB recently launched a new company strategy with ten core objectives which were hugely ambitious and to the benefit of the Irish people.  Its ability to invest in that plan is critical to our energy security and climate ambition.  It is also crucial in helping to shield householders.  The smart metering programme, for example, would allow us to introduce time-of-day pricing and so on so customers can start saving money by using power when the wind is blowing and energy is cheap rather than at peak times.  We need to strengthen and support ESB's ability to invest.  Most of the other energy companies are private.  Bord na M&oacute;na is doing a remarkable job of transforming from brown to green.  It has an enormous investment programme, particularly in renewable generation, that is showing real success.</p><p>I see our semi-State companies, in addition to other operators in the market, as having a role in helping us out of this crisis rather than being the cause of it.  The cause of it is Mr. Putin.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022030800002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement and update.  We are here to discuss the transfer of &euro;128.6 million from subhead B4 - residential and community retrofit - to subhead B11.  We discussed this move previously but were not clear about where and to what level the funding would be moved and where it would come from.  The Minister acknowledged that transfer but said the Department will maintain delivery outputs.  How can the Minister make that claim?  It seems contradictory to take &euro;128.6 million while still expecting to maintain delivery outputs.  It begs the question as to whether the Department's delivery outputs were too low in the first place or whether it over-allocated in the budget.  How can the Minister make the claim that delivery outputs will be maintained?</p> <p>  My second question concerns the degree to which this transfer has been energy poverty-proofed.  For example, &euro;62 million was approved for the better energy communities scheme in the revised Supplementary Estimate.  That figure has now been reduced to &euro;43 million so &euro;19 million has been taken from that budget.  That scheme has a specific role in energy poverty reduction, as acknowledged by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the Government's environmental assessment in 2020.  We are supporting this legislation and the transfer of this funding but at a departmental level, how was the decision made to identify the funding?  I would have thought areas of the Department's expenditure that were not specifically allocated to energy poverty reduction could have been more ideally targeted.  The Minister's figures for deep retrofits last year show 1,800 of those deep retrofits were achieved by the addition of solar PV, which is great.  This indicates that the houses that are benefiting from that were already cosy and well-insulated compared with others that might have a D, E or F building energy rating and need more significant work.  Within the range of options and funds available to the Minister, was there not more appropriate funding that would not impact on energy poverty reduction initiatives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022030800002#C00400"><p>Regarding the inflationary effects of energy price rises, particularly the rising cost of gas, which is driving up the cost of electricity, it was clear in most of the second half of last year that we were going to have to do something.  It relates to one of the measures we had in mind in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was to use some of the carryover we had, which I think was some &euro;57 million, as a result of an underspend last year because a lot of retrofitting could not take place last year due to Covid.  We decided to use some of that carryover - the &euro;128 million that has been transferred in the way described by the Deputy - to recognise that we would probably need it for some fuel price support measure.</p> <p>  The issue of the balance, social protection and energy poverty proofing must be taken into account in the wider context than the national retrofit plan, which was launched last November, and the very specific details announced two weeks ago.  I think it was a &euro;267 million package.  The design of that was very much done with addressing fuel poverty in mind.  I think something like &euro;118 million of that &euro;267 million is in the warmer homes 100% grant targeted at those on the lowest incomes.  There is also an allocation of &euro;85 million within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage targeting social housing retrofitting.  If we take those two sums, of the some one third of &euro;1 billion between the various measures, two thirds of it is targeted at energy poverty measures.  It was appropriate that the Government made the decision, particularly given that we had to act fast and did not want a further measure that was more universal in nature because even with all the planning as regards social welfare increases and the targeting of roughly &euro;200 million at social housing, there are people who fall through the gaps.  The benefit of a &euro;200 credit is that it gets to everyone quickly.  I believe that was the correct approach.  I think there was a call for that mix.  </p> <p>  In respect of whether we are reducing ambition, if at the end of this year, we find that the demand for and level of public interest in the retrofitting scheme is such that we are coming to the end of our budget and are unable to meet all demand, I am very confident I will be able to go back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, particularly in these circumstances when everything has to be focused towards energy efficiency and burning less Russian oil, coal and gas, and get a further Supplementary Estimate if we find demand outstrips supply.  Our biggest problem in recent years has been the opposite so I am confident.  This &euro;267 million programme is huge.  There has been massive expansion.  If that is not sufficient, I am confident we will be able to look for further funding because this is a significant priority for Government - not just for climate reasons but for energy security and fuel poverty reasons.</p></speech>

We will no doubt spend a lot of time in the months and years ahead tracking that and ensuring it gets delivered.  However, it does not address the decision to move &euro;128.6 million.  The better energy communities scheme has been identified as one that must reduce its spend in the year ahead.  To what degree is fuel poverty reduction prioritised in the decision-making process at departmental level?  Some of the options available to the Minister have a greater impact on reducing fuel poverty than others.  Notwithstanding the big spend, when the Minister made the decision relating to this scheme, what level of importance was given to fuel poverty bearing in mind that there has been a &euro;19 million reduction involving a transfer to a scheme that is universal?  That is acknowledged as a weakness across the board.  There has been a reduction of &euro;19 million relating to the better energy communities scheme, which is specifically targeted, at least in part, to reduce fuel poverty, and that money is being transferred to this universal scheme.</p></speech>

We must have a just transition, which is why it involves two thirds of spending going on those sorts of 100% grant-aided schemes.</p><p>However, it is not that alone.  It goes back to the budget in October, which was specifically designed in that way.  The decision to not only target the fuel allowance but include a mix of qualified child allowance, living alone allowance and the working family payment was based on a detailed analysis of how not to leave gaps.  If we were just relying on the fuel allowance or the warmer homes or community homes schemes, we could miss some people.  The blend of social welfare increases and the budgeted mechanisms are the key.</p><p> Another benefit of this universal scheme is that all those households benefit from this too.  It is important because for households on low income, the energy crisis represents a much higher percentage of their bills.  This is centre stage in our thinking.  There will have to be further measures.  What we are experiencing is an unprecedented challenge.</p></speech>

The CSO data on housing and energy use show a clear pattern where some areas with older buildings have very low and poor energy systems.  Is enough being done to have focused, area-based initiatives?  The retrofit programme is admirable in many of its intentions, particularly its focus on anti-poverty measures, but it seems to rely on sustainable energy communities to develop that area-based approach.  Otherwise it is individual applications to the one-stop shop.  Should the Government not try to go in with a focused offer to some of the more poorly insulated areas that could easily be identified on a map?</p> <p>  Is there greater clarity now on the low-interest loan?  The concept is that deep retrofits could be funded by loans that would be paid down from the savings from the energy bills.  That is a really important aspect of this if it can be made work.  Is the Government clearer on the rate?  Will it be 3%?  When can it go live?</p> <p>  I am conscious that there are 620,000 homes with smart meters but to our knowledge only 40,000 have access to options that could help them reduce the cost of energy by using electricity when it is cheaper or when renewables are on the grid.  Could initiatives be taken to activate those smart grids at this time of acute difficulty?</p> <p>  An issue that is arising again is our gas security.  Can the Corrib field be drawn on to supplement our supply at this time of very great difficulties or is its output fixed?  Is the traditional position of opposition to LNG up for review in the context of energy security or is it unchanged?</p> <p>  What is the Minister's view on the short-term contingency measures that may have to be prepared for in the context of the continuing conflict in Ukraine?</p></speech>

One way we will do that is with the new applications to the warmer home scheme   We will do that once we have cleared the backlog, which will be done quickly, of 7,000 houses that built up during the pandemic.  We are looking at the pre-1993 houses because the building regulations were changed in 1991.  Houses from 1993 tend to be above a BER D+ standard.  We are right to target those in that way.</p> <p>  The energy communities are the right way to do that.  It is up to 600, I think, so it is starting to take off.  That is a good mechanism but the Deputy is correct that we need to go further.  The one-stop shop system will allow companies that are operating as such to do exactly what the Deputy is suggesting, namely to go in and aggregate and market this to a community as something where they can provide a community solution or aggregated response.  Houses on an estate tend to all have the same fabric and energy structures.  The one-stop shop is geared towards that kind of aggregation of response, which is the right way to go.</p> <p>  On the loan, I was really hopeful that we would have something like 3.5% which would be a remarkably low interest rate in the current circumstances.  We do not have final confirmation of that.  </p> <p>  One reason for the summer-early autumn date is that it is unprecedented that the EIB would be involved.  It has never dealt in a loan system that is directly customer facing.  We have to tick all the boxes, dot all the i's and cross all the t's in the European mechanism.  It is on the edge of new, innovative financing.  I am confident it is going to work and will be hugely beneficial.  Even for people starting their work now, I am confident that it will be there in time for many who want to use it.</p> <p>  I agree about the potential use of smart metering as a mechanism.  As I mentioned in reply to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, pushing the time of day pricing and ensuring it is used is one way in which we can reduce our use of fossil fuels, allow households to save money by their management of energy use and benefit from the investment we have made in the smart metering programme.  That is the sort of measure we can look at.  The Government will probably look at two steps.  One is a more immediate response around the price issues we have now but beyond that the Department is looking at further ways by which we can accelerate or support energy efficiency measures.  That type of example may be one where we would work with the CRU, ESB Networks and others.  We can see if we can fast-track measures that we projected we would do in future and respond to this emergency crisis situation by advancing some of them now to help out householders.  I would not rule that out.</p> <p>  I would have to check the technical aspects but I think that the Corrib field is halfway through its lifetime.  It is the natural pressure from the field.  Corrib is not a very large gas field.  It was a fluke geologically.  It had a salt cap on it and it does not have any neighbouring fields.  It is a relatively simple pipeline connection into a processing centre.  My expectation is that the pressure from the field would drive the output.  It is not that easy to ramp up output and give us further supply. </p> <p>  We have other mechanisms.  Some of our power stations are adjacent to our oil stocks, which are often in the form of distillate that can be burned in power stations.  There would obviously have to be a connection.  Poolbeg is one example where we have a combined cycle gas plant adjacent to some of our strategic oil stocks.  That gives us some flexibility and capability.  In addition to the national reserve, the other power stations also retain some fuel.  We can change switch from gas to distillate and some of our oil reserves.</p> <p>  Even if we made a decision tomorrow on LNG and Shannon it would be a five- to ten-year delivery for anything and it would not address the immediate issue.  The wider strategic issue there is looking at what is advancing increasingly rapidly across European countries, which is the conversion of renewables particularly, offshore wind, through electrolysis for hydrogen.  I understand from the ESB is that it is very confident that any new power generation at Moneypoint, not as it now configured, or all new gas-fired power generation, will be hydrogen.</p><p>Those are some of the strategic questions we will have to look at.  However, that will not address the immediate crisis.  We have an immediate issue.  We are in a better position than most other European countries as we were only reliant on Russian gas for 2% to 4% of our gas supply.  We are more reliant on oil, at about 8% to 10%, and are now less reliant on coal.  The Moneypoint contract with Russia has concluded and further coal will come in from Colombia or other locations.  We are going to have to look at all those strategic matters but the more immediate issue is how we manage this and pushing efficiency and renewables as the immediate response to what is a fossil fuel induced crisis.  Dependence on fossil fuel is our core weakness at the centre of this crisis.</p></speech>

My first question follows on from Deputy O'Rourke's points about poverty-proofing and the use of departmental funds for the universal electricity rebate.  There have been talks about excise duty rates and a swing mechanism being put in place for that.  Has the Government had any discussions about VAT reductions?  Hitting the VAT and tax would have been a much more efficient way of doing it.  The premise behind the electricity rebate was that it was to be universal and quick but it could be six months before this measure actually hits people's bank balances or electricity accounts.  It certainly has not been quick and is not meeting people's needs now, whereas a reduction in VAT or excise would be an immediate reduction that people could feel.  It would also mean that the budget of the Department was not impacted by the measures.  As part of its toolbox for dealing with the fuel crisis, the EU has specified that VAT is one of the tools that should be used by governments.  Has the Government had any specific discussions with the EU on whether a penalty-free derogation could be applied, just because of the crisis we are in, when it comes to VAT measures?</p> <p>  On the swing mechanism that has been talked about for excise, what I have seen reported is that it will apply to the increase, so if there are any further increases in the price of fuel, the swing mechanism will come into play.  Does that mean the Government is essentially setting a cap at where we are at the moment?  Where we are at the moment is completely unacceptable and is putting huge pressure on families and businesses.  I am concerned that the Government thinks it is only the future increases that need to be dealt with through excise measures. </p> <p>  Regarding the one-stop shops and retrofitting, I understand that the portal is open and a number of applications have been made.  The last time I heard the Minister speak about this, he said the process should be complete this week.  Is that still on track?  When does he foresee the announcement of how many companies have registered under the one-stop shop process?  Will that be available shortly?</p> <p>  On just transition and ensuring we help the people who need it most, were there any conditions put onto companies registering as a one-stop shop?  Were there any conditions stating that they needed to be targeted in their approach?  As Deputy Bruton mentioned, that aggregate approach is the quickest and most efficient way, as someone could deal with all the houses in an estate in one go.  Is there a requirement on these companies to be targeted so they do not just pick the lowest-hanging fruit or the easiest and cheapest houses to retrofit?  It should be done on a socioeconomic basis or based on the age profile of the house.  Is there a requirement on these companies to provide a certain number of apprenticeships?  One of the problems we will face as this ramps up is the skills shortage and we need to address that.  If there was a requirement on these one-stop shops to provide a percentage of apprenticeships, that would be very positive.  Is that condition on them as well?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, it will be coming out with further revisions to the rule book and there are a variety of different mechanisms being used across Europe.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned some of the price caps.  Other mechanisms, such as revenues from the emissions trading system, ETS, and VAT, have been used.  There are a variety of different mechanisms, including excise duty.  We have not finalised any measures.  The Minister for Finance has a key role working within the European context and we will do further work in that regard.  I would not rule anything out.  Nothing is finalised.  There has been media commentary about a swing mechanism around excise duty, which has real advantages in terms of smoothing out and what happens if there is an excise cut and prices go up further.  However, there are difficulties around that legally so it may not be possible.  With regard to tax, we have to use legislation and make sure it is all legally correct.</p> <p>  While we are looking at additional measures, they will not protect fully from the scale of price increases.  We should be clear on that.  The increases are beyond compare.  If we did try to fully protect everything, that would have immediate effects on the other budgets the Exchequer has to fund, such as for education or social welfare.  We will have additional costs as a result of this crisis.  The &euro;500 million package, on top of what was done in the budget last October, was the right response.  We were not intending to do anything further until October but the war has changed that.  As I said, whatever mechanism is used will not be just on the tax side, on excise or VAT.  It will also have to be the mechanisms I was discussing with Deputy Bruton on the efficiency side as well.  If the State were to try to reverse all the global increases in coal, oil and gas prices, that would burst the budget.</p> <p>  With regard to the one-stop shop, aggregation and apprenticeships, we are on track.  I had a meeting with the officials yesterday and got an update on this.  We are on track to start announcing double figures in the next week.  My understanding is that the numbers already going through the process to get up and running in that timeframe are as we would expect.  We have a certain advantage in that we, and the SEAI in particular, have been working on this for 22 years.  The SEAI has been given very significant additional resources.  As well as the &euro;22 million the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science put in place for the green skills action programme in last year's budget, recognising those sorts of apprenticeships, we have a number of mechanisms in place.  The SEAI and the industry have built up expertise over 20 years of learning by doing, making mistakes and adjusting, so we are well placed to hit the ground running on this.  Not only has there been an incredible domestic response but we are hearing that the phones have been ringing off the hook at those apprenticeship schemes in recent weeks following that announcement.  That is encouraging.  We are well placed and will be able to deliver that sort of innovative use with the one-stop shop.  These companies will have to be good at getting the apprenticeships up and running and helping them find work but also targeting households and aggregating them. </p></speech>

With the remaining housing stock, we must get to every single house in the next three decades at the latest.  We must accelerate that.  It will not be targeted to the level of a particular company going to a particular house and another company going to different houses.

I will take the opportunity in the few minutes that remain to ask a few questions.  I apologise for perhaps straying from the Standing Orders and away from the Supplementary Estimate.  The energy crisis we have, and the cost of living challenge as a result of it, are inextricably linked with transport costs.  The Minister has two roles here as the Minister for energy and climate, and for transport.  It seems to me that in trying to address the cost-of-living challenge, we should look to the transport cost challenge people have.  If we are ambitious and radical to pursue aggressively modal shift in our cities in particular, and in rural areas if we can really ramp up the level of our bus services, these would seem a very realistic and effective way of addressing the cost-of-living challenges people have.  I expect that all across Europe these kinds of measures will be introduced and it would make sense we would do so in Ireland also.</p><p>My second question relates more to the Supplementary Estimate.  Maybe it is a question for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Will the Minister tell the committee anything about the windfall that has accrued to the State on the increase in energy prices?  Essentially, the &euro;200 rebate is the State paying back to people the extra tax it has received.  I accept this may be more of a question for the Minister of Finance, but the Minister, Deputy Ryan, might wish to comment.</p><p>My third question is around Europe's role in the more medium to long term.  The joint committee had some very interesting sessions this morning where we talked about the much bigger potential in Ireland to provide clean energy for our own needs and to contribute to Europe's needs.  There was a very interesting article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>by Dr. Hannah Daly, Dr. Diarmuid Torney,  Dr. Paul Deane, and Dr. Olexandr Balyk that really spoke to that.  It is a medium to long-term prospect, but with the energy and security crises on the other side of the Continent, we should be talking at the European level about accelerating as much as we can the opportunity Ireland has.  Perhaps the Minister will speak to those points.</p></speech>

One of the things we have been working on, and which we have agreed in the Cabinet subcommittee, is the establishment of new delivery task forces that would accelerate key areas for our climate ambitions, such as just transition, climate communications, and land use review, and in the three more immediately specific areas of the development of offshore renewables, the development of our domestic heating strategies, including what we are talking about today, and sustainable mobility.</p> <p>  The establishment of those teams, which are cross-cutting and bring officials from different Departments together, along with outside agencies and international expertise, means we recognise for the lifetime of this Government, which is the next three years, that we have an immediate delivery issue up to 2025.  We must accelerate key elements of what we need to do.  For example, in the offshore wind area we need to get phase 1 and phase 2. With phase 3, as the Chairman has said, we must give a clear direction to Europe that Ireland is the place to come for offshore wind.  Similarly, when it comes to retrofitting, we need to make sure we deliver on our ambitions for a scale of retrofitting, and we need to look particularly at district heating as well as retrofitting, including existing projects such as taking heat from the incinerators to heat some parts of the Dublin Bay area.  All of those projects will have a rapid three-year acceleration timetable, which these delivery task forces will monitor, manage, and oversee.</p> <p>  In sustainable mobility, while we will not be able to build the metro in the next three years, we have a good bit of the Cork metropolitan rail project done.  We can accelerate the active travel and BusConnects projects, especially in our five cities, and the Connecting Ireland rural bus transport system.  One of the delivery task forces is within the Department of Transport.  The leadership group there will look to see how we accelerate.  This is all the more important now given what is happening with the rising cost of fossil fuels and the energy security issues.  As it happens, today the Cabinet has just approved the decision on phase 1 for the BusConnects project for Dublin.  For example, we got a three-year timeline.  BusConnects was originally designed to take much longer, but there are some elements I hope we can accelerate to get the sustainable mobility shift the Chairman has spoken about.  The real project with my job in the two Departments for which I have responsibility and in working with others is delivering an accelerated programme of works in those areas.</p> <p>  On the energy prices question, the Chairman must ask that of the Minister for Finance.  I will be asking the Minister later this afternoon about what exactly is the windfall gain to the State.  To be honest, that is slightly false accounting in a way.  Yes, it does get State revenue, but we must remember Ireland is 90% dependent on imported fossil fuels for energy.  When the cost of energy goes up like that, the balance of payments situation for the State disimproves.  That money is going out of the country.</p> <p>  I will give a vivid example of that.  Prior to the immediate and recent invasion, Russia was getting in revenue from Europe in the region of &euro;350 million per day from exported gas, oil and coal.  An equivalent of this is that the United States of America has delivered a package of support to Ukraine of &euro;350 million, which is not insignificant, but that was a one-day receipt for the oil, gas and coal revenues for Russia.  Since the price escalation, that &euro;350 million figure is probably an historical figure and is now probably closer to &euro;1 billion per day, every day, day in, day out.</p> <p>  This is why in Europe there is an absolute clear determination.  I recently attended a meeting with EU energy ministers and an International Energy Agency meeting.  The real focus there is that we must stop that flow of money.  It will not be immediate sanctions on oil, gas or coal because this would further exacerbate our problem and put prices up.  The European Council will continue to look at that issue.  The underlying strategic imperative on divesting from fossil fuels has never been stronger.</p></speech>

The Minister's predecessor, Shane Ross, in one of his last acts as Minister introduced emergency legislation to facilitate the roll-out of active travel infrastructure in particular.  We are in a similar situation now.  Does the Minister, Deputy Ryan, believe there is merit in an emergency response?  Obviously, we will try to increase the level of active travel development in the next few years.  Ireland has an ambitious programme in that regard.  There is, however, an acute crisis now right now with regard to energy.</p><p>Facilitating active travel is certainly one of the solutions.  If we can develop active travel networks quickly using light infrastructure in all our towns and cities, we can make people far less dependent on driving and on expensive fossil fuels.</p></speech>

We need to act in education.  How will we deal with some of the people coming in?  I agree with the Chairman about sustainable mobility.  Where that worked during the Covid pandemic was through the local authorities.  This must be something that comes from the bottom up.  We need to be really flexible and fast but we cannot ignore local authorities bearing in mind their interest and knowledge of how we do that.  I agree that we should be looking at fast-tracking and accelerating, but it also needs to come from the bottom up.  I will have a meeting with representatives from Limerick City and County Council this Friday and that is the message I will give them.  I will ask them if they are up for it and what we could do if we were really thinking outside the box.  The benefit of that is not just in reducing usage of fossil fuels and taking on Mr. Putin at the pump, as it were; it is also helping us with a better environment and better climate, and making it a more attractive place for everyone to live.  It cannot be forced; it also needs to come from the bottom up.</p></speech>

There is concern that there is an issue with supply of transport fuel and home heating oil.  Is that the case?  I am hearing different things in different places.  It is important to hear what the Minister has to say about it.  I appreciate the difficult context we are in.  In the days, weeks and months ahead, how will the Minister ensure we avoid profiteering or hoarding of fuels?  Does he have plans to regulate the market to ensure fair distribution of fuels?  He indicated there would be specific Government measures in October but in light of recent events, decisions may need to be made in the near future.  When will they be made?</p></speech>

We have supplies to meet normal demand.  They are slightly nervous about that sort of profiteering or storing and that is why they have introduced some measures to discourage that, as reported in today's newspapers.  If everyone keeps their head and follows proper processes, we will have sufficient supply.  As I said, Russian oil represents only a small percentage of our imports and Russian gas represents a very small percentage.  Therefore, we are probably in a better security situation than others, but we will keep it under review.</p> <p>  What was the Deputy's second question?</p></speech>

He mentioned what was reported in the newspapers.  My second question related to the timeline for decisions from Government to mitigate the problem.</p></speech>

We will look at further measures but it cannot be a cure-all because the price rise is so large.  I will also be looking at a range of efficiency measures in the coming weeks to help people reduce their usage.  That will be the key one.</p> <p>  I should have mentioned that I was at a meeting of the International Energy Agency last week.  There was a call there for countries to contribute towards a release of emergency reserves.  We were happy to sign up to that as part of a solidarity response to what is happening in Ukraine.  I believe we will be releasing approximately 227,000 barrels of our strategic reserves as part of that united International Energy Agency effort.</p> <p>  We will need to continue to review and monitor this.  We will not be able to protect against all the impacts, but we will do everything we can to try to minimise then.  Government is reviewing this.  There is a meeting of Secretaries General every week.  Cabinet has a separate line item on the monitoring and managing of the crisis.  This is unprecedented and we will need to be flexible and keep an eye on every aspect of it.</p></speech>

All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via MS Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.</p><p>Please note that, in order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to continue wearing face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others.  We ask them to please be respectful of other people's physical space.  They are also asked to adhere to any public health advice.</p><p>I remind members that, should a vote be called, they must physically come to the committee room in order to vote.</p><p>Before we resume our consideration of the Bill, I advise the Minister and members that two supplementary amendments have been added in the name of Deputy Cairns.  These are amendments Nos. 352<i>a</i>and 359<i>a</i>and have been grouped with amendments Nos. 117 and 146 for discussion.</p><p>A revised grouping list was circulated to members by the Bills Office and hard copies are available from the secretariat.</p><p> To remind myself more than anyone else, but also anyone watching, we will move and discuss a group of amendments together.  The proposers will have time to discuss that, the Minister will respond, there will be a discussion at that point and a further chance for the Minister to respond, after which we will put the question.  At each point where there is a grouping of amendments, that is the opportunity to discuss all amendments in that grouping and all of them must be discussed at that point.  However, amendments will still be considered for voting one by one.  There may be an amendment that we are discussing that we do not get to vote on until later today or even the next session, depending on how we go.  If there are procedural issues, we can pause the meeting and go into private like we did previously.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 77 removes the ambiguity around language.  A person's medical information is the person's personal data and the person has a fundamental right under EU law to access that data, and not merely information contained in a record for which a person may apply.  GDPR law makes it clear that medical data should be released, not information contained in the data.</p><p>Amendment No. 167 seeks to amend the unacceptable constraint on affected people's access to personal data.  Items of this nature which were left with an adoption agency or an institution are highly unlikely to have been provided for anyone else's benefit.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 173 to 179, inclusive, are very similar to amendment No. 77.  They again remove ambiguity around language.</p><p>The last group, amendments Nos. 196, 219, 252 and 257, seeks to remove the restrictions on what medical data is shared.  Basically, we have proposed these amendments with regard to vital medical information being shared.  They are all very similar.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#G00300"><p>I propose these amendments for the same reasons.  Amendment No. 77 is important.  It just shows the power of language and what is meant in this Bill.  The substitution of the word "records" for "information" is vital.  Information implies that whoever is the holder of the record can decide what is released, and that is the crux of the problem.  We are going to have a situation where that is going to have to be challenged and go through that whole process before it can be decided whether somebody has not released the full information.  That is wrong.  It should not be in this, particularly when we are dealing with a group of people who have had everything that the State has done against them to this point.  We should be making it easier for them now.  It shows the importance of language and of a simple word like that.  For that reason this amendment should be accepted.  I do not see that it would impact significantly on the legislation.  It would remove a lot of the burden of complying with the legislation as well, because rather than having to decide which information one does or does not want to release, the assumption is that one would release everything.  That is important.</p> <p>  In summary, the other amendments are the same.  They seek to change and put in words and I am happy to support them.  We will also be opposing a section at a later stage.  I cannot remember what number it is, but that will be included as well.</p></speech>

It is an important departure, providing proactive responses to the rights of adopted people.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#G00600"><p>I thank the Deputies for the amendments.  I will take amendments Nos. 77 and 173 to 178, inclusive, and speak to them first.  Then I will speak on the other amendments.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 77 and 173 to 178, inclusive, seek to replace the word "information" with the word "records" in respect of the provision of medical information.  The goal of the amendments appears to be to ensure that where a person applies to receive his or her medical information, he or she is assured that he or she will receive actual copies of the relevant documents where such records are available.  We cannot accept the text of the amendments as submitted here because of consistency grounds.  As they are here, they will remove the fundamental entitlement to medical information.  That is just the way they are drafted.  However, I am in full agreement with the spirit of the amendments.  The intention of this provision was always that an applicant's medical information and the records on which the person's medical information is held would be released directly to the applicant in full.  As such, I am happy to accept amendments Nos. 77 and 173 to 178, inclusive, in principle and I will table amendments on Report Stage to reflect what is provided for here.  This was an oversight in this section.  It should have provided for access to both the information and copies of the records on which this information is based.  It is because this section was originally combined with others and it has evolved over time, so I will bring forward amendments to reflect that on Report Stage.</p></speech>

It is very helpful to hear it.  These amendments were clearly put forward in the spirit of ensuring that adopted people would have access to full records, not to information about records.  What all of us who were engaged in the hearings during pre-legislative scrutiny heard from adopted persons and organisations representing adopted persons was the real hunger to have access, as should be their right, to the original records about their birth, not to any types of secondary sources for information about them.  I welcome the Minister's indication that he accepts the amendments in principle.  That is very helpful.  It will help to ensure the Bill is changed constructively to reflect more precisely not just the right to information about records but the right of access to records, which is what we all want to see enshrined in law.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 79, 80, 165, 166, 168 to 172, inclusive, 226 to 228, inclusive, 258 and 260 will be discussed together.</p><p>I move amendment No. 79:</p><blockquote>	In page 12, to delete lines 16 to 25. </blockquote><p>I will speak to amendment No. 80 at this stage.  Others may also wish to come in.  It provides for a broader definition for a &ldquo;provided item&rdquo;, moving beyond &quot;another person involved in the provision of care&quot; to &quot;another person connected to&quot;.  Amendment No. 226 removes a clause which could be interpreted as restrictive.  Amendment No. 227 again provides for a proactive measure to oblige the relevant body to locate the data controller for the items being sought.  This is about granting every mechanism to facilitate adopted people and other relevant people in accessing information.  Amendment No. 228 removes the restriction on adopted people being permitted access to specific items.  Amendment No. 260 is similar to No. 227 in that it facilitates persons in accessing information.</p></speech>

The Minister has refused amendments based on the likely unavailability of information or even the existence of such information.  This restriction falls into that category.  In this case, the provision of items is dependent on knowledge of the motivation behind the leaving of the item with the relevant bodies, which seems to be an unnecessary obstacle.  Amendment No. 260 is similar to No. 227 in facilitating persons' access to information.</p></speech>

The whole purpose behind this legislation is to provide adopted people with information.  We have discussed the various categories of information.  However, its purpose is also to provide them with provided items.  If anything was left for them by their family members, they should be entitled to it.  That is why we have drawn this broad definition.  It is not a random definition or something that was concocted quickly.  It has been worked on and thought about in the context of this legislation.  That is really important to state.  Every definition here has been thought about in a lot of detail to ensure it interacts properly with the rest of this legislation and also with other legislation.  Where we have recognised that the definitions we have do not square with everything, as was the case with the last amendment, we are happy to admit that and bring forward changes.  However, we do not believe that the changes Deputies have proposed here are appropriate.</p> <p>  As it currently stands, the definition sets out the different items that may be contained within records that must be released in all cases.  The types of items included in the definition are letters, photographs, mementoes or any other documents or objects.  The list provided in the legislation on page 12 is not exhaustive.  That is really important.  It also provides for the different types of people who may lodge a provided item.  This includes parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles and first cousins.  Both items placed on historic files and items provided through the contact preference register that will be established under this legislation are provided for.</p> <p>  I cannot support amendment No. 79.  As I have said, the definition of a "provided item" is central to ensuring clarity and consistency and guaranteeing the release of items and it provides an important mechanism through which historic items can be shared with the person to whom they relate and family members will be allowed to share contemporaneously provided items.</p> <p>  Again, I cannot support amendment No. 80.  The definition of a "provided item" was carefully considered in the drafting of the Bill and the list of persons who can deposit provided items was carefully considered in that drafting.  To make it clear, the ability to lodge a provided item with the authority under section 39(1) is not the only way in which a person can share information.  The robust statutory tracing service established under Part 8 of this legislation provides for information to be shared or requested while maintaining the level of contact a person is comfortable with.  It is important that the tracing service allows the person initiating the trace and the person on the other end of the trace to have the final say with regard to the degree of contact they want.</p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 165, 166, 168 to 172, inclusive, 226 to 228, inclusive, 258 and 260, I again cannot support the amendments.  In terms of the threshold for the release of information, it is important to note that, as it stands, the section does not stipulate the threshold of proof required to fulfil the criteria in respect of a specified item or provided item for the purposes of being made available to the relevant person.  I will be publishing policy guidelines in respect of that.  We discussed the issue of the provision of policy guidelines when we discussed similar amendments last week.  These guidelines will confirm the ability of the bodies to release provided items.  In the future, any provided items lodged under section 39(1) will fall under the criteria of specified items or items provided for the purpose of being made available to the same person and their release will not require any degree of discretion.</p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 168 and 172, while I understand the intention behind these amendments, it is important to note that the application process is important for a number of reasons, the most significant of these being that relevant persons have complete control over the categories of information they are seeking and wish to access.  That is important.  We want to maintain that process.  </p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 171, 227 and 260 seek to place an obligation on both the agency and the authority to seek out records that they do not hold without any certainty that they exist.  Again, the whole purpose behind this legislation is to require the authority or the agency to release all information it has.  It will not have a choice or discretion but must release that information.  These amendments ask the authority or agency to go looking for information that it does not have and that it does not even know exists.  We have spoken about division of resources and the need to allow these agencies to focus on the delivery of what will be, in the initial years, a significant amount of information.  To ask them to go looking for information when they do not know whether it exists is not a good use of the resources of either the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, or Tusla when large numbers of people are on waiting lists whose information is available and there to be released.  There is also the question of how we would ever know whether this obligation has been fulfilled.  How do you ever know if an agency has done all it can to find information that you do not know exists?  This provision is not workable and, as such, I cannot support it.</p></speech>

Again, this speaks to the concern that we touched on at the end of our discussion the last day, the sense among many adopted people that there was a culture of not releasing information.  When you look at the history in this area, there was definitely such a culture in the past.  As I stated the last day, we are doing two things to address that culture, beyond this legislation which clearly provides for a legal basis and legal obligation to release information.  One is the establishment of the implementation group, headed by my Department, which brings together Tusla, AAI and the Department to talk about the approach to be taken.</p><p>Officials from my Department have met those who will lead the implementation of this legislation and both agencies to talk about the change in culture.  I know Mr. Bernard Gloster has appeared before this committee and members have spoken to him.  It is very clear that he realises the need for a change in culture particularly in Tusla regarding its culture of release of information.  Beyond that there is also the publication of guidelines.  If a future Minister believes that the changing culture is not being manifest, those guidelines can be tightened and refined to ensure that we get full release of all information.</p></speech>

It is incorrect that any institution that was established or operated for the purposes of providing care to children in residence may be added to the Schedule because section 5 states that only the Minister may add to the Schedule.  This means a significant number of the 182 institutions, agencies and individuals involved in separating unmarried mothers from their children will still be exempt from the legislation.</p><p>Amendment No. 107 seeks to expand again to include any individual or organisation that operated in this State for the purposes of care to children.  Amendment No. 108 changes the connotation making it irrelevant whether the State had regulatory inspection function.  Amendment No. 357 again seeks to expand the remit of the Bill to provide a mechanism for adopted people and mothers to access the administrative records of institutions, agencies and individuals involved in forced family separation.  We know that this was widespread and the people affected by this practice often feel they have no right to ask for information.  It is therefore imperative that forced family separation is included in the Long Title of the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendments numbers 93 to 101, inclusive, expand the definition of secondary information source to include the very wide range of actors that we know were involved in the adoption process.  The current list does not make explicit reference to any persons or organisations involved in facilitating adoptions, the care of adopted people and family separation.  Given the realities of the adoption process, it is important for these amendments to be made to make specific reference to these persons as potential sources of information.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 96 to 101, inclusive, introduce reference to any Roman Catholic Church or Church of Ireland bodies or organisations as secondary information sources.  Obviously, given the scale of involvement of those bodies in the adoption process, it is crucial that they are explicitly referenced as secondary information sources.</p></speech>

It is vital to expand the list to include those.  This goes back to what we were saying on the last grouping of amendments about the need for people to be assured that the legislation will provide for all those bodies to be included.  This ties in with GDPR and the information available for people to request.  I fully support these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#K00050"><p>The context is on page 13 of the legislation where we have the definition of prescribed secondary sources. This definition includes a list of bodies that, on the enactment of the legislation, are immediately designated as secondary information sources.  These include the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the data controller of the Access to Institutional and Related Records archive, AIRR, the HSE, a registered adoption society, and an accredited body.  Importantly, the definition also allows a Minister to designate a secondary information source under section 43 (2).  The power of the Minister, that is me or any future Minister, to designate other groups as a secondary information source under this legislation is a key element.</p> <p>  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 93 to 101, and 107 and 108.  They seek to expand the list of secondary information sources within the legislation itself.  Again, I do not believe this is necessary because the power is already included under section 43(2), to designate other bodies, and any body so designated would be classified as a secondary information source.</p> <p>  Section 43(2) empowers a Minister to prescribe additional information sources.  The proposed addition of amendments Nos. 94 to 108 is unnecessary.  Importantly, it would also generate obligations on an unclear list of people.  It is unclear who would come within the definition of an organisation involved in the care of a relevant person.  That would appear to potentially engage every organisation that has provided a health or social care service at every stage of a person's life.  What is being proposed here is an absolutely vast array of coverage, which goes far beyond the focus of what this Bill is trying to achieve.  The list currently included in the published Bill was carefully considered through consultation with stakeholders and organisations that are currently operating in the area of adoption information release and tracing, or that hold specific sets of historical records.</p> <p>  Additionally, secondary information sources are relevant only in their obligation to safeguard relevant records under Part 7.  This is very important.  We are talking about the safeguarding element here.  The legislation already provides a catch-all requirement for any person or organisation in possession of a relevant record, to safeguard it and to inform the authority that it holds that relevant record under section 46.  There is already a catch-all provision there under section 46.</p> <p>  I intend to make regulations designating further relevant bodies and secondary information sources.  Private entities, church bodies and religious congregations can be so designated.  It is important in designing those regulations that they are carefully constructed to clearly and accurately identify the relevant holder of records.  For example, Tusla now holds many of the institutional records, which people may believe are in the possession of religious congregations.  As we are aware, a huge amount of the information that was held by the congregations, especially those who ran mother and baby home and county home institutions, has already been transferred over to Tusla.  At different dioceses or parish levels there may be baptismal records, which would be highly valuable for relevant persons.  Again, we are using the regulation power under the legislation to design it carefully so we can have regulations that target exactly the relevant record holders, so we can deliver records to people, rather than the extremely broad brush approach proposed here that brings far too much potential information far beyond what this legislation is designed to cover, and which causes real difficulties in the future.</p> <p>  I wish to be clear that there are mechanisms set out in the legislation, primarily the ability to designate a secondary information source under section 43(2), and separately, the ability of the catch-all subsection in section 46 to address issues of concern here.</p></speech>

There may be some confusion, and perhaps we could get clarity on this.  The Bill defines early life care information as the information gathered from birth up until the age of 18.  Section 2 (2) states that a person's early life care information only covers the period after the birth only until the time the child is adopted.  Perhaps we could get clarity on that.</p></speech>

It is included for accuracy and precision in the terms of drafting.  The reason I cannot accept the amendment is because it would delete the section entirely and offers no substitution or alternative for it.  In the case of an adopted person, this time period ends where they were adopted.  In the case of someone who was the subject of an illegal birth registration the period ends at the time their social parents took over responsibility for them.  </p><p> The legislation that we have here is primarily aimed at supporting relevant persons to exercise their right to identity through access to information relating to the origin of their birth and early life and for individuals affected, this can only be fully inserted and achieved through clear access via statutory pathway to the information that is on the historic files.  We know this information will guarantee that for the first time.  The amendment, however, seeks to remove this focus and instead extend the period until the relevant person is 18 years old.  It is important that this amendment will have no practical purpose because if a person is adopted at the age of 12 years there will be no further information held by adoption agencies about them because they will now be with their adopted parents.  Saying that there will be early life information about them and extending that up to the age of 18 years would not work in this situation.  There will only be early life and care information about them for the length of time that they are in an institution.  That ends at the time they are either adopted or, as we know in certain cases, the subject of an illegal birth registration.  That is why we do not feel that this is correct.  If this amendment is followed through, a lacuna will be left open for no valuable purpose.  </p></speech>

The definition of incorrect birth registration is purposely constructed so that a person who is the subject of an illegal birth registration will always come within the scope of the definition even after the correction to the birth register.  Therefore on the grounds of accuracy, the amendment simply removes the redundant words &quot;or has been&quot; to this reference to persons affected by an illegal birth registration.

If I leave and return, that is the reason.  I was afraid that we might get to this section after I had to leave so I am glad that I have the opportunity to speak because this is one of the key sections.  It is one of the key contentious issues.  If you took everything else away this might be best described as the red line.  It relates to the mandatory information session.  People feel very strongly that if a parent registers a no contact preference that they would then be asked to attend a meeting.  Regardless of whether it is with a social worker, in an in-person meeting, over Zoom or a phone call, people feel very strongly that they do not want it to take place.  It should not inhibit them getting access to their birth certificates and other information.  People feel that there is an attitude that the State knows best.  It is something that arose a lot at our committee hearings.  The committee did recommend the use of registered post and that has since been discussed in the D&aacute;il and so on.  I feel very strongly that it is an alternative we should look at putting in place.  This is one part of the Bill that I would not be able to accept at all.  We need to go back to the drawing board on the whole area of a mandatory information session.  It is not right or fair on individuals looking for their birth certificate.  There is a fear about what exactly will be said at these meetings.</p><p>From the State's point of view, I do not really understand why it would not be better to have a registered letter because it is there in black and white and nobody can say that something was said at a meeting that was not said.  It is a lot more straightforward.  I know there will be many arguments as to why that is not the case but I feel very strongly about it.  I know people are very upset about it and they wanted us to communicate the view that they do not want a mandatory information session in any way, shape or form regardless of whether it is just a phone call, which might not seem like a big deal to people but really is.  It is important that their rights and wishes are respected and that this is changed.  </p></speech>

It is quite telling that with the exception of Deputy Pringle, the only people here really speaking on the amendments are women and now we are all going to speak on International Women's Day so it is bad timing in terms of the schedule.  I think the Chairman and everybody else is really aware of the highly contested issue around mandatory information sessions that we heard time and time again throughout pre-legislative scrutiny.  People find it really insulting and upsetting and I do not think anyone understands why it is still there.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 145 concerns the information sessions for young people aged 16 to 18.  The same arguments against mandatory information sessions in general apply to them.  Amendment No. 208 relates to a reference in section 19 to the mandatory information session, which the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Counsel identified as a real barrier in accessing information.  It seeks to remove reference to the session.  We hashed all these arguments out in the D&aacute;il Chamber and in this committee and there is broad agreement around the mandatory information session.  I really hope it is reconsidered.  </p></speech>

It is amazing when you read it because all this information can be accessed from other sources anyway and people have been doing that.  To single out adopted people and tell them they must go through this process is completely wrong.  I would even have doubts about using a registered letter to them outlining the responsibilities or the fact that the information is there but I think this is really wrong, cannot be contemplated and should not be in this legislation.  These people must be the only people in the State singled out and treated differently regarding access to birth certificates, which is completely wrong.  I could be wrong but I would like to be proven wrong.</p></speech>

My amendments in this grouping are Nos. 119 to 122, inclusive; Nos. 123 to 126, inclusive; Nos. 132 to 137, inclusive; and No. 144.  I have other amendments in the next grouping as well, all of which relate to the mandatory information session, which as we have all heard and know, is the most contentious issue in the Bill as it currently stands.  We know the long history and that what is being proposed by the Minister and Department is an improvement on what went before in terms of conditions on access but nonetheless requiring a information session means that access remains conditional.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, all of us devised an alternative arrangement involving a registered post letter, which we believed would have answered the arguments made by the Minister and Department about some sort of communication and would have been infinitely preferable to requiring an information session.</p> <p>  There are two key points.  What happens if an adopted person refuses to engage or does not wish to engage in the information session?  I know the Minister talks about untrammelled access to information but the reality is that there is that condition that the records cannot be released unless the information session is engaged in and there does not seem to us to be any recourse to be had if a person does not wish to engage in that information session so it is a condition on access.  I cannot see how it could not be.  These amendments are designed to remove that condition on access.  Amendment No. 199 in the next group will replace it with a registered post provision similar to the recommendation in our report.  </p> <p>  The second point, which was made by Deputy Cairns, is that we took the view that registered post would also be a safer option from everyone's point of view because it sets out in writing any issues whereas the content of a phone call can be very problematic.  It can be very difficult for somebody in a vulnerable position to take a phone call and it can be very difficult to establish what was said in a phone call or have any clarity or record of what was said in a phone call.  To require mandatory information sessions and say it can be done by phone still amounts to a condition on access to the data, records and actual life information of the individual.  It also seems to be less safe and secure than the registered post option we suggested to meet the constitutional argument that was made by the Department to ensure there would be free right of access to information and birth records.  </p></speech>

This section is central to this legislation and is central to us being able to ensure that if this legislation is challenged, it will be found to be constitutional.  That is a very real risk.  Many of the difficulties adopted people face in this area are the result of a constitutional challenge about the release of information in the case of  I. O'T <i>v</i>. B.  I know there are many criticisms of the way in which it has interpreted by courts, successive Governments and State agencies but nevertheless that case has had a massive influence.  That was a situation where a parent challenged the release of information so we are not talking in the abstract here.  Because of the fraught history of adoption in this country, the secrecy around it and the need for secrecy that is still experienced by some adopted people and, in particular, some mothers, this is a fraught area so we must design legislation that is not at risk of being found to be unconstitutional.</p><p>We are trying to balance two sets of constitutional rights here.  Much of our discussion at this point has been about the right of the adopted person to their identity.  This is a right that successive Irish Governments and legislation have failed to vindicate.  We must say this upfront.  Adopted people have been failed when it comes to the vindication of their right to identity.  The right to identity is now recognised by the courts as an unenumerated right and a constitutional right and it is recognised under EU law as well.  With this legislation, we are seeking to vindicate that right.  However, there is another set of rights holders in many of these cases.  This involves a parent seeking to exercise their right to privacy.  Again, it is important for us to realise that we cannot make any value judgments about the decision of a parent to exercise that right.  If a parent wishes to remain anonymous from a child they gave up for adoption, that is their right and that is an exercise of their right to privacy.  We may think it is terrible that they must feel that need, and it is something I personally feel, but it is not my decision to make.  It is their exercise of their privacy right, which is a constitutional right.  It is important that we balance constitutional rights in this situation.  </p><p>One of the amendments here proposes to delete this section in its entirety - this balancing section set out by the information session.  I very much wish to put on the record that if this section is deleted in its entirety, this Bill will be constitutionally flawed because there will be no recognition of privacy rights and this will be easily struck down by any future court.  </p><p>In terms of how the balancing mechanism we are bringing forward in this legislation works, an adopted person seeks access to their information.  The agency looks at the contact preference register.  Where a preference accepting contact is put on the contract preference register or there is no entry in the register, all information is immediately provided to the adopted person.  Nothing more needs to happen.  All information is released through whatever mechanism the adopted person wants.  If they want it sent to them in written or photocopied form, that is fine.  If they want it in an email, that is fine.  If the agency finds that there is a no-contact preference, which is something a parent will have proactively do following the introduction of the three-month public information campaign that will follow the passing of this legislation, and the parent has decided they want it registered that they do not want contact, the agency will call the adopted person or undertake an online or in-person meeting.</p><p>It is important to remember that it can be by way of a telephone call as well.  In that telephone call, three elements will be discussed.  First, the designated person, who no longer has to be a social worker because we took on board people's concerns about a social worker, will inform the adopted or boarded-out person of the entitlement of the relevant person to obtain his or her birth certificate and birth information related to him to her, as the case may, in accordance with this Act.  Second, &quot;that the parent concerned has stated, in accordance with this Act, that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person&quot;.  The third element is the &quot;importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights of the parent and the preference of the parent referred to in <i>paragraph (b)</i>&quot;.  That is the content of the telephone call as set down clearly in legislation.  I have heard the concerns that adopted people have expressed about the content of that telephone call.  I propose to bring forward an amendment to section 17(2)(c), which we will have an opportunity to discuss later on.  <br/><br/>That is the process.  After the telephone call has taken place and those three points have been conveyed to the relevant person - the adopted person - the full information is provided for.  We are going from a situation where a statement by a parent that he or she wanted to exercise his or her privacy rights meant an adopted person got nothing to one where, when a parent exercises his or her privacy rights, the above mentioned elements are conveyed to the adopted person by way of telephone call and the adopted person gets everything.  That is the scale of the change we are talking about here.  It is important to understand the scale of that change because that is a huge limitation on the privacy rights of the parent.  The balance has entirely shifted from one that favoured the privacy rights of the parent in almost every situation, and led to adopted people being so restricted for so long, to a situation where the privacy rights of the parent are restricted.  Parents cannot now keep their names from the adopted person in any situation.  All they can do is, through this process, have their no-contact preference conveyed to the adopted person.  It cannot be enforced.  In previous drafts, the adopted person was asked to sign a statutory undertaking, which later changed to a non-statutory undertaking.  In one of the earlier drafts, there was a criminal prohibition on the adopted person contacting the parent.  All of that is removed.  All that has to take place now is this meeting.  <br/><br/>Why have we chosen the idea of an information session?  It is important to reference that this is not something that came from my Department.  Rather, it this is something that has been discussed as a means of balancing those sets of rights.  I will refer to a couple of documents from outside of my Department.  In their analysis of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 introduced by former Minister, Katherine Zappone, a group of academics brought forward an opinion on the Irish Constitution and EU general data protection regulations.  The academics are people well known to us, including Dr. Conor O'Mahony, Dr. Fred Logue, Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, Dr. James Gallen, Dr. Eoin Daly, Mair&eacute;ad Enright, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Ring, Rossa McMahon and Dr. Laura Cahillane.  They did a detailed analysis on the previous legislation.  It is a lengthy piece, with which, I am sure, members are familiar, but I would like to cite paragraph 30.  It states:</p><blockquote>	Thus, in order for legislation in the area of adoption information and tracing to be deemed unconstitutional, it must be shown that the law is arbitrary and lacks an objective basis.  It is on this basis that we submit that the Constitution does permit the Oireachtas to legislate in the manner proposed by several Senators earlier this year: providing automatic access to identifying information for people who were adopted in the past following an information session, and accompanied by a fully resourced voluntary National Adoption Contact Preference Register and voluntary tracing service. </blockquote><p>Again, the concept of the information meeting is set out in that detailed piece.  I refer also to the draft Bill, namely, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2019, that was put forward by the Adoption Rights Alliance in 2019, which was an effort by that organisation, which has been very active in this area, to seek to balance the conflicting rights, the privacy right of a parent with the right to identity of an adopted person.  I will set out sections 25(1) to 25(3), inclusive, of that draft Bill:</p><blockquote>	(1) An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir shall on an application made in the prescribed manner by an adopted person, a record of whose birth is kept by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and who has reached the age of 18 years supply to that person on payment of the prescribed fee (if any) such information as is necessary to enable that person to obtain a certified copy of the record of his/her birth. <br /><br />(2) It shall be the duty of the Independent Information Service to provide an information session to the adopted person, the format of which shall be prescribed in consultation with the Adoption Advisory Group.  The information session shall serve the following purposes:   	(a) To inform the adopted person about the records held by the Independent Information Service about them; <br /><br />(b) To provide the adopted person with information on how to read and understand adoption records;<br /><br />(c) To inform the adopted person of the existence of the tracing service provided by the Agency;<br /><br />(d) To inform the adopted person of the existence of the National Adoption Contact Preference Register.  (3) An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir shall not supply a person who was adopted before the date on which this Act was passed with any information under subsections (1) and (2) of this section unless that person has attended an information session as prescribed under subsection (3) of this section. </blockquote><p>It is important to make the point that in terms of this effort to address issues with the previous legislation - I regret Deputy Bacik is leaving because I am about to cite her - Deputy Bacik stated:</p><blockquote>	the Minister could make provision for an option, such as that provided for in Averil Power's Bill, that those who do not wish to sign an undertaking could have an alternative option, such as a meeting a social worker or counsellor, as provided for.  Provision of such a meeting would have to ensure that it would not become unduly burdensome on those seeking to avail of the option, but this is a simple and practical way to get around this difficulty. </blockquote><p>Two years later, Deputy Bacik and colleagues brought forward an information session almost identical to the information session provided for in this legislation.  It is important to put that on record because there is a sense out there that this is some crude mechanism that is being introduced to inflict further injury and insult on adopted people when it is a mechanism that has been suggested by a range of highly knowledgeable sources to address that really difficulty and tricky situation we are grasping with, namely, how to reconcile those two sets of privacy rights.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#N00200"><p>If I may, I would like to come in on that point before I have to leave to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It is a case of unfortunate timing.  The Minister is quoting back to me, as I had anticipated.  I have been measured in my comments.  I acknowledge that this is a far preferable option that the Minister is presenting us with as a means of balancing rights.  A few years ago, when we proposed the information session as an alternative to the signing of the statutory declaration and so on, that would have been preferable but things have moved on.  Just as incremental change becomes embedded and then more radical change is necessary, so too with the journey of this legislation, if I might put it that way.  It started out with a whole series of different conditions being placed on access to records.  </p><p>At the point I put forward the information session, I was working very closely with the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, to try to achieve a compromise in order that we could get the legislation through.  That was the intent.  That was everyone's desire at the time, most of all adopted persons.  We did work on different methods of doing that but at the time, the information session was opposed by the Attorney General as being unduly protective of the privacy rights of the birth mother.  The reality is we could not get that passed.  Clearly, things have shifted at the Attorney General's Office, but so too have they shifted in terms of our understanding of the rights of identity or of privacy rights.  The I.O'T <i>v. </i>B.case is now even more dated.  There is no specific right of privacy in the Constitution.  We are still relying on that interpretation in I.O'T <i>v. </i>B. and, clearly, the Attorney General's view has changed over the years.  It is fair to say that in terms of what would have been acceptable and preferable some years ago, the understanding has moved on.  That is the spirit in which I offered these amendments.  It is the spirit of our consensus in the pre-legislative scrutiny in terms of the registered post option put forward in the report.  I hope to return to the meeting.</p></speech>

We had that conversation around the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and law.  There is a recognition now that GDPR applies here, therefore, people have a right to this information.  Saying there is a constitutional barrier is ridiculous.  There is no constitutional barrier to people accessing their information.  It is also acting like this Bill is doing them some kind of favour.  Ultimately, it is worth questioning whether we even need this Bill and legislation.  If we just acknowledged people's rights to their information, we would not be sitting here having long debates about these things.</p><p> The other false narrative that is continuously spun, to the point where even Opposition Deputies are saying the same lines, is that we must balance the right of the parent to his or her privacy with the right of the adopted person's right to information.  That is not based on any kind of reality.  What we heard at committee during pre-legislative scrutiny was that more people are registering a no-contact preference who are the adopted people, and not the parents.  There is this constant narrative that what the Government and this legislation is doing is trying to protect the parents who have a right to privacy.  Where has that come from?  We hear these constant lines that are based on no reality, as far as I can tell.  After what was a long process of pre-legislative scrutiny with different representative organisations and people appearing before the committee, of course, we had loads of personal engagement with individuals who have been affected by this.  The narrative creates this feeling of trying to protect parents from their children.  It is unnecessary and untrue.</p><p> Finally, the Minister made a point at the end of his contribution about section 30.  He referenced people like Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Dr. Fred Logue and suggested that an information session is a must-have.  That is really the opposite of what we heard from experts.  He said it has been recommended by many reputable sources.  We heard it refuted by many reputable sources at committee that we do not need that mandatory information session.  That seems to me like cherry-picking information to argue for something that is unnecessary and which people have highlighted repeatedly.  It is insulting for them.  As Deputy Bacik said, the suggestion, which the Minister cited, came from years ago when people were still trying to get this legislation moving.</p><p> We have come a long way from there, and not only we in the Oireachtas but the whole country, in terms of saying enough of these different barriers and things being put in place, and these kinds of narratives around people's situations.  It is not necessary and often also not true.  The Minister has done much work in this area since he took office.  If there is one thing he could change in this legislation, this seems to be the thing that means so much to people.  Will he please consider it?  I do not think we have to stick to it.  That is what we heard from many experts in this area at pre-legislative scrutiny.  I am pleading with the Minister to reconsider this provision</p></speech>

Deputy Bacik asked a question earlier, which I do not think was answered.  What happens if somebody cannot take part in this information session for either mental, physical or personal reasons?  He or she will lose his or her right to this identity again.  That is the point I wanted to make.  I call on the Minister to reconsider this again.</p></speech>

With regard to GDPR, was that in place at the time this was going through the Seanad?  The GDPR obviously has an impact on this, which supersedes the court case to which the Minister referred.  It is a right for people to access their personal information.  That must have a bearing on the Supreme Court case as well.  That should be taken into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#O00400"><p>In response to the question by Deputies Bacik and Ward, if somebody chooses not to participate in the processes set out in the legislation, he or she continues to have the right to submit an essay or application under GDPR, as anybody has.  That right remains with them but the right of access to information under GDPR is not absolute in the same way it will be under this legislation.  A balancing test under Article 15(4) of GDPR still applies.  We are providing for the absolute right to access information in all situations in this legislation.  To address Deputy Cairns' question, that is why we are having this legislation.  We are taking away that discretion of the data controller to refuse somebody access to his or her information.  That is why this legislation is necessary.</p> <p>  It is really important that we address the argument in terms of what Deputy Cairns said, which is that this desire to protect the constitutional rights of parents is not based in reality.  It is based in reality.  Right now, we have a national adoption contact preference register.  Approximately 4,500 parents whose children were adopted have signed on to that and the vast majority of them are seeking contact with their children.  Only 1% or 99 people have signed a no-contact preference on the existing national adoption contact preference register.  I take the number of parents who do not want contact with their children from that and that is not all; that is a portion of people who have signed this.  It is tiny.  They are still rights holders, however.  Each of those 99 people still have a right to exercise their constitutional right to privacy.  If they decide that they do not want contact with the child they gave up for adoption, that is their right.</p> <p>  Deputy Cairns asked where this came from.  She said many different groups came in and spoke before the committee.  Absolutely, and I have spoken with them too.  However, these women do not want to be known.  They are not going to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee for whatever reason because that identifies them.  Again, it comes back to the history of adoption in this country and the secrecy that surrounds it.  These women continue to exist in secret.  We must remember that the information session will only apply where a parent has signed a no-contact preference.  Based on what we are seeing from the existing national adoption contact preference register, it will only be a tiny proportion of the overall number of applications under this legislation where an information session is required.  In those situations, however, it is an exercise of a constitutional right.  It is the exercise of an individual who has proactively decided that he or she wants to provide some protection of his or her anonymity.  The fact is that they do not come into the Oireachtas joint committee or form advocacy groups.  We cannot let their desire and need for secrecy eliminate them from this conversation.  They do exist.  Their existence is demonstrated by the existing no-contact preference register.  I have received letters from women who have set out their concerns to me as parents.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  We are trying to achieve a recognition of their constitutional right to privacy but doing so in such a way that in every situation, the adopted person gets full access to his or her information.</p></speech>

We heard at committee that there are more adopted people who want to exercise their right to privacy rather than their right to information than there are parents.  All we hear from the Government, and now again from the Minister, is the parent's right to privacy.  There are more children, many of whom are now adults, obviously, who want to exercise that right.  Nobody has an objection to people exercising their right to privacy.  That is not what I am getting at.  I am talking about the weight the Minister is putting on that versus all the other rights we are dealing with in this committee.</p><p>We are talking about 1% of relatives.  How is so much of the focus on this when we are also dealing with all of the other rights that have been disregarded for decades?

I am just saying the narrative is unnecessary.  The Minister saying he is trying to protect the privacy rights of the parents.  What about the privacy rights of adopted people?

The relevant person will be kept informed and will be consulted throughout the course of the investigation.&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 117 and 146.  These amendments are linked.  Amendment No. 117 inserts a new provision to the effect that where there is no entry present in the register of births, the authority has the power to seize all records relating to the relevant person's adoption and open an investigation.  We believe it is important to ensure that any anomalies in a person's records are properly investigated.  </p></speech>

These amendments would insert a clause into sections 6 and 10.  The amendments require that where no information is available, upon application by an affected person, the authority must seize all records and conduct an investigation into what transpired.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept these amendments.  Under section 63 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, a person can apply to the register to correct a record and under section 65 of the same Act, the Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheoir is empowered to conduct an inquiry to correct registration of a life event.  What is being provided for here does not need to be undertaken, especially on a mandatory basis, where a person may not wish for further investigation.  An adopted person subject to an illegal birth registration may not wish for such an investigation.  A person who was the subject of an illegal birth registration may not wish their parents - the people they have seen as their parents all their lives - to be subject to an investigation, which would be mandatory under this provision.  It is completely out of the ordinary when compared to what we have been looking at - the idea of a mandatory investigation without any understanding of its size and scope, what it would do and what its consequences would be.  I cannot support this amendment.</p></speech>

I do not think the relevant body should specify the information concerned or how it is conveyed.  I am recommending that is removed and that the information should be provided.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Pringle, the line that amendment No. 127 seeks to delete gives the body to which these applications will be made the ability to construct the form through which the applications will be made.  If that body will not set the application form, I do not know who will.  As this amendment seeks to take out the most basic of administrative elements, I oppose amendment No. 127.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, concern the requirement for a person to provide explicit consent to the use of their information when applying for birth information.  The manner in which the original draft of the legislation provided for the use of consent, as was flagged by some advocacy groups, was not fully in compliance with the proper reading of the GDPR.  Amendments Nos. 114 to 116, inclusive, which have already been agreed to, also dealt with that issue.  Amendment No. 130 deletes section 9(2)(c), which requires that the application is accompanied by the applicant's written consent to process his or her contact details.  We are removing that because it would not be fully compliant with GDPR.  That is just a piece of housekeeping but it is important nevertheless to ensure the legislation is compatible with GDPR.</p></speech>

It is to give effect to the recommendation we made in the pre-legislative scrutiny report to replace the mandatory information session with a requirement that the authority sends a registered post, or other recorded delivery, letter to applicants setting out the relevant information.  I apologise because I had to leave in the middle of the debate earlier to go to statements in the D&aacute;il.  It was terrible timing.  I am sorry I did not hear the full response the Minister gave.</p> <p>  Without labouring the point, as I said we have gone through many different iterations with this legislation as we all know.  There have been many different attempts to achieve the balance between constitutional rights of identity and information versus the right to privacy.  As I said earlier, things have moved on.  The advice of the Attorney General has changed over the years in successive iterations of the Bill.  We are at a point where a mandatory information session should no longer be required as a condition of access to identity information, even if that mandatory information session is in much preferable format now to what it was and even if it may be carried out by phone and not by a social worker and all of the welcome improvements that have been made.</p> <p>  The committee, having heard the evidence and having heard from stakeholders, still believed there was a preferable means of achieving the balancing of rights and that this was through a prepaid registered post mechanism.  It is an acknowledgement there is some need to balance rights.  It is also an acknowledgement that the understanding of privacy and identity and conflicting rights has moved on since we last debated this type of Bill.  We should be able to move beyond a mandatory information session in any form.  I have tried in one amendment to set out as best I can a way of delivering on the recommendation we made.  I know we have had the debate already but I believe this would be preferable to the current mandatory information session.</p></speech>

I have set forward the reasons I believe, and more importantly why others believe, the information session and the provision of the conveying of the preference of the parent to the adopted person is the best way to go.  We discussed with the Attorney General and counsel the option of a letter.  It is not that we did not consider it.  The issue has been considered.  There are practical issues with a registered letter, particularly in the context of the amendment tabled by Deputy Bacik that everything would then have to be done by post.  The issuing of information would have to be done by post because it would have to contain the registered letter and the bundle of information.  Plenty of people want their information via email.  This means two sets of information would have to be sent out.  There are practical issues for data controllers in all of this.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that the balancing mechanism has gone through various iterations.  Each iteration has brought the balance more in favour of the adopted persons and their right to identity but at the same time has lessened the privacy rights of the parent.</p><p>If that balance continues to move over, there comes a point where the privacy right will no longer be recognised by a court as a proper defence in terms of proportionality.  I hope we both agree on that.  In term of what is essential here, the no-contact preference is the final protection of the privacy right and that must be conveyed to the adopted person.  Is the best way to convey that a registered letter, where we will never know if the person actually read it or saw the line about the no-contact preference?  If there is a phone call, a physical meeting or an online meeting, we know the preference has been conveyed.  I am making changes and I will speak to them in a moment but that is the core element of what is necessary to ensure the right to privacy is sufficiently present and balanced in all of this.  When a no-contact preference is stated by a parent, it must be directly conveyed to the adopted person.  That is not the case with a registered letter.  While we considered the registered letter, we believe direct conveyance of the no-contact preference is the correct way to go. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#S00200"><p>We are agreed that there have been lots of variations of this and that the understanding of how best to balance rights has changed and developed.  The problem remains that the mandatory information session strikes many adopted persons as an unduly paternalistic approach.  It is still balanced too much on that side.  It harks back to when the view was taken that we could not give people access to information and there had to be conditions.  It is still a condition on access.  In a previous debate on this, Professor Conor O'Mahony talked about privacy rights trumping identity rights.  It still seems like that is what is happening with the mandatory information session.  We must trust people.  We trust people who receive a court summons by registered post.  There is a point where you have to trust people.  The Minister raised a couple of practical issues around email or registered post.  Those are very easily surmountable because the provision I have set out simply states that the statement of information will go by registered post.  All the other information can go by email or any other means.  It is very easy to get around that problem.  We have other protections for privacy rights.  We have the age limit and the contact preference register.  We have built into this statutory framework other protections and recognitions of that right.</p> <p>  I will come back to the two practical points I have raised, which also go to the kernel of the issue about an information session.  First, what if an adopted person does not wish to take the call?  Will they simply not have access to their identity information?  It is a condition on their access and it is not possible to see it any other way.  Granted, it is a much reduced condition compared to what was in previous versions of the Bill.  Second, what happens if there is a dispute or disagreement over what was said in the phone call?  A written statement setting out information, however it is delivered, is far clearer evidence that that information was delivered.  I am concerned that issues could arise around the manner in which information is conveyed in that phone call and the lack of any evidentiary back-up for it.  Those are two issues we discussed in the committee and it was one of the reasons all its members, including Government representatives, agreed on that recommendation.  That is what I am trying to give effect to in amendment No. 199.  I would love to hear the Minister's response to the point that it is this a condition, albeit a more minimal one, and as to what would happen if there were some disagreement over the phone call. </p></speech>

I fundamentally disagree with the mandatory information session.  Even setting it aside from the point of view of principles and what is right, from a practical point of view for the State, having this meeting in preference to a physical letter opens up a whole can of "he said, she said".  We all know the idea of registered post is that if somebody signs for it, he or she has received it and if that person does not, it gets sent back.  I do not think there is a responsibility on the State to ensure the person has taken in that information.  Someone could go to a meeting and put his or her hands over his or her ears and not take in what has been said.  If something is sent in a letter and somebody signs for it to say he or she has received it, surely the State's obligation in relation to privacy is fulfilled.  No matter what way it is said, anything else will always be interpreted by people who are adopted as the State being distrustful and saying it knows best.  It is very difficult for anyone to understand it in any other way.  I feel very strongly on this.  Deputy Bacik made a lot of good points and I support what she said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022030800002#S00400"><p>We do trust people.  We trust adopted people.  That is why they are being provided access to all information.  Nothing is held back any more.  We trust them with the name of their mother, and of their father if it is on record, and the names of all their relatives.  In the past they were not trusted with that.  We trust them and this legislation provides access to that information.  They do not have to sign anything.  There is no criminal prohibition if, having heard the no-contact preference, they decide to ignore it.  There is no consequence set out in this legislation.  I do not believe they will do that but there is nothing there to prevent it because we trust people.  It is right that we are discussing the sense, belief and understanding of the adopted person.  However, we have to recognise there is a set of people - it is a very small set but they are there - and mothers who desperately want to maintain their secrecy.  They exist.  We have to understand that, through this legislation, we will be revealing their names to their children and for a small set of people, primarily women, that will be deeply distressing.  We need to recognise that we are dramatically limiting their privacy rights.  The question is how we ensure that their privacy rights, though limited, are still somehow present in this process.  The State has a responsibility here because, inasmuch as we have a responsibility to provide access to the right to identity, which we are doing under this legislation, an Irish person's privacy right is a constitutional one and the State has to protect that as well.  We have an obligation on both sides to protect rights and we are balancing those two sets of rights.  That is difficult but we believe this is the best way to do that.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised concerns about disagreements about what is said and the information.  There is not information in the call.  What the call will involve is the list of points set out in section 17(2).  That is what the call is, and nothing more.  The information will be conveyed separately, either by post or email, after the information session has taken place.  There does not need to be any dispute there because all the designated person is conveying to the relevant person are the points set out in section 17(2).  That will be the end of it.  The information session will then completed and the adopted person will get full access to all information.</p> <p>  Deputy Bacik also asked about what would happen if an adopted person decided they did not wish to engage with this process.  That is a right.  As I said earlier when the Deputy was not in the room, adopted persons continue to have their rights under the GDPR and can make an application for information under Article 15.  However, the issue there is that Article 15.4 still applies and the balancing that has to be undertaken under the GDPR will still apply.  What is so important about this legislation is that the balancing does not apply.  The adopted person gets full access to all information in all circumstances. </p></speech>

I will bring forward these amendments to change the text in respect of the information session.  Currently, the three points of which the designated official will inform the adopted person in the information session are:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) the entitlement of the relevant person to obtain, in accordance with this Act, his or her birth certificate, or birth information relating to him or her, as the case may be, <br /><br />(b) the fact that the parent concerned has stated, in accordance with this Act, that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person, and <br /><br />(c) the importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights of the parent and the preference of the parent referred to in <i>paragraph (b)</i>.  </blockquote> <p>Having listened to contributions from groups during the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, process, I understand that section 17(2)(c), in particular, and the fact that in an information session an adopted person will be told of the importance of respecting privacy rights was felt to be condescending and that the adopted person was being spoken down to.  I hear that and we have sought to change it.  In what we are bringing forward now, section 17(2)(a) remains the same, but we will delete section 17(2)(b) and section 17(2)(c).  Instead of those, we will put in:</p> <blockquote> 	(b) the fact that&mdash;   	(i) the parent concerned has exercised his or her entitlement under <i>section 38(11) </i>to state that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person, and <br /><br />(ii) the making of that statement by the parent constitutes an exercise by him or her of his or her right to privacy.  </blockquote> <p>There is now no language proposed and the information session will not contain any language where the adopted person is told about the importance of respecting the parent's privacy rights.  It is a further dilution of the information session.  However, I can understand there was a concern that it was seen as paternalistic, particularly in the context of the designated person speaking to an adopted person.  We have sought to improve and address that by the changes brought forward, recognising the importance that the information session has for so many people.</p></speech>

He is here to listen to the witnesses and the members.  He said he was coming to listen to the Chairman but I am not sure about that.  He is very welcome.  It is very important we have people from secondary school who come to Leinster House on work experience.</p> <p>  I welcome from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, Mr. Martin Marjoram, president; from the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, Ms Clare Austick, president; from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, education sector group, Mr. Karl Byrne, chairman; from the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, Mr. Frank Jones, general secretary; from the Irish Research Staff Association, Dr. Andrew P. Allen,  chairman; and from F&oacute;rsa, Ms Stella Griffin, assistant general secretary with responsibility for higher education.  Mr. Byrne will make an opening statement on behalf of the ICTU education sector group, followed by the other union representatives.  Ms Griffin will take part in the questions-and-answers session.</p> <p>  The witnesses are here today to discuss the further funding of higher education.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Marjoram to make a brief opening statement, followed by Ms Austick, Mr. Byrne, Mr. Jones and Dr. Allen.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee and there will be an eight-minute slot for each member's questions and the witnesses' replies.  As participants are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements to the Oireachtas website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before I begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I also remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.</p><p>If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be requested by the Chair to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that they comply with such a direction from the Chair.</p><p> Unfortunately, we have apologies from a number of Senators, for various reasons.

The issue of funding of higher education has been a complex one for many years but has come to the fore especially since cutbacks of the last decade, combined with rapidly rising student numbers, and the publication in 2016 of Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education, which hereafter will be referred to as the Cassells report.<br/><br/>It is important to note that in 2021, Ireland only spent 0.9% of GDP on tertiary education, compared to 1.4% in the OECD.  The ratio of students to teachers in Irish tertiary education is also significantly above both the OECD and EU averages, and has risen dramatically from already unsustainable levels in the past year.  The funding deficit, even aside from anything to do with Covid-19, will get worse in coming years as, mentioned in earlier hearings of the committee, student numbers are expected to rise by almost 30,000 in tertiary education in this decade.  Even without an increase in student numbers over the next decade, the third level budget is 40%, approximately &euro;100 million, off where we were ten years ago, according to <i>The Irish Times</i>in January 2020.  The Cassells report made clear that &euro;600 million was needed by 2021.  However, we are now in 2022 and little has changed.<br/><br/>The European University Association, EUA, has reported that public funding of third level education in Ireland, as a percentage of GDP, fell a shocking 62% between 2009 and 2019.  In the same timeframe, student numbers rose by 28% and staff numbers fell by 8%.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has found that between 2007 and 2016, real expenditure per student at third level education decreased by more than 34% in nine years.<br/><br/>The TUI believes that third level education, as part of the social contract, should be funded from Government revenues; that is, from taxation.  Whence that taxation comes is then the issue.  For its part, TUI has made the serious proposal that a 1% levy should be applied to corporation profits to generate a dedicated fund for higher education.  Why, we may be asked, should corporate profits be levied in this manner?  For the very simple reason that to do so is fair and provides those corporations with an opportunity clearly to demonstrate what they claim to have, but what is little in evidence, which is commitment to the society in which they base their enterprise.  These corporations benefit hugely from having available to them a very deep pool of graduate talent in this country &ndash; supplied courtesy of the Irish taxpayer.  In 2015 for example, the levy we suggest would have yielded some &euro;550 million, an investment that would have done very nicely indeed in terms of resuscitating the exhausted and gaunt figure that is the Irish third level education system.  Investment in the further education and training sector also needs to be addressed.  Priorities in the programme for Government can only be adequately addressed if accompanied by additional funding.  Areas such as Youthreach, adult literacy, post-leaving certificate programmes etc. have for too long been a Cinderella of the system.  The committee has acknowledged the need for additional funding of the further education and training sector in its hearings of 1 March.<br/><br/>It is important that all institutes of technology have the opportunity to become technological universities if that is the wish of the community concerned.  It is imperative that the two remaining institutes of technology, the Institute of Art, Design and Technology and Dundalk Institute of Technology, are expedited into the technological university sector.  TUI members in both institutes have communicated to management, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, their wish to move towards technological university designation.  This position is supported by the TUI nationally.  Dundalk Institute of Technology is currently being assisted by the HEA in this regard.<br/><br/>The HEA has found that 15% of graduates from institutes of technology attended schools participating in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, compared to just 8% of university graduates, and that 7% of institute of technology graduates attended fee paying schools compared to 13% of university graduates.  According to Richard Thorn, the institutes of technology have 22% of their students registered as flexible learners - part-time, distance and e-learning - compared to 17% for the universities.  The distinction comes in terms of socioeconomic class, in that 31% of students in the institutes come from the non-manual, semi-skilled or unskilled groups compared to 21% in the universities.<br/><br/>The TUI would like to make several recommendations to the committee.  The size of SUSI grants and eligibility criteria for same should be significantly expanded.  The TUI welcomes the current ongoing review of SUSI.  Exchequer funding of higher education must be dramatically increased.  This could be partly funded by a one percentage point increase in corporation tax with the proceeds ring-fenced for funding higher education.  Staff-student ratios need to be reduced urgently.  Apprenticeships should have greater support and visibility.  Funding models must take account of the unique role the institutes of technology-technological universities sector plays in higher education access.  Greater recognition of, and visibility of, the further education sector is vital due to the essential role it plays in supporting under-represented groups to access levels 5 and 6 of the national framework of qualifications, and also frequently then accessing levels 7 and 8 of the framework.  Additional staffing of guidance services in schools, further education colleges, higher education institutions and in the adult guidance services would be helpful.  The points system needs to be reformed.  More progression pathways should be recognised.  Additional support in the form of funding and staffing is required for student mental health support services in higher education institutions, HEIs, as well as for employee assistance programmes.  Further funding is required to support access programmes in higher education institutions.  Strong consideration should be made to extending a DEIS-style funding model to the higher education sector.  All institutes of technology, IOTs, should consult staff in relation to seeking a pathway to technological university status.  Emergency remote teaching and learning is, by definition, an emergency response to a crisis situation.  It cannot be seen in any other context.  Additional education needs students should have additional supports maintained if they attend further or higher education after leaving the post-primary system.  Currently when they leave second level, their support is effectively cut off and then needs to be re-established by the relevant further or higher education institution.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, may have a role to play here, especially in the further education, FE, context.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for listening to this opening statement.  The TUI is more than happy to answer any questions that members may have.  The TUI would also like to direct members to the more extensive written submission that we made to the committee in February, which provides more detail on the issues I have just outlined. </p></speech>

I am the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, which is the national student representative body for students in third level education.  Our core mission has always been to protect access to third level education.  At every single opening I give, I must remind people that education is a right and not a privilege.  However, the continual marketisation of education threatens how it is viewed and has only served to heighten existing barriers to third-level education.  I must emphasise how much USI welcomes that future funding of higher education is being looked at and reviewed.  For far too long, many students have been priced out of a third level education and did not get to excel in the ways they should have.  We can certainly change how the future funding of higher education goes, going forward.</p> <p>  To fully begin the conversation, we cannot overlook the largest barrier in student access to education, which is the student contribution charge.  We want to see an immediate reduction in the fees, with a commitment to sustainably funding the higher education sector through a publicly funded higher education model.  If we really value our education system so much then we must act on our words. The State must be responsible for funding the system to the levels required to ensure high quality education for all students.  To highlight just how bad it has become, I note that approximately 50% of the funding of Irish universities is private funding.  This is the highest in the European Union and is the second highest in Europe.  According to the OECD, Ireland invests just 0.8% of GDP in tertiary education, which is well below the 1.5% of the OECD average.  How can Ireland prides itself on its education system when it is way below average?</p> <p>  In addition, the current student-staff ratio in Ireland is among the highest in the EU, and a minimum investment of &euro;147.48 million per annum is required to bring Irish higher education institutions in line with international best practice of a ratio of 15:1.</p> <p>  The USI strongly believes that publicly funded education is the most equitable way to ensure that this increased funding is delivered. The onus should not be on existing or future students to prop up a crumbling sector, rather the State should provide support to the future workforce of our country.  The future expansion of technological universities certainly poses logistical challenges.  As institutes of technology across different geographical locations merge, investment in public transport links is crucial.  Students must be able to access all buildings, resources and supports in campuses across the country.  We must address the lack of public transport infrastructure available in rural areas in particular.  Post merge, technological universities must also be supported, as the entire integration process can take a long time.  They should be supported in building affordable, purpose-built, student accommodation.</p><p>Universal design for learning, UDL, played a critical role in online assessment and teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, outside the Covid-19 classroom, UDL serves as an important tool to help combat barriers students with disabilities face in both learning and social environments.  UDL is critical in increasing awareness of barriers to participation and supports that a student may need.  USI believes that the Government should provide funding to higher education institutions for training on UDL principles and guidance on a national framework to try and support colleges to integrate those principles into the entire teaching and learning environment.</p><p> Equity of access to higher education is a core component of the work of USI.  Existing financial support structures are not optimal and they are not fit for purpose.  There have been significant cuts to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant over the last decade.  We fully believe that the student grant scheme is a huge opportunity to support students to access education and to progress their entire learning journey.  We welcome the review that is being carried out, but funding must be provided to fully implement the recommendations that emerge.  It is important to note the knock-on effect of a stagnant student grant scheme that is deaf to inflation and higher costs of living.  It affects many people, such as disadvantaged and low-income families, engaging in part-time or full-time employment which may lead to students being unable to complete their studies satisfactorily.  Similarly, international students experience many financial hardships, as they are often seen as cash cows to prop up an underfunded system.  We cannot ignore postgraduate students either.  We must ensure there is a national stipend in line with the living wage for research postgraduates, which would enhance engagement in research and encourage the involvement of more postgraduate researchers of diverse backgrounds.</p><p> Finally, I want to touch on student mental health and well-being supports.  Student mental health and well-being is a fundamental element to the overall student experience.  Worryingly, student mental health has worsened in recent years, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We call for the implementation of the recommendations of the student mental health and suicide prevention framework.  Sustainable core funding must be invested annually in support services for student mental health on campus.</p></speech>

The congress group comprises a range of unions representing staff across all levels of the sector, including IFUT, the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, F&oacute;rsa, SIPTU and Unite.  It is our view that equal access must be a cornerstone of our education sector as a whole, otherwise we will simply exacerbate divisions and inequality in Irish society.  A 2018 UNICEF report showed that teenage children of lower income parents in Ireland harboured little or no ambition to attend third level.  Meanwhile, a 2019 HEA study revealed that children from affluent backgrounds were ten times more likely to score high CAO points than those from less affluent areas.  An overriding goal of official policy must be to remove all barriers and impediments to access, and the further and higher education sector can play a crucial role in this process.  However, this can only occur if the critical issue of funding is resolved in a sustainable manner, in order to maximise educational opportunity and participation for all.</p> <p>  There is broad consensus on the value of investment in higher education and the fact that the returns on the investment are public, political, economic and social.  Indeed, the OECD has pointed out that as countries across the globe respond to the challenges of digital, technological and environmental transition, higher education has become pivotal to progress, given its key role in the formation of intellectual capital.  Similar conclusions were reached by the Nevin Economic Research Institute in research carried out for the congress education sector group.  This stressed the role of higher education as "a producer of increased skills and capacities in the population, and as a site of research and development".  The Nevin institute warned that cuts to spending on higher education were self-defeating, as lower investment has a negative impact on long-term growth and living standards.  Given the consensus around this issue, the question arises as to how we have arrived at a situation where we have the highest cost barriers to student participation in the EU and among the lowest spend per student.</p> <p>  These barriers include fees and significant increases in the cost of living for students and working families, and in particular the failure to deliver on secure and genuinely affordable accommodation.  The core of the problem lies in the sharp fall in official funding over the last decade.  Thus, between 2012 and 2016, total State funding for higher education fell by almost 15%.  This reduction is in contrast to comparator states, where funding has always been consistently higher.  In 2014, the spend on third level here amounted to 1.1% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of 1.5%.  If we strip out private funding sources, Ireland's public spend on third level was just 0.8%, while the OECD average was 1.1%.  It is now six years since the expert group on future funding for higher education delivered its recommendations and these trends have worsened since then.  In 2019, the Parliamentary Budget Office concluded that funding per undergraduate student - full time, part time, remote and FETAC - was 50% lower than in 2008.  In our experience, the funding shortfall has contributed to a worsening of employment conditions and a rise in precarious work, with research by TASC and NERI strongly suggesting the problem is most acute in the higher education sector.  It has also sparked a creeping privatisation, and a more dominant role for private funding in our universities, a trend that undermines higher education as a public good.</p> <p>  In conclusion, equality of access must be the cornerstone of our entire education system.  Education is an essential public good and must be funded accordingly.  This includes a properly resourced and publicly-funded higher education sector.  Crucially, this must be accompanied by engagement with all stakeholders, in order to develop a coherent and shared vision for the future of the sector.  Indeed, the necessity for engagement is a key lesson from the experience of the Covid pandemic in the sector.  I stress that this should be the first step, not the last one, once a decision is made on future funding.  The annual cost of attending college has become almost prohibitive and there should be a full reassessment of the grant system to ensure it covers costs and that grants are awarded where they are most needed in a fully transparent manner.  Part-time work and temporary work have a legitimate role at third level, but widespread insecurity of employment will harm teaching and educational standards.  This applies to academic and support staff throughout the institutions, all of whom play a key role in the delivery of education and the proper functioning of the sector.  I thank members for their time.  We are more than happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Jones" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#C00400"><p>IFUT welcomes the opportunity to take part in the discussion on this matter that is of the upmost importance to our entire membership.  IFUT represent thousands of members, all of whom work in higher education.  Our membership includes lecturers, tutors, librarians and researchers.  In our submission to the committee we outlined our concerns in relation to the increased reliance on the sector to secure alternative sources of funding, as the public funding is inadequate.  We referred to reports from the OECD and others that provided statistical evidence to support our case that Ireland is performing badly with regard to publicly funding the higher education sector when compared to others within the OECD.  We must consider why this is the case and make every effort to remedy the situation.</p> <p>  Higher education in Ireland has been underfunded for decades.  While Government spending has slowly increased since 2014, the spend per student is still lower than the levels that were in place in 2011.  Then, the State spent around &euro;8,500 per year on each student in higher education, while today that figure is below &euro;8,000 per year.  Currently, we are ranked 20th in the OECD with regard to our spend per student.</p> <p>  During the period since 2011, the Irish universities slipped significantly in international rankings.  In the late 2000s, two of our universities were ranked in the top 100 internationally, with one in the top 50.  We now have no institutions in the top 100.  The fall in rankings is directly linked to the reduction in spend.  Cuts to core funding have resulted in a reduction in staff numbers.  The employment control framework of 2010 to 2014 appears to linger across the sector, prohibiting HR departments from recruiting academic staff on the agreed and established contracts.  The most obvious way in which the underfunding manifests itself is through the student to staff ratios across our institutions.  According to the OECD, Ireland's student to staff ratio is at 23.4:1, far out of line with the OECD average of 15:1.  Addressing this ratio must become the number one priority for the Department and for all of us involved across higher education.  In an effort to address the need to have student-facing staff, universities have engaged occasional or hourly-paid lecturers.  This committee must note that these employees are not, in the eyes of the institutions and universities themselves, lecturers, as lecturing staff are defined as those contracted to undertake a range of academic duties encompassing teaching, research, and contribution and scholarly activity.  Given an opportunity, I will expand on this point.  Across the universities, different job titles or terms that are used to describe those engaged in this manner include part-time teaching assistants, part-time assistant lecturers, occasional lecturers etc.</p><p>Those engaged in this manner are usually on short fixed-term contracts, only paid for their teaching without any of the other benefits associated with being an employee of a university in a position funded by the State.  Our members in these grades do not have the opportunity to engage in research work.  Being research active is core to the role of a lecturer and the university.<br/><br/>Some employers have failed to afford the terms of the public sector agreements to those engaged in this manner.  The precarious nature of their engagement is further compounded by the fact that there is no sectoral engagement on industrial relations, IR, matters across the university sector.  The education oversight group has not met since before the Covid-19 pandemic.  While these workers are represented by trade unions which are members of the ICTU higher and further education group of unions, the employers will not engage sectorally on IR matters, either through the Irish Universities Association, of which they are all members, or through any other employers' umbrella organisation.  Historically, the rationale for the universities&rsquo; refusal to engage on IR matters sectorally was, according to the universities, because to do so would interfere with the institutional autonomy they enjoy as a right, a right that we respect.  However, UNESCO recommendation 20 from 1997 addresses this point.  It states that autonomy should not be used to limit the rights of higher education staff and teaching personnel.  The same document, in recommendation 27, provides that:</p><blockquote>	Higher-education teaching personnel are entitled to the maintaining of academic freedom, that is to say, the right, without constriction by prescribed doctrine, to freedom of teaching and discussion, freedom in carrying out research and disseminating and publishing the results thereof, freedom to express freely their opinion about the institution or system in which they work ... </blockquote><p>I ask the committee to consider how a precariously employed part-time assistant lecturer would be expected to exercise this entitlement without any certainty of employment into the future.  We in IFUT know the answer.<br/><br/>In IFUT, we believe the failure to fund higher education adequately has given rise to a situation whereby our universities have become over-reliant on precariously employed staff and this has impacted on the quality of our higher education institutions and their global rankings.  We need to address the student to staff ratio by engaging these academics, and others, on contracts agreed through local level or sectoral bargaining.  Failure to address this matter will have a detrimental effect on the sector and society in general.  <br/><br/>I thank members for their attention and welcome the opportunity to discuss these points with them.</p></speech>

Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#D00200"><p>I am the chair of the Irish Research Staff Association, which represents salaried research staff in higher education.  T&aacute;im br&oacute;d&uacute;il as a bheith anseo inni&uacute; chun labhairt ar son daoine at&aacute; ag obair i r&eacute;imse an taighde in &Eacute;ire.</p> <p>  Research is an investment that consistently makes returns that are greater than what we put in.  Studies from Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, Indecon and University College Cork estimate that for every &euro;1 invested in research, society reaps a benefit of between &euro;3 and &euro;5 to the economy.  Research staff bring funding into universities, contribute to internationalisation of higher education, help to inform evidence-based policy and, although this is often under-recognised, contribute to teaching as well.  Strategic investment in research is of benefit to various regions across Ireland and investment in research capacity across our universities, new technological universities, institutes of technology and other higher education institutes, HEIs, across all regions will be a great local, regional and national economic stimulus.</p> <p>  Research careers in HEIs are currently characterised by precarity, with research staff generally being employed on fixed-term contracts tied to specific research grants.  The high turnover of research staff within the HEI sector means that experience is often lost from this sector.  Research staff can also end up devoting a significant amount of time to chasing research grants where only a small number of candidates will succeed.  Ireland has a demonstrable track record in producing long-term research, such as the study on which I am employed, the intellectual disability supplement to The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA.  Given this track record, we should avoid precarity becoming part of policy.  </p> <p>  Coming from a background in psychology, I am glad to see that mental health is on the agenda.  A systematic review and meta-analysis found that job insecurity is associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.  Precarity reduces the health and well-being of research staff, and their productivity with it.  It harms not only individual researchers but research groups and programmes that have higher levels of brain drain as a result.</p> <p>  In order to inform any policymaking decisions regarding research and innovation, it is first important to develop an accurate method of data collection regarding the numbers of research staff, a method that is universal across all HEIs on the island of Ireland.  Data on gender, ethnicity, international or national status, level of seniority and contract type should be tracked over time and should include the career outcomes of the researcher.  Where there are aggregated data, they should be made easily available, to the greatest extent permitted by data protection law.  Research staff should be able to communicate with large numbers of their peers quickly and easily in order to maximise the potential for collaboration and avoid duplication of research effort.</p> <p>  In terms of policy, research career frameworks are important for research staff.  A number of policies have been proposed that take an "up-or-out" approach, whereby research staff have to progress to a higher level within a relatively short period of time or exit the system.  Why is this problematic?  Let us look at the "up" part of the up-or-out approach.  Career progression is good but there is a lack of funding in place for research staff to progress, which means they use increasing amounts of labour hours, paid for by the taxpayer, chasing increasingly competitive grants that they are less likely to get.  Research staff who are generally least able to absorb risk are the ones who take on the bulk of the risk.</p> <p>  What about the "out" in the up-or-out approach?  Some researchers may wish to stay within a particular role at a given level, drawing on years of experience to perform high-quality research, but risk being pushed out of the system when we take an up-or-out approach.  The higher education research group proposed a funded research framework in the late 2000s.  This is a model we should bring back.</p> <p>  A possible solution to enable research staff to continue contributing to academic research is for funding agencies and HEIs to put in place staff scientist positions and equivalent positions for arts and humanities, thereby creating alternative attractive career progression routes within academia.  A report from the National Research Council, for example, recommends raising the salaries of research staff to "appropriately reflect their value and contribution to research".  Unless the career prospects for early career researchers are improved, we risk losing the talent that will be essential for our future progress across all areas of research.</p> <p>  Alternative career paths, where research staff segue into roles more focused on other areas such as teaching or professional services, are to be encouraged, but they should not be seen as the necessary goal of all research staff.</p> <p>  I am here today to advocate not simply for research staff but for a sensible policy of investment that benefits everyone.  Given the return to Irish society evidenced by research, we know that investment in retaining research staff is a win-win.  I look forward to participating further in this process.

I also welcome Alex, who I hope finds this session interesting.  I thank our guests for their opening statements, each of which spoke to what we need to do with the future funding model.  My first question is for Mr. Jones from IFUT.  He highlighted the impact that underfunding has had on the ranking of our institutes of higher education.  In this committee, we have been slow to call out the impact that years of underfunding have had on performance.  We know that because of the work of members of IFUT, other high standards have maintained in extremely difficult circumstances.  However, it is important to accept that even with this great effort, we are inevitably being outperformed by better funded colleges.  The student-staff ratio is much higher here than the OECD average.  That will lead to a very serious impact on education and research output.</p> <p>  Mr. Jones also mentioned that the employment control framework extended from 2010 to 2014 and that it is still curtailing HEIs from offering full contracts.  Perhaps we could examine that a little to see why that is the case and ask why, if the framework was to run from 2010 to 2014, it is still having an impact.  We must also consider what is needed beyond adequate funding for the sector and what needs to be put in place to ensure, if and when the Government brings forward a sustainable funding model, that funding is reflected in better working conditions.  The worst thing that could happen would be for us to have a new model but retain precarious working conditions.  We need to make sure we bring change with us.</p> <p>  In his opening statement on behalf of ICTU, Mr. Byrne mentioned creeping privatisation, which is a very important point.  Privatisation does not always happen in one big sale to a private company.  It can happen, and has happened, over time and we have seen the impact of that.  Do our guests believe we need a step change in how we fund higher education to protect and restore the public nature of third level education?</p><p>One of my great fears is privatisation, because it is a quick fix.  We have seen it happen across the board in essential services, including healthcare and housing.  Now we are seeing it in higher education.  How do we collectively stop that?</p><p> My next question was sparked by the IRSA's submission.  Over the last ten years, the higher education sector has been underfunded but one exception to this is Science Foundation Ireland.  SFI sets up centres in colleges and works on specific projects or research areas.  Has the SFI model impacted on the working conditions in the higher education sector?</p><p> In its submission, the TUI called for a 1% levy on corporation profits to adequately fund higher education.  Is there a specific reason for applying this levy on profits rather than expanding the levy on payroll that currently exists for the National Training Fund?</p><p> Ms Austick said the relationship between student accommodation and adequate funding for higher education is vital.  I agree with her on that.  We have not had an update on the student accommodation strategy since 2019 and the housing crisis means accommodation is the single biggest barrier for anyone who needs to travel to third level.  I am concerned about the rising cost of fuel and the impact that will have on those who have been forced to travel long distances.  Do we need a new student accommodation strategy, focused on public ownership and affordability, to go along with the new funding model?  There were a lot of questions there.  Each witness will have about a minute to answer but maybe they can expand their answers later on.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned rankings.  The student to staff ratio has a direct impact on the rankings but it affects much more than that.  It affects the entire student experience because it affects the ability of lecturers and other staff to deliver on their contracts.  It is very clear that this has a negative impact.  The employment control framework I mentioned was in place for very good reason between 2010 and 2014.  In 2016, Michael Cush SC conducted a review of precarity, short-term contracts and the use of fixed-term and part-time contracts for lecturers in universities.  He made seven recommendations, one of which is that the employment control framework be lifted, allowing the universities the right to hire lecturers directly when necessary, so they would not have to go to the HEA or other organisations for approval.  That is fine and dandy if they have the money to hire but they do not.  That is why they do not hire lecturers but hire these hourly-paid staff on very poor fixed-term contracts of employment and they renew the fixed-term contracts, leaving us with very little option as trade unions-----</p></speech>

Is it purely a matter of funding?</p></speech>

The problem is that when people such as part-time teaching assistants are employed on these types of contracts repeatedly, they secure permanency in their positions under the fixed-term work legislation but they are permanent in a job they should not really be doing.  They should have the full lecturing experience.  That will make the situation even more dire into the future.  It is a big job.  There is a huge task to be done here, not just in saying that from now on we will have no part-time teaching assistants and will only have lecturers.  I like that the USI has put a figure on the student to staff ratio.  That is important because we need figures and costs to aim for.  It will also take time to tackle this.  ICTU's submission stated that this should be the start of something and I agree with that.  We should not just address the student to staff ratio by putting a load of hourly-paid, precariously engaged teaching assistants into a university because that will not sort anything.</p></speech>

It is not a desire to attend college or awareness of it that is lacking.  It is due to the cost of attending higher education, that is, the cost of student accommodation coupled with the fees, the cost of living and the hidden course material costs.  It is everything together.  The TU Dublin cost-of-living guide estimates that it costs &euro;10,000 to attend one year of college.  It differentiates between people attending college in Dublin, Galway, Cork or Letterkenny.  We need a new student accommodation strategy that commits to tackling the student accommodation crisis in the most effective and efficient manner possible and has short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals.  It has to be accompanied by making higher education accessible and reducing the student contribution charge immediately, if not abolishing it.  We want the Government to provide support to colleges to build their own student accommodation that is affordable and based on a cost-rental model.  We need a new student accommodation strategy and we need to tackle the financial aspect and the cost placed on students to attend college.  Otherwise, we will not get anywhere.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me a direct question about privatisation.  ICTU did a report that shows nearly 50% of money is now from the private sector.  There has been a huge drop in public funding from what it used to be.  It was close to 80% or 90% previously.  That is why we are saying this should be the beginning of the discussion.  When the report comes out we would love to come back to the committee and have a discussion because at that stage we can answer the questions on how to deal with what is being put in front of us.  A number of the people here, including us and the representatives from the USI, IFUT and TUI, as well as SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and Unite, are part of Education Futures, the campaigning group we put together to try to deal with future funding.  We had three pillars, which are the metrics by which we should be measuring things when the report from the Department comes out.  The three pillars - access, the quality of the education system, and decent work - set down what we need the future funding model to deal with.</p> <p>  The employment control framework does not just deal with academics but with all staff across the system.  Even if a university wanted to hire a security guard, it is set in stone.  That causes problems because if they do not have the funding, they might outsource or bring in a temporary cleaner or security guard.  It is across the system.  The employment control framework is a legacy of the crisis and it must be done away with.  We need to have those discussions across the board on what having more money in the system means going forward and how we deal with it.</p> <p>  The USI has given a very clear report on the effects of the accommodation crisis on students and we support it on that.</p></speech>

As the Chair said, I will have to leave the meeting after this.  I am very impressed with the presentations.</p><p>Many of the witnesses speak about access, those on the margins and disadvantage.  We still have an issue in Ireland with functional literacy with 17.9% of our adult population functionally illiterate.  It is something we regularly discuss here.  I suppose the witnesses have all come here looking for money so we need to cut to the chase of what the discussion is really about.</p><p> There are a couple of topics regularly bandied around in Irish political discourse.  If it is said in any forum that crime is out of control, most people will nod their heads in agreement.  If anybody rings "Liveline" and says "crime is out of control, Joe", most people would agree.  It does not matter what kind of international statistics we have about crime in Ireland versus any other country in the world, people would still nod their head and say crime is out of control.  If we say people in Ireland are overtaxed, most people would again nod their heads and say they are overtaxed.  Again, not to disparage "Liveline" but the caller to that programme would say "we are overtaxed, Joe".  In any pub conversation, political conversation or electoral cycle, people will assume we are overtaxed, despite it not being true.</p><p> We need much more maturity in the Irish political discourse and we cannot pretend to invest more in public services, as the delegations are advocating, with zero cost.  They have provided a very reasonable suggestion of a levy on the corporate sector here, raising &euro;550 million.  We made the political argument that to give away &euro;500 million of tax cuts in the last budget, given the state of public finances, was not the right thing to do.</p><p> I remember almost 30 years ago being a beneficiary of free education at third level and it opened doors for my family and other families like mine that could enter third level education.  Maybe some doors would have been closed to us otherwise.  Nevertheless, we lost the argument on the idea from the mid-1990s until recently.  The suggestion was made that essentially this was an advantage from which only middle class people would benefit.  The argument was that the funding mechanism should have been funnelled in a different way.</p><p> There is no way of adequately funding public services and making them free and excellent, as happens right across Europe, without having a proper discussion about the way we tax and people invest so they can feel proud of their tax system.  They should feel it is a duty and we should get away from the political discourse around every levy and taxation measure.  There is a language around "tax burden" and "squeezed middle" that always seems to come into the political discourse.</p><p> If I am going to nod my head and say the witnesses are absolutely right, as I want to, it would be dishonest of me to say they are right and we must absolutely fund what they want to achieve while telling people during my political campaigning that they are overtaxed.  I do not believe they are.  How do we fix that?  How do we make that political argument and convince the people of Ireland that a fair, transparent and progressive taxation system does not need political buy-off or auctioneering around election time?  Hard questions and choices must be made about how our taxation system produces highly educated and free citizenry.  They are free to make choices and live their lives with an education that has lifted them.  We cannot do that if we still get into the mire of comparing this tax to this levy and the assumption we are overtaxed.  There is also an assumption that public services are not excellent, and that is part of the same right-wing, conservative discussion.  As the witnesses are all seeking money, will they help me out?</p></speech>

I might repeat some of what I say now to Deputy Conway-Walsh when she returns.  We brought forward the notion of a 1% levy on corporate profits and as has been pointed out by Deputy Conway-Walsh, there have been increases in the contribution to the national training fund.  It clearly has not been nearly sufficient to meet the funding gap.  The Deputy's broader point is correct with regard to the commentary that goes with taxation discussion.</p> <p>  In general terms Ireland is not particularly out of line when it comes to income and consumption taxes.  It is out of line with its corporate taxes.  It is why we have focused on a corporate tax levy and a specific levy to take it directly into higher education.  As Mr. Cassells pointed out in his report, employers benefit hugely from what comes from our higher education sector.  It is entirely appropriate for us to look for a contribution from them commensurate with the gains they make from the very availability of the talented work pool from which they benefit.</p></speech>

The Teachers' Union of Ireland has been very clear about that.  I have spoken at rallies, including rallies organised by the Union of Students in Ireland, about this and we are utterly opposed to that.  We are utterly opposed to our current position, quite frankly, and it is extremely unfortunate that the student contribution charge came in when it did in 1996 when a Labour Minister abolished fees.  It was extremely unfortunate that the &pound;150 levy or charge was introduced.  It was the equivalent of &euro;190.46 and it has been multiplied by 15 since as it has gradually worked its way up and become this enormous burden on students.  It must be lifted and we fully support such an effort.</p></speech>

We must change the narrative and we can do that together; this is not a spend on higher education but investment in the country.  There is a very positive Indecon report and my colleague might be quoting from it with respect to returns on investment in higher education.  It was commissioned by the Irish Universities Association in 2019 and it deals with the spend on higher education and returns that come to the Exchequer from that spend.  It is a really good investment for the country and it is worth us trying to discuss that and ensure there is value for money and good returns on that investment.  That is what we are about.  We are not just a bottomless pit seeking more money.  We are seeking proper investment so there can be proper returns to society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Karl Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#F00600"><p>From the tax perspective, Mr. Marjoram has touched on our approach, while Mr. Jones has spoken to the investment perspective.  We can marry the two of them while also looking at the returns that higher education provides to society in general.  We can also consider the targets being set by the Government.  For example, there is a target of 750 apprentices in the public sector but we do not know where they are going.  There are only 50 live apprentices now in local authorities so even if we put apprentices into the local authority sector, we do not have craft workers with whom they could buddy up.  Who would deal with such matters?  How will we deal with Housing for All and retrofitting?  How will we deal with any of this?  We must invest now because we will also see societal problems down the line.  When politicians have a conversation with people at the door, they should also be saying that if we do not invest now, things will get worse.  If we do not invest now, we will not be able to do what we are suggesting.  We will not be able to build student accommodation or deal with such issues.</p> <p>  This is also about societal value.  I went to school in Kilbarrack, where only around four or five people went to the National University of Ireland colleges.  In 1995 I had the grant and in 1996 I paid &pound;50 as a registration fee in University College Dublin.  I was part of the Goldilocks generation and a number of the politicians here would have been part of that too.  Now a &euro;3,000 fee is required.  That conversation must be had about the effect we are having.  I am from a generation that benefited from free education at third level and the State provided that for me.</p> <p>  We must consider societal benefit, investment and tax.  This is about a whole discussion.  That is why we are saying this is the start of a discussion.  We would welcome the opportunity to come back to the committee when a decision has been made by the Department on a future funding model.  We must deal with all those aspects and not just the spending of money.</p><p>We need to have a discussion on how it is spent, what we are targeting and what we are trying to do.  As I said, we would welcome that conversation at that stage.</p></speech>

I am the last man standing.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is coming back in a short while.  The Western Rail Corridor is being discussed in the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication and it is a subject close to her heart.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is keen to continue the discussion on this.</p> <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir as an bhfianaise seo, na f&iacute;ric&iacute; agus an arg&oacute;int.  T&aacute;imse den tuairim go bhfuil cuid mhaith i gcoitiantacht againn.  T&aacute; tuiscint againn ar c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach is at&aacute; oideachas sa tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al agus go dteasta&iacute;onn infheist&iacute;ocht cheart ann. </p> <p>  I will pick up briefly on the previous discussion.  It is not necessary to repeat it.  From my party's point of view, this is, as Mr. Jones has said, about investment.  This is not only about the individuals who cannot benefit and, indeed, should benefit from third level education.  It is about the value of this to us as a society and, to an extent, as an economy.  I do not want to over-emphasise the latter but it is true as well.  As a society, we need to invest in this.</p> <p>  The Cassells report was lengthy but to some extent it stated fairly simply that here is the destination, we need to get to it, there are many ways you can get to it but standing still is not adequate.  The surprising aspect of this discussion is that to a large extent across political parties and organisations, such as Mr. Jones's own, but not limited to it, there is something of a consensus that it should be done through public funding.</p> <p>  The view on a graduate tax, a student loan system or anything like that is a minority view as far as I can gather including in the education sector as a whole.  Indeed, many of the third level institutions and some of their leadership have a different view but several of them are also opposed.  To some extent, it surprises me that the suggestion is somehow so resilient that it keeps coming back into the public debate when there are so many voices against it.  I would make that minor point to agree with Mr. Marjoram on some of the taxation inequalities but perhaps the other point relates to social insurance.  We are a bit out of step in social insurance as well in terms of PRSI compared to our European comparators.</p> <p>  The general point aside, I have some specific questions for Dr. Allen.  On the issue of career pathways for postgraduate researchers and postdoctoral researchers, there are countries we can look to as doing this better but there are also countries we can look to where this is completely collapsing.  The situation in Britain seems to be adverse for postdoctoral researchers, as far as I can gather, in the precarity that exists.  Perhaps Dr. Allen can correct me, but there is a significant danger there in loss.  I have not come across that "up and out" phrase previously but I think I understand what is meant by it.  Can Dr. Allen give me a sense, when the opportunity to progress to full lectureship or a comparable occupation is not there, where is "out"?  Where do they go?  Have we any sense of how many postgraduate-postdoctoral researchers are lost to the system?  Perhaps we do not have that information.  If we do, it would be useful to have a sense of the scale of it.  Obviously, the skills involved in their experience and the expertise would be quite considerable.  I agree that there is a significant issue with the funding model.  It is peculiar that much of the funding is State led but still comes in that compartmentalised fixed-round way.</p> <p>  For the TUI and Mr. Jones, I am also conscious of the issue of fragmentation of employment and that there would be many people working in the sector who have bits and pieces of contracts - a few hours here and a few hours there.  Is there an element to which the higher education authorities are not prioritising people who are already on the books so that they get more full-time jobs and consolidate their hours?  Mr. Jones also expressed a desire - I will afford him the opportunity if he wishes - to expand on the point that they are not officially classed as lecturers, etc.</p> <p>  In response to Ms Austick, the issues with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, are enormous.  There is the issue of the adjacency levels.  It cuts in a number of ways - the threshold to qualify is too low; people on relatively low incomes do not qualify; a large proportion of the people who get grants do not get the full grant; a fairly small proportion gets the full grant; and, in any event, the full grant is not enough to cover costs.  SUSI falls shorts on so many fronts.  I am glad it is being reviewed, but a review is all well and good.  There was a stage where the student contribution was definitely a disincentive but the grant structure and the relevant cost of living was not so serious that large numbers of disadvantaged students or low-income students were put off.  We are now reaching the point, because the SUSI grants are so inadequate, that a significant number of students are facing disincentives of that kind.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Byrne on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I could be wrong on this but I imagine there have been discussions at congress level - I am not sure which trade union would necessarily represent them but perhaps it is SIPTU - about the non-teaching staff, such as the large number of caretakers, grounds staff and carpenters.  Taking caretakers, and probably security as well, for example, many universities are outsourcing these services and privatising them, and some of the terms and conditions are probably under attack.  I would say it is likely to be one of the first areas that universities look at when they are trying to cut costs.  What is the future in relation to that?</p> <p>  There is a lot there but I am hopeful that the Chair might be lenient, given that a few others have perhaps benefited from such leniency.</p></speech>

They do not accurately reflect the cost of living.  That is one of the big issues.  In previous conversations with the Department, the Minister or other key stakeholders, it always has come down to whether we should have investment in publicly-funded higher education, whether the student contribution charge should be reduced or whether there should be investment in the existing financial support services such as SUSI and the student sssistance fund, SAF.  From our perspective, it should be both.  There has to be the complete abolition of the student contribution charge.  It should be publicly funded.  The sector is so significantly underfunded that the student-staff ratios are not average.  The working conditions are not great for staff.  Students are not getting the best, most meaningful, high-quality education possible because they cannot engage in societies or clubs, or have to work part-time jobs, and have to commute up to four hours each day.  There are so many different scenarios that students experience because of the financial hardship that they are in.</p> <p>  In terms of the SUSI and SAF, we are still waiting on the SUSI review to come out to see what has been established and if there will be any financial increases in them.  However, we must look at this in a holistic way.  We must look at the criteria to qualify for the SUSI grant in the first place.  Does one get the full maintenance?  Is it only a portion of it?  Is it only the fees that are covered?  There is the non-adjacency rate as well.  Postgraduate students need support.  International students cannot avail of the SAF or the SUSI grant.  They have no real financial support at all when they come into Ireland and in some instances they pay up to nine times the amount that Irish domestic students do.</p> <p>  There is one other point I want to come back on because I just need to say it.  On the argument for a publicly-funded higher education system, you can take the practical economic approach in terms of the investment and what it does for society but there is also the emotive element to it.  Publicly-funded higher education would provide individuals, but also the collective, the opportunity to upskill, to reskill and to participate in lifelong learning encouraging them to constantly strive for more information and knowledge.</p><p>It supports society in the context of being creative and thinking outside the box and promotes social justice and equality.  There is also the economic argument whereby for &euro;1 of investment, there will be a &euro;3 return.  There are many positives to a potentially publicly funded higher education system.</p><p> This comes back to how we view our education system and whether we see it as a right.  If so, we cannot put a price on it.  Otherwise, we view it as a privilege, although I hope nobody in this room or anybody listening to the meeting thinks that way.  Ultimately, it is a right, not a privilege, and we need to invest in it and ensure that regardless of someone's background, whether he or she has worked or whether he or she wants to attend college or higher education at any stage in life, he or she will have the opportunity to do that.  We need to fund the system.  We need to have a publicly funded higher education system and invest in student accommodation that is affordable, but also ensure the financial supports that are already there are fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I might come in on the point made by the representative of the Irish Research Staff Association.  It related to a different question, but the Teachers Union of Ireland has negotiation rights on behalf of researchers in the institutes of technology and the technological universities.  It has been a very difficult and arduous path to try to do what we want to do, namely, to improve and standardise the terms and conditions.  What we want are terms and conditions that are directly comparable to those of lecturing staff, that is, the same kinds of contracts, the same level of permanency, the same pension rights and rights to leave and so on.  It has not been easy and, after many years, we have not made the progress we wanted.  There are a plethora of contracts, some of which do not have a pay scale but rather a single point where people stay for however long they remain in employment.  Other than that, there are those who have no pension arrangements made for them whatsoever.  Bizarrely, some of the funding that comes in comes from the funding body with 20% added onto the salary portion for a pension contribution, and that has been sent back in some cases, although we really do not understand why there is such a bureaucratic difficulty in doing anything with that money on the part of the host institution.  We are trying to progress these issues, and while it is not easy to do, our intention is to continue with our negotiations and to try to improve the terms and conditions of researchers to a level comparable with those of lecturing staff.</p> <p>  In technological universities, in particular, we want to see an expansion of research capacity, but not a hived-off or separated research activity that is disparate from lecturing.  We think research and lecturing go together, and that is one reason it is a good idea to have comparable terms and conditions in order that there can be interchange and there can be a time in an academic's life when there is a greater focus on one than the other.  The closer together the contracts are, the easier that is to do.</p> <p>  There has been some improvement for the sector.  The review of the model in 2019 applied &euro;5 million in funding directly to the sector for the first time.  That was a small sum - the review had recommended 5% as opposed to the &euro;5 million figure, and it will need to be ramped up to 5%, which would be about four times as much - but it has certainly helped with multiannual planning for research and the building of capacity.  That has been positive but it needs to be built on to a far greater extent.</p> <p>  There was a question about the fragmentation of employment.  To build on what Mr. Jones talked about, TUI was a little ahead of IFUT in gaining the benefits of what he mentioned and of the Cush report.  We met Michael Cush in numerous engagements to try to replicate progress we have made for our teaching grades with regard to far better terms relating to achieving permanency after only two years, as opposed to what is laid out in employment law, where four years has to have passed.  One important aspect of it relates to the augmentation of contracts after a single year of holding additional hours.  I think that was the point that was being made.  We should not have people in the system who are not turned to for additional hours that become available.  We are adamant that is what should happen.  We have an agreement and a circular letter that states that should happen, but there remain implementation difficulties and it is something we are concerned about.  The Cush process, like many of these trade union processes, arose out of industrial action and, frankly, out of saying enough is enough.  Nevertheless, we got something positive and it has improved matters, and we are still working to try to make it as effective as possible by following precisely what was laid down in the circular and the agreement.</p></speech>

I look after predominantly administrative staff in the technological universities, the IOTs and the ETBs.  We got that name changed to professional, managerial and support staff, PMSS, because it was a big bugbear for our members that there were academic and non-academic staff, which in itself suggests the latter were more important.  Much of what has gone on since the austerity years, and is still continuing citing the ECF, relates to specific-purpose contracts, and there is an awful lot of outsourcing of agency staff because of the ECF.  Trying to establish the extent of the cost being incurred by the employer was difficult and, as members can imagine, it was quite expensive compared with direct labour, which is what we are advocating for.  Under fixed-term contracts, members who worked tirelessly had some security under the legislation whereby after four years, they could become permanent and have security of tenure, whereas in the case of specific-purpose contracts, they did not.  There is an awful lot that has to be done in that regard.</p> <p>  By May, five TUs will have been established.  This is an exciting time for many students who, in the first instance, would not have had access to the universities but now they do, at world-renowned institutions.  It is important that rather than throwing money at the issue, there should be engagement with the relevant stakeholders, including all staff and us representing the members, to see what to do.  I am an advocate of the idea that if you want to know how to do a job, you should ask the people who do it.  Let us slow down and get this right.  Let us carry out due diligence that will make us proud.  Many rural institutions were set up because of local socioeconomic factors and afforded an opportunity for students to gain access to third level, and now they have university status.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked how we can make this political argument.  I do not think there is one person in a household who would not advocate for his or her student children to get the best opportunity possible.  We have that now with these TUs.  We need to fund them in such a way that Ireland can be proud and the students who qualify will receive recognised, world-renowned university degrees.</p></speech>

We have members in the IOTs and the TUs, and in the old F&Aacute;S training centres that are now ETBs, such as the instructors, the administration staff and so on.  Ms Griffin hit the nail on the head.  The outsourcing happens at the lowest level, where institutions feel they can implement it.  It happens at the levels of security, caretaking and cleaning.  In the university sector, the majority of those roles are outsourced.  The best example of where that is not done is at Trinity College, and I think the benefit of that can be seen there.  Outsourcing is about saving money, not having to deal with various issues and so on.<br/><br/>Furthermore, due to the ECF, if additional people are needed, there is the question of whether they will be taken in on fixed-term contracts, through an agency or whatever the case may be.  This is why we have requested that, if a decision is to be made, it will not be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  Once we have a new model for the funding, we should sit down and discuss what the new model for the sector will be and how we can move it forward.</p></speech>

The reason for that is that there is no sectoral engagement and social dialogue, believe it or not, across the entire sector.  University and employers' organisations are devising the researchers framework without any input from us.  They are planning out the entire career of researchers through the seven points in the researchers career framework.  When a researcher eventually reaches point 7, there is termination.  A researcher can spend 15 years on a series of contracts and the employer's plan is to get him or her to point 7, where there is termination.  There is no input from the trade unions or social dialogue.  For this to work, there must be social dialogue.  It is an absurd situation.  The point is that without social dialogue and sectoral engagement, we will not get anywhere.</p></speech>

Reference was made to the UK.  I know that with Brexit, they were struggling and there has been a lot of anxiety around the European funding that everyone is chasing.  To reference a specific example from the UK, Bristol University has followed a really good model for a number of years that features tracks.  There is a research track whereby staff can go further in their careers up to research professor level.  In Ireland, most of the time people are trying to segue from being a post-doctoral researcher to a lecturer.  They often change.  It speaks to Mr. Marjoram's point that sometimes there is a different focus on research or teaching.  Something like the Bristol model could be interesting to look at in Ireland.</p> <p>  Just to speak to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point, we are talking about investment and the value of it here.  We are not just looking for a big tranche of funding.  Ms Griffin has touched on the issue of contracts of indefinite duration and specific purpose contracts.  Research staff just want to be treated the same way most people in most sectors are treated, so that if someone works in a particular organisation for a number of years, he or she should have the same entitlement to be kept on and his or her work should be recognised after working in the sector for long enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#J00300"><p>I have a small number of questions in the same vein.  As politicians, we are often asked for funding.  I do not want to be the spoilsport, but I am asking a very serious question.  Different sectors and organisations are coming with a begging bowl looking for money.  The witnesses are experts in the educational field.  That is why they are before us today.  Why is the higher education sector more important than, for example, saving the life of a person who is suffering from cystic fibrosis, or whatever it might be, in an acute hospital?  They are the questions that I am asked if I am in a radio debate.  I do not think there is anybody that does not want more funding for education, but there are so many asks out there.  While it is a spend, it is an investment for the future to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, and everything like that.</p> <p>  I have been a huge advocate for the South East Technological University, SETU, looking at the geography of the south east and where we are located in County Wexford.  We have been told by IDA Ireland that one of the reasons that we cannot attract FDI to Wexford and the south east is because we do not have a third-level education facility.  That is particularly true in respect of County Wexford, and less so in respect of counties Waterford and Carlow.  Now we have ticked that box.  We have the infrastructure and the roads and everything like that.  We have bypasses straight into Enniscorthy and fantastic infrastructure.  I will be after the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Government in general, looking for investment for infrastructure into the all the campuses of the SETU, including the campuses in Carlow, Wexford and Waterford.  It is really important because we are behind in the south east.  The number of people who do their leaving certificate and do not go on to further or higher education but go straight into the workplace is absolutely staggering.  How do I make that argument?  I am not just saying that it is an investment.  There is something behind it as well.  I mentioned the idea of attracting FDI.  I would like the witnesses' views on that issue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-08a.500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Marjoram" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022030800002#J00400"><p>Ms Griffin expressed very well the fact that we share the optimism for technological universities for all that there are challenges that remain.  One thing, for instance, is that we certainly do not want the TUs to lose the really strong grip that they had on the teaching and learning side and the very strong relationship we had with the students.  On the Chairman's basic point, if we look at our own history, what has lifted this country is education.  It has been well expressed here in terms of that investment.  Would we have gotten anywhere near where we are but for very progressive decisions that were made regarding second level education 50-odd years ago?  We would not.  We would still be scrabbling around with a very poor economy.  None of the things that the Chairman rightly pointed to, such as proper healthcare and housing, are achievable without that base of education that generates the kind of economic activity and the kind of society that lifts us all.  That is the very strong point.  TUs give us an opportunity now to do better with regard to those who have not been coming to third level previously, to improve the pathways from further education into third level and into a qualification that is viewed on a par with a third-level qualification, and that adds that value to the local community.  That is one great thing about technological universities, which the Chairman highlighted, is their regional remit and the fact that they can lift the region around them.  There is very strong evidence, and it has been pointed to previously, that every euro spent on education multiplies in a local community.  For example, I saw a study on Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which was scoring highest on this.  Every euro spent was bringing &euro;6 along with it.  That is the argument.  I know it has been repeated, but there is no point in trying to make up a better argument for something that is fundamentally true and totally backed up by our own history.</p></speech>

When we say that we want money, questions will be asked about housing, healthcare and medical care.  I agree with the argument made my Mr. Marjoram.  However, there is also the other side of the argument.  How do we get the medical professionals into the field?  At this moment in time, discussions are ongoing.  We are engaging with the universities and institutes and telling them that we do not want a repeat of situation that occurred last year, which we knew had to happen because of Covid, where extra places had to be put into the system.  If extra places are put into the system, they need to be planned and looked at.  The Department is telling us that we need more medical students going into the system.  That means that we need more labs and bigger lecture theatres, or we need to roster them differently.  To provide the extra medical professionals for the hospitals, we need to invest to ensure that we have quality.  I listened to the meeting of the committee a few weeks ago when the employers, such as the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association, were in.  They were saying the same thing.  We have got to a place where quality has not been affected.  That has involved putting many shoulders to the wheel.  However, quality will be affected if we do not invest in this regard.  We had situations, during Covid, where we had overflow rooms for lectures because we could not fit everyone in the same room.  We had to extend the number of lab sessions that we had because there were pinch points around restrictions to numbers in a lab or training session.  Those are aspects of the Chairman's question.</p> <p>  I raised an issue related to housing.  How do we get the apprentices into the system?  We currently have the highest number of registrations that we have have ever had.  We have a backlog that we are working through very quickly and, hopefully, will be cleared by the summer.  We have engaged constructively with the FET stakeholders.  We and the TUI have done that at all levels to ensure that backlog is dealt with.  However, the questions remain.  How do we deal with Housing for All?  How do we deal with retrofitting?  How do we deal with those areas?  We need to invest.  This is where the societal question arises.  As a politician in the D&aacute;il, the Chairman is being asked about healthcare and housing.  That is where we are looking at all the parts that bring us to the point where we have the person in health to provide healthcare and the builder in construction to build the house that we want built.  That is where we interlink.  As Mr. Marjoram said, it is our education system that allowed us to advance going forward through the 1990s.  That is something that we are asking.</p><p>We are at the point where we have to make a decision.  There is a radical change with regard to digital and green technology and all that sort of stuff.  Will we invest in that?  Will we move forward as a country?  Will we invest in our society and people?</p><p> The people around this table say that is done through the education system.  In fairness to the committee, I have seen some of its comments on access and making sure people get into the system.  That is why it is very important and why all parties have taken significant time discussing disadvantage and, as the Chair said, ensuring people have an opportunity after they leave school.  It is all about lifelong learning as well, so that even if somebody decides to leave school and get a job, maybe at the age of 25, 26, 30 or 40, he or she has the opportunity to get back into the system.</p></speech>

If we keep going the way we are going in terms of engaging researchers on very specific-purpose, externally-funded, short- and fixed-term contracts, there will be no blue skies research.  There will be no Luke O'Neills in a number of years.  We will not have researchers ready to go who are properly engaged and safe and secure in their employment to conduct research in areas they find important.  We will be waiting until medical companies or other funding agencies decide what is important for us to research.  We need blue skies research, not just for the purpose of research but for education.</p> <p>  We have seen that through Covid.  Every news programme over the past two years relied on the few senior researchers left who are comfortably, properly and safely employed on contracts of indefinite duration, CIDs, in both public and private universities.  We have another crisis, our climate crisis, which will put Covid into the ha'penny place.  We need to have our people ready for that and properly safely engaged, rather than waiting on three-year externally-funded contracts that lead to definite termination at the end of the project.</p></speech>

With regard to the accommodation example given by the Chairman, if support was given to colleges to build affordable purpose-built student accommodation and students had accommodation to live in, that would, potentially, free up the private rental market.  We need to identify where education overlaps with different sectors and what we can do, collectively, to ensure there is a better, more prosperous, inclusive society going forward.  Funding allocated to the entire education sector and to building student accommodation would, it is hoped, alleviate the wider accommodation crisis.  We have to link up the different difficulties and challenges we meet and see where the intersectionality is.</p></speech>

Years ago, many students would have lived with widows or single women or single men.  Is that accommodation still used?  They were mostly women who were living on their own after their husband had passed away or their family had moved out and they had two spare bedrooms and provided accommodation.  Is that accommodation still used in the way it was ten, 15 or 20 years ago?</p></speech>

They did not want just anyone living in their rooms and they took their rooms off the market.  Covid has exacerbated the pre-existing student accommodation crisis.  We need affordable purpose-built student accommodation that is available to students.  We need to ensure the rent is affordable and the rooms are up to standard.  It is about finding places for students.  Very often we look at providing course places for students, and that is all great and we want more people to attend college, but we cannot forget about where they will live or stay or how they will commute to college.  Digs accommodation is available but it is very limited.  It is not where it was pre-Covid-19.</p></speech>

It is hoped it will get up and running.</p> <p>  While I am on the subject of construction, one thing has come back quite strongly.  While it is very welcome that significant money has been put forward to improve our infrastructure, the inflation level in construction puts enormous pressure on those trying to see those projects through.  They are very necessary projects for some of our building stock.  Covid highlighted many of the inadequacies with regard to ventilation and so on.  Some of the buildings in the institute of technology sector go back 50 years or slightly more.</p><p>It is a big problem that must be addressed and one the Department must explore in respect of possibly having to provide extra funding to ensure those projects can be completed.  </p></speech>
