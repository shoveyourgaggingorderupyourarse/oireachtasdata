    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#B00200"><p>On behalf of the Regional Internet Service Providers Association, RISPA, I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to appear before the committee and contribute to its discussion on the national broadband plan, NBP.  As part of the delegation today, I am joined by several subject matter experts and representatives of RISPA members who will be answering technical questions.<br/><br/>RISPA is a trade association that was founded by a number of Irish-owned Internet service providers, ISPs, that wished to establish an industry representative body that could provide a coherent voice for the more than 40 ISPs that have been successfully delivering broadband services throughout the rural regions of Ireland for the better part of 20 years.  RISPA's aim is to raise awareness of regional ISPs and address the issues they face so that the roll-out of reliable high-speed broadband services can be accelerated and delivered to rural Ireland within two years.<br/><br/>In respect of the purpose of RISPA's appearance before the committee today, RISPA recognises the important role that the committee serves in scrutinising all matters pertaining to communications policy and appreciates the privileged opportunity to assist the committee's examination of rural broadband issues.  RISPA's appearance before the committee today is intended to help the committee's investigation of the NBP's process and provide advice about the options for accelerating the roll-out of rural broadband.  In support of its appearance, RISPA has provided a written submission that outlines issues relating to the NBP's process and proposes a different approach to solving Ireland's rural connectivity gap.  RISPA's suggested approach is based on a hybrid model of complementary technologies and a series of proven policies that collectively represent an alternative to the NBP.  RISPA intends that the information it presents to the committee will provide its members with new insights on the NBP and the best options for rolling out cost-effective and timely high-speed broadband services.<br/><br/>RISPA has serious concerns about the NBP.  Regarding the accuracy of the intervention area, a recurring issue throughout the NBP's procurement process has been the mapping of premises that do not have access to a minimum 30 Mbps broadband service.  The implications of these mapping inaccuracies were most evident when 300,000 premises had to be removed from the intervention area because Eir concluded that they were commercially viable for the provision of its fibre optic broadband service.  Such mapping inaccuracies were exacerbated by the fact that the intervention area failed to take into consideration the approximately 125,000 premises that are customers of regional ISPs, many of which had already begun rolling out next generation broadband services to rural Ireland when the procurement process began.  Ultimately, the accurate mapping of the intervention area is necessary to minimise the financial burden on the State and prevent the overbuilding of infrastructure.  Consequently, RISPA advocates that a real-time market monitoring system be implemented and maintained by ComReg and that such a system would be designed to allow ISPs to demarcate the areas that they serve and provide a facility for citizens to appeal such information.<br/><br/>Regarding the issue of encroachment, related to the problem of an inaccurate intervention area is the issue of the encroachment clause in the NBP's proposed contract.  Such a clause would compensate the winning bidder should the number of premises in the intervention area fall below 542,000.  Considering that approximately 125,000 of these premises are already customers of regional ISPs, RISPA is concerned that upon signing the NBP contract, the State may be immediately liable for the payment of large encroachment fees to the winning bidder.<br/><br/>Regarding the potential removal of retail restriction, a leaked <i>aide-memoire</i>from the Department of Communications reveals that the winning bidder is to be the retailer of last resorts.  In the event that the uptake of fibre broadband services is lower than expected and the cashflow of the winning bidder suffers such that it cannot afford to build out and operate the network, RISPA believes that there will be pressure put on the Department to lift the retail restriction.  If this were to happen, the ISPs that retail broadband services over the network could be disadvantaged and possibly exit the market, which would leave the winning bidder in a monopoly position that would run contrary to the very purpose of the NBP.<br/><br/>In respect of EU state aid rules, RISPA notes that the EU guidelines for the development of broadband networks to correct market gaps direct that member states should limit the scale of their interventions as much as possible.  The guidelines instruct member states to intervene only after the private sector has failed to deliver services commercially.  Where a member state elects to intervene, the guidelines clearly state that interventions should begin with the least intrusive policy instruments, such as those described in RISPA's written submission.  Only after such policy measures have failed does the EU recommend that member states consider more intrusive interventions like the NBP.  In short, the guiding principle of the EU rules is that interventions should target market failures and not crowd out existing market operators from areas in which they plan to invest or have already made network investments.<br/><br/>RISPA fully supports the laudable aim of rolling out high-speed broadband services to rural Ireland.  RISPA believes that the NBP will fall considerably short of its target for 100% of premises to have access to broadband services and that the project does not represent good value for money.  RISPA would argue that the collective policies it has outlined in its written submission represent an alternative approach that would achieve the NBP's aim in two years instead of seven and for a net cost to the State of &euro;402 million compared with &euro;2.97 billion.  Consequently, RISPA advocates that the NBP's procurement process be halted so that a comprehensive evaluation can be undertaken of the recommendations that it has outlined in its written submission, which the committee is now invited to discuss and ask questions about.  This concludes RISPA's opening statement.  I now yield to the Chair.</p></speech>

For the wireless option, the restriction was that one had to use licensed spectrum to do that.  I think the other witnesses would be more familiar with the timing of the auction.  I cannot remember exactly when it was but I believe the auction for the licensed spectrum had just passed-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Gartlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#B00500"><p>It came in around that period for the 3.5 GHz licence, so the two things happened in parallel, and as a result, the operators of unlicensed spectrum were excluded from taking part in the submission process at that time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#B00600"><p>Was that the reason RISPA did not enter the procurement process?</p></speech>

Obviously, RISPA did not exist as an entity during that time.  RISPA is a new entity designed to bring the industry together to operate as a coherent voice.  However, there have been other organisations down through the years that have repeatedly attempted to influence public policy and the process itself.  There were consultations and recommendations, paperwork was filled out and options were explained to the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin List-Petersen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#B00800"><p>There is another item.  Regarding the 3.5 GHz licensed spectrum, before the auctioning off of the spectrum so the change ran parallel to the start of the NBP procurement process, each provider could apply for a 20 km radius - a chunk of Ireland.  They would buy them in the areas they were serving.  Obviously, a regional provider will only serve a part of Ireland.  With the change of licensing of that spectrum, all the providers that had been using 3.5 GHz spectrum were basically booted out of that spectrum and forced to move to unlicensed spectrum because it was not affordable for them to buy a nationwide spectrum block.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#C00200"><p>Just to provide some more clarity, the policy in Ireland has been to auction spectrum nationally for the whole country.  A multi-award model was examined for the 3.5 GHz element and that did divide up various areas.  It was quite successful but it still covered huge chunks of the country.  The United Kingdom, for example, has addressed this issue quite successfully and it has implemented a use it or lose it policy on spectrum.  The mobile network operators can purchase vast blocks of spectrum to serve the urban and suburban areas they need.  In the rural areas, however, where they do not tend to use the spectrum, what is happening is that regional ISPs purchase that auction for that region to use it in a service.  It is quite a good model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin List-Petersen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#C00300"><p>Another factor also made it unfeasible for us to partake.  The technology requirement set for the spectrum auction mandated the use of long-term evolution, LTE, based equipment.  We did not have the freedom of choice to use alternative transmission methods.  If we were to purchase nationwide spectrum, it had to be LTE equipment.  That equipment costs much more than alternative products we can get that can achieve the same speeds or similar.</p></speech>

We have heard from witnesses, particularly from the Department, who have spoken about broadband being the game changer for the next 20 or 30 years.  I would like some information on the speeds that will be provided in future.  We have had presentations from the Department concerning elearning, efarming and ehealth.  Developments in those areas will require major changes and high speeds.  How would the witnesses fit their criteria within the context of the speeds required?  Are they happy that their technology has the potential to provide those speeds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#C00600"><p>In our written submission we have given an overview of the evolution of broadband radio technology.  We referred to the speed in 2012 as being 30 Mbps and remarked on the jumps experienced since then.  The products themselves are now rated for 200 Mbps and some of the members here have connections installed that are achieving that speed in licence-exempt bands, which are noisy.  Regarding the evolution of long-range technology, by 2025 the prediction is that 500 Mbps will be possible.  I am referring to long-range and serving multiple premises from the same site.</p> <p>  At the moment, in respect of short-range provision, a new category of short-range broadband radio technology has come on stream which allows premises to be linked together.  It is like laying wireless fibre.  That is the easiest way to describe it.  That technology operates at about 1 Gbps.  In the second quarter of next year that technology is going to become multi-gigabit.  It will then be in the range of 3.5 Gbps.  If there are strings of houses within a reasonable distance of each other, it will be possible to install these radio units and it is possible to keep going-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#C00800"><p>Technically, it is a mesh networking technology.  All of the elements interlink with each other.  It is exactly like a fibre cable.  When a fibre cable is laid, all of the homes that it passes will be connected to that same cable and all of those houses will share that same bandwidth.  These multi-gigabit broadband radios do exactly the same thing as fibre cable except they do not need the wire.  That is basically how it works.  Regarding the evolution of speeds, we are already seeing multi-gigabit products coming onto the market now.  It is admittedly a category of short-range radio technology.  On the long-range technology, however, we are already up to 200 Mbps and the conservative estimate is 500 Mbps by 2025.</p> <p>  When I appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts I remember that there were discussions on this issue in the context of wireless technology.  I heard figures mentioned of 20 Gbps.  I tend to stick very close to hard research that I trust and that figure of 500 Mbps by 2025 is a very realistic.  That is the evolution of where we are going.  There are appendices in the back of our submission which contain information on the specifications under development.  The fastest specification at the moment is just over 10 Gbps.  In the context of short-range, we are seeing great speeds.  To transfer that into the longer-range radios takes time.  Regarding where this is going, however, and based on the technology shifts experienced to date, there is no reason to doubt that trend and trajectory will not continue.</p></speech>

If we operate in the 5 GHz spectrum, then the technology will be line of sight.  If we operate in the 3.5 GHz spectrum, however, technology exists that is near line of sight so it will cope with certain impairments.  If we go down then in the radio spectrum to 700 MHz or similar, we will be talking about non-line of sight.  In the United States, there is an unlicensed spectrum in the 928 MHz band.  The US did not roll out the global system for mobile communications, GSM, in the 900 MHz band but in the 850 MHz band.  It started with 1900 MHz.  Fixed wireless operators in the United States are operating non-line of sight in the 928 MHz band to provide broadband to customers.</p></speech>

We will have to look at every individual scenario.  The way we operate today with fixed wireless technology is that we have multiple base stations and repeaters, which means that if it is not possible to connect a premises from one location, then it will be possible to connect it from another.  There have to be multiple options.</p></speech>

We reduced the distances in those sites down to below 6 km.  When we get down to those distances, the likelihood that we will not have line of sight or the likelihood that we will not be able to cover somebody is very low.  We also discussed in our submission the importance of allocating the correct spectrum bands.  We discussed allocating low bands, namely, 700 MHz, which is non-line of sight as we have just heard, and allocating something in the mid-band, that is----</p></speech>

Mr. Neote has set up an example of a broadband radio unit here today and it can be seen how small it is.  Regarding what regional ISPs do, the technology involved does not tend to be massive tower masts on hilltops.  The technology used tends to be on a high point in a local rural area.  That could be a farmer's shed on top of a hill.  It could be as simple as that.  I reiterate that broadband radio technology is a different type of technology and not the same as cellular technology which requires those high sites which are trying to cover a larger distance.</p> <p>  The redundancy built into broadband radio technology and specifically the model we are talking about is multifold.  We are talking about dealing with small distances from the sites to the premises and that is the first aspect of redundancy.  There are also, as Mr. List-Petersen said, multiple different angles available because of the distances from the units themselves.  It is different, therefore, in respect of the number of sites required.  We did the calculations, and again, we were just looking at covering the entire landmass of Ireland, so it was a simple and very rudimentary calculation, and we came up with 795 sites based on that model.</p></speech>

Many of the regional providers operate on a completely different subset of small repeaters.  It is for budgetary reasons but also because we are happy enough providing to areas even if there are only 40, 160 or 300 customers there.  In the circumstances in question, we cannot use a traditional mast &ndash; never mind the cost of gaining access to one.</p></speech>

In some cases, if there is a particularly large number of premises in a given area, fibre would be run to the site.  That is the beauty of the model.  We are talking about fibre extension, not building huge swathes of network infrastructure.  If one fibre extension is brought to the right geographical area, multiple broadband radio sites can be loaded on.  Each one could have 160 to 200 customers.  Very quickly, therefore, a large number of premises can be covered with the next generation access speeds we are talking about in a much more flexible and efficient way.</p> <p>  With regard to infrastructure, it is very scalable.  That is the simple answer.  It is not necessary to take up every road.  Separate fibre extensions are installed and then technology of the kind I have referred to is used.  It can be put up in an afternoon.  One can connect a home in two hours.  I refer to the antenna.  One can see from the equipment I have to hand the antenna at the top of the stand.  That is the sum total of it.  One can run all the broadband services over the top of that.  I refer to high-speed Internet access, a telephone service, television and whatever one wants.  That is the sum total of the infrastructure.</p></speech>

Mr. Matthews did not get involved in the process until 2015.  The other three operators in the process were all opting for fibre to the home.  He has suggested a totally different model.  If the process were reopened, would his company come on board in the retendering?  Does he believe the process has moved on such that the focus is just on the fibre itself?</p></speech>

What we are proposing to do is abnormal.  The only jurisdiction of which I am aware that has truly achieved 100% fibre is the island of Jersey.  Everywhere else, there is a hybrid model where broadband radio covers the rural part.  If we were to consider this again, we would need to consider what has been done in the United Kingdom, for example.  We would need to consider a use-it-or-lose-it model of spectrum.  We would need to consider what Scotland is doing.  It tried to have 100% fibre under the digital Scotland superfast broadband scheme.  It did very well but it does not have the same type of development pattern.  It has a more clustered development pattern.  It had very successful fibre roll-out but it concluded that it makes sense to introduce a hybrid approach.  It is going at it in terms of the design of the consumer subvention programme.  This involved connection grants, which are technology agnostic.  Once the Internet service provider can meet the performance criteria, which is what we are talking about, it can use whatever technology it likes.  It can run fibre to the home or it can use broadband radio.  In terms of reopening the process, we would need to follow what other countries have done or elected to do and are doing successfully.  We would need to consider a licence-protected model, such as that in France.  A licence-protected model means the licence is not auctioned.  It involves protecting a section of the band.  The only people who may access the band are those who make an application to deliver high-speed rural broadband to premises.  If they do not meet the performance targets, the application is rejected.  It removes the cost burden and allows existing regional Internet service providers to start solving the problem immediately.  By striking the decision in terms of the licence-protected model, it immediately opened up 2 million homes to coverage by existing regional providers.</p> <p>  Let me return to the question of reopening the process and what we talked about in our written submission.  One would need a licence-protected model that allocates a suitable spectrum.  One would need some low band and some midband.  One would need several of the other policy instruments that have been outlined in our written submission.  There should be a consumer subvention model to cover those premises that are not commercially viable.  There would ideally be a State-backed affordable loan scheme, similar to what was done with the agricultural cash flow scheme.</p></speech>

As I recall, representatives of Analysys Mason, a firm of international consultants, said when they were before us they had never seen any place like Ireland because of the ribbon development along roads.  If I recall correctly, they concluded in their work on the national broadband plan that rural Ireland could not be served in the manner Mr. Matthews has suggested.  Owing to development along country roads, it was found the only technical way of proceeding was to run fibre.  It is difficult because we are not technical experts.  He said the work can be done with a similar non-cable-based, house-to-house solution.  Who do we believe technically?</p></speech>

I read extensively the various reports by Analysys Mason.  None of what it said to the committee makes sense.  It has more documents discussing the importance of wireless technologies for solving the rural broadband issue.  It maintains a standing report on what other countries are doing with fixed wireless access technology.  It monitors continuously how the countries on its list use wireless technologies to address the issue of broadband access in rural areas.  It is quite detailed.  In all the documentation one reads, the recommendation is that the wireless technologies comprise the way to cover rural areas and serve them with high-speed broadband services.  I am not sure why the representatives said to the members that broadband radio is not the appropriate technology.</p></speech>

Even if there is a mast on a high point, such as at a local school, church or barn, it is very difficult to cover every house and the only way one can be certain of doing so is by looping from house to house.  I suppose the representatives were not saying it could not be done with house-to-house fixed wireless, or radio technology.  I understand them to say that one could not easily get a high point to cover all the houses along a road because they may be behind trees, a little hill or a turn.  There is a meandering pattern of development everywhere that has no concentration of hamlets.  There is just road-based housing development, which makes Ireland completely different from any other country.  There is nowhere else in the world that has a road-frontage, sprawl-development model.  Analysys Mason says it is just not physically possible to proceed with a fixed wireless solution.</p></speech>

More than 70 providers are registered with ComReg for a general licence for wireless broadband transmission.  If more than 40 providers are actively selling wireless broadband in rural Ireland, what is the reason for that when it is not possible?</p></speech>

Obviously, there is the odd house, which we have come across, that is completely enclosed in trees and it cannot be done.  I know of one scenario where the receiver was put up in a tree.</p></speech>

When we refer to radio, it is the radio wave spectrum.  Fixed wireless is the same thing.  Either term - wireless or radio wave - can be used.  It is all on the invisible microwave spectrum.  Mr. List-Petersen said that the next likely development is in the 700 MHz spectrum but he did not finish the point.  I presume it was approximately 2 GHz.</p></speech>

To briefly track back on Mr. List-Petersen's point, in terms of the position we are in now where we have the odd house which cannot be covered, it must be remembered that currently all regional providers are forced to operate in licence exempt bands, which are very noisy.  The spectrum that has been allocated is not the ideal mix.  It is very restrictive in terms of the options.  What we have done in this written submission is outline the mixture of spectrum bands of which 700 MHz was one.  That is a low band which the members have heard is for non-line-of-sight locations and to deal with trees, the drumlins and everything else one needs to bounce the signals through to make sure they are getting the 150 Mbps.</p> <p>  We have outlined also the position in terms of the midband.  There are three options in the midband; they are in the written submission.  I refer to the 2 GHz band.  What is needed are continuous blocks of approximately 100 MHz per second assigned in a licence protected model.  That means that the only people who can use it are, say, the regional Internet service providers, ISPs.  If that licence protected model was implemented and suitable spectrum bands such as the ones outlined - a mixture of low and mid frequencies - were allocated, we would get into a situation where that lone house is suddenly covered.</p> <p>  We have taken that one step further and said that if we reduced the differences from the sites and took a very conservative limit - in reality one would probably do it over a longer distance - of, say, a maximum distance of approximately 6 km, it would be very interesting to see if there was a premises that was not covered.</p></speech>

It is due to be cleared by March 2020.  We do not know what will happen at that time.  We imagine it will be auctioned off but it will be a highly significant and useful band width for use for broadband radio because it could provide coverage to, say, the final 5% of premises where trees, drumlins and small hills are in the way.  Generally, the lower in the frequency we go, the better it penetrates through obstructions.  I will use the analogy of driving from Dublin to Belfast and listening to RT&Eacute;.  One starts off in Dublin listening on digital audio broadcasting, DAB, which is on a higher frequency.  The quality is very good but the range is quite short at 30 km to 40 km, which is good compared to broadband radio.  However, as one drives up the coast and moves into areas where DAB cannot cover, it falls back to VHF, or what we call traditional FM.  That provides coverage to approximately 60 km from one's area because the frequency is lower and it penetrates better through obstructions, hills, trees and forests.  Driving along the motorway one enters Northern Ireland but once one goes 60 km in, one is out of range because the terrain has blocked it and one has to move to a lower frequency again such as AM or LW to continue listening.</p> <p>  A similar analogy can be given in respect of broadband radio in that the lower the frequency used, the better the penetration one gets from broadband radio.  That is at a slight sacrifice in terms of speed but we envisage that will be used only for the 5% of premises we cannot service on the mid and high frequencies.</p></speech>

When we hear about 5G, it is technically a 5G new radio line of code.  It is a software upgrade to existing 4G technology.  The straight up 5G in terms of hardware will come out later in the year.  It is interesting that in the US, Horizon did some trials in terms of rural broadband with several mobile network operators.  They found that in the rural regions the performance increase over 4G was not substantial.</p> <p>  If we go back to the original concept of 5G in terms of its development, it was to serve high density environments such as airport terminals and subway stations.  It started out as a need to develop a new standard because everyone now has a mobile phone and we have scenarios where tens of thousands of people are in very close proximity to each other.  We need technology that can deliver a large volume of throughput to all of these people in close proximity to each other.  The scope grew as the technology was developed and it co-opted the rural broadband access issue.  It has since become associated more with the idea of providing rural broadband access than, say, the original impetus for its development.</p> <p>  In terms of its development, 5G is not a technology designed for the type of rural broadband and rural connectivity gap we face.  From its initial concept to the development stages through to the finished product, the technology used by regional ISPs has always been about connecting multiple premises from a single site at the highest speed possible.</p></speech>

Some of those customers' houses will be passed.  They will have the option of getting the fibre connection at a charge of &euro;100.  A total of 2% might be by alternative means but the vast majority will be fibre.  Does Mr. Matthews believe his ISPs will keep the retail relationship and switch over to the fibre connection?  Will he migrate that easily from his fixed wireless network to retail through the fibre?  If there is not a sufficient number of customers, where is that risk that the Department would lift the retail restriction?</p><p>It has been fairly clear all along that this has to be open access.  There could be open access where the provider was also acting as a retailer, I suppose.  There is no sense whatever that Grattan McCourt has infrastructure or any interest in becoming a retail provider.  Surely that is not the risk to the companies represented here.  The risk is that some other service provider with another retail arm would use the fibre connection to compete with them and take out small, local, indigenous companies that have been doing a good job over the past 20 years.  The bigger risk is not that the developer would take the business but that other retailers would do so.</p></speech>

There have been previous successful attempts in which two previous trade associations were set up.  When the national broadband plan process started, the industry as a whole was very active and spent an inordinate amount of time filling out paperwork and engaging in consultations, much of which was to no avail.  This time around in terms of the industry having a third run of it, there was a feeling that we had done all this before when we submitted all those reports.  In 2015, an independent report by the eminent economist, Colm McCarthy, went to the Department but nothing came of it.  With RISPA it was a case of those who were willing to go again.</p></speech>

In terms of spectrum allocation and changing that policy, there is a subtle relationship.  ComReg has wide scope in the strategies and policies but is advised by the Minister on what it looks at and investigates.  Section 13 of the Communications Act 2002 allows the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, to allocate any spectrum band for any justified purpose.  The Minister can direct ComReg to do that.  That is worth noting.  It does not have to come from ComReg.  The Minister can say he wants it considered and request a submission regarding how it would be implemented.</p></speech>

The reason, historically, that the mobile network operators have always won those auctions is that they have the scale and they are delivering cellular services nationally.  What we are saying is that the trend in other countries is that many have realised that those mobile network operators are only using the spectrum in urban and suburban environments.  What these countries are doing is looking at regional allocation models and deciding that if the spectrum is not being used in rural regions, they will hold regional auctions for that or they will have regional licences that can allocate that spectrum at a much more affordable rate.  In the UK, for instance, if a mobile network operator is not using licensed spectrum in a rural area, a regional ISP can apply for the spectrum and pay &pound;900 sterling for it per year.  I believe that is correct. </p></speech>

If the mobile network operator then comes in after three years and there is a significant surge, it can then take the spectrum back.  It is a much more efficient way of utilising the spectrum and one will get many more people involved in it who can then deliver more services.</p></speech>

That is all a bit hazy from a Government perspective in terms of providing a service, getting it done on time and leaving very little room for doubt.</p> <p>  Reference was made to Mr. Colm McCarthy, which is fair enough, but is there any evidence that the companies represented here ever came together collectively in the past or made any effort to get involved?  If we accept that the procurement process, as established, was too rigorous or constrained for them to participate, they did not lobby or come before this committee.  These companies did not come to me as a public representative and put an alternative view.  I take it that is also the case with my colleagues as I would have heard about it anecdotally.  This is akin to a colleague buying a bad car which I knew it to be a bad car and then my saying to him that I knew it was a bad car when he had already bought it.  Why were the witnesses not more proactive about getting involved at a critical stage in either forming our opinions or forming the Department's view.  Why are they coming in at this point?</p></speech>

I am a long-standing member of this committee.  I remember when my good colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was Minister that I was spokesperson in the Seanad on this area.  We debated the broadcasting legislation and other Bills together.  I am almost reluctant to say how long I have been on this committee, yet nobody ever raised this issue with me before now.  I am far from having the solution but, collectively, the witnesses should have been talking to us and our political leaders.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

He, among others, said that to achieve fairness, as policymakers we cannot make a decision.  Coming from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, it would be negligent of me if I stood idly by &ndash; to use that awful clich&eacute; &ndash; while a less sound system of providing broadband to people in isolated areas was chosen.  The view of Mr. Weckler and other technical experts &ndash; evidence was cited earlier &ndash; is that only through the fibre option can one be sure beyond doubt that fairness and evenness are created.  I refer to the man at the back of the hill, a phrase I grew up with, in other words, the people who live in isolated rural areas.  Fairness should be applied to them and their rights should be taken into account.  Why should they be put into a two-tier system on a wing and a prayer and using less secure technology when the view is that the fibre optic solution is needed?  It is the best solution.  I am not saying that other solutions do not work, to a degree, and the witnesses are a crucial part of the market, but what we are talking about is whether there is a viable, workable alterative to the national broadband plan.  That is basis of the terms of reference of the committee.  Bearing that in mind, one must assume that we cannot have apples and oranges and that the solution must be all apples or all oranges, in other words, that the person in an isolated area such as Ballydehob must have the same access to broadband and the same level of technology as the person in south Dublin.  As policymakers, we cannot make an alternative decision that would put people in rural areas on a different footing.  We would be negligent if we were to do so.</p></speech>

They have used fibre to the cabinet.  They are using copper technologies.  The 1.7 million premises of their roll-out use copper.  Of those, a large chuck are sub-30 Mbps.  On top of that, because there is an issue where some of the copper lines still do not go to the nearest cabinet and they go to the exchange, to cabinets miles away, etc., which has not solved anything.  That is why Open Eir has turned around, because it has this old legacy network that dates back 20 years or even more, and said that the only way it will fix this is by now also going fibre.  This is what they do traditionally.</p> <p>  Open Eir, or, in its traditional sense, Eircom, also always had a nationwide 3.5 GHz licence.  They have run WiMax trials.  They have had customers on WiMax.  They have never run the product because they are a traditional telecommunications company.  SIRO, on the other hand, sprang out of ESB Networks.  They are using ESB Networks power lines.  Basically, the easiest way for them was fibre.  It is down to the scalability with that.  This is all urban.  What we are talking about here is the national broadband plan, which is all rural.  SIRO has nothing in such rural scenarios.  It is cities, towns and villages to a certain extent.  It makes a whole lot of sense with fibre there because if one runs with radio links and one does not have the spectrum to run non-line of sight, then one has houses in the way everywhere.  In an urban scenario, one would need non-line of sight spectrum, and one would need a lot of it to do it, which is what the mobile network operators do.  In an urban scenario, even though one has a 4G signal, often one does not have a lot of bandwidth because there are just too many people and there is not enough spectrum.</p></speech>

This next issue is one of human reality that, as policymakers, we cannot avoid.  We have had a number of such issues.  There is a considerable campaign in Cavan-Monaghan regarding the undergrounding versus overgrounding of the cables of the North-South interconnector.  The not-in-my-back-yard, NIMBY, syndrome is evident all over Ireland.  In the abstract, it is grand.  Of course, people feel an unfairness and wonder why are all these structures, such as masts, lumped out in the sticks.  Mr. Matthews and I can argue about the figure, but he will accept that he would need up to 6,000 masts all over Ireland to achieve his objectives.</p></speech>

Even under the Constitution, from a legalistic point of view, every citizen has to be cherished equally.

This has been raised a number of times during our hearings.  ComReg, which is the trusted independent body in this field, has told us 6,000 masts would be needed to deliver 5G.  I take the RISPA's point that it is proposing something completely different from 5G.  The Plum report stated that fixed-wire operators would require 4,000 to 5,000 masts.  If the witnesses are, therefore, proposing masts, we need clarity as to how many there would be, the planning issues that would arise and the timeframe for erection of the masts.  We need that understanding.</p></speech>

We are currently rolling out what we call our next generation service.  It is a 50-plus Mbps service.  We have 19 sites in Cavan and Monaghan.  They could be on a farmer's shed, the side of a pole in a haggard or a yard, or a hill, like some of them up in Slieve Glah, in Cavan, where there is a mast.  From those 19 sites in Cavan-Monaghan we have close to 4,000 rural customers in the Senator's constituency.  Regarding our penetration, we have recently obtained a test-and-trial licence from ComReg to operate on the 700 MHz low band.  I think the Senator was at the launch last month in Teagasc's Ballyhaise College.  That project is-----</p></speech>

They need support, and what they do is important.  The launch in Ballyhaise College was exciting and wonderful, and the more such events the better.  That is not the issue here.  Our issue is whether this is a viable alternative to the national broadband plan.  That is what our report will have to deal with specifically.  Of course the witnesses' services are efficacious and do great good and there are beneficiaries - I know some of them - which I support.  The question, however, is whether they can jump from this to an assumption that they deliver the entire national broadband service.</p></speech>

RISPA is not advocating that it should deliver the entire national broadband service.  We are putting forward an alternative argument as to how the speeds that are set out can be achieved in an alternative way that costs the State less money.</p></speech>

RISPA made the point in its written submission that the projected cost of the national broadband plan has spiralled to &euro;2.97 billion.  We were led to understand by a number of other witnesses to the committee, by the Department, etc., that the State will get VAT on this back.  That would amount to a reduction of up to &euro;350 million.  Do the witnesses accept that?</p> <p>  Within the &euro;2.97 billion, approximately &euro;527 million has been provided to avoid a scenario we have all been reading about recently relating to another large project, that is, to avoid the risk of escalating costs.  The &euro;527 million has been put in as a cushion such that the cost may go up or down but will not exceed the &euro;2.97 billion.  The likelihood is, with good management and the Department's rigorous protocols and controls, that the &euro;527 million cost will be avoided.  This takes the cost nearer to &euro;2 billion.  Furthermore, is it not the case that there is a clawback facility, assuming a high take-up?  I think there will be a high take-up.

Who would have thought 20 years ago that we would all have mobile phones?  Who would have thought when the ESB started that everyone would want an electricity supply given people were almost afraid of electricity at the outset?  This process will change and there will be an enormous take-up.  This is the future.  We have a political imperative; the witnesses have a commercial imperative.  Everyone has an imperative to get this right.  The &euro;2.97 billion figure is not correct because of the VAT reduction, the cushion of more than &euro;500 million to allow for escalating costs, which we do not anticipate will arise, and the clawback.  In this way, the figure could realistically fall a little below &euro;2 billion.  Mr. Matthews said there will not be a high take-up.  In the UK, one of the witnesses told us, the take-up was far greater than anticipated.  I put it to the witnesses that the figure of &euro;2.97 billion is not correct.</p></speech>

Our headline figures reflect the maximum and the worst-case scenario of having to build the model with an incredible volume of redundancy.  One can talk about clawbacks and success rates, but that is like reading tea leaves as to what the future will be like.  One must take the headline figure, the top figure, and presume that it could go that way, just as we picked figures and presumed that a loan scheme could cost up to &euro;500 million and that connection vouchers could cost up to &euro;412 million.  In public policy planning, that is how one must look at this.  There will be clawbacks and all these other mechanisms, but we does not know exactly how this will turn out.  The bottom line is that the Senator is talking in billions of euro and we are talking in millions of euro.  It is quite disturbing to me as a citizen that he would not be more prudent in examining the information and reading through in much greater detail the arguments that have been laid out.  If we are talking about saving the country these large sums, I think that-----</p></speech>

We want to know exactly how many masts RISPA is proposing to install to serve the 540,000 people.  The complexity of planning has been outlined by many individuals.  We already know about the problems with mobile reception in some areas.  Constituents contact us and we say that they need a mast in their area but there is an objection to putting up a mast for mobile reception.  These are the political complexities surrounding this issue.  That is why there are many questions about what exactly RISPA is proposing for the roll-out of masts and planning.  I am not over-simplifying, that is our concern.</p></speech>

We would have to bring fibre into certain rural areas.  If we took somewhere like Wicklow, we might do four fibre extensions for the entire county and use broadband radio to connect the last mile network.  Rather than digging up every road and town to run fibre everywhere, it would be extended where it makes sense and then we would use a flexible technical model which exceeds the target specification proposed in the NBP to deliver the services.  To come back to the Chairman's original question about the masts, they are not desirable, the model was built in such a way that we would not get into building 6,000 masts.  We were considering 20 or 30.</p></speech>

That is why that mast infrastructure does not have to be used.  It is used to cover huge distances and get a load of properties in the coverage arc, from the unit.  If the distance is reduced, however, they can be located in a more targeted way.  They cover fewer premises but the quality of service is much higher and more flexible and we avoid dealing with masts.</p></speech>

The Chairman can comment on the red line of the technicalities in respect of that.  The second point is about the gigabit connections.  All of the companies here provide wirelessly extremely high-speed connections of 1 Gbps plus.  It is possible to provide up to 10 Gbps with broadband radio technology.  Businesses that want that type of connectivity already have it and have had it for a very long time.

It has been the case for many years, and some of the members of our delegation can attest to this if they like, that businesses which require multi-gigabit connectivity have had it for some time because they need it.</p> <p>  If the Chairman is talking about private households, the question is how many of them are taking multi-gigabit services.  We discussed earlier how the uptake beyond entry level connections is very low.  The technology is already there and subscriptions are available if people want 50 Mbps and 100 Mbps to their homes.  I could have 150 Mbps now if I wanted it.  I do not need it at all.  I may need it in the future at which point the technology will have moved on further again.  We have to look to see who needs that level of connectivity and when.</p></speech>

We saw the BBC demonstration that was carried out in London a couple of weeks ago with the launch of the EE 5G trials.  The reporter had to sit with the telephone facing a certain direction to get it because the coverage was so small and was reflecting off buildings.  Perhaps ComReg is referring to something akin to that.  I am not sure because I have not seen it.</p></speech>

There is an issue that it is the same as the technology used by regional ISPs, but it is not.  In terms of the cost and the number of sites, I have no doubt that is accurate if it was to be done via 5G, but we are not talking about 5G.  We are talking about a technology that has been purposely designed and has been used for 20 years to deliver connectivity in remote and rural regions across the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin List-Petersen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#L00600"><p>With regard to the figures, the Senator is talking about 540,000 premises.  That is the figure for premises passed that the NBP wants to achieve.  When we talk about 4,000 to 5,000 premises that Net1 covers in the Monaghan and Leitrim area, that is 4,000 to 5,000 premises that are subscribed.  There is also competition from ADSL, the copper technologies, mobile broadband and other platforms.  Not every household in that coverage is subscribed to the service.  It is apples and oranges again.  One thing is uptake and the other is premises passed.  One cannot just say that the 4,000 to 5,000 do not scale to the 540,000 nationwide because one must consider uptake.  In addition, the Senator said he expects a high uptake under the national broadband plan.  Even Open Eir, with a 300,000 roll-out, did not have a very high uptake.  It did not anticipate that, for example, we are already covering many of these customers, who did not move because we could give them an adequate service or they were not interested in paying for the service needed to get the line into the property.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#L00700"><p>On that point, it is interesting that regional ISPs have maintained their customer numbers in spite of the fibre roll-out of Eir's 300,000 intervention.  It is something we were discussing a few weeks ago.  It is quite intriguing.  One can only come to one conclusion in that.  As the number of premises took up that service, and it is reckoned that approximately 14% of premises passed during that Eir roll-out did, it would have been taking them predominantly from regional ISPs.  The only way for regional ISPs to maintain their numbers would have been to extend their networks into areas that were not being served and acquire new customers.  It shows quite a level of ingenuity on the part of regional ISPs that they are continuously adding customers to their businesses in terms of serving areas that are not served.</p></speech>

I have a great deal of sympathy for the approach being proposed for a number of reasons.  One is that I have worked in my constituency with a number of providers for a number of years.  The NBP has been around for as long as I have been in active politics.  It has not been delivered but certainly has been doing the rounds.  I have worked with many different ISPs and have seen many different approaches and what has worked with communities where, perhaps, more technically proficient members of a community group used various <i>ad hoc</i>approaches and tried to improvise with varying degrees of success.  I know from experience that there can be multiple ways to achieve broadband penetration into rural areas.  It is not just fibre.  There are many different technologies that work reasonably well.</p><p>One of the bugbears I had with the NBP was that these were not tried in further and greater measure.  It is something I have said many times in this committee and in the D&aacute;il.  I have published legislation on it.  The former Minister, Deputy Naughten, largely agreed with my legislation.  In drafting a Bill and in various different testimonies such as this, I have said that it appears we are trying to do this the wrong way around.  We are subsidising the winner of the tender to go into all the intervention areas.  We are paying it a great deal of money to provide Internet to areas that cannot get it.  Rather than stating that we will accept this as a given and we will give somebody a subsidy to do it, we should be asking why it is not happening already, why there is a market failure, understand the reasons for the market failure and tackle those reasons and the planning, regulatory and sharing of site anomalies.  All sorts of things have been inventoried in the various task lists of different committees over the last number of years and I tried to tackle some of them in my legislation.  Rather than saying we will fix all those issues, gripes and glitches and then see if the intervention area gets smaller, which it invariably would, we have taken an approach of saying there is a big black hole in an area so we will give loads of money to somebody to go and fill it.</p><p>As I said, I have a great deal of sympathy with the proposal.  I agree with many of the points made.  I am not convinced that we are achieving economies of scale with the current approach.  By giving one tenderer a pay cheque to do it, we are not allowing for improvements in technology.  There is no incentive to improve the process.  There is no incentive to deal with a glitch between two different local area plans side by side in two different counties which have the same border.  They are competing area plans.  There is no incentive to choose the site sharing possibility.  Instead of there being a common mast that is reused by many providers everyone puts up their own.  There is no incentive to ducting along the side of a motorway.  I understand it is cheaper to dig up the road and put in new ducting rather than reuse what is already there because of the rates the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform charges for access to ducting on the motorways.  With all these crazy catches, there is no incentive to tackle them because we are going to give somebody loads of money to do it regardless.  I have many issues with the proposed approach.</p><p>I have sympathy for what our guests are saying.  They seem to be indicating, if I am reading their proposals correctly, more or less what I have just stated, namely, that there is a different way we can do it.  One of the ways they are proposing contains a compromise of sorts.  They are saying they will not give fibre to every home but that they will provide a variety of technologies, primarily broadband radio according to the submission.  Perhaps there are other technologies as well.  Perhaps there is a degree of fibre with the last mile being radio and perhaps a little 5G in the mix as well.  The witnesses are indicating there is not, so it is primarily broadband radio, fixed wireless.  They are saying they will do that and have a minimum standard of 150 Mbps.  That will be delivered in two years at a cost &euro;402 million.  That is extraordinarily good value for money and an extraordinarily attractive proposition.</p><p>I am coming at it with an extremely sympathetic perspective.  It bears out my direct experience as a councillor and then a Deputy working with companies in my area and working with local authorities and so forth.  However, if something is too good to be true, it usually is.  I would love to think this is the way forward, and there are many reasons that it might be, but if it was so obvious how come it is not happening?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Marcus Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#L00900"><p>That is probably how I ended up becoming involved in this.  I just could not believe it when the connection was installed.  It was James O'Sullivan's company that did it.  I was on ADSL for years and it was dreadful.  He asked me how much speed I would like and I asked if I could get the Internet.  I wanted it to work and not drop every two minutes and I asked if I could get 1 Mbps.  He asked if I wanted 50.  I was thinking that it would not work and that it would take weeks to be done, but he came up one afternoon and it was installed in two hours.  I have never had to telephone the company about an issue of a technical nature.  I carry out web conferences with the high definition video link with up to 40 participants and all the bells and whistles.  There can be rain, hail, snow and fog in which one cannot even see the gate, but it does not make a difference.</p><p>When I heard about the NBP, I thought it did not make sense.  Before long, I was involved in putting my public policy experience and various other skill sets to good use.  Our submission provides case studies and figures, particularly in respect of Scotland, which tried the 100% fibre approach and got very good value for money at a cost of &euro;442 million.  It now has a top-up which will catch the final 5%.  On things being too good to be true, other jurisdictions are bringing it in at this kind of efficiency and with these economies of scale.</p><p> On why the proposal was not raised previously, there were numerous consultation engagements on the part of the industry through the years.  There are plenty of people who will attest to this and provide evidence and documentation in that regard.  Two previous representative bodies also collectively engaged.  One could say that it is appearing to the committee at a late stage.  I would put that down to a lack of communication, possibly between the Oireachtas and the Department or on the part of the industry.  The people in the industry are working very hard to serve their customers and they should not have to shout this loud to get heard.  From my perspective in terms of public policy engagement, it is remarkable and worrying that this alternative was not examined as part of the cost-benefit analysis.</p><p> The criteria for a cost-benefit analysis and the public spending code require that one looks at one's project and an alternative and prepares a counter-factual that extrapolates what will happen if one does nothing in terms of how broadband access provision would progress.  The NBP process did not really look at an alternative.  The counter-factual had substantial issues in terms of 300,000 properties having to be removed.  Two eminent economists stated that it does not live up to the stress tests.  We are where we are.  There is a tender process running.  We do tenders for a reason, namely, to try to tease out problems and prevent bad decisions being made in the allocation of precious public funds.  The process worked in one respect as a very credible proposal has come forward in time to be examined and for the current process to be halted for two or three months during which we can run a national mapping exercise.  I am sure all of the regional ISPs would be very happy to provide their mapping data.  We were looking at software last week that would probably allow us to do that mapping exercise and instantaneously figure out how many homes are covered for next generation access speeds and how many would need some type of assistance.</p><p> On whether it is too good to be true, I am of the opinion that we should put it to the test and stress test it before we make this decision and go forward with the biggest contract in our history.  If we can achieve the same result in a shorter timescale for significantly less money, the Government has a fiduciary duty to examine that in great detail and robustly determine what is the best course of action.</p></speech>

Does the Deputy have another brief question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-16a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019071600002#M00300"><p>I have a quick follow-up question.  I thank Mr. Matthews for his response which makes a lot of sense.  On putting it to the test, to what extent has RISPA or the providers it represents managed to penetrate into some of the areas in question?  Has there been success in that regard?  To an extent, an experiment has been running in recent years.  If members of RISPA have managed to provide broadband in certain areas in a viable way which is worthwhile for the company, that is a success story in itself.  If that has been done, are there things such as the glitches which I mentioned which could quickly be dealt with to enable the company to provide broadband in that way, which would turn the conversation around?</p></speech>

We have outlined some of what would be required.  We addressed the costs, including wholesale access.  Backhaul is a major problem.  The Deputy made the point that in many cases it is cheaper to dig the road than to buy it.  That is a core issue that would have to be corrected.  The subject matter experts who are present could tell the committee a significant amount about that, how it works and how it does not work compared with other countries.  It is clear that we need to look at a regulator pricing model and, for backhaul providers that are directly or indirectly owned by the State, we need to consider implementing a ratcheting mechanism to drive those costs over time.  We could tie that with an investment into the companies such that shareholders are not losing out and we avoid those types of problems while getting a good quality series of fibre extensions and a good scenario whereby regional ISPs can instantaneously start delivering more connectivity.  That is a core issue to be addressed behind the scenes in this context.</p> <p>  There are other issues such as communications timelines in terms of different State entities.  We would probably need to establish a communications management strategy, which is not dealt with in our written submission, and would address issues such as a fault or radio interference from another company.  It is for ComReg to enforce the law and state that one cannot put something up in a particular place and start interfering with pre-existing equipment and other businesses.  These types of things can take a very long time and that is a frustration for regional ISPs in the industry because their customers will question why their service has suddenly slowed down.  It doe no good for the businesses to say that they can do nothing about it because they are responsible for enforcing the law.  There are many issues behind the scenes that need to be fixed, but we could be here all day talking about them.</p></speech>
