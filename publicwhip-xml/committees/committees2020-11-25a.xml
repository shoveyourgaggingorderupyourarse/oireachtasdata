Today we begin the first of our two-day engagement with officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is a significant amount of material to cover, which is why we have split the work over two days. The matters for examination today are, from the 2019 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts, Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Local Government Fund, and chapter 2, central government funding of local authorities.  To assist us in our examination of the matters before us today and with regard to the public health guidelines, we are joined by Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department, Ms Mary Hurley, assistant general secretary, and Ms Marguerite Ryan, finance officer.  We are also joined remotely by Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning division, Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh, assistant secretary, water division, Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue, principal officer, local government finance, and Ms Clare Costello from the Housing, Local Government and Heritage Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome to the meeting.  I thank them and the staff in their Departments for the briefing material that they have prepared for the committee today.</p> <p>  The witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations that they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation for anything that they say at the meeting.  Witnesses are expected, however, not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  If statements by witnesses are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that witnesses comply with such directions.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and frankly witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also ask that the members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure that they can be heard and that when members are leaving that they take their seats in the sanitised area.</p></speech>

The 2019 Appropriation Account for Vote 34 Housing, Planning and Local Government records gross expenditure of &euro;3.96 billion. The appropriation account is presented under five programme headings.  Some &euro;2.37 billion, or almost 60% of the total, was spent on a wide range of schemes that together constitute the housing programme.  A further &euro;1.29 billion, or just under one third of the total, was spent on the water services programme, and comprises mainly payments to Irish Water.  Just under &euro;211 million was spent on the local government programme.  Some &euro;68 million was spent on the planning programme.  And just under &euro;28 million was spent on Met &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>  The surplus at the year-end was &euro;40.1 million.  Of this, &euro;33.5 million related to unspent capital allocations associated with the planning programme which were carried forward to 2020.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the account.  However, I drew attention to the disclosures in the statement on internal financial control as to some non-compliant procurement by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage during the year.</p> <p>  The Local Government Fund is managed separately from the Vote, by the Department.  There have been a number of changes in the source of funding for the fund in recent years. It is now funded by the proceeds of the local property tax, or LPT, and a transfer from the Vote.  In 2019, LPT receipts into the fund amounted to &euro;473 million.  This was down marginally from the level of receipts in 2018.  The transfer to the fund from the Vote in 2019 amounted to &euro;185 million.  This was up by &euro;60 million, or 48%, year on year.  Total receipts were &euro;658 million.  The fund expenditure in 2019 amounted to &euro;644 million.  The bulk of this was accounted for by transfers to local authorities.  At the end of December 2019, the fund&rsquo;s reserves stood at just under &euro;99 million.  Again, I issued a clear audit opinion also as to the fund account.</p> <p>  Because of the complex ways that central Government funds flow to individual local authorities, chapter 2 is compiled each year to present an overview of the level and purpose of the funding provided.  The chapter also outlines the oversight of local authorities&rsquo; financial performance by the Department, the Local Government Audit Service and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.</p> <p>  In 2019, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities amounted to a total of &euro;4.17 billion &ndash; an increase of 13% from 2018 funding.  More than 90% of the central Government funding for local authorities came from three sources: Vote 34; the Local Government Fund; and Vote 31 for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Of the total of &euro;4.17 billion central Government funding, almost &euro;2.4 billion was provided to local authorities for housing and regeneration.  A further &euro;882 million was provided for transport investment.</p> <p>  I will introduce the chapters which are the focus of tomorrow's meeting in advance of that meeting tomorrow.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

Together, we will work in discussing the expenditure and activity of the Department in 2019 with the committee.</p> <p>  Despite not being present in the Department for the period under examination, I have very carefully examined all of the areas of activity and expenditure.  I recognise that the Department had a very substantial work programme in 2019 and delivered on a range of key policies and programmes.  I will not go through every area of expenditure but will touch on the key areas briefly.</p> <p>  As requested by the committee, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting and also a copy of this opening statement.</p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2019, as set out in the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;3.9 billion.  I will start by welcoming the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and, in particular, on the four chapters which will be examined over the course of this evening and tomorrow.  I recognise and appreciate the value of this work in the context of enhancing the outward demonstration not only to this committee but to the public in general of the important work that is done in my Department and the value we put on transparency and accountability.  As with previous recommendations, we will continue to evolve and mature our systems and reporting to align with best practice wherever possible.</p> <p>  The focus of the Department&rsquo;s 2019 activity in the area of housing was led by the actions set out in the six year Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The year, 2019, represented the fourth full year of activity under the plan and a milestone year in terms of social housing delivery.  The Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the appropriation account, totalled some &euro;2.365 billion in 2019.  A further &euro;92.6 million was available from local property tax receipts to fund housing programmes of certain local authorities whose LPT allocation exceeded their funding baseline, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to almost &euro;2.5 billion in 2019.</p> <p>  Social housing delivery represents a large proportion of expenditure under the housing programme.  Delivery is achieved through the main headings of build, acquisition, leasing, housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  Within these headings there are multiple sub-delivery vehicles, all working in parallel to achieve the optimum outcome for Exchequer investment.</p> <p>  To understand why the Department relies on both capital and current structures for social housing delivery, it is important to refresh our minds on the context of the Rebuilding Ireland social housing targets.  These were developed in response to the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness in 2016.  That committee indicated that the local authority and approved housing bodies stock available for social housing should be increased by some 50,000 homes, but also recognised that the ability of the State to meet the cost of responding to the need for social housing was hampered by the application of domestic and EU fiscal rules.  In addition to this, the need for immediate, mid-term and long-term delivery had to be taken into account and the range of programmes that are now in place seek to harness the maximum delivery possible by deploying the maximum current and capital funding available.</p> <p>  Appendix 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper, sets out the key targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that had been made to the end of 2019.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to over 28,000 households in 2019, just ahead of the target.  Cumulatively, since 2016 more than 100,000 additional households had received a social housing support, and social housing waiting lists dropped by 25%.</p> <p>  Build activity increased year on year, with new build activity - excluding returning vacant local authority dwellings to active use under the voids programme - growing almost ten-fold between 2015 and 2019.</p> <p>  The quarterly Social Housing Construction Status Report showed an increase from 8,430 homes in the programme overall at various stages of development at end 2016 to some 26,015 homes at end 2019.  Local authority-led new-build activity also grew significantly over the period.  The number of local authority-led projects increased from 290 schemes representing 4,820 homes at end 2016 to almost 700 schemes representing almost 11,000 homes by the end of 2019, and this continues to grow.  This excludes local authority turnkey schemes, which accounted for 3,860 homes in the programme at end 2019.</p> <p>  Wider housing supply also continued to grow in 2019 with the number of new homes becoming available for use in the full year reaching 24,394, a 14% increase on 2018.</p><p>While what I have set out reflects some of the positive indicators and increasing provision of social housing, we are keenly aware of the substantial work that remains to be done.  The number of homeless households supported into more sustainable housing increased by 16% last year, however the challenge remains in making substantial and sustainable inroads into reducing the net numbers reliant on emergency accommodation and services, and we continue to absolutely prioritise working with housing authorities and NGOs.  Prevention is just as critical as developing pathways for exits.</p><p> Across all areas we will be unrelenting in our commitment to achieve the best outcome for citizens using the resources provided to us by the Exchequer.  The new programme for Government seeks to place even more demanding ambition on delivery to be achieved in the years ahead and rising to meet this ambition will be the cornerstone of social housing activity for my Department.</p><p> The 2020 provision for housing amounts to nearly &euro;2.7 billion, including local property tax receipts, the majority of which will be concentrated on supporting over 27,500 additional households across all our social housing delivery streams and those already in a support.  Like many sectors, the impact of Covid-19 has been very challenging for the Department and its stakeholders, however we continue to push for maximum feasible delivery across all streams.  As we move into 2021, a provision of over &euro;3.3 billion will be available for the housing programme.  This represents the largest ever investment in housing and will support implementation of the ambitions in the programme for Government with a particular focus on increasing supply through new build activity. </p><p> I will now turn to water services. The past decade has seen a significant period of reform in the approach to the delivery of water services and the promotion of wider environmental protection.  As the committee is aware, responsibility for the provision of public water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  Irish Water is now firmly established as the national public water utility and has brought a new coherent approach to the delivery of water services investment and management.</p><p> While the Government&rsquo;s voted Exchequer investment in Irish Water is substantial, with &euro;1.2 billion in the accounts before the committee today for 2019, and &euro;1.3 billion for 2020 and 2021, there remain significant infrastructure deficits to be dealt with and it is critical that we maintain a high level of investment in the sector in order to achieve compliance but also to support national housing and regional development objectives.  In terms of our rural water programme, in 2019 some &euro;41.1 million was provided across both capital and current funding structures.  Certainty for priority investment has been put in place through a multi-annual capital programme, aimed at improving the reliability and efficiency of rural water services infrastructure. </p><p> On local government, members will be aware that the Local Government Fund, LGF, is a special central fund established in 1999 under the Local Government Act 1998.  The profile of income and expenditure of the Local Government Fund has undergone significant changes in recent years.  Income, which historically comprised motor tax income along with some payments from the Exchequer, is now comprised of income from the Exchequer and, since 2014, local property tax.  The Government decides the expenditure from the Local Government Fund each year as part of the budgetary process.  As the chapter shows, transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities in 2019 totalled some &euro;4.17 billion, an increase of 13% on 2018.  The Local Government Fund accounted for 15% of this amount.  A number of Departments, including my own Department and the Department of Transport, as well as other agencies, are involved in providing this annual funding to local authorities.  The Local Government Fund account for 2019 gives details of the operation of the fund during the year.  The income sources to the fund totalled &euro;658 million, made up of local property tax receipts of &euro;473 million and a payment of &euro;185 million from the Exchequer, through the Department&rsquo;s vote.</p><p> The main payments from the LGF in 2019 were: local property tax allocations to local authorities of &euro;503 million; an allocation in respect of local authority pay and pensions costs of &euro;86 million; an allocation of &euro;47 million in respect of compensation in respect of rates previously paid on water infrastructure; and an allocation of just under &euro;1 million to support the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme at local level.</p><p> With regard to chapter 2, which has been prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department welcomes the work undertaken to provide such a comprehensive overview of the structures and the funding flow, and the complexity of same.  The chapter also sets out the scale and levels of scrutiny and accountability that have been put in place to ensure appropriate levels of oversight, including through the Local Government Audit Service and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.</p><p> As for other programme areas, further areas of expenditure set out in the 2019 appropriation account include, in the planning area, meeting the costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la of &euro;18.5 million, as well as Met &Eacute;ireann costs of &euro;28 million.  Since the establishment of the new Government this year, my Department has also taken on responsibility for the heritage division and while not covered in today&rsquo;s examination, I look forward to updating members in due course on the wide range of activities supported by expenditure in that area. </p><p> Before I conclude, I will make some short remarks regarding my Department&rsquo;s activity in 2020.  While not the subject of today&rsquo;s meeting, and I look forward to meeting members in due course to discuss expenditure, it has been an exceptionally challenging year for all sectors.  I am immensely proud of the responsive and proactive manner in which the Civil Service has acted in response to this pandemic and for the collegiate and practical collaboration with political colleagues during a never-before-seen set of circumstances, starting with the election in February.  I came to this Department a very short time ago, in the midst of the pandemic, and saw at first hand the scale of activity and responsiveness.  The Department, its agencies and our partners for delivery, including the NGO and approved housing body sectors, have given of themselves tirelessly to achieve the best for those we serve and I formally acknowledge that here today.  In particular our local authorities, with whom members will all have played their own part, have demonstrated the true value of public service through the Community Call and other critical supports deployed at local level.  At all times, the Department has continued to advocate for local government at a national level and will continue to do so, in recognition of the absolutely critical nature of the local authorities.</p><p> The matters I have referred to illustrate well the broad range of programmes and activities for which the Department had responsibility in 2019.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work today.</p></speech>

I thank them for taking the time to be with us today.  Everyone is grateful for their extraordinary work over the past months in supporting our local authorities to deploy vital services, as Mr. Doyle said in his opening remarks.  They came to the fore with the Community Call during the height of the pandemic and we are very grateful for the Department's support in those instances.</p> <p>  As time is limited, I will start with a focus on housing and the 2019 accounts before us today.  Will Mr. Doyle tell me exactly how many houses were delivered in 2019 by the local authorities and the approved housing body for social housing purposes?  How much was spent in build, acquisition and leasing? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020112500002#C00400"><p>Yes, certainly.  I thank the Deputy for his comments also.</p> <p>  In 2019 just over 10,000 social homes were delivered through build, acquisition and leasing schemes.  That was pretty much exactly in line with the target of 10,000 for that year.  Of these, 6,074 were homes built through the different programmes implemented by local authorities and the approved housing bodies.  That was an increase of about 20% on the build activity of the previous year.  Including the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, activity that is just over 28,000 social homes provided for families and individuals in 2019, against a target of almost 27,400.  That was 3% over target.  This was on the back of a record level of public investment of &euro;2.4 billion in 2019 to support the delivery of housing programmes.  Almost &euro;1.5 billion was on build, acquisition and lease, which breaks down as &euro;836 million for build, &euro;496 million for acquisition and &euro;150 million for lease.  The 6,074 built social housing units that are referred to break down as 2,271 local authority new build units; 2,174 approved housing body new build units; and 1,326 Part V units.  We limit how we report voids but adding some 300 units on voids brings us to the 6,074 units built.</p></speech>

The Secretary General, in his earlier statement, outlined that the majority of housing will be concentrated on supporting over 27,500 additional households across all our social housing delivery streams.  Does that include new builds, acquisitions and leasing?</p></speech>

We are increasing the level of direct build and that will continue forward into next year.  For example, next year we are looking at a direct build programme of 9,500.  We are seeking to increase that and to change the mix in terms of delivery across the programme, which is challenging.  There is no question but that as we ramp that up, we are going to have to play a very careful role around local authority delivery and through the other streams as well.</p> <p>  In terms of the concerns about construction activity in this year that have been mentioned, there is no denying that time was lost around that.  We work closely with the local authorities.  I think the housing delivery co-ordination office is playing a really strong role at this point in time in working with each local authority and the other stakeholders to try to maximise delivery this year and into next year.  Just trying to minimise the impact of that delay, and looking at the construction status report for quarter 2, it showed us that delivery was below target, obviously, at that stage.  There were almost 1,500 built, acquired or leased homes at that point of the year.  They cycle of delivery, which has surprised me in terms of coming to the Department and I would have really expected delivery across a year, but it does actually get back-ended, just the cycle tends to get back-ended, into the latter part of the year.  That profile for completion in quarter 4, heavily weighted towards quarter 4, is there.  We are hopeful that we will get much of what we sought to deliver this year and the numbers are relatively encouraging.  We will not quite make where we had hoped to be.</p></speech>

We have seen various numbers put forward by various groupings.  As we discuss this with the local authorities and try to crunch the numbers for the end of the year, we are hoping to see delivery in the 70% or 80% range and, if we are lucky, it might push a little bit above that.</p></speech>

Over the course of the past four years, 1,132 schemes have been completed, so in respect of the projects one would see listed in the appropriation account, there is a range of projects and they move through the various stage of the pipeline.  Things can fall over various years.  One of the interesting things that the Deputy has raised is about the build.  If one looks at the expenditure on build over the last number of years, in 2016, when we started to develop the pipeline, the spend on build was in the order of &euro;170 million and, in 2019, we spent &euro;835 million on build.  That shows the growth of the pipeline.</p> <p>  One of the things, in terms of delivery also, has been the blend of delivery.  One of the things that we have tried to do, in terms of delivery and it is reflected in the expenditure, is to maximise the amount of homes that we actually deliver through the various different schemes whether it be build, acquisition or leasing.  The Deputy will see very clearly in the trajectory the build peaks are really growing and we are seeing significant numbers of homes in the pipeline.  At the end of quarter 2 of 2020, more than 29,810 homes were moving through various stages of the pipeline either completed, moving on site or in the pre-development stage.  So, very clearly, we are seeing the spend on build increasing as we move through the years.</p></speech>

The repair, retrofitting and leasing scheme has provided a useful mechanism to address vacant buildings and revitalise some towns.  The expenditure in the accounts for last year was &euro;47 million.  I ask the witnesses to provide an update on how many homes were delivered and their location.  What is the average cost to retrofit a house?</p></speech>

There is the buy and renew scheme, and the repair and leasing scheme.  The cumulative delivery under the buy and renew scheme, which started out very slowly in 2016 and which I think local authorities tend to prefer, has over the past four years reached over 570 on that side.  On the repair and leasing scheme, it has been a little bit slower with 165 under that scheme.  There has been a lot of activity in various local authorities.  You can see that some of them brace these schemes more than others.</p></speech>

There was certainly an expectation that there would be a much greater uptake on that.  I think what was probably discovered, as the local authorities went through the process of looking at these, was that time had moved on a little bit.  I think some of these properties had begun to be used in different ways.  I think there was probably less properties out there.  There were plenty of properties out there that were in states of repair that would work for this scheme but maybe not in locations or maybe not fully suitable to social housing.  We are very anxious to address and attack the vacancy issue.  So we are still persisting with these schemes and trying to promote them again, working closely with the local authorities.  Some have had a lot more success than others around this for a variety of reasons.  Louth has been very good.  Cork has been very good.  Waterford has been very good.</p></speech>

I know it is an impossible task.  It is probably not surprising that in considering Vote 34 I was drawn to the money spent on the O'Devaney Gardens development in 2018 and 2019.  The figures were &euro;1.7 million for 2018 and &euro;3.79 million for 2019.

It has a different approach to housing and seeks to build more public housing on public land.  In November 2019, the council voted to approve the HLI deal and made a parallel agreement with Bartra Capital Property to purchase 30% of the stock for cost-rental accommodation.  I know the new Government is committed to a cost-rental approach.  At this early stage, is the Department supportive of the programme which the council seems to be progressing?

A full year passed between the decision on O'Devaney Gardens in November 2019 and the vote on the Oscar Traynor Road site in November 2020.  It was known that the proposal for O'Devaney Gardens was barely voted through by the council.  Was the Department concerned that the time and effort it had put into the Oscar Traynor Road scheme would result in the failure we saw?  It is very disappointing all around, but why did both sides not manage in a full year to arrive at a proposal that was at least as good as O'Devaney Gardens?  In the event, we got a proposal that was worse than O'Devaney Gardens.  How was that project managed during that year?  Did the absence of an affordable housing scheme, which was a key element in the uncertainty around this, and the continuing absence of an affordable rental scheme play a major part?  I accept that there was no Government for a large part of that year.  What did the Department do in the intervening period to prevent the failure which we ultimately saw?</p></speech>

Dublin City Council drew on a lot of the Department's existing schemes to construct that arrangement.  From what I could tell, one of the biggest issues was the mix of means of delivery.  The council takes a particular view, as it is absolutely entitled to.  The Deputy has asked if we are disappointed.  The scheme involved about 850 units, and our drive is to house people.  We will have to learn lessons from this.</p></speech>

The main reason for the failure of this project was uncertainty around the prospect of 50% private ownership.  These units could easily become private rental housing through the housing assistance payment, HAP, or a real estate Investment trust, REIT.  Providing models of funding which allow certainty around the outcome will be the secret to securing more agreement from local authorities and will enable the Department to deliver these houses.  I do not believe it is an unreasonable left-wing approach.  Most of the reservations arise from uncertainty around what we will get from these deals and the lack of transparency with which infrastructure and unit costs are conflated.  If the Department focuses on those points it will help to ensure further spending on further projects like O'Devaney Gardens.</p></speech>

I will try to keep my comments focused and I would appreciate short replies as five minutes is a very short time.  I would like to concentrate on local government funding.  In his opening comments, the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the complex ways in which central government funds flow to individual local authorities.  That is a great understatement and a very balanced comment.  It is acknowledged in the chapter that the local property tax was a replacement of the motor tax fund.  Revenue is collected by the Revenue Commissioners and it is up to the Department to distribute it.  I will concentrate on the key issue of baselines.  I do this every time the Department appears before the committee.  There was to be an interdepartmental review of local property tax, with baselines to be specifically examined.  Where is that review?</p></speech>

That was carried out in parallel with the Department of Finance-led review of local property tax.</p><p>The group that carried out the baseline review - I was the Cathaoirleach - submitted their proposals to the Minister when the work was essentially finished.  Those proposals have not yet been signed off but they have been resubmitted recently to the current political team in the Department.  We await further news on local property tax changes before that baseline change can be decided upon and put in place, assuming that it would be acceptable to the Minister.  As I said a moment ago, it is under review.</p><p> A number of options were looked at.  The principle that underpinned the baseline review initially was that in the event of local property tax changes and additional properties coming into the LPT net, additional funding would be available for the local government system.  It was about considering the best allocation of those additional funds.  There were commitments in the programme for Government about moving to 100% equalisation.  We will have to review that in parallel and consider how to implement all of those things at the same time.</p></speech>

In fact, if we consider the gross expenditure and carry out a comparison between all local authorities, the counties with growing populations are always at the bottom of the list in terms of the amount of spend per head.  There is a direct impact on the baselines.  Essentially, the primary work done on the baselines was done under the needs and resources model in 1999 and 2000.  We are still using the 1996 census of population.  No increase in population has been counted in terms of the needs of certain local authorities.  Is that the kind of thing we can expect to see the reports addressing?</p></speech>

I would not like to anticipate any decision that the Minister might make but suffice it to say that several of those issues were actively considered as part of the baseline review.  These included issues such as population change, current population, geographic features, size of the country, etc.  A range of issues were looked at and will be looked at again.  One of the key issues that underpinned some of our thinking on the review group was that the data available and used to review baselines would be fully transparent and publicly available.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy referred to the baselines.  The needs-and-resources model was developed around 2000 and ran until 2008.  It involved 600 layers of data being analysed every year.  It was quite an inefficient process in terms of allocating local government funding.  However, the current baselines in operation were essentially set at 2014 levels.  No additional general-purpose funding through local property tax has been brought into that system since then, although they were adjusted marginally in 2017.  It is fair to say that some of the issues Deputy Murphy has raised are relevant.  Individual local authorities have changed somewhat.  All of that has been factored into the proposals that are with the Minister at the moment.</p></speech>

I wish Mr. Doyle the best in his new role.  I am sure he will have no problem getting across the brief, having come from the mixed brief he had.  It is even more mixed since he left it.  I welcome Ms Hurley and Ms Ryan as well.  The Chairman can stop me if he feels he needs to, because I will be somewhat current.  During the Covid-19 period have any rules applied to the Department or any agencies under its remit that permit paying staff full salary for working part-time?</p></speech>

It issued from the human resources side of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The guidance has evolved over the course of the initial lockdown period and up to now.  Much of it is based on safety of staff and providing a service to the public.  It is based on the public service trying to show leadership around working from home, where that is possible.  Where work necessarily has to be carried out on-site, the idea is to try to do that in a safe way.</p> <p>  I am unsure whether there is a specific line on the point raised but all this lends itself to organisations doing what they can to try to comply with the overall guidance being given by Government.  The idea is to try to bring about a safe working environment and show some leadership in the context of what all organisations across the State are trying to do at the moment.</p></speech>

What about the issue of people being paid a full salary for less work, should a person be unable to work remotely?  For example, what if the person is outside a broadband area or is simply unable to attend work in a safe space?  What I am trying to get at is whether things have evolved to the extent that we are paying a full salary where, for example, people are working part-time.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have to look after people so there are financial supports through the pandemic unemployment payment and so on.  Will Mr. Doyle check this?  I do not expect him to know the answer today.</p><p>I believe the Property Registration Authority is under the remit of the Department.  In answers to me from the authority and from another source providing me with information I have learned there are approximately 202 working hard remotely.  That is working well.  The remaining 345 are split into team A and team B.  The alternate teams work two days one week and three days the following week and <i>vice versa</i>, but all are paid full salary.</p><p>I am aware of the directions from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I understand the sort of evolution to try to help people on the one hand and keep the whole operation afloat on the other.  I gather in this case it has not evolved to the extent that it is an official line.  I appreciate that Mr. Doyle may not have the answer today because it is not the subject matter of today's meeting, but I wanted to use our time efficiently.  Since Mr. Doyle is here I said we would take advantage of it.  Can Mr. Doyle come back to us to confirm whether people are getting full salary for part-time work as a result of Covid-19?  It is not the fault of the workers.  It is our fault as a State if we are presiding over such a situation.  I do not believe it is right, if that is the case.  I will park that point with Mr. Doyle.</p><p>I have one final question on the vacant site levy.  I know this is an issue for the Department of Finance in the main.  Again, with Covid-19 this year there are issues where someone may have bought a site and closed the sale in November 2019.  The person may have proceeded through the planning and so on this year.  He may not be there yet, as is often the case for a larger-scale development.  However, from 1 January 2021 the person will be levied.  In many instances, the cost would be tens of thousands of euro.  Is there any scope or can there be any scope with this?  I know local authorities do not have discretion on this.  Is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in discussion with the Department of Finance on any sort of accommodation for people who have been affected by lockdown in terms of the progress they would normally have made?</p></speech>

If not, we will come back to Deputy MacSharry with an answer.  That is no problem.</p></speech>

The reason for that, they say, is the nightmare of bureaucracy.  If they go to start a small project, it takes 18 months before they start to build the house, even in the midst of a housing crisis.  Many local authorities have made reference to the fact the tendering process and the procurement process could run in parallel and that would shorten the time for the physical delivery of houses.  Why has the Department not looked at that, given the pressure it is under to deliver homes in a crisis?</p></speech>

It would certainly help and it is quite astonishing it has not been done.</p> <p>  The other aspect I wanted to touch on was the housing maintenance budgets.  Local authority income from rental is less than half of the response maintenance, and that is not taking into account the structural maintenance.  I will give the example of the local authority in County Louth, where there have been more than 4,000 maintenance requests for this year to date, with more than 425 coming in during October.  There are properties where windows have to be nailed shut, and doors one could put a finger through.  Local authority management have said they are starved of funding.  That is just one local authority but there is clearly an issue that local authorities are starved of funding.  I imagine that if the Residential Tenancies Board was to go in and inspect local authority properties, they would not pass any inspection and they would be considered substandard in many cases, to say the least.</p> <p>  It is an area that has been flagged up by local authorities but it seems to fall on deaf ears.  Are there plans to increase the funding?  In addition, AHBs get more funding than local authorities for maintenance of their housing stock.  Why is that?</p></speech>

There has been a lot of work over the years, when a house becomes vacant or becomes a void, to bring the property up to a new pre-letting standard.  What we are actively looking to do at the moment is transition from focusing on voids to the extent that was probably done in the past to a planned maintenance model.  That particular change is being worked through at the moment.  It is a valid point, which is why we are pursuing that.</p></speech>

My question is in regard to HAP and RAS.  What are the performance targets in regard to how much we are spending on those?  Is there a significant difference in how long people have been on them when they get their house?  How are targets being set in that regard?  It is very hard to discern how the Department is even setting targets because everything seems to be bunched together.  Is there a more streamlined way we could look at this?</p></speech>

As we deliver more and more social housing, we would like to see the numbers on HAP reduce over a period of time.</p></speech>

Should we continue with it?  The figures, between the accommodation for homelessness and HAP, are significantly increasing whereas the housing stock seems to be going the other way.  I am asking about the targets.</p></speech>

The way the Department has looked at this previously is how much build can conceivably be delivered reasonably in terms of ramping up over a period of time and meeting the projected housing need through the various blends.  If we can get the build output, which the State has ramped up the over recent years and is certainly going to continue to do that, we will start to reduce the reliance on that.  It is about setting targets based on cutting your cloth around the mix that can be delivered because, ultimately, we have got to put roofs over people's heads.</p></speech>

I see a significant issue in this regard with planning applications, for example, where developers apply for planning on the basis of dwellings per hectare and the next thing An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturns that and insists on 35 dwellings per hectare, and the development does not go ahead.  The scheme is falling down because we will continue with the HAP tenancies.  The houses are required.  How is the Department meeting targets?  In one county, there are 13 planning permissions granted but, because of the dwellings per hectare stipulations, they are not going ahead.  Out of 13, there are two, which means that we are not solving the housing issue.</p></speech>

Five thousand were determined to be the appropriate number of additional stock through build, acquisition and leasing and the remaining 87,000 through HAP and RAS.  Over the past number of years, there have been a high number of HAP set-ups.  The Deputy is correct in that regard.  However, it is worth noting that almost 6,000 people up to the end of quarter 2 this year had exited from HAP into a long-term social home.</p></speech>

Of that 22,000, the number who have got their long-term social home is 6,000.</p> <p>  There is a really good report, published last week by the Central Statistics Office, that analyses data probably more than we could because it compares it to those of Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.

I want to return to a point that had been raised by Deputy Munster with regard to the single-stage approval process.  With much fanfare, the limit was increased from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million.  It has been indicated that there is only one project, which is in the early stages of that process.  How many houses is that project expected to deliver?</p></speech>

One of the things we have been trying to do in relation to that increased limit is to work with local authorities to bring forward applications, and there is a number of applications coming through the system.</p> <p>  In terms of the one-stage process, we know that there are 35 projects on site involving schemes that are under the &euro;2 million ceiling.  We know there are 20 applications in respect of &euro;2 million.</p></speech>

Where the ceiling was &euro;2 million, that has been raised to &euro;6 million.  What we have been doing in the Department is working with local authorities to bring forward applications.  This new cap has only been introduced.</p> <p>  Side-by-side with that, it is probably worth noting, just in terms of the approval process and in terms of speeding projects up, that in tandem to those approval processes we have put in place frameworks.  A volumetric framework has been put in place to support the deliver of the volumetric housing on a regional basis.  Each region will have one of them.  We have put in place internal layouts that will help local authorities design their house.  We have put in place a really useful document, an employer's requirement, which essentially sets out the quality around fixtures and fittings.  In terms of approvals, the approvals are one piece but the other pieces are the supports that we provide to local authorities in trying to speed up matters</p> <p>  Deputy Munster spoke about the red tape.  We are conscious in the Department to cut any red tape.  That is why, in terms of the four-stage process, which is still there for projects over &euro;6 million, we run a lot of those processes in tandem so that it is possible to come in with a joint stage 1 and stage 2.  We are all committed to accelerating delivery.</p></speech>

The output is getting worse as we are going on.</p> <p>  We are talking about all of these projects and about streamlining.

Usually, in these cases, the local authority would quickly purchase the house.  It was good value and a house built by the council.  The Department refused to allow the council to buy it, however.  It was bought for &euro;42,000.</p> <p>  Since then, the owner of that house has been subsidised through rent supplement and HAP.  The State has paid in value multiples of what it would have cost to build that house on day one.  That was as a direct result of an ideological driven position that has been adopted by the Department.  Has ideology been put aside?  Are we ready to go back to basics, namely local authorities building and purchasing homes which in turn will alleviate the pressures on rents and return them to a reasonable level?  Are we at that point that we can address the fundamental core problem that lies at the heart of the reason we are in the middle of a housing crisis today?</p></speech>

I raised this issue when I was a councillor.  The house is built by the local authority with taxpayer money.  A tenant lives in it for 30 to 40 years and then buys it out under a tenant purchase scheme.  The house might subsequently be bought by an individual who turned out to be a small-time - in some cases, big-time - landlord.  The tenant renting the house would get rent supplement or HAP.  The taxpayer was effectively subsiding the rent for a house which the taxpayer built.  There is a 20-year rule which can be applied.  The county council of which I was a member did not apply it.  It is an issue which needs to be nailed down.</p> <p>  There are several ways the Department does long-term leasing which includes Part V housing.  About a third of these are lease-to-buy, meaning the local authority would own the unit after 25 years.  Then there is lease-to-lease which is the greater number, two thirds.  The local authority leases these units under a long-term lease but never gets to own them.  After 25 years, it has to start all over again.</p> <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, pays &euro;2,300 a month per apartment under this scheme.  The cost of that over 30 years would come to &euro;828,000 for an apartment.  A cost-to-build unit on public land would come to one quarter of that.  This does not make sense.  Where is the logic in that approach?  Dublin City Council will enter into a deal on former RT&Eacute; lands in Donnybrook which will come to &euro;521,000 for a two-bed apartment and &euro;472,000 for a one-bed.  That lease is astronomical.</p> <p>  Can anything be done by the Department to ensure value for money?  I would argue more should be going into social and affordable housing but we are not getting value of out such a scheme.</p></speech>

There is a strategic objective to harness off balance sheet investment in order to deliver the maximum number of units.  That is why we blend capital and current.</p> <p>  The enhanced lease is a specific model within that space.  It is not always easy to compare the unitary cost of a lease like that with other delivery mechanisms.  We have to look at the availability of alternatives in that area, particularly in a local authority where land is constrained and its own construction programme is operating in parallel but also at a cost.</p> <p>  The lease costs have other elements to them which are not immediately visible and not comparable with the construction, notably management, maintenance and the long-term management of the tenant within the unit.  There are outliers relating to more expensive units but there are other schemes progressing at more normal prices in the market.  It is a market-rent driven scheme.  The leases paid for are not above market rent and a discount is secured on the market rent as part of the contract.  It is just about the proportion and the slice of the overall delivery through leasing.</p> <p>  I will have to come back to the Chairman on the lease-to-buy and the lease-to-lease schemes.  In most cases, they are 20-year to 25-year leases.  Some can be shorter.  The reason-----</p></speech>

The problem is that it is a lot of money going down a big hole.  Up to &euro;2,300 a month to rent an apartment is an astronomical spend, even in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  In terms of social housing delivery, I am in favour of the integration of social housing with private.  I have argued for it over the years.  When I was chair of my local authority SPC, strategic policy committee, I pushed it hard.</p> <p>  Up to 70% of new builds for local authorities and approved housing bodies were turnkeys.  There is an argument that this takes away from private housing stock in that if an approved housing body buys units in a development, it leaves fewer for first-time buyers trying to get a starter home.</p><p>The cost of these homes appears astronomical.  Figures supplied by the Department show that the cost to build such a unit in Fingal is estimated to be &euro;209,000 while a turnkey unit costs &euro;412,000.  In Dublin city, the cost to build an apartment is &euro;181,000 while the cost of a turnkey apartment was &euro;382,000 in 2019.  It is more a case of breaking even in rural areas in that turnkey accommodation can be bought for roughly the same amount as it would cost to build.  By any standard, these turnkey developments represent an excessive cost.  To return to the issue of leasing under Part V, in many cases developers have the option to lease 10% of units rather than allowing the local authority to buy between 10% and 20% of them at a discounted rate, as was the case under the old system.  That is where many of the leases are getting caught.  I presume those units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire were acquired under Part V.</p></speech>

The averages may potentially distort the picture, particularly as a result of some outliers.  We have looked at the issue.  We are trying to compare apples with apples.  Some of the numbers that are quoted with regard to average costs for local authorities to deliver accommodation, such as &euro;200,000 or &euro;210,000, quite often relate to a three-bedroom semi-detached or terraced house.  Some of the very large numbers quoted relate to apartment delivery, which is fundamentally more expensive.  We are trying to deliver a mix of units into the housing system.  There are plenty of people looking for one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments in addition to families who may be looking for a more traditional three-bedroom home.  Quite often, the numbers quoted relate to some of the outliers.</p></speech>

As we move towards the numbers for next year and beyond, the Chairman will see that we are trying to shift the mix a little bit further in that direction.  I have looked at turnkey accommodation over the few months I have been in this role and it was certainly an issue as we looked towards the Estimates for next year.  There are, however, many situations where turnkey accommodation makes absolute sense.  One of the biggest criticisms the Chairman mentioned is that we can potentially be competing with first-time buyers, which is something we do not want to do.  A significant amount of the turnkey accommodation that has been delivered has been located on sites where properties would otherwise simply not have been built.  It does, therefore, add additional supply into the system.  The particular type of accommodation needed in a particular locality can also be an issue.  Turnkey accommodation definitely has a role.  The one thing on which I would caution-----</p></speech>

All I see in my constituency are long leases.  Properties are leased for 25 years at 90% of market rent with reviews at four-year intervals.  That is in cases where the maintenance is done.  When the maintenance is not covered, 80% of market rent is paid.  At the end of that period, the property is still owned by the developer.  I cannot see where the housing stock is going to come from in future.  All I see are the housing assistance payment, HAP, and long leases.  I could point the witnesses to six such developments being acquired under long leases, some of which are replacing units that were expected to be purchased under Part V.  Other whole estates are completed and it is expected that they are going to go on the market.  People tell me that they were waiting in the hope that they could stay in the area in which they grew up, where these are the only developments under way, only to find that, all of a sudden, these units are to be put out under long leases of 25 years.  I cannot see how value for money could possibly be achieved in that way.  We can use all sorts of language about things being off-balance sheet, blended mixes and so on but, at the end of the day, we need to build houses and add to our housing stock and this is not the way to do that.</p> <p>  To be perfectly honest, all I can see in the figures I receive through parliamentary questions is that the percentage of housing delivered in this way is growing.  I hear that developers are encouraged to suggest this option to the local authority.  That encouragement must be coming from the Department if that is the case.  Perhaps the mix in my area is different from that in others because I do not believe the local authority in my constituency owns any land which is designated for housing, but how can this be considered good value for money?  HAP is another issue.  Since 2014, I have been giving out about HAP and about how it is not a short-term measure and was the only measure available for a long time.  We have spent an absolute fortune on these measures which deliver no permanent assets and, in the case of HAP, do not deliver any certainty either.</p></speech>

This has happened.  If one compares the numbers built in 2016 with the numbers built in 2019, the year we are looking at today, or with the numbers that would have been delivered this year, one will see that more of these permanent solutions are certainly being brought into the system.  This will continue and, over time, we will see the number of HAP tenancies reduce.  In fact, it has reduced this year.  I have some statistics in respect of the Deputy's constituency, which I can certainly send on to her.</p></speech>

While it is not enough yet and there is still a long way to go in that, with the constraints around Exchequer finance it has been a question of trying to balance value for money but also of using many of the tools in the box to ultimately deliver the roof over people's heads.  That is what governs a lot of this, while at the same time trying our best to move over time to deliver solutions that do deliver value for money.</p></speech>

I am back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's insistence in some instances of usurping the local development plan and insisting on 35 dwellings per hectare, and in rural areas particularly, which means a mix of apartments and a mix of houses.  Essentially, one cannot build the apartment for less than one can sell it for.  Those developments, therefore, do not go ahead.  To my mind, to the developers' minds and to the minds of the people who are looking for housing this is not solving our housing problem.  It is creating it.  We may have lots of applications and lots of planning granted but the significant issue is that they are not viable at 35 dwellings per hectare in areas where apartments are just not suitable.  Rural and small towns in Ireland do not have the infrastructure.  It is a bit chicken and egg.  We need to put the infrastructure in to allow people to travel by train to these areas, or some other form of transport in order that they are not just the ghettos of the future.  This is why they are not being built.  That is the difficulty I have.  We need to see where An Bord Plean&aacute;la is coming up with this.  It is not in the guidelines, it is not anywhere.  I have raised this in the D&aacute;il.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is doing it persistently and it is preventing housing stock from increasing because the development of housing stock is not going ahead.  The grant for planning may be there but it is not viable on the basis of 35 dwellings per hectare.  This is a significant issue, and counter to what Deputy Catherine Murphy is saying, in that we are going to continue with HAP if we are not going to be able to increase the housing stock.</p></speech>

The former Minister did not write that letter.  We now have a new Minister who has not got around to it either.  I believe that it is the Department's function to look at this.  It is a significant issue that does not help the Department in increasing housing.</p></speech>

More generally, more than 29,000 planning decisions were made in 2019, of which almost 26,000 were granted and approximately 2,000 went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In the cases with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, 24% of the decisions were confirmed, 25% were reversed, and 50% were varied.  There is a huge amount getting through the system.  I believe approximately 40,000 homes were consented in last year.</p> <p>  As Mr. Doyle has outlined, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the independent planning appeals board.  It makes its judgments based on the policies in vogue and guidance given by the Minister.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that if 40,000 permissions were granted we did not build 40,000.  They did not go ahead.  The significant issue is to ask the question "Why and what is the problem?"  That is all.  I ask that Ms Graham might forward to the committee the report she has quoted from.</p></speech>

Those people cannot even apply because of the income threshold limits.  I am currently dealing with a couple who have five children.

We will take a married couple, where the husband is one of the hardest workers one could ever meet and who bursts himself and is out day and night trying to look after his family.  His wife is a carer for one of the children and is at home.  They are crippled by rent.  Every single year their rent goes up.  I have lost count of the number of places they have had to move to.  They have been to every single financial institution imaginable trying to see if there is some mechanism by which they can own their own home.  It is a no-go and yet, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage says they are not in need of housing because they earn in the region of &euro;40,000.  They would be ideal local authority residents.  One must remember that there is often an insinuation that people who are in local authority houses somehow get a free house.  They pay rent in line with and relative to their income and it is far from a free house.  At the moment the only people who are getting free houses are the developers and the speculators who are drawing down this year &euro;479 million in HAP payments.  This system is absolutely rotten and needs to be changed.</p></speech>

Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s opening remarks alluded to it but from the Community Call all the way through to the library services and the outreach services, local authorities were to the fore and acted in an exemplary manner.

Am I correct in saying &euro;2.5 billion of this was spent on housing?  My initial questions are on housing, and I have a number of them.  I think I heard Ms Hurley mention that in 2019 there were 20,809 homes in pre-development stage, or it may have been Ms Ryan who said that earlier on.  As to those nearly 21,000 homes at pre-development stage, under what kind of schemes are those homes being developed under?  Can I get a snapshot of those, please?</p></speech>

I am sorry Ms Ryan for interrupting but I am limited in time.  Can she forward a copy of that report to the committee?  It would be much appreciated.

I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire which has an older population.  A large proportion of our tenants require adaptions to the housing.

As Deputies know, it has been an exceptional year, and there have been some significant and unforeseen factors that have impacted on the Revenue&rsquo;s funding.The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 9 is to meet the 2020 shortfall associated with appropriations-in-aid, which is expenditure that the Department would normally receive, and Brexit-related expenditure required as part of our no-deal preparations. The total shortfall to be met is &euro;7.819 million, which is less than half a per cent of the Estimate approved for the year.  While &euro;7 million is a significant figure, it is less than a half a per cent of the Revenue's normal operational budget.</p><p>To further explain the background, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on trade, resulting in a projected shortfall in appropriations-in-aid income of &euro;7.1 million in 2020.  This shortfall is primarily a consequence of Covid-19 restrictions and their impact on<font color="#FF0000"> </font>customs collection costs associated with appropriations-in-aid.  During the course of the year, the Irish customs collected a substantial amount in fees processing customs documents for imports into both Ireland and the UK, where the company doing the importing was located in Ireland.  As a result of the shortfall of trade in the retail sector, there has been a significant reduction in the lack of actual imports, with the knock-on effect of a reduction in fees that the Revenue Commissioners would have expected to collect but did not arise because of a reduction in trade.  Although Revenue has seen significant underspend in its current funding, these savings are now required to meet overspends in office premises expenses due to Brexit infrastructure requirements.</p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s 2020 budget has also been impacted by minor overspend in the category of motor vehicles and revenue instruments.  This increased expenditure has arisen due to required maintenance work for multiple years in respect of Revenue&rsquo;s three mobile scanners and the acquisition of personal protective equipment, PPE, for customs staff.  The total amount required under that heading is &euro;719,000.</p><p>I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimate of the Revenue will allow the Revenue Commissioners to deal with such requirements between now and the end of the year.</p></speech>

Essentially, the Revenue expected some years ago that the required additional staff to deal with Brexit would have been in the order of 600.  The estimate during the course of the year was that that figure will eventually be 900.  Over 700 of those are currently in place and working.  The recruitment campaign has been ongoing for the other 200 in recent months and is expected to be completed as soon as possible in the new year to bring the full complement up to 900, which is the expected figure.  We are already well in excess of 700 as we speak, who will deal specifically with Brexit.  Most of those staff will be at clerical officer grade.

I have a query on table 1.  Can the Minister of State clarify the shortfall in terms of SASP, single authorisation for simplified procedures?  Can he clarify what occurred and give a bit more detail?</p> <p>  On the retail export scheme, I am sure many of us have been contacted by huge numbers of constituents on this.  The fact of the matter is that the hospitality sector, especially in the likes of Galway, has been massively affected by Covid-19 and the resulting restrictions.  This is another hit for the tourism industry.  I know an amendment has been submitted to change it to &euro;75 but we know that 50% of all transactions are for less than &euro;75 so it is another hit.  Since this scheme is operated by Revenue, will the Minister of State explain the rationale behind it?  I am concerned, as are many people in the Galway area, in particular.</p> <p>  We saw that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, published yesterday that there has been a 38% decrease in traffic volumes.  This is up to November so it does not include the level 5 restrictions currently in place.  The Minister of State knows well that there are insurance companies out there who have given just &euro;15 back in SuperValu vouchers for people who have not been able to use their car, such as people who are working from home and that kind of thing.  That is a huge cost and the insurance companies are ripping off ordinary customers at the best of times.  Now in the middle of a pandemic, when people have lost their income and are not using their cars and the CSO tells us there is nearly 40% less traffic on the roads, they are being hit again.</p> <p>  We need to see at least 20% of insurance premiums paid back.  Does the Minister of State agree?  What has he done about this?  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have written to the insurance federation on this but it is important that action is immediately taken.  People cannot afford this and 20% of premiums must immediately come back to the customers.</p></speech>

There is a specific amendment on that issue.  That is not in place as we speak.  It is a proposal in the Brexit legislation that will be dealt with on Committee Stage in the Convention Centre this afternoon.  There are amendments down and that matter will be discussed at that meeting because it cannot be dealt with here in respect of the context of the Estimates for 2020.  That is a 2021 matter, covered by the upcoming legislation.</p> <p>  On insurance, while it is not a matter for this debate, the committee has extended an invitation to me, as the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, to come before the committee as soon as the date can be arranged and I am happy to do that.  We can have a full discussion on the insurance issue.  The Deputy's point is well noted.  As she said, there were some reductions but that matter will be discussed at a joint meeting of this committee as soon as we agree a date, which will happen very soon.</p> <p>  Finally, the Deputy asked a question about why there were some reductions.  There were some reductions in the appropriations-in-aid related to payroll because, as a result of Covid, there was a significant reduction in overtime for a number of staff in the Department.  This resulted in a reduction in superannuation contributions that normally accrued during the year.  That is why there is a slight reduction in that heading in relation to Covid.</p></speech>

People cannot afford to pay this now and we need urgent action.  I am glad the Minister of State has heard what I had to say and I hope he takes it on board and takes immediate action with regard to insurance companies.  People cannot afford this and &euro;15 in SuperValu vouchers will not get a turkey for Christmas, let alone anything else.</p><p>Therefore, the reality is that urgent action is needed in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020112500002#B00200"><p>I support the remarks made by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.  We will have a special meeting on insurance.  The amount of money being refunded by insurance companies to those with policies is miserly, particularly given that they are not on the road and so on.  Perhaps the Department will ask the companies to reconsider, particularly in the run-up to Christmas.  Issuing &euro;20, which some of us got, or &euro;15, which others got, is miserly.  It goes to show what the insurance companies think of their customers.  The Minister of State might be able to reflect on that and pass the message on to the insurance companies as he meets their representatives.</p> <p>  Regarding the Estimate, there is &euro;1.27 million in respect of maintenance of the fleet of mobile X-ray container scanners.  That seems to be a huge figure.  Is there a breakdown?  Is the money for general maintenance or is it specifically for the container scanners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020112500002#B00300"><p>It concerns the container scanners, which had not been subject to that level of maintenance for a number of years.  A couple of years' maintenance was actually carried out in the one year.  Maybe it should be done annually but it was not.  That is why there is an exceptionally high figure for the fleet of mobile X-ray container scanners at Dublin Port, Cork Harbour and Rosslare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020112500002#B00400"><p>I suggest that there should be a rolling maintenance programme to ensure the scanners do not break down.  Obviously, the authorities will be under pressure for time owing to Brexit.</p> <p>  From the beginning of the Covid pandemic, many of the staff who normally travelled from the country to Dublin found themselves working from home.  I understand that, for the Revenue Commissioners, this has been particularly successful.  Will they now review the work that has been undertaken by the employees at home and determine how successful it was, perhaps with a view to continuing a programme to support those working from home?  Maybe it could be ensured that those who travel from the country are given the option to work from home.  I understand the change of practice was quite successful.</p></speech>

It is probably a matter that will be dealt with in pay talks concerning not just the Revenue Commissioners but also the public sector in general.  It has been a big issue right across the public sector.  Ministers have made comments on reducing the time people have to spend in offices.  I assume that, for the coming year, the Revenue Commissioners will operate according to whatever is agreed across the public service.</p></speech>

How many of those who worked from home during the Covid pandemic will be allowed to continue to do so where there is a proven success rate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020112500002#B00700"><p>I do not have that information today but I will ask the Revenue Commissioners to provide an information note to the committee on it.  As I may have mentioned previously, approximately 600 staff were employed originally to work on customs as a result of Brexit.  One hundred and seventeen of these people, who had come from other sections in Revenue, went back to their posts in the past year but were brought back again to work on Brexit.  As we speak, over 700 people are working on customs operations in respect of the ports.  That number will increase.  I do not know how many staff were working from home.  We will get a note not only on the Brexit aspect but on how many of the Revenue Commissioners' staff as a whole have been working from home and how this has been working out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020112500002#B00800"><p>One of the biggest delivery companies in the country that will find it is a customs clearance expert after all this is DPD.  I declare an interest in that I have an involvement with it.  The fact is that it will be the biggest customs clearance company in the country.  Last night, for example, 210,000 parcels passed through its system.  I am not taking into account DHL, An Post and all the other relevant companies.  I am told many of the smaller customers have not geared themselves up at all to be ready for customs associated with Brexit.  They are not ready for the responsibility they will have in the chain of the customs clearance process.  I encourage the Minister of State and his colleagues to press this sector of business people a little harder because the storage of parcels that cannot be cleared will cause immense problems, including in respect of the delivery of consignments etc.  An examination is required at the coalface to make sure arrangements are in place.  The bigger companies, such as the one I mentioned, should be encouraged to feed back to the Minister of State some of the data they have and their concerns regarding the Brexit-readiness, or otherwise, of their customers.  Action has to be taken to make sure this particular pathway is cleared.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020112500002#B00900"><p>I agree completely with the Chairman, who has mentioned the principal concern.  The big companies are geared up but the small companies are the ones that are going to have a difficulty.  Some will get quite a shock in the first two or three weeks of January if they do not get ready between now and the new year.  An example might be a garage that imports equipment to repair cars.  It might phone for a part when the importation truck is still in England but because no customs clearance docket will have been prepared in advance, it will find the part cannot be brought on that truck and that it will have to be brought on another two days later.  Delays will be caused, especially for small businesses, some of which have not fully grasped what is happening.  Serious delays will be caused to their business in January and February if they do not get Brexit-ready.  The Chairman's point is well made.  Through the Revenue Commissioners, we will get on to the small companies.  The Revenue Commissioners have a record of everybody who goes through customs every year.  They know those who are well prepared and those they have not been hearing from.  I will ask Revenue to redouble its efforts in respect of the smaller companies.</p></speech>

If one extrapolates from that, taking into account all the other companies involved in express delivery, one will find massive numbers of transactions going online.  It is only when the amount of sorting is seen that one realises the volumes involved.  If there is a problem at small business level in this regard, it really has to be thrashed out now in co-operation with the delivery companies.</p></speech>

Will it be early in January, or will it be mid-January?  It is a holiday time, in general.  Will we have the resources from early January onwards to deal with issues that arise?</p></speech>

Bearing in mind the example I gave, the problem will arise the first time a company that is not ready customs-wise to deal with Brexit tries to import something.  For some companies, it could be the end of January or 1 February.  For others, it could be 3 January or 4 January.  The problem will arise the first time they try to import something, and then they will know straight away.</p></speech>

Our only concern is for those small businesses that are not ready.  Revenue, customs and the ports, in terms of premises, additional parking and other facilities, are ready.  For example, the animal border control post at Rosslare Port was completed last week.  Dublin Port completed terminal 10 and the R2 last week.  The R3 is an ex-boatyard and it will be completed Christmas week.  Dublin Port terminal 11 west truck park will be completed Christmas week and terminal 11 east, including a 10 on-site truck parking area, is scheduled for completion in mid-March.  A yard port is yet to be completed in September 2021.  At Rosslare Port, a permanent port infrastructure will not be completed until well into 2022.  In terms of the checklist, most of the works are already completed.  Some work has yet to be done but Revenue is satisfied it has sufficient arrangements in place at those ports.  As time goes on, these will need to be expanded.</p></speech>

One of the requests was for a detailed note on the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, the Department's intention and policy direction and a breakdown of expenditure.  The committee should have received the letter in the last day or two, which was prepared a short time ago.  There has been an update which the committee may be aware of that is not addressed in the letter.  I would like to put that update on record today.</p> <p>  To allow primary medical certificate assessments to recommence a Committee Stage amendment has been inserted into the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.  The committee will be aware of that as the amendment was made on Committee Stage of its consideration of the Finance Bill.  When the Bill has passed Report and Final Stages and it is signed into law by the President and enacted this will allow for assessments to recommence in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified.  The issue that went to the Supreme Court was dealt with by way of an amendment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  When the Bill is cleared by the Houses, the primary medical assessments will be able to recommence.  That information was not included in the letter received this week by the committee.

I also remind members to sanitise their desk area and seat when leaving the committee room.  The main item on our agenda is our consideration of the pandemic unemployment payment scheme.  I welcome officials from the Department of Social Protection, Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession and Ms Teresa Leonard, both assistant secretaries, who are joining us remotely.  They are very welcome.</p><p>Speaking not just for members of the committee but for all Members of the Oireachtas, I thank the witnesses and each and every member of their teams for the work they have been doing over the past nine months in processing claims for the pandemic unemployment payment as expeditiously as possible, as well as for dealing with queries raised by Members of the Oireachtas in a prompt manner.  It is not unusual for any of us to receive replies from officials in the Department late in the evening or on Saturdays indicating that documentation is outstanding or that something needs to be addressed.  I take this opportunity to thank each and every one of the staff for their work and their commitment.</p><p>The committee recently commenced an examination and a review of the pandemic unemployment payment scheme as administered by the Department of Social Protection and has sought public submissions on this matter.  Today's engagement will assist the committee as we work to present a report on our findings to the Minister in advance of the social welfare Bill coming before the Houses.  As part of our ongoing work, we are also examining the interaction of the pandemic unemployment payment with the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme.  We will publish submissions on the committee's website.  There have been clear anomalies in the operation of the pandemic unemployment payment, which is understandable as it was introduced literally overnight.  There have also been issues in its interaction with the various wage subsidy schemes since those supports were introduced last March, and thousands of people and families have been impacted.  We look forward to engaging with the witnesses on these matters.</p><p>Members of the committee and of the Houses have absolute privilege in respect of statements made to either House of the Oireachtas or before a committee.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are required to give to a committee.  However, if during the course of the committee proceedings they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p><p>They are also directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way that would make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I now call Mr. Hession to make an opening statement of five minutes.  If he so wishes and if it makes it a little easier for him, he may take his mask off.</p></speech>

I thank him and members of the committee for the invitation to attend to discuss the pandemic unemployment payment scheme, or the PUP, as it is known.  My name is R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession and I am the assistant secretary general in the Department of Social Protection with responsibility for working-age policy.  I am joined by my colleague, Teresa Leonard, who is assistant secretary general with responsibility for operational matters.</p> <p>  The PUP was introduced in March of this year as an emergency response to the huge and sudden increase in the loss of employment arising from the imposition of necessary public health restrictions to address the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was introduced first at a rate of &euro;203 per week as a means to fast-track payment of an unprecedented volume of claims.  The intention was that claims from people with qualified adults or dependants would then be prioritised and re-rated at an appropriate higher rate of payment.  When, given the claim load, it became evident that this would not be possible, the rate of payment was increased to &euro;350 and aligned with the rate for a two-person household on a standard jobseeker claim.  This payment rate was also broadly equivalent to the net weekly earnings in the two most affected sectors, namely retail and hospitality.  Within two weeks of the PUP being announced, we received and processed 389,000 applications.  This was equivalent to a 19-month claim load in one fortnight.  By the peak on 5 May, we were issuing payments to 602,000 people at a cost of some &euro;209 million per week.  By that time more than 1.1 million people were in receipt of State supports either via the live register, the PUP or the temporary wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p>  Changes were subsequently introduced in June to link the payment rate to prior earnings, and since the move to level 5 restrictions the PUP is paid at four rates as follows.  For those with prior weekly earnings of less than &euro;200 per week, the rate of the PUP is &euro;203 per week.  On average, this is 190% of prior earnings.  For those with prior weekly earnings between &euro;200 and &euro;299.99 per week the rate of the PUP is &euro;250 per week.  On average, this is 106% of prior earnings.  For those with prior weekly earnings between &euro;300 and &euro;399.99 per week the rate of the PUP is &euro;300 per week.  On average, this is 90% of prior earnings.  A person who previously earned &euro;400 or more per week receives a PUP rate of &euro;350 per week.  On average, this is 58% of prior earnings.</p> <p>  In addition to the changes to payment rates, and as outlined in briefing material provided last week, the Department has, since the PUP was introduced, enhanced the processes and systems used to verify prior employment status and earnings.  All claims are now checked against Revenue Commissioners records of employment and earnings to validate prior employment status and to set the correct rate of payment.  Where a person's employment status or earnings cannot be validated, he or she is contacted and invited to submit supplementary information to enable us to check his or her status and to process the claim to completion.</p> <p>  On 16 November we issued payments valued at &euro;103.8 million to 350,072 people in receipt of the PUP.  To date, numbers in receipt of the PUP have therefore increased by just under 150,000 since restrictions were introduced at the start of October and by just under 106,000 since the introduction of level 5 restrictions on 7 October.  These figures are in addition to the 203,172 people who were reported as being on the live register as of the end of October.</p> <p>  From a sectoral perspective, those most impacted sectors, measured in terms of PUP recipients during the initial onset of the pandemic, included accommodation and food, wholesale and retail, and construction.  All three recovered to varying degrees during the lifting of restrictions over the summer.  With the introduction of restrictions, the accommodation and food sector is impacted to the most significant extent, with wholesale and retail impacted to a lesser extent than may have been anticipated.</p> <p>  From a regional perspective, while the introduction of level 5 restrictions has seen increases across all regions, PUP numbers remain below peak levels in all areas.</p> <p>  In age terms, under-25s make up a proportionately higher share of current recipients than was the case at the peak.  Given the high concentration of young workers in hospitality and retail, this is unsurprising.</p> <p>  As for gender, at the peak just over 40% of recipients were female.  The most recent data, which capture the initial impact of level 5 restrictions, indicate that the proportion of males and females on the PUP is now almost equal.  This is likely a consequence of the different sectoral composition of those on the PUP compared with the initial peak.  For example, construction, which is a largely male-dominated industry, employs more than 148,000 people across the country and was closed at the initial phases but remains open under level 5.</p> <p>  A number of changes have been made to the PUP scheme in recent weeks.  Following the announcement in the budget, it is now possible for a self-employed person to earn up to &euro;480 in a four-week period without it affecting his or her PUP claim.  This addresses concerns raised in particular by taxi drivers and those in the arts and culture sector.  We have also revised the reference period for the calculation of prior earnings in order that those with employment records since February can receive the appropriate PUP payment.</p> <p>  We have a number of important projects under way, including payment of the Christmas bonus.  The bonus will be paid at 100% of the relevant PUP rate of payment.  The PUP bonus week is the entitlement week ending 3 December 2020.  A person who has been in continuous receipt of PUP since Friday, 7 August, will satisfy that condition.  In addition, any person in receipt of the PUP for the week ending 3 December who has returned to work and who has an aggregate of at least 17 weeks on the PUP will also qualify for the bonus on the pay date of 8 December.  In other words, the 17 weeks do not have to be continuous.</p> <p>  Before I conclude, I wish to pay tribute to the staff within the Department who have worked tirelessly since March to ensure that those affected by the Covid restrictions receive the financial support they need.  This has been demanding at a time when, as a Department, we have had to adapt our work practices in order to prioritise the safety and well-being of our staff and customers.  We have provided briefing to the committee setting out further detail on the scheme, which I hope is useful in informing the committee's deliberations.  We are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

Two of the big issues that have been raised with committee members have been the position of Aer Lingus staff and getting their applications processed and the music and entertainment industry.

I think approximately 12,000 people from the arts and culture sector are currently claiming the PUP.  The size of the sector overall is approximately 55,000 people, according to the CSO data.  At the peak approximately14,000 were on the PUP, so the current figure is slightly below the peak.  A number of different issues have been raised with us by this sector.  Many of the people in the sector are freelance, and there was a question around their ability to do a small amount of work without losing the PUP.  Originally, when we were interpreting the legislation, we had given advice and guidance that people were able to do a small amount of work if it was intermittent, sporadic, etc.  In response to concerns raised by the sector, one of the measures announced in the budget was the introduction of a &euro;480 earnings limit for those people so they had clarity on what they could earn while still retaining their PUP payments.  There are further measures for people who earn beyond that limit through the part-time job incentive to allow them to return to a position of fuller employment.  There is a wide range of issues in this sector.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, has published a task force report which addresses a wide range of issues beyond social welfare, going into what that sector needs.  Clearly, the sector has been heavily impacted by the pandemic and faces a number of challenges, but overall we have tried to continue positive and constructive engagement with it.</p><p>Overall, we have tried to continue to engage positively and constructively with the sector.  I was a member of the task force on arts and culture.  We have had a good dialogue over several months and we have tried to be responsive to issues that have been raised. </p><p> I will ask my colleague, Ms Teresa Leonard, to speak on the Aer Lingus issue.  I am happy to answer any further questions on this area.</p></speech>

There are several things at stake here.  We have been actively involved with the Aer Lingus staff since 1 September.  All the applications we have received in that period have now been processed.  More than 3,200 cases are involved.  To put the whole issue in context, two schemes to support employers and employees in employment are currently operating.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme was introduced early this year.  Aer Lingus took part and its employees were paid using that scheme.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme is not compatible with the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  A claimant cannot receive both.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme marks a recipient as employed.  At that point, some Aer Lingus employees made applications to the Department which have not yet been processed.  On 1 September the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme was replaced by the employment wage subsidy scheme, which is payable to the employer.  That payment is compatible with jobseeker's benefit.  The Department has processed all of those claims, which I referred to initially.</p> <p>  We have now set up a group of deciding officers to process the claims from the period prior to 1 September.  Each of these claims is quite complex and must be examined individually.  We must determine whether a claimant received the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, the periods of time for which he or she did so and the periods for which he or she was employed.  Employers paid remuneration to some employees for some periods and actually increased their wages.  The temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme allowed employers to top up employees' wages.  As such, claims made prior to 1 September are very complicated.  The only way to examine them with any thoroughness is to set up a group of deciding officers, which is now working on them one by one.  That work commenced last week.  We will go through each and every claim and determine an outcome for each individual. </p> <p>  We have also made an arrangement with Aer Lingus.  If we ask its employees for particular information, Aer Lingus is aware of what we require and will immediately supply it to the claimant via email.  It will take time, but we hope to get through the claims in the next several weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#C00300"><p>I thank Mr. Hession for his opening statement.  I would like to ask a couple of questions arising from the statement and the briefing document.  The initial rate of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment was &euro;203.  It quickly moved to &euro;350.  Would it be fair to say that it was acknowledged that a worker who had lost his or her job could not live on &euro;203, particularly in light of the fact that the highest rate of &euro;350 just about covers half of the average worker's prior earnings?</p> <p>  It was announced in the recent budget that people could earn &euro;480 per four-week period and retain the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  Do the witnesses have any idea how many workers have taken advantage of that and in which sectors it has been utilised?  That was referenced in the submission to this committee from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The cuts, or "calibrations" as I think they have been called, are due to be introduced in February.  The Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment rates will be reduced to &euro;250 and &euro;203.  Has that been reconsidered in light of recipients' prior earnings?</p> <p>  According to emails I have received, the issue for Aer Lingus workers did not so much concern the payments and their administration.  Employees were being actively blocked from getting their forms signed by their employer.  I raised this with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and she acknowledged that the Department had spoken to Aer Lingus on several occasions.  That kind of carry-on sets a very dangerous precedent.  Any future engagement with Aer Lingus must include how these things are resolved with employees.  All TDs received horrific emails from Aer Lingus employees who were in really difficult situations.  We do not want to see that happening again.</p> <p>  The briefing document makes several references to the fact that those currently on the &euro;203 payment, who had prior earnings of &euro;200 or less, are better off than when they were at work.  I have heard that said a lot and I do not think it is a good thing.  It points to much bigger issues of working poverty and the prevalence of low pay.  I do not like that kind of language and I have heard it quite a bit.  Since the legislation came in one of the qualifying conditions has been that a claimant must be genuinely seeking work.  How is that monitored?  Have referrals been made to job activation schemes?  Can the witnesses give us a little bit more information on what is actually required for a claimant to show that he or she is genuinely seeking work?  Are there sanctions or penalties if that requirement is not met, or are such measures being considered for the future?</p> <p>  Travel outside the State is also referenced in the briefing document.  In its submission to this committee, representatives of ICTU stated that they had sought clarification on the criteria used to identify which flights were to be checked by departmental officials.  People were really shocked by that operation when it was reported in the news.  I would like more information on who decided on that operation and how it worked.  I would also like an answer to ICTU's question.  </p> <p>  I have a further question about how claimants apply for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  What was the rationale for removing the form from the website and asking claimants to send an email requesting it?  I welcome the efforts to pay arrears before the end of the year.  Do the witnesses have any idea of how many recipients will be due arrears?  Can they confirm that they will be paid before the end of the year?  I would like to clarify that to receive the Christmas bonus, a claimant does not need to be on the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment the week it is paid, once he or she has been previously been on it for four months, continuously or otherwise.  I think the bonus is issued on the week of 7 December.  Does a claimant need to be on the payment on that week to receive the Christmas bonus? </p> <p>  There has been a lot of mention of the social insurance fund.  The Parliamentary Budget Office gave us a great briefing on these matters.  How concerned should we be about the social insurance fund?  Is the Department looking at any ways to fix what will obviously be a big issue for the fund?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Leonard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will take some of the operational questions and then yield to Mr. Hession.  We may both comment on some of those issues.  The Deputy's first question was about the change in the rate of payment from &euro;203 to &euro;350.  I would like to provide some context for the change.  We introduced the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment very quickly, as the committee acknowledged.  The initial rate was &euro;203, which was the standard rate of jobseeker's allowance at the time.  The Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment was initially introduced to ensure that people stayed at home when they were expected to or to compensate them when their employment disappeared.  With that in mind, the payment was increased to &euro;350 to make it equivalent to the rate for a two-family household and to make sure people did not feel they had to go to work.  Mr. Hession will explain the work issues a bit more.</p> <p>  We have been in constant communication with Aer Lingus on this issue.  The company is very aware of what will be needed if an employee approaches them seeking information for the review we are carrying out.</p><p>It has agreed the documentation with us, meaning there is no issue with that matter as far as we are concerned at this point.</p><p> The genuinely seeking work, GSW, conditionality has been brought into the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  It is being treated lightly and sensitively.  In fairness, we are not pursuing anybody at this point in time.  Activation services are available to anybody on PUP, should he or she require them.  However, we are not actively at that nor are we applying any penalties or reviews now.</p><p> It is a scheme, however, for which people are available for work.  That is part of the conditionality for it.  As of now, we have not done any review of anybody.  We are encouraging people, should they wish, to get any activation services as they are available to them.  We have not formally invited anybody to our activation services, however.</p><p> The arrears project is well in hand at this point.  We have done a huge amount of work over the past number of months to get it organised and ready for payment.  We hope to make a payment next week to most customers who are due arrears.  There will be some particular candidates who may not get arrears, however, because of the complexity of it and that the relevant information is not fully available to pay them should they have an entitlement.</p><p> It is important that the committee realises the complexity of doing arrears.  When calculating and issuing arrears for customers, we have to look back over the customer's whole record.  It is important to bear in mind that we have had over 800,000 customers with just under 1.4 million claims for PUP and we have issued over 13 million payments so far.  With that in mind, in the same period, the temporary wage subsidy scheme is in place, which is not compatible with PUP, but there was an interaction between the two.  Some customers have blanks in their records in that they may have been employed during that period and may have received the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  If they missed a week's period, they may have been paid by the community welfare service.  We have to check back on those payments over that period.</p><p> In addition to that, if a payment fell out, we did pay them the following week.  PUP is not compatible with other primary schemes with the exception of some schemes like carer's allowance, disability allowance, one-parent family and working family payments.  We have paid it in conjunction with these.  There are other schemes, such as jobseeker's and illness benefit, with which it is not compatible.  In those cases, we have to check to ensure somebody was not in receipt of those during the same period.</p><p> The actual complexity of arrears and getting them out the door lies with the comparisons and checking we have to do to make sure we are actually paying people appropriately, not overpaying or underpaying them.  We hope next week that the majority of cases will be paid.  There will be a small minority which we will have to do manually.  These will follow.  Due to the complexity of their actual cases, we feel an officer needs to look at them because we cannot programme any solution to pay them.  That will be done manually.</p><p> Somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 is our expected number of customers to be paid.  We will know more later on in the week.</p><p> The Christmas bonus, as my colleague stated in his opening statement, will be paid on 8 December.  It is for anybody who has to be on PUP on the week ending 3 December.  The 17-week period to qualify for the bonus payment can be made up of any period in the past 36 weeks.  This is week 36.  Yesterday, we paid PUP for that week.  It is any week in that.  If there was a period of unemployment in that period, that can be used to add up to the actual 17 weeks.  It is very much a case of working through the 17 weeks and giving it to people.  However, they have to be on PUP the week of 3 December.  Even if they sign off to go back to work, anytime during the week, they will get their bonus payment.</p></speech>

It is quite significant in terms of the lifting of the lockdown next week.  If people sign on any day next week, will they be eligible for it or must they have signed on on 3 December?</p></speech>

It is anybody who is part of the PUP in that week from this Friday coming until 3 December.  Anybody who has had any day that they are not working in that period and only signs off to go back to work any day in the week will still get their PUP, provided they sign off that they are going back to work.  If ones sign off to go back to work on Monday, 30 November, one will still get one's PUP because one is actually on the scheme in the week ending on 3 December.  PUP is paid by weeks, not by days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#D00400"><p>The &euro;203 rate was introduced at the jobseeker rate initially.  The idea at that stage was that PUP would be a six-week scheme.  We needed to get money out to people quickly before we were able to put them on to a proper jobseeker scheme.  That was the standard rate.  The movement to the &euro;350 rate was not so much a commentary on the adequacy of the &euro;203 rate but more a recognition of the fact that it would take longer to do that and people had dependants and so forth.</p> <p>  We do not have numbers on the people availing of the &euro;480 threshold under PUP.  People are not required to report that to us.  They are required to keep records in case we need to check that.  That is why we do not have details available on that.</p> <p>  On the February rate change, the Minister said during the budget that the question will be revisited towards the end of year.  Over the coming weeks, the Government will have to assess the current situation in light of the trajectory of the pandemic and the economic situation and then take a position on that February change.</p> <p>  On the question of the working poor and the number on the &euro;203 rate, given the level of the minimum wage at &euro;10.10 an hour and moving to an extra increase in January, the chances are that the people in that cohort are part-time workers.  One can only get 20 hours on the minimum wage to be under the &euro;203 threshold.  Until recently, the Department was responsible for the national minimum wage.  We are conscious of the issues of low-wage jobs, employment rights and ensuring we avoid in-work poverty.  Many of our payments continue to be paid as people work, such as working family and jobseeker payments.  They allow for a degree of work.  We are always mindful of that issue.  The &euro;203 threshold is more likely, given the statutory minimum wage, to be a reflection of part-time workers.</p> <p>  On travel, we have not done inspections at airports for quite a number of months and we do not plan to resume them.  In the case of the flights that were inspected, a factor was the low level of flights coming in and out of the country at the time.  We also did inspections at ports at that time.  In terms of the criteria, it was a factor of the inspectors operating at the airports at the time, looking at what flights were available and making a call on the ground.</p> <p>  Since the legislation came in on 5 August, the full cost of PUP has been drawn from the Social Insurance Fund, SIF.  The total cost of PUP for this year is &euro;5 billion, along with &euro;94 million.  The latter is largely the budget for the Christmas bonus.  We are up to &euro;4.3 billion at the moment.  Clearly, this is a big draw on the SIF which we had not expected at the beginning of 2020.  That clearly is an issue which needs to be examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#D00500"><p>I join in thanking the staff of the Department of Social Protection.  We certainly get a good and interactive service, which is important.  The staff are willing to talk to Oireachtas Members as they recognise we represent people.  When we get on to the Department on behalf of constituents, we obviously have their permission.  It makes our life a lot easier.</p><p>It is a pity that not all other agencies in the State operate with the same kinds of interactions.  It is not only that the Department comes back quickly, but it also comes back with comprehensive answers when we ask further questions.  There is a great willingness to deal in detail with the kinds of issues that arise.  Social welfare, by its nature, is complex.<br/><br/>I have a few questions.  One of the most significant things that jumps out to me is that those who are getting the full rate of &euro;350 on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, are only, on average, getting 58% of what they were earning previously.  That is a significant loss of income.  I have mentioned this time and again.  Some of that cohort are renting and entitled to rent supplement, as far as I understand, if they qualify under a means test.  However, further up the income scale, a fair number of the people affected would have significant mortgages and young families.  I understand that such a person would not be entitled to child dependent allowance and there is no mortgage interest supplement.  I do not know if our guests covered the philosophy of the policy when it was introduced but was consideration given to reintroducing a scheme that existed for as long as I can remember until 2014, namely, mortgage interest supplement?  That would have been an option instead of depending on the banks.  We all know how kind banks are, as charitable organisations.  They are not.  They are run by hard-headed business people and if someone gets a moratorium on repayments, the banks will come after them, looking for that money back.  I am thinking of the cohort of people who might have been on &euro;1,000 a week and paying a big proportion of that on their mortgage, people with a family and the costs that go with it.  Those people were hit by the pandemic and, we now know, are only getting, on average, 58% of what they were earning.  The higher up the pay scale one goes, the lower that percentage.  The percentage is higher the nearer a claimant was to earnings of &euro;300 or &euro;400 a week.  Was consideration given to the reintroduction of mortgage interest supplement as a policy instrument?<br/><br/>I do not know whether our guests have the figures I am going to ask them about now but it is a matter about which we should think.  As Mr. Hession pointed out, there is a minimum wage in the country and any company that was not paying the minimum wage was breaking the law.  That means that people who were earning less than &euro;350 were, by definition, part-time workers.  That is a mathematical certainty.  Do we have any information as to how many of those are voluntarily part-time workers?  There are quite a number of those.  I often come across people who choose, for family circumstances or whatever, to work on a part-time basis.  On the other hand, how many are forced part-time workers - in other words, workers to whom the employer does not give the work and so the worker has no choice other than to be a part-time employee?  There is also a third cohort.  Do we have any idea how many part-time workers were students who were working to try to put themselves through college?  Those people worked particularly in fast food, retail and so on and lost out on that income on which they were totally dependent in order to keep the ship afloat while they were trying to get an education.  Those figures would tell us something about student grants and a whole lot of other things that are not the immediate concern of our guests.  We should learn from everything that has been going on with the PUP.  There are a lot of good lessons, and some hard lessons, to be learned.<br/><br/>The PUP was due to end and I now hear noises that this might not happen.  Can our guests confirm that if there are to be continuing lockdowns of sectors of the economy, or, for example, restaurants and so-called wet pubs are allowed to open over Christmas but are locked down again in January and February, that there will be a PUP for which workers in those affected areas will be able to reapply?  Workers might move away from the PUP before Christmas but be forced be back to it in the new year, although please God that does not happen.  Can our guests confirm that such people will be covered by the PUP?<br/><br/>I thought it was strange that the &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; caveat came in, whoever was responsible.  I know it was said that the rule is not being applied, and I welcome that, but I hate rules that are not applied because some day, somebody will wake up and decide to apply it.  When asked why they are applying it, they can then say it was the rule for the past six months, or whatever.  My view is that if there is a rule, apply it.  If a rule is not going to be applied, do not have it.  Otherwise, we get into the area of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>where we have a rule but do not apply it before some day, someone suddenly starts applying it, saying that we have had this rule for ages.  People are concerned about this.  Consider somebody who had a good job for all their life and worked for the past 30 years in a restaurant.  The job will be there for them when the restaurant reopens, please God.  The person does not need a job because they have one, albeit they are out of work in the short term, in the greater scheme of things, because of a situation that will not happen again on a recurring basis.  It is a pity that the caveat was put in.  These sorts of things seem perennially to get thrown in and it does not seem to make sense.<br/><br/>A valid question was raised about the Social Insurance Fund.  Back in 2010, the fund ran dry.  In the noughties, there was quite a lot of accumulated savings in the Social Insurance Fund.  In other words, the social contributions that were being put aside for the rainy day, pension budgets and so on exceeded expenditure out of the fund.  As a result of the downturn between 2008 and 2012, the Social Insurance Fund ran dry in 2010.  The Exchequer gave advances at that time and if one looks at Exchequer returns for the following few years, one can see the advances and their repayment.  Some time in the middle of the 2010s, all the money was paid back and no advances were needed during the year.  Can the witnesses tell us how much was saved in the Social Insurance Fund?  In other words, what was it worth on 1 January 2020, before we were hit by the Covid-19 tsunami?  The Department has stated that &euro;5 billion over and above has been spent.  Is the fund still in credit or has it gone into deficit?  If it is in deficit, I presume the Exchequer is temporarily funding it and will recoup its investment in the Social Insurance Fund as things get back to normal.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

We may have to come back to the Deputy on one or two points.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a legitimate point about the position of a cohort of those receiving the PUP at a rate of &euro;350.  Approximately 46% of PUP claimants are on that &euro;350 rate and, even with that support, we recognise there is a significant drop in income for a large number of people in receipt of the payment.  The means or income test for rent supplement was adjusted to reflect the payment of PUP at the &euro;350 rate so we were not giving people a PUP which was affecting or knocking out their rent supplement payment.   At the start of the year, rent supplement was approximately &euro;15,000 or &euro;16,000.  It went up to over &euro;20,000 and it now back to just under &euro;20,000.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about reinstating mortgage interest supplement.  He is right that the scheme stopped to new entrants in 2014.  It is not an issue at which we looked.  I know that there have been various other statutory protections introduced by the Minister responsible for housing to try to address the position for people who are under pressure with their mortgages.  The mortgage interest supplement was not a part of our thinking at that stage of the process.  To be honest, in terms of the size of the problem we were dealing with, our immediate focus was primarily to lead on the income supports and try to make sure we could address those.  The wider housing complexity would have been difficult for us to take on at that stage.</p><p>I do not have the figures here with me on unemployment - voluntary, forced or otherwise - but I know there are figures produced by the CSO on the degree of underemployment among those who are currently working part-time but have the capacity or ability to work more than that.  I am happy to send those figures to the committee after the meeting.  The number of students receiving the PUP is around 26,000.  As the Deputy has said, there were many people who were studying but also working to try to support themselves through college.  Like others, they lost their employment after 13 March because of the pandemic.  They have an entitlement to the PUP and are being paid at a rate that is linked to their prior rate of pay.  I can confirm to the Deputy that, arising from a decision taken yesterday by the Government and announced by the Minister, the PUP will remain open to new applicants until the end of March 2021.  In cases like that outlined by the Deputy, where people go back to work for the Christmas period and then go into unemployment, the PUP will be available for them to submit a claim after that period.</p><p> I note the Deputy's points on the genuinely seeking work rule.  To some extent, I cannot comment on the merits of Government policy on this issue other than to say that the PUP is an unemployment payment with the standard features that entails, and the genuinely seeking work rule is part of that.  I accept Deputy's point that a rule is a rule and we should not decide in a spontaneous way when to apply it or not to apply it.  Bearing in mind that the pandemic is a very different economic environment, however, we do not think it is a problem for a person to fail to look for work while their sector is closed.  If a person is working in the hospitality sector, for example, their job is not available to them because their workplace is closed due to the shutdown of the wider sector.  We take a proportionate view of that.</p><p> I do not have the figures with me on the opening balance of the social insurance fund, but we will provide the Deputy with those figures in a follow-up response.  Perhaps my colleague, Ms Leonard, has something to add.</p></speech>

The &euro;350 is net income, so the annual gross figure would be equivalent to approximately &euro;20,000.  I will return to the issue of the genuinely seeking work rule because I did not do a great job of answering the question the first time.  I was going to go back and clarify the matter for the Deputy.  Although the environment and the times we are in mean that we are perhaps not applying the genuinely seeking work rule as religiously as we normally would, it is there and it is a rule that is applicable to the PUP scheme.  I should say that activation supports are available to people if they want to interact with them directly.  In the new year it is likely that we will do something on activation in respect of PUP recipients.</p></speech>

I gave a bit more discretion to the two lead questioners earlier, so I will try and keep things tighter now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#F00400"><p>I would like to be associated with the comments of other members of the committee on the work of the staff.  The statistic that has struck me this morning from the two witnesses is that 18 months of work was carried out in two weeks.  That is a tremendous achievement.  The staff working in the Department are an asset.  I would like to express my thanks to them for their work, and also for their responses to the queries we raise.</p> <p>  Mr. Hession said that he was part of the task force on the arts sector.  He has told us that 12,000 people in that sector are currently in receipt of the PUP, which is just over 20% of the CSO figures.  Through his work as a member of this task force, does he have any idea what the other artists and people involved in the arts sector are on at the moment?  Are they struggling?  Are there issues with PUP that are causing them not to apply for it?  It seems to me that 20% is a very low figure.  At its height it was only 25%, which is low considering the emails we have received from people in the arts sector about the issues and concerns they have.  Has the task force come up with anything else in relation to the inability of artists and others in this sector to apply for the PUP?</p> <p>  I have another question, which I have raised before at this committee.  It concerns those under the age of 18 who are paying tax and PRSI, but do not qualify for the PUP because it is confined to those over 18 years of age.  Are any figures available on the number of 17-year-olds who may have lost their jobs but are not in receipt of the PUP?  Perhaps the witnesses have some figures on that.  It has been raised with me by a number of people that young people who have paid their taxes are not in receipt of the PUP.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the issue of child dependants.  His question was not answered in the last round of questioning, so perhaps it could be answered now.  It is a serious concern for me, particularly in respect of low-income families.  I had a case yesterday which concerned somebody who is in receipt of &euro;203 - the lowest PUP rate - and is trying to survive with two children on this amount.  This person cannot get a child dependant payment.  Is there any other payment for which they can apply to bring up their income level, or anything else they can do?  It does seem that receiving a payment of &euro;203 with two children, and everything that goes along with Christmas, is a very low payment.  Perhaps the witnesses could address that issue.</p> <p>  I share the concerns raised by others on the genuinely seeking work rule.  Has an instruction been given to the staff of the Department's local offices not to enforce this rule?  It is important that this is clarified today, because we do not one member of staff to be telling applicants that it is being enforced because the rule is there, while another member of staff is telling them that it is not being enforced.  There must be one rule for all.  Like other members, I am asking for confirmation that that is the rule.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any comment on how the social insurance fund might affect the State pension age and qualification?  It has been mentioned before in commentaries that the fund will help us to reduce the age of qualification for the State pension.  Will the &euro;5 billion that has been taken out of the fund, as we have heard, be used for PUP payments only, or is it also for other Covid support payments?  The witnesses might clarify that.</p> <p>  Mr. Hession mentioned the 26,000 students in receipt of the PUP.  I have received queries from a number of students on the taxation implications of the PUP for them.  Will there be any such implications for that cohort of people?  Obviously, they are trying to get back to their education and to pay for it, other members of the committee have mentioned.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that issue.</p> <p>  Finally, the witnesses mentioned in their introduction that over 90% of claims for the PUP were received online.  That is a very interesting figure.  As public representatives, many people come to us with queries about making applications for social welfare payments online.  I know there have been difficulties with making online applications for medical cards, in respect of which I have encountered particular difficulties.  Have any lessons been learned with a view to rolling out the online facility to other payments?  Like other committee members, I have had queries about the actual application form being much easier to complete.  However, I am most interested in the fact that over 90% of claims were submitted online.  Is that somewhere that the social welfare and social protection authorities are thinking of going in the future?</p></speech>

He referred to someone who has two child dependants and is receiving just &euro;203.  It would probably be better for the person in question to apply for jobseeker's allowance directly and to claim for the children through this allowance.  As PUP is a flat-rate benefit, with one rate per individual, there is no rate for dependants.  I suggest that the Senator contacts me with the details of that person, and we will send out the proper application forms for jobseeker's allowance.  The person in question could possibly claim for the children, and maybe for a spouse or partner.  There are other payments to which he or she could be entitled.</p> <p>  The genuinely seeking work rule is there.  I am sorry that I caused confusion in my first answer in respect of how the rule applies to PUP.  We are not actually pushing it at this point in time because of the actual climate.  We are not forcing people who are temporarily out of work towards the genuinely seeking work rule right now.  The committee should recognise that the Department is really stretched in supporting the PUP.  We have staff all over the organisation who are backing up that particular scheme, and are working on it along with their other tasks to ensure it is paid promptly every week to all recipients.  There is not the facility to implement the genuinely seeking work rule effectively, efficiently or thoroughly at this point, for numerous reasons.  First, the climate is such that it may not be appropriate.  Second, the resources required to implement it limit how much action we can take on it at this time.  Nonetheless, the rule exists.</p><p>It is similar to a jobseeker's scheme.  Just to be clear on that, a jobseeker's scheme has a genuinely seeking work, GSW, requirement to it.</p><p> As for the 90% online applications for PUP, PUP has been very successful online.  I overlooked a question that the previous Deputy asked about why one had to send an email to get the form.  We started out initially with a form for PUP in mid-March of this year - at this point, it seems like last year - and within three weeks we had an online application process in place.  The take-up of that was substantial from day one to the point that in the resurgence in the past number of weeks, we primarily took away the paper application and encouraged people to go online.  The paper application was available but the percentage of people who used it, as the committee can see, is very low.</p><p> We are working in the Department on putting all our schemes online.  It takes a bit of time to get through them all because we have over 80 schemes in the organisation but this year we have made considerable progress in our presence online and the availability to our customers of online services.  We will continue with that.  It is part of our objective.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for his kind remarks about the work of the Department, and also Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who made kind remarks.</p> <p>  On the task force on arts and culture, Senator Wall asked if the figure was surprisingly low given the size of the sector.  There has been work done by the Arts Council.  They had a report done by EY which pointed to a higher incidence in terms of the effect.  There is probably a number of factors at play.  First of all, the &euro;55,000 includes sport and recreation.  They are categorised together in terms of nomenclature of economic activities, NACE, codes.  Second, approximately half of the arts and culture sector are part time.  Some people are part-time workers and they will have either other work or other responsibilities.  Musicians, for example, typically will have sources of income other than performance or recording, most obviously teaching.  They will teach guitar or piano.  There may be some people whose arts income is not the majority share of their income in terms of what they earn from year to year even though they would consider it their primary role.  In those cases, it is perhaps that they are classified under education.  It means a bit of a deeper dive there.  The task force was only in place for six weeks and there was not really an opportunity to dig into the deep statistical context for that.  However, that is one possible explanation.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the State pension.  In the budget, the full-year cost of retaining the current pension is &euro;453 million and the cost for next year is &euro;221 million.  Clearly, that is significant expenditure which will impact on the Social Insurance Fund, SIF.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about students and their tax status.  It is not a matter for our Department.  We do not have a deciding influence in terms of the tax treatment of the PUP payment.  The issue was raised in the context of the Finance Bill and the amendments that were made to the Finance Act 2018 about the tax treatment and the Revenue Commissioners.  That will apply, I would expect, to students in the same way that it will apply to other PUP recipients.</p> <p>  Between the two of us, I hope we have covered the questions.  Obviously, we would be happy to take more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#G00400"><p>It is amazing what people can do when they are under pressure.  I compliment the Department of Social Protection on the number of people who were given some kind of respite in the pandemic because it was quite a shocking occurrence.  The pandemic hit us overnight.  Nobody saw it coming at the level it did.  The Department did amazing work and kept many people sane and above water.  I thank the Department for all its efforts.</p> <p>  With regards to the student payments, it has been amazing for the students who usually have part-time work to be able to get the PUP.  That made a phenomenal difference to them.  It was really important for them to be independent of their parents.  Maybe they were independent of their parents anyway but they stood on their own two feet and they have worked.  It was amazing the Department did that.  I was curious about whether they will be eligible for the Christmas bonus because they will be dying to know that.</p> <p>  The second question I wanted to ask was about the arts and culture.  I would like clarity around the &euro;480.  Is it that they can earn up to &euro;480 sporadically and still be eligible for the PUP?  </p> <p>  Another issue that came to my notice from different people in my county who would have worked in different sectors, especially in the tourism sector, who were over 66 and who have always worked is that they were not eligible for the PUP payment.  That is shocking because those people have been working probably 50 years.  I felt so bad when they were approaching me saying that they have worked all their life and now they have nothing and the Department will not give them anything just because they are a bit older.  I would like to hear a response to that.  That is something we must look at in the long term.  How we treat our older people in this country needs to be looked at, especially with regards to the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>  Seasonal staff missed out on the PUP.  In my county, we have a considerable tourism industry and there were people who missed out only by a matter of days.  As the part-time employment contracts that they have had for 30 or 40 years in the Cliffs of Moher or wherever did not start this year, they missed out by a couple of days.  They were not eligible.  I do not know whether that has been rectified or what the Department has done about that.  There is a significant number of people employed in the tourism industry and it would be seasonal work.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned mortgages.  This is probably not for this Department.  The &euro;350 will keep people above water but, as the Deputy said, for those with big mortgages, often half people's wages are going on their mortgage, sadly.  It is disgraceful.  I was wondering if there is any mortgage relief.  Is that a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or where does one find information about that?</p> <p>  On the PUP tax, if people have to pay it back, whether they are students or otherwise, if Ms Leonard and Mr. Hession are saying it is not a matter for their Department, which Department do I go to to find out that?</p> <p>  Overall, I thank the Department.  It has done brilliantly.</p></speech>

They are very much appreciated.</p> <p>  The Senator asked whether students would get the Christmas bonus.  As Ms Leonard has outlined, the qualifying conditions are not based on whether one is a student or not.  It is about whether one has the 17 weeks combined and whether one is on PUP for the relevant weeks.  If they meet those conditions they will get it.  The fact that they are students is not a complicating factor.</p> <p>  The &euro;480 applies to any self-employed person.  It is not limited to the arts sector.  It effectively works over a rolling four-week period.  We look back over the past four weeks to see if a person has stayed under the &euro;480 limit.  The language around the sporadic nature was, if you like, a formulation to describe a rule that ultimately has been replaced by a strict &euro;480 rule.  Therefore, if one earned &euro;480 or less over the past four weeks, one is all right.</p> <p>  On the 66-year-olds, we recognise this is an issue that has been of concern to Senators and Deputies.  It has been raised throughout this process.  The PUP is intended as a working-age scheme and it has those limits.  Apologies, as I did not come back to Senator Wall on the 17-year-old issue.  The age range that applies for working-age payments is 18 up until pension age.  If one is above 66 and receiving the State pension, one can keep all one's employment income.  It is just that slightly different rules apply when people go past 66.  They get other payments that are there to support them and the two-person rate for a person on the State pension is a good bit above the payment rate of a two-person jobseeker payment.  That is not to diminish the concern.  We understand that but PUP is a working-age payment and the age range that applies reflects that.</p> <p>  On the seasonal worker issue, when PUP was first introduced that came up as an issue.  PUP applies to people who were in work on 13 March or thereabouts and who lost that employment suddenly because of the pandemic.  It was not really designed to deal with a situation for people who were not in work at that time but typically had a pattern of seasonal employment.  They may have worked during the summer, for example, in the tourist period.  There are other jobseeker supports that are available for those people.</p><p>I expect that people in that seasonal position, who might have gone back during the summer and now find themselves out of work, would be eligible for PUP.  That issue has somewhat timed out.<br/><br/>We formerly had a mortgage interest supplement but it was discontinued in 2014 or thereabouts.  It is not a support we provide as a Department.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v<b></b>raised this earlier.  There have been a number of measures and I know that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been keen to ensure there were statutory protections for people and engagement from financial institutions to try to ensure that the pandemic would not create unnecessary difficulty for people.<br/><br/>On the Senator's question about which Department is the lead on the taxation of the PUP, it is a matter for the Department of Finance in policy terms and the Revenue Commissioners.<br/><br/>I might ask my colleague, Teresa Leonard, whether there is anything I have missed or that she would like to add.</p></speech>

I will add that quite a number of job supports are available to people, so if people miss out on different things, there are a range of job support initiatives for people both on PUP and on jobseeker's allowance.  I will not go into them now but if the Senator wants to know about them, a list is available.</p></speech>

On a personal basis, having dealt with the staff through my office, I can pay them only the highest compliments.  Certainly, nothing has been complicated and every effort has been made to help people in our constituencies.  Like other members, I really appreciate that.  Many of the questions I had intended to ask have been asked by the Chairman, Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Kerrane and others.</p> <p>  Our guests might clarify how many people have to be paid arrears.  They said the issue should be sorted out in the next couple of weeks but how many people are there?  I understand that the Department might have more investigating to do.  As Christmas approaches, if there are people on the longer term list who really want the money, can we do anything for them or make a case for them?  The investigations might not be fully carried out, but close to Christmas, people need that money more than at any other time of the year.</p> <p>  I join the Chairman and others in their remarks about the entertainment business, a business I know a little about.  I greatly appreciate the effort the Department has made in that regard but people in the industry have concerns about taxation.  While I accept what Mr. Hession said about it not being an issue for their Department and it being an issue for the Department of Finance and Revenue, they might make a note of it.  The continuation of PUP will be very important for these people.  I think we all accept that with regard to the recovery, vaccinations and so on, the entertainment industry will be at the end of line in terms of getting back into business.  Many of them face very serious financial challenges.  It is not only about putting bread on the table.  Engineers in that business who travel throughout the country when working at gigs have to have vehicles that are up to speed and roadworthy.  All of them are paying substantial fees on such vehicles.  They have hidden costs that people do not see.  I am very concerned about that.</p> <p>  It was welcome to hear what our guests said about the Christmas bonus, but will they clarify how much they estimate it to cost in total?</p></speech>

I cannot tell the Senator the exact number of people who are eligible for an arrears payment but the figure is somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000.  He asked about people whose payments are being kept aside.  In the case of most of the ones we cannot pay, they lack information, that is, the information available to us does not allow us to consider whether they are entitled to a payment.  There is a small number we will do manually because of particular circumstances, and we will act on them as quickly as we can to get them paid.  I appreciate that Christmas is coming, and our intention is that the vast majority will be paid on Tuesday next.</p> <p>  I might pass to R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession while I locate the figure for the cost of the Christmas bonus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#H00500"><p>I appreciate the Senator's remarks about the work of the Department.  He mentioned the costs faced by people in the arts and culture sector.  One measure that has been introduced during the pandemic period is an enterprise support grant of &euro;1,000.  If somebody is coming off the PUP and works in the entertainment sector, perhaps as a self-employed musician, and if that person needs assistance with costs to get business going again, there is a once-off grant of &euro;1,000, which covers vehicle expenses.  That may be of interest to those the Senator has spoken to, and I am certainly happy to send him on the details of that.  We provided for about &euro;12 million for the grant for this year and the recent budget extended that into next year.  Thus far, about 7,000 people have applied, at a cost of about &euro;6.5 million.  People are using it and it is helping those in a self-employed position, including in the arts and culture sector, to get back to work and recover some of those costs.</p></speech>

I have found, however, as I am sure many Deputies and Senators have, that people have contacted us wanting to apply for the PUP but could not do so online, whether because of a lack of broadband or because they just could not do it, which is fair enough.  We would print the document and send it to them.  While there may be a very low take-up, I do not understand why the form is no longer available to print for people who might need to use it.  I do not see it as an issue and it should be available online for people if they need the paper application as opposed to having to email.</p> <p>  On the issue of people genuinely seeking work, our guests mentioned the job activation schemes and how the Department might consider that in the new year.  Is there a specific plan?  I do not see the Department will work out, where sectors have been closed or have not fully opened, who is genuinely seeking work and who should be moved on to activation.  We will need to be really careful about how we consider that in the new year if it is not being pushed as much now.  I do not see the rationale for it to be there at all.</p> <p>  On the take-up of courses and returning to education, there should be full flexibility for all courses.  As an example, I was contacted by someone on a jobseeker's payment.  This person has completed 147 of the 156 days of the qualifying period needed for those on a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment to qualify for a vocational training and opportunities scheme, VTOS, and they cannot go on it because they have not satisfied the qualifying period.  Someone else contacted me who wanted to do a bus-driving course at an education and training board but cannot do because that person is on the PUP.  I would like to see absolute flexibility for people who want to go back to education.  It should be made as easy as possible.  There are anomalies where people are encountering roadblocks.  I ask that social welfare officers would allow full flexibility when assisting people in coming off jobseeker's allowance or the PUP.</p></speech>

All our offices use them for people who cannot apply online.  Sadly, they cannot come in to us at the moment, so the only way we have to facilitate them in applying for schemes is by printing those forms, and I have printed many.</p><p>I ask that the facility be reinstated on the website.</p></speech>

We should be able to do post them out to people who cannot get into us.  Not everybody has a printer and not everybody can do things online.  At least we can do that much for them.</p> <p>  It is great that people who get seasonal work over Christmas will not have to worry about availing of the PUP up to the end of March.  Does the Department envisage that the PUP will continue for a long time?  What are the hopes in this regard in the context of improvements in the tourism and other sectors?  Is it undecided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#J00300"><p>I concur with my colleagues regarding online forms.  We are all slower when filling out a strange form and we often wonder what information the questions are actually seeking.  I have seen this with people with PhDs and so on.  If a person has filled out a form 50 or 100 times, he or she knows the information the questions are asking for.  Many Deputies and Senators print off a form and start filling it out by going through the questions in such a way that the person for whom the form is being filled will know what is being put on it, or they start filling it our for their constituents on verbal basis.  I often do this in my constituency clinics.  When a form is filled, we send it to the constituent, who signs it and submits it.  The Department gets a better filled form but a Deputy or Senator cannot submit it online for their constituents because he or she cannot authorise it.  I often fill out various forms, such as pensions forms, manually for people.  Since we fill out forms so often, I would hope that we fill them out to a good standard.</p> <p>  One thing I could not understand is that I encountered somebody in the entertainment business who did not have much formal education and who wanted to do a one-year course.  I could have understood the Department's response if it had been a three-year or four-year course because we hope the pandemic will not go on that long, but in this case it became a choice between getting a basic payment of &euro;203 or forgetting about that and going on the course.  The individual could not afford to do the course without the payment.  It seemed to me a pity that if somebody was forced to be at home, he or she could not do a course of up to one year in duration.  I am not making the case for degrees, etc., because they last for three or four years and the pandemic is not expected to last that long.  We do know, however, that in the entertainment business, even if everything is resolved, it will be a slow burn before everything gets back to normal because the one place people will still be reluctant to go will be into a crowd, even if there are vaccines and cures.  I expect restaurants will open up faster than crowded entertainment venues, particularly indoor venues.  I realise it is a policy issue and that there is a policy formulation.  I would be interested in hearing about this.</p> <p>  I still want to discuss the mortgage interest supplement.  We were told the Department of Finance made arrangements with the banks but it was only pushing the can down the road because the mortgages still have to be fully paid.  Would it be possible to go back to the Department and ask whether it could send this committee the rationale, in 2014, for getting rid of two complementary schemes, namely, the rent supplement scheme, which supported the unemployed in paying rent, and the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which traditionally, or for as long as I could remember, helped those with a mortgage who became unemployed?  Perhaps the Department would send us the rationale for why there was a suspension in 2014.  I have dealt with welfare for many years but I could never understand the decision.  It was the strangest decision when it was made because, let us be honest, the crisis from 2008 onwards was largely about mortgages.  I have always believed we would have saved a lot of hardship if the scheme had been continued or had been beefed up.</p> <p>  The famous four-year plan we developed at the end of 2010 strengthened the mortgage interest supplement.  There was not an awful lot in it on this but there was a sentence that referred to strengthening the supplement because it was seen as the best safety net for those with a mortgage.  Something similar has happened now, but in a different way.  The mortgage interest supplement, which used to last for as long as a person was unemployed and ended the minute he or she went back to work, meant that person had no accumulated interest and would not be going cap in hand to the financial institutions, which are not charities.  I just do not understand the rationale for the suspension.  Maybe somebody in the Department could give us the policy reason for it.</p></speech>

Could he comment on the issue?  I have raised it before.  Are there figures concerning those who have paid taxes but who are not entitled to the PUP?

This is something that the committee will be coming back to in the next week as part of its recommendations, so it would be of assistance to us.</p></speech>

The rent supplement system is still operating.  That should be clarified if it was not clear earlier.  Based on my recollection of the context for the removal of the mortgage interest supplement, there were a range of reforms at the time.  We will certainly prepare a note.  Do not hold me to this but my recollection is that it was a decision that came out of the Keane report produced by the Department of Finance at the time which looked at a wide range of issues.  I will certainly be happy to provide a note on that.</p> <p>  I will make one point on education and then ask my colleague, Teresa Leonard, to come in on some of the operational matters.  Generally speaking, we have been trying to support people going back to education as best we can.  In the July stimulus package, we waived the waiting period for people on PUP so they could get the back-to-education allowance.  It is done via the jobseeker's scheme because, as things stand, and Senator Garvey asked about the future of PUP, it is supposed to conclude at the end of March.  It will be open until then, but the current timeline for PUP is the end of March.  Therefore, we cannot put people onto longer schemes or education courses where the payment will not be available after March.  At the same time, as part of the July stimulus, we have said that a person on PUP will not have to wait for the normal period and can go straight into the courses.  If a course is short term, the individual can stay on PUP.  If it is for a longer term, the individual will need to switch to a jobseeker's payment.  I might ask Ms Leonard to come in on the other issues.</p></speech>

Those words are much appreciated because the staff have worked really hard on this scheme.</p> <p>  With regard to the application form, members will know that 90% of people apply online and are comfortable doing so.  We have a very good process in place to supply application forms.  There is an email address and when we are emailed we send out an application form very quickly.  It is in the applicant's interest to apply online because we pay the week somebody applies.  If one applies online on a Monday, one will get a payment the following Tuesday.  The PUP week runs from Friday to Thursday.  We have the payment available the following week unless there is something seriously wrong with the application.  The online service forces people to put in the correct information and fill out the appropriate boxes.  Therefore, we do not have to go back to people for further information.  There is a lower likelihood of getting it wrong.  In the beginning, quite a number of applications were filled out very incorrectly by individuals and the only option available to them was to apply again, which delayed them somewhat.  We are very anxious to pay people as quickly as possible but we have a very good process in place such that there is absolutely no difficulty in getting a form.  We provide it very quickly.  I have two teams that work on it immediately.  The applications are processed on receipt so there is no delay.</p><p>That should be borne in mind.  We will consider putting the facility on our website.  It is a fact that the quality of what people fill out and the actual response that we give them is better, as a consequence of them applying online.  It is in the interest of customers that we have that as much as anything else.</p><p> In terms of activation, and I say this having heard from some of my colleagues, in the first instance it possibly would be to send out information to people in receipt of the PUP on how to start the process and to know what might be available to them.  My colleague, Mr. Hession, has mentioned job supports, the different job incentive schemes, back-to-education scheme, back-to-work scheme, enterprise allowances, enterprise grants and training support grants.  There is quite a range of stuff that would be of interest to some of the people on PUP and that might work in their interest.  That is the starting point for pushing activation.  It would be very useful for people to get the information initially.  Mr. Hession has answered the question about a one-year course so that covers all of the questions.</p></speech>

I ran into trouble with a query because the person's spouse had an income. so the applicant was not entitled to an assistance payment.  The applicant was just &euro;5 or &euro;10 over so would have got a very small assistance payment in any event.  The back-to-education allowance is an allowance.  It is not a payment without a means test and that is where the claim one can transfer comes asunder.  Anyone in receipt of PUP should be allowed to do a one-year course as it would be an opportunity for people to better themselves without a cost to the State.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it might be in people's interest to apply online but I still do not understand why the form cannot be made available.  Not everyone can send an email seeking the form and as some people cannot even work a computer, a hard copy should be an option.</p> <p>  In the case of those who had been in receipt of the PUP previously and who had received it for 17 weeks from March onwards but who are not in receipt of the payment at present, do they qualify for the Christmas bonus? </p></speech>

The PUP is a statutory scheme so it is limited.  Unfortunately, people aged 17, notwithstanding that they were working and paying taxes, will not qualify for PUP.  We have a supplementary welfare allowance available if there is an urgent financial need or if people are in financial difficulty.  I encourage anyone in that position and who is in difficulty to contact our community welfare service.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Leonard to speak to the points about online forms and the Christmas bonus.  I understand the point Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has made about the duration of courses and we note that. </p></speech>

If somebody has 17 weeks but on the week of the bonus he or she is not in payment then he or she will not get a Christmas bonus, which is the same for every other scheme.  The bonus is only paid to people in receipt of the scheme on the bonus week, as defined.  Very simply, if one receives a payment on that particular week, then one gets the bonus.  It is very similar to the carer's support grant, which is paid in June.  If one receives the payment on a particularly Thursday in June then one qualifies for the carer's support grant.  It works based upon one week.  So people have to be on that week irrespective of whether they had it in the past.</p> <p>  All I can say is I will consider putting the form back on the website.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020112500002#K00800"><p>I hear what Ms Leonard said about the form.  These forms are very useful to Members of the Oireachtas.  Even as an interim measure, until we consider the broader issue, perhaps all Department of Social Protection forms could be made available in electronic form in order that they could be put up on the Plinth service, which is our intranet here.  The initiative would ensure that for anyone who contacts the office of a Deputy or Senator, we could print off the form and assist people to fill them out.</p> <p>  I will start by asking Mr. Hession about a cohort of people over the age of 66 who do not have PRSI contributions, are ineligible for a State contributory pension, will not receive a non-contributory pension because it is means tested and some of whom continue to work servicing loans on their businesses.  It is the policy of the Department and the advice from officials to Ministers over the years to increase the age threshold for receipt of the State contributory pension, yet a cohort of people who are over the age of 66, continue to work and are not in receipt of a State pension have been denied any support throughout the pandemic.  They are ineligible for the pandemic unemployment payment.  They are not in receipt of another social welfare payment.  They are ineligible for another social welfare payment.  That cohort must be shown some flexibility when it comes to the pandemic unemployment payment.</p> <p>  In terms of the music industry, Mr. Hession made the point that the &euro;480 threshold is a rolling threshold over a previous four-week period.  This issue needs to be reconsidered.  I ask that there is an average applied to the payment of the pandemic unemployment payment rather than using a four-week period because if some entertainers or artists are commissioned to do work and offered &euro;500 they must, unfortunately, automatically refuse.  Also, they may get payment in two separate calendar months but happen to be within the four-week period so yet again they are discriminated.  The most sensible approach to take is for the &euro;480 average to span the period of their pandemic unemployment payment.  The adoption of this approach would be a far better vehicle to help these people return to full-time employment, which is the primary objective.</p> <p>  I accept what Ms Leonard said about arrears, that it is a complex calculation and that the Department intends to pay the vast majority of people next week, which is welcome.  She said that the Department is going to deal with the other people who must be processed manually over the coming weeks.</p><p>The intention is to have those paid by the end of the year.  First, what sort of numbers are we talking about that will be processed manually?  Second, the witnesses need to be conscious of the fact that if those people are not paid before the end of the calendar year they could end up being taxed inappropriately in 2021 on those arrears because that income comes in in 2021 even though it is to supplement their income for 2020.  They may have a tax credit available to them in 2020 that, hopefully, may not be available to them in 2021 if they get back into full-time employment.  Every effort must be made to ensure that all of those people are paid this year.  I would actively encourage the witnesses to make contact with the Department of Finance to ensure that those people are not discriminated against in respect of the taxation code in 2021 because of that delay in paying their arrears.</p><p> I want to make two other points.  The first is to pick up on Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's point about the mortgage interest supplement.  I know this is not for the witnesses to comment on but I was very surprised that the T&aacute;naiste suggested yesterday that there would be a further lockdown in the new year.  I believe he is throwing in the towel in respect of what we need to do to manage this pandemic.  We need to make every possible effort to ensure that there are no further lockdowns in this State in 2021.  In that context, and in light of his particular comments, does it not make sense considering that the payment guarantee that had been in place with the banks is no longer in place that we would reintroduce mortgage interest supplement, particularly for people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment?  That would make a significant difference to people, particularly to the more than half of those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment who have seen a dramatic fall-off in their basic income.</p><p> In her evidence Ms Leonard made the point that the temporary wage subsidy scheme did not correlate with the pandemic unemployment payment whereas the employment wage subsidy scheme did.  She might elaborate on that.  We are quite happy to take that in written format after the meeting but I want to flesh out those complexities because they are the very issues we want to see addressed as part of this process in which we are currently involved.  I do not know who wants to start.  Ms Leonard is on the screen so I might ask her to start off.</p></speech>

To deal with arrears first, the numbers that may have to be manually done are quite small.  We will do our best to get the process going as quickly as possible but they are extremely complex.  I have to make that point because I do not believe people understand the complexity of going back over the number of payments we have made to pick weeks for which people may not have been paid and that they will be paid something else for the same period.  A proportion of people have not provided us with the information that will allow us to quantify whether they have arrears.  That is one of the issues but there is a small number that we will deal with manually, and we will do our best to deal with them.</p> <p>  As regards the tax liability of that, I take on board the Chairman's awareness of that and what he said in respect of it.</p></speech>

The employer could top that up with income to bring it up to a particular level.  That was part of the temporary wage scheme.  It was paid through an employer for an individual employee and it was attributed to an individual employee.  It was put in place to ensure that employers kept their employees attached to the workplace.  It was to supplement them with paying wages to keep them attached to the workplace.  That was the primary objective of that particular scheme.  As such, they are in employment when they are on it and they are not entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, when they are in employment.  The PUP, by its very definition, is for people who have lost employment due to the pandemic because their work has closed or whatever reason.  It is because they have lost work because of Covid-19.</p> <p>  On the employment wage subsidy scheme, I either misspoke or I misrepresented what I said.  It is an actual supplement to the employer to supplement wages for his or her employees but it is not defined directly to individual employees and, as such, it is not attributed in that manner.  It is claimed by the employer for, say, ten employees who fulfil a certain criteria.  They get the supplement towards the payment for those ten employees but it is not individually placed on them.  It is not compatible with the PUP because the individual is in employment.  The PUP is only paid when someone is out of work, when people have been let go because of the pandemic and their employment has been limited as a result of that.  It is in regard to jobseeker's that there is compatibility between getting the employment wage subsidy scheme and jobseeker's unemployment benefit.  That is in respect of the Aer Lingus workers where their employer may be claiming the employment wage subsidy but they can claim part-time or casual employment with us at the same time.  To be clear, the temporary wage subsidy scheme is not compatible with the PUP, neither is the new employment scheme from 1 September, but it is compatible with jobseeker's and they can be paid to someone who has periods of unemployment along with that particular scheme.</p></speech>

Coming to his first point about people who are aged 66 and over and the PUP, the PUP is a statutory scheme and the Oireachtas has put those age limits on it so we do not have discretion as a Department to offer flexibility on that.  On the substance of the point, however, if a person does not qualify for a contributory pension because of their contribution record and then they do not qualify for the non-contributory pension because of the means test, that is the core feature of our system.  Someone is either getting a contribution based payment or a means tested payment and if they do not pass the means test it is because of their income.  I accept the point the Chairman made that people will have outgoings and demands but in terms of the way social welfare payments are assessed, it is very important that they are either contribution or means test based.  As a fallback we have the supplementary welfare allowance, which I know people have spoken of negatively as something they do not believe they should have to resort to, but it is a safety net for people to make sure that where people are under financial pressure and have difficulty they can apply for that but that, too, is subject to a means test.</p> <p>  On the point about the person in the music industry who might be offered &euro;500 for work, the &euro;480 limit is what one can earn and still get the PUP.  If somebody has a job that is worth &euro;500 they should be back in employment for that week.  Strictly speaking, if we look at the legislation, if one is self-employed and on the PUP one should be available for full-time work.  Somebody doing work worth &euro;500 is unlikely to satisfy that so the best thing for that person to do would be to sign off the PUP for that week.  The averaging will apply over the duration of the period on the PUP.  We are trying to be flexible but at the same time if somebody is consistently earning above the &euro;480 limit they may look at the part-time job incentive, which allows them to work 24 hours and keep a payment of &euro;128.  </p> <p>  I am mindful that when we are talking about these thresholds that they exist across social welfare schemes.</p><p>For example, the disability allowance is &euro;120, increasing to &euro;140 next year.  Jobseeker claims are roughly &euro;20 day.  It is consistent with the overall approach taken.  For somebody who has a pattern of having work every now and again, the best option for him or her is to sign off when he or she is working and to go on to the PUP when he or she is not working, as opposed to trying to squeeze the &euro;500 under the &euro;480 limit.</p><p> I acknowledge the point that is being made.  You are raising a wider point, Chairman, about the pressure people who have mortgages will be under as they go through this, and there were comments about the possibility that mortgage interest supplement could play a role there.  All I will say is that if we hit a point we will come back with a note.  It is not something that has featured in our thinking.  To some extent, a significant portion of the pandemic problem has fallen to our Department and our focus has primarily been on the income support, as opposed to the wider suite of housing measures that has been handled more widely across the Government.  We hear the point and we will produce whatever information we can to help the committee form its own deliberations and to implement its report.  I hope that has answered your questions, Chairman.</p></speech>

I understand exactly where Mr. Hession is coming from with his comment regarding pensioners.  I have teased this out at length with the Minister and her predecessor.  It is difficult to tell older people to go for a supplementary welfare allowance when some of them will still recall the community welfare officer as the relieving officer.  He can imagine that unless they are in a desperate situation those people will not make contact with the community welfare officer under any circumstances.  That is a cultural mindset that exists and the Department needs to be conscious of that in regard to that cohort.  I will leave that with the witnesses.</p> <p>  I thank both witnesses for their very comprehensive contribution this morning, their agreement to come back with further information and their assistance in providing the briefing material to the committee.  It has been very useful to the committee members and will help us in our continued deliberations on the pandemic unemployment payment scheme.  I thank both witnesses for their time today.

This meeting is part of the committee&rsquo;s continuing examination of broadband and phone connectivity and related matters.  The committee is particularly interested in discussing the national broadband plan, regional and rural access to broadband, the roll-out of the Eir&rsquo;s fibre broadband network in Ireland, the handling of customer requests and complaints by Eir, and the difficulties posed by Covid-19.  This discussion also relates to fixed line, mobile and broadband fibre connectivity.  I welcome to today&rsquo;s meeting Ms Carolan Lennon, chief executive of Eir, and Mr. Edward Storey, director of strategy and corporate communications at Eir.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.

Since April of this year, Eir has connected 150,000 new customers to fibre broadband and repaired 200,000 faults.  Eir&rsquo;s team of approximately 1,000 field engineers has worked continuously throughout lockdowns and travel restrictions, following rigorous safety guidelines without losing a single day in the field.  Given the challenging wider circumstances, we are extremely proud of our field force and of their commitment to carrying out their essential roles and of the milestones they have achieved which have so vastly improved the lives of many who, as a result of Covid-19, depend on Eir's essential services.</p> <p>  Eir completed its rural fibre broadband programme during the summer of 2019, delivering fibre to the home, FTTH, to approximately 340,000 rural homes and businesses on time and on budget.  Eir invested &euro;250 million to deliver rural fibre, and as a result of this investment, 40% of rural premises in Ireland entered the pandemic with the opportunity to access high-speed fibre broadband at no cost to the taxpayer.  In recent months we have seen a significant increase in uptake on this network, which means, as a result of our investment, thousands of rural homes and businesses have been able to connect and continue to work and learn from home throughout this crisis.  The pandemic has reinforced to us all how vitally important this connectivity is.</p> <p>  In July, Open Eir reduced the wholesale cost of a standard FTTH connection on this network by &euro;70 and reduced rental charges by a further &euro;5 per month, which has led to increased affordability of these packages for customers.  We know members get representations from their constituents who have homes or businesses close to, but not included in the Eir rural fibre network and many of those people are desperate to be connected.</p><p>I, too, receive those representations and, given the world we find ourselves in today, I sincerely wish we could connect them all.  However, as a private company, we had a budget of &euro;250 million to invest and we developed the programme in a way that connected the most people possible.  We extended the programme from 300,000 to more than 340,000 homes and premises, ensuring we could connect as many as possible, but that programme is now complete.</p><p> Since then, the baton has been handed over to National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and our teams have moved on to our next fibre roll-out programme, which is the build of Ireland's fibre network, IFN.  The IFN programme is bringing the same FTTH gigabit fibre broadband to thousands of households every month in other parts of the country.  We are also supporting NBI fully in delivering the national broadband plan and we are confident that it will deliver fibre broadband to rural homes in the fastest possible way.</p><p> For those households within the national broadband plan, NBP, intervention area that have longer to wait for fibre broadband, we are investing &euro;150 million to upgrade and expand our mobile network, and we continued to do so throughout the pandemic, to maximise the connectivity we can offer to customers.  While not as reliable as fixed broadband, our 4G mobile data coverage enables speeds fast enough for most office-based workers to work remotely, and we have seen data usage increase by 80% over this time last year as more people use this network for high-speed data connectivity.  We have been increasing coverage week by week throughout the pandemic as we push towards our target of outdoor coverage for 99% of the geography of Ireland.</p><p> Following the completion of Eir's rural FTTH programme last year, our networks team immediately turned to the &euro;500 million investment in the IFN urban and suburban FTTH programme.  Once this programme is completed within the next four years, Eir's gigabit FTTH network will extend to 1.8 million homes and business or approximately 75% of the total in Ireland.  The total fibre footprint, including fibre to the cabinet, will be approximately 85%.  In total, Eir has now passed 690,000 premises with FTTH broadband and is currently passing 60,000 premises per quarter, delivering gigabit fibre to enough people in those homes to fill Croke Park every month.</p><p> As is the case with the national broadband plan, Eir's FTTH network is future-proofed and, once completed, will push Ireland towards the top of the international leader board for broadband connectivity, making the country an even more attractive place to live, learn, work or to open a business.  While Ireland competes with other countries for telecoms investment, our shareholders have committed to continuing to invest in the highest quality networks for as long as the regulatory environment ensures a fair return on that investment.  The future regulatory challenge will be to ensure that there is a clear, cohesive policy developed that provides a clear path to allow legacy services to move to those more modern networks for the benefit of all users.</p><p> I will now move on to talk about customer care.  Every business in Ireland has been challenged profoundly by the pandemic.  Eir's challenge has not been in managing our network or keeping customers connected, it has been providing a quality care service to our customers at a time when our retail stores were closed, we moved hundreds of care agents to remote working overnight, we had an effective freeze on new hiring and training because of health regulations, and we saw a 30% increase in call volume versus the same time last year.  The result was longer than acceptable wait times for our customers and I apologise unreservedly for that.  I also welcome the opportunity today to explain why this has happened, what we have done, and what we will do to address these longer wait times, and to give my personal commitment that this is being resolved.</p><p> When I was appointed CEO of Eir in 2018, I was determined to make customer care a point of difference for the company.  Like most large telecoms operators, Eir had long before followed the trend of outsourcing its customer care to specialist operators.  This led to a continued high turnover of staff and customer service that was not up to standard.  Two years ago, we decided to take those jobs back in-house to improve the experience for Eir's customers.  We opened a new multimillion euro care hub in Sligo, creating hundreds of new jobs, and expanded our regional centres in Cork and Limerick, adding additional jobs in both those locations.  Bringing these jobs back in-house was challenging.  It took time, but it did deliver a better experience for our customers by this time last year.  We believe it is the right long-term strategy for Eir and for our customers.  The insourcing programmes across care and other customer-facing roles have brought hundreds of staff directly into long-term, sustainable, pensionable jobs, with good career prospects, in regional locations.</p><p> When the pandemic hit and the lockdown restrictions were put into operation, Eir was first to move all care centre staff to remote working to ensure their own safety.  As a result, we also did not lose a single day of service throughout the pandemic.  This time last year, our care agents, many of them only new to their roles, and used to the on-site support of their colleagues, trainers, IT and team leaders, were delivering call wait times for customers of five minutes or less and handling an average of 40 calls a day.  Today, working from home, they no longer have that on-site support network, and so we have seen increased wait times and a reduction to 30 in the average number of calls handled.  For example, if an agent faces a systems issue today, we have to courier their computer back to our IT team, which means that an issue that could have been resolved in a few minutes pre-Covid could now take a day.</p><p> Working from home can be challenging for care centre staff, most of whom are younger and often working from a shared apartment or a busy home with young children.  Working in a bedroom or at a kitchen table is not the job that our staff signed up for, and we have lost 80 staff between March and July when we were unable to recruit due to lockdown restrictions.  On top of this, during the period that our retail stores were closed, queries that would have been generally managed in-store now have to be managed by our care agents, for example, simple SIM card replacement.  With more people working from home and relying on our service for meetings, home schooling and entertainment, queries have increased dramatically.  This initially led to a 30% increase in calls to our centres versus the same time last year.  From March to July, the restrictions meant we were unable to hire and train new staff to replace leavers and manage the increased demand.  To account for the increase in calls and the lower productivity of working from home, we needed to add 70 new staff and instead we lost agents during the lockdowns.  When all these factors are added up, the result has been unacceptable wait times.</p><p> The protection of jobs throughout this challenging year is an absolute priority for Eir.  Staff in roles that could not continue as usual during lockdown, such as retail, were redeployed to support care.  We introduced a wide range of additional routes to support customers, including online forms for logging faults and requesting refunds.  When we reopened our retail stores, we extended the customer care services we offer in-store and introduced special hours for vulnerable customers, but as members know, footfall in retail is down across all businesses.</p><p> Once restrictions began to lift, we launched a national recruitment drive, and we have been hiring and training staff across Sligo, Limerick and Cork efficiently and while adhering to safety guidelines.  Travel restrictions, social distancing and the requirement for initial on-site technical training limit the pace of hiring.  These are real challenges facing all businesses as restrictions continue for longer than anyone anticipated.  By the end of this month, we will have hired and trained almost 120 new staff.  This is something we are proud of, particularly in light of the economic shock and job losses Covid has brought to Ireland.  Today we continue to hire throughout the country.</p><p> Our average call wait times have decreased as a result of these measures, from an average of 30 minutes during the early stages of the pandemic to less than ten minutes today for our main care line.  There are some variations to those times depending on the service required, but general care is the main point of customer contact.  With new hires starting all the time, we expect the wait times on our main care line to average five minutes before Christmas.  This is still not where we would like it to be, but resolving care wait times has been our number one priority and we have worked hard in an environment where every call centre in the country has longer than acceptable wait times because of Covid-19.</p><p> I do understand the frustrations of members as constituents contact them regarding Eir.  We know the service we provide is essential, and for many, especially the most at risk, their phone and broadband is a lifeline to their loved ones and the outside world.  We have more than 3,200 people working in Eir and every person, from the 1,000 field engineers through to our retail staff and care agents in Sligo, Cork and Limerick, hears these stories from friends, family and neighbours.  We are all disappointed at the service levels we have provided.  We are determined to rectify this and return wait times to acceptable levels and to continue to improve from there.</p><p> Once again, I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address some of these points here today.  I look forward to answering any questions they might have.</p></speech>

The ComReg commissioner, Robert Mourik, said last night on the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" programme, on which Ms Lennon also appeared, that the problems with Eir were "so deep and so problematic" that customers had been "left out in the cold".  He said this is unacceptable.  In fact, he said that the number of complaints were exceptional relative to other providers.  Of the 5,354 complaints to ComReg between July and September, two thirds, or 3,477, were about Eir.  Eir is exceptional when compared with other service providers.  In the fixed-line area, there were approximately 2,900 complaints about Eir compared with a fraction of that for other service providers - 294 about Sky, 319 about Virgin and 74 about Vodafone.  In the mobile area, 955 complaints were about Eir compared with half of that for Vodafone.  I want Ms Lennon to give me her reaction to the comments by the ComReg commissioner, Robert Mourik, on the "Prime Time" programme last night.</p><p>He said two things; he said the level of complaints to ComReg about Eir were unacceptable and furthermore he said customers were left out in the cold.  He added that the level of complaints was exceptional relative to the other providers of mobile, broadband and fixed-line services.  What is your reaction to that, Ms Lennon?</p></speech>

First of all I was surprised, because my director of customer service and I have met Mr. Mourik and one of his team every fortnight since, I think, June to update them on exactly what has been happening, what the issues are and what we have been doing to address them.  In those meetings, he has absolutely specified how important it is that we fix them but certainly I have never heard language like that in all those months of that conversation, so that was a surprise.</p></speech>

Am I surprised at the high level of complaint?  No, because I have been getting them, we have been dealing with them all summer.  The reason Eir gets a lot more complaints than everybody else is because it is our network.  We have almost 1 million customers on that network.</p></speech>

If a repair goes wrong, or a member in here wants access to fibre broadband for a constituent, they generally do not contact the head of Sky or Vodafone, they contact the head of Eir.  We do all the repairs and all the installations, so as a result we are likely to get more complaints.  That is not to excuse it.  I am not saying that the service we offered over the summer was acceptable or even that where we are now is acceptable.  It is not and I absolutely accept that.  However, there is-----</p></speech>

The point I take exception to is you using the excuse that Eir is bigger than everyone else.  Eir has a large number of customers, it has the fixed-line business and it owns the fibre network and whatever.  By definition, therefore, Eir is going to get more complaints as it is a bigger business.</p></speech>

Second, what is Eir doing to remedy that?  When will it be done and how is it doing it?</p> <p>  Moving to broadband, the gap intervention areas are, as you are well familiar, areas where Eir provided fibre broadband and then discontinued.  We had representatives of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, before us this time last week.  They are agreeable to working with Eir to see if it can effectively speed up the connection of these gap intervention areas, where there are customers who are looking over their ditch at their neighbours with broadband, into the Eir fibre network.  Is Eir willing to discuss such an arrangement with National Broadband Ireland to connect these people who have been left out in the cold by Eir?  We have been in touch many times, trying to get the extended connection.  Eir was doing it for a period but certainly over the past year or two that changed.  I put those two questions.  What is Eir doing to remedy the complaints about wait times so people can get access to Eir?  It is a communications company so by definition it should be promoting quick access.  Second, will Eir work with National Broadband Ireland to look to expedite connection of the people in the gap areas, where there is Eir network literally 100 yd. up the road, or less?   Will Eir work with National Broadband Ireland to allow it to connect them to Eir's fibre?</p></speech>

Those are pretty much the dynamics with the wait times.  As I said, we lost up to 80 staff during the pandemic.  They just found it too difficult working from home.  I am not blaming them at all.  I understand completely they signed up to a job in a contact centre surrounded by colleagues and team leaders and suddenly they found themselves-----</p></speech>

The company must have known it was going to be difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carolan Lennon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020112500002#C03800"><p>Of course we knew it was going to be difficult.  When we first moved people home, we did not know if that was going to be for two, three or nine months.  Initially, in April, our productivity levels were actually pretty good, people were relieved to be out of a contact centre environment and there was a novelty factor to working from home.  However, as that progressed, a number of people said it was not for them, so they left.  One could not hire safely and train safely during that time, so that gave us a gap.  Over time we have also seen the number or calls people have been able to handle from their home in a day decrease, and that is in no way a criticism of them.  I understand completely how difficult it must be for them; they do not have tech support, some of them do not have great connectivity where they are and we did not hire them to be working from their homes.  To be fair to them, we hired them to be working from a contact centre.  Of course, we also saw an increase in the number of calls.  What are we doing about it?  On hiring, once the restrictions were lifted we started hiring.  We have hired 120 people.  We are not done yet and we continue to hire.  Six people start on our tech support team this week and we have more people starting on the care desk.  We will continue to hire until we have enough people to manage that.  That is what we are doing.  It is much slower than it used to be.  We hire in teams of five now because that is what we need to do to keep to the 2 m and all of that.  We used to be able to have much bigger teams when we were recruiting in the past.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  The second point is that we are working with the teams in their homes, we are trying to make things easier for them with the technical stuff, we are trying to keep them motivated and we are trying to encourage them.  We are trying to put our arms around them and ensure they do not feel all on their own in dealing with customers who, obviously for good reasons, are not happy with Eir.  They are at the front line of that.  We are absolutely trying to increase that productivity but are doing it in a way that is very conscious of what our staff are putting up with.</p> <p>  The third point is trying to take calls away from the contact centres.  We have briefed everyone in retail on care issues.  All the retail systems have been updated to be able to deal with care queries.  We have introduced hours in retail before 11 a.m. for vulnerable users to try to give people another outlet to ring, and not just the contact centre.  Unfortunately, not just in our business but across lots of businesses, with the current restrictions retail footprint is down so we are not getting many people going into our stores at the moment.  We have also put many of the key activities, like getting a refund and reporting a fault, online so customers can use an online form.</p></speech>

You said we discontinued.  We did not discontinue.</p><p>We signed a contract with the then Minister to do 300,000 rural homes.  We actually did 340,000.  When we finished that project, there was a tender and NBI won the tender.  It is now NBI's role to do that intervention.  I get emails from Members and customers about this every day but we have finished our roll-out in rural Ireland.  We are supporting NBI by getting our duct and pole infrastructure ready for it.  We will continue to do that, but we are now building a national network across the rest of the country and that is where our network teams have gone.  It is now NBI's role to take this up and fill those gaps.</p></speech>

That is another ten or twenty houses, and suddenly we are not doing 340,000 houses but 400,000, which is an intervention that NBI is getting a good Government subsidy to do.</p></speech>

To follow up on the Chairman's point, the difficulty many people have is that they see fibre from Eir on a pole 30 m from the entrance to their homes and they cannot understand clearly why Eir is not in a position to provide a service to them.  We are not asking it to go a mile or three miles up the road.  We are asking it to review where its service terminates and to look within close proximity to that to see if it can do any extension.  We all understand that NBI now has a contract but we would like Eir to consider that.</p> <p>  I will move on to the customer care issue because there is no doubt that people are concerned about their inability to report faults to Eir and get an adequate response.  Ms Lennon said that Eir has had 200,000 faults since April.  That seems a very high number.  She has given an explanation for that but could it be argued that there has been a lack of investment in infrastructure over recent years?  Is there a plan to make a greater investment there?</p> <p>  I ask Ms Lennon to address the issue of staffing.  When I read her statement last night, I was shocked to hear that 80 people gave up their jobs between March and July.  It seems bizarre that, when so many others were losing jobs, people would give up their jobs and the opportunity to work from home, albeit in a more difficult environment.  I would like Ms Lennon to drill down into that a bit.  How many staff does Eir have overall in that area?</p></speech>

Our salaries are between &euro;21,000 and &euro;23,000, plus bonuses.  We are the only contact centre in Ireland, of which I am aware, that pays sick pay and maternity and paternity benefit.  These jobs are designed to attract people and keep them.</p></speech>

I assume it did not intervene.  Did it offer any incentive to keep people on during the pandemic?  Did it offer any increases in pay or any additional supports?  I would think that 80 people, or 16% of Eir's customer care staff, throwing in the towel in the middle of a pandemic would have generated a response from someone at management level, saying they have a very serious problem.  What was the response?</p></speech>

People, usually from Sligo, join when they are young and they have not worked in a contact centre before.  They probably came from a retail store or hospitality.

If Eir pitches what it is offering to such a low level, it will get people who are less skilled and less committed to the company.  I would argue that if Ms Lennon is serious about doing what she is talking about and putting in place permanent, pensionable jobs, Eir is going to have to pay more.  Quite frankly, there is a direct correlation between what I pay in purchasing Eir's services and the care I get.  If I am paying what I consider to be a decent amount of money for the service I am getting and, ultimately, I am not getting the service, I might argue, with some justification, that Eir is penny-pinching on the back end in terms of its customer care.  The evidence is there in Ms Lennon's statement that somewhere between 15% and 18% of Eir's customer care staff walked out in the middle of a pandemic.  If that does not raise a flag for Ms Lennon-----</p></speech>

The reality is that the pressure came on during the pandemic, though Eir could not have been able to see around that corner.  I get that completely.  However, it is clear to me that when the pressure came on, the staff were either ill-prepared, ill-trained or not suitable.  I might argue, with some justification, that the reason for that is that Eir is low-balling on the pay side.  It is not getting a quality or level of staff who are prepared to go the extra mile or who are capable of doing the work.  Eir is going to have to look at its pay structure if it is going to get the kind of staff who can deliver the service the public wants.</p></speech>

We probably did make a mistake in choosing Sligo to build from a greenfield site.  There was no history of contact centres in Sligo before we got there, which meant that when we were hiring local staff and people travelling from the environs, many of them came to us from retail or hospitality.  They came in because they wanted to build a career in Eir and many of them are team leaders now.  That was a challenge.  It took us longer to train them and the centre in Sligo only opened last November, which is this time last year, so to be fair to them, they were in their roles a relatively short time when Covid hit and they found themselves at home.</p></speech>

The person in question had moved from the Eir service to a competitor, which was Sky in this case, but continued to be billed through a standing order from their account.  The individual concerned lives independently but has both a physical and an intellectual disability.  A family member became aware that the account was being debited on a monthly basis by two providers.  They had moved to Sky and Eir was still taking the money.  When a family member made contact, when it was noticed after a year, Eir sent a bill to continue the service for additional money and then followed up with a legal letter from a solicitor.  In my business, we lose voters but providers lose customers.  What system does Eir have in place to ensure that, when it loses a customer and that person moves to some other provider, it does not continue to take direct debits from the account concerned?</p><p>Eir would have been paid by its competitor as well for the access to the line and so on.</p></speech>

When a customer leaves Eir, we cease the line and the billing associated with it is also ceased.  If a customer who is in contract leaves, be that on a fixed line or mobile, there is usually a follow-up bill.  It sounds like that cancellation was not properly processed.  If the Senator gives me the details I will follow up on it.  Normally, when a person cancels that all stops.  That is usually what happens.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting the person referenced by Senator Dooley did not do that.  He or she may well have done so but I do not know if he or she did so or not.  If we cease a service, all of that should stop and, as I said, if a customer is in contract there may be an outstanding or final bill but that should be the end of it.</p></speech>

I want to get a sense of the scale of the problem.  The figures from ComReg represent only a fraction of the real problem.

The number of calls was high in the early days of Covid but they were not all complaints.  Some were inquiries regarding appointments and whether Eir was still open and active and others were from people working from home inquiring if they were on the right package, if they needed a bigger broadband bundle or if they could get a faster speed package.</p></speech>

I am interested to know how much of the contact is within the control of Eir, how much is related to services it is expected to deliver, be that breakdown or interruption of service, and how much of it is standard-type queries from people working their way around Eir's service.</p></speech>

We would have seen an increase at the start in the broad categories of whether Eir was still operational, if people could be connected, if they could review their package and so on.  That has come down now and we are back at levels we would expect to be at now.  In the early days, we were getting approximately 260,000.  In the last couple of months, it has reduced to 230,000 calls.  The calls were a combination of people contacting Eir to buy services, at 10%, and people engaging with credit management to pay their bills.  One of big buckets is tech support, which is usually people wanting to report a fault or it can be that they want to report that a service that was great last week is no longer great and they want to know if this is related to their WiFi.  It is for the trouble-shooting tech support team.  Those people are qualified in terms of tech support.  In terms of care, mostly it is a query about a bill, with people saying it is not what they expected it to be.  We get a lot of calls regarding contracts to which people sign up for an initial 12 months on price X and then in month 13 it is price Y, which is a model in telecoms that we are trying to change.  People are in the habit of ringing back and saying they want price X again.</p></speech>

If I am a user and there is an interruption to my service that is a different challenge from straightening out my bill.  In regard to tech support, has something in particular happened in that regard?</p></speech>

We have been under those targets all year.  Senator Dooley mentioned that 200,000 faults is high.  The average time to fix a fault is 1.6 days and the target is two days.  This does not mean that some are not on the edges of that.  The challenge on faults has not been that we have not had staff available to fix faults or that they have been taking too long to fix them, it is people have not been able to get through to report a fault.  That has been our issue.  We have 1,000 engineers who can go out to fix a fault.</p></speech>

There is always an element of turnover in a contact centre.  Our plan is to always have a contingency of staff that can fill in to manage that going forward, particularly because we have to recruit in such small numbers at the moment to ensure we are complying with health and safety guidelines.  At the end of the year, we should have the right number of people.  We need then to make sure that we keep that backfilled if we lose further staff.  We will obviously love to get back into our contact centres but like everybody else we have no idea when that will be possible.</p></speech>

I hear what Ms Lennon says in regard to the recruitment embargo but I do not understand it.  I think it is self-imposed between March and July.  I do not know why Eir could not and did not recruit during that period.  Eir is deemed an essential service.  Other industries have had to live with Covid, some of them far more challenging and complex industries than telecommunications.  For example, if we had the CEO of a hospital group here today, whose staff profile would not be that different from that of Eir in terms of working from home, staff losses and having to deliver services, he or she could not just say that the phone rings out and takes an extra half hour to answer.  I do not accept that as an excuse.  I think the type of customer service that is being provided by Eir, which is a hugely profitable company, is inexcusable.</p> <p>  That said, Ms Lennon has come here today and offered an apology and a promise that things will get better.  I put it to her that Eir is hugely profitable.  What does it propose to do for its loyal customers to make up for the poor service, frustration and anger they have been forced to endure because of poor customer service?   We are in the run-up to Christmas.  What is Eir going to do to reward those customers who have stuck with it in this most difficult year when it has, in my opinion, blatantly failed them?</p></speech>

That is what we said we are going to do.  Our company has not provided the level of service we should have provided.  There is no excuse there.  I do have to remind everybody that we did also connect 150,000 customers to the network and we did 200,000 repairs.  We continued to build out a 4G and 5G network during the pandemic.  We also continued to roll out fibre during the pandemic.  My team did that.  We talk about this in numbers such as 300,000 and so on.  The reality is that within those numbers there are 27,000 farms, 800,000 individuals, 47,000 businesses, 300 business parks and 1,000 schools.  Because of our investment and the work of my team everybody was able to get access to high-speed fibre broadband to stay connected during the pandemic.  I am not in any way trying to justify the level of service that we have offered but to suggest nothing is going right is not correct.  We will fix service.  That is why I am here.</p></speech>

I suggest to Ms Lennon that Eir, which is a hugely profitable company, needs to make a gesture of goodwill to its loyal customers.  I ask the witnesses to consider these options.  For example, it could offer a month's waiver for pensioners who are service-users of Eir.</p><p>That is the type of initiative Eir should be taking to show the people that it understands the frustration through which it has put them.  The company is in a position to do so and it would be a better gesture of acknowledgement than saying that this is what we have had to live with it but that it will be better in the future.  Eir needs to put its money where its mouth is.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-25a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1609" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020112500002#F02200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presence here today.  Eir has a serious problem which has to be addressed.  It has a problem with its customers, with its image and with its service and, if it does not move to correct these problems, it will do serious damage to the long-term future of the company.  The only thing saving it at the moment is that its customers are effectively hostages to fortune.  They are with the company and are signed up to it and have no avenue out.  If they had, people would be deserting the company on a great scale.</p> <p>  Ms Lennon was appointed CEO in 2018.  One of the major initiatives she identified was customer care.  She said she wanted to ensure that she made a difference in respect of the company's customer care.  She made a decision to move from outsourced and subcontracted customer care services to in-house customer care.  I will not dispute whether it was the correct decision or not, but it is obvious to me and to all of us here that she did not think this decision through, that she did not understand the extent of the service Eir needed to provide and that she did not gear up for it.  The proof of that can be seen in the opening statement where it says: "Once restrictions began to lift we launched a national recruitment drive and we have been hiring and training [...] while adhering to safety guidelines."  This in itself tells me that the company never had enough staff in the in-house service to deal with the level of problems it faced.  It is effectively reacting now rather than having had services prepared, designed and rolled out when they were needed.  </p> <p>  All of us, as public representatives, are inundated with calls.  I can only imagine what Ms Lennon's people are dealing with on the telephone.  Out of pure frustration and anger, people become abusive when dealing with issues regarding Eir.  The main reason for this is that they feel they are not getting a reaction.  My impression is that there is massive incompetence in the customer care programme, which seems to be in an absolute shambles.  Eir's customer care was bad when it was outsourced but, since being brought in house, it has gone from bad to worse.  Does Ms Lennon consider the initiative she took to have been ill-thought-out and that preparation was lacking?  Does she believe that, effectively, it has been a failure and that she needs to do something to correct it?</p> <p>  I acknowledge the point Ms Lennon made about making financial concessions.  Connection fees were lowered to make them more affordable.  It is not really a matter of affordability, however.  It is about accessibility, maintenance and customer care.  Those are the issues.  People will gladly continue to pay what they are paying if they get a proper service.  It is about a proper service.</p> <p>  What is Eir's relationship to National Broadband Ireland, NBI?  In 2018, Eir put fibre broadband cables into Terryglass.  I mentioned this to NBI when it was last before the committee.  It is a beautiful village and tourist destination with a strong local economy.  At the end of 2018, Eir's broadband infrastructure was 90% complete and the village was due to be fully connected in March 2019.  In November 2019, the new national broadband plan was announced and Eir effectively walked away from the area.  It never completed the works in Terryglass, even though they were 90% complete.  Terryglass has now moved from a blue designation on the map on which Eir had indicated its plans to deliver services into the amber designation under the new plan.  Terryglass will now have to wait to get broadband through the national broadband plan and NBI.  Why would Eir, a very strong company, walk away from Terryglass and not complete these works?  To the locals it looks like a reactionary commercial sulk as a result of NBI getting the new contract.  Eir left the people of Terryglass without a service.  It turned its back on them.  Can Eir return to Terryglass and consider providing a service?</p> <p>  I know of multiple examples of the kind of gap the Chairman mentioned earlier.  I live in the townland of Cormackstown, near Holycross.  There is a gap area in the locality.  There are 30 houses in this gap area, all of which seek connection to the service.  Eir's fibre-optic cables run by both sides of this group of 30 houses.  It would take very little to connect them to it but, again, Eir has refused point-blank to fill that gap.  I do not understand the logic of that decision.  Surely a company with a reputable reputation which is concerned with customer relations should be more considerate of people who do not have a service.  Among the owners of those 30 houses in Cormackstown are farmers, people who work from home and business owners.  They need a connection.  I have been on to Eir's operations people on numerous occasions and I just get a stubborn point-blank refusal to join up these areas in the middle which have missed out.</p></speech>

We certainly made some mistakes, there is no doubt about that, and it was certainly a bigger challenge than we anticipated.  The Deputy is right about that.  It took longer for us to set it up than we expected, particularly the greenfield operation in Sligo.  We will put our hands up in that regard without a doubt.  Do I still believe having customer care in-house and outside of Dublin is the right strategy?  I absolutely do.  We did not implement the decision as well as we should have, but I still believe it is the right decision.  We now have to get it right and prove that it was the right decision.  We certainly made some mistakes along the way.  We underestimated the effort required to get it up and running.  I agree with the Deputy's points in that regard.  We have to fix it but insourcing customer care at a location outside of Dublin was the right decision.</p><p> I will look specifically at the case of Terryglass.  I do not know that example but I will have a look at it.  In terms of the other examples, this comes back to a point I made earlier.  We identified 300,000 homes, farms and businesses and this was the greatest number of premises we could pass for the budget we have in the timeline we had.  In the end, we added 40,000 more, often on the back of people, including members of the committee, identifying homes that were close and could be connected relatively easily.  We have finished that programme and have moved on to our national build.  Our teams are in the middle of that.  This is NBI's programme now.  This is the whole point of the intervention footprint.  It is up to NBI to fill in those gaps.  When people write to me, we still check whether we missed a property or whether it is within our 300,000 and is easy to connect but the reality is that most of these are clearly in the NBI intervention footprint.</p></speech>

Obviously, NBI is not going to get this for free.  Eir is dealing with NBI in terms of Eir's phone network in any case so why would it not come to a commercial deal to allow NBI to tap into Eir's fibre broadband to deal with these gap areas?</p></speech>

We are pointing out blatant omissions that were made.  I have a business that involves installation and maintenance and I cannot understand how Eir cannot delegate a crew within its organisation.  It is a large organisation with a huge workforce.  It is not as if it must go back and plan, do surveys and carry out preparatory work.  The work has been done.  It is literally cables from one corner of the room to the other corner and these areas in the middle do not have access.  They will be waiting for years for NBI to get to them.  If Eir made a decision to provide resources to do this, it could fill in many of these gaps without any big outlay on its part and would give a service to the people who have been deprived of one and, as a result, have been disadvantaged in their business and social lives and every other aspect of their lives.  When NBI representatives appeared, they said NBI would co-operate with Eir and facilitate whatever wishes Eir had in terms of a programme to fill in these gaps.  Will Ms Lennon give us an assurance that Eir will at least examine the possibility of filling in these black spots?  That is what we are really asking.</p></speech>

In some ways, the witnesses and members on opposite sides of the room have similar jobs.  Members face people at election time, they vote for us and they do not really know how good we are until they need us.  It is the same with Eir.  People sign up to Eir and become its customers but the real litmus test is when something goes wrong with network, their billing or something else and they phone Eir's call centre.  Politicians get in trouble if we drop the ball and miss a constituency issue.  Eir is dealing with that multiplied several times over.  To have ComReg on its back, to be referenced on "Prime Time" and to be here today before an Oireachtas committee, all in the space of one week, is hugely embarrassing for Eir.  This is not personal.  This is about a company - corporate Eir - in front of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications Networks effectively being hauled over hot coals for letting down its customer base in Ireland.  It is embarrassing.  I have only been in the D&aacute;il since February.  This is a first for me.  I have never seen this.  We have dealt with trade unions and airlines as we try to get planes back in the sky and discuss transport networks but here we see a company that has let down its customer base.  Whether someone is in politics and lets down his or her constituents or in telecommunications and lets down customers, it is an unforgivable error that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  In the past 12 months, I had to call Eir out twice on Twitter to get it to respond to me on an essential issue for a constituent.  This is also unforgivable.  I think it took a few days before I realised that I was not talking to Eir but a chatbot on Twitter.  It was not a real person.  The same names featured twice so Eir is either paying two people to run its Twitter account, which I doubt, or it is using chatbots.  Like the Chairman, on some days, I probably waited 30, 40 or 50 minutes.  Recently, I was on a call to Eir on my way to the D&aacute;il, which sometimes sits in the national convention centre.  When Eir eventually answered after about 50 minutes, I was going down the hill into the underground car park, and all members of the committee can relate to this, when the line cut out after Eir's representative answered because I had gone into an underground car park.  I nearly tore out what little hair is left on my head because it was utterly frustrating.  Try dealing with that several times a week.  It is infuriating.  </p> <p>  I also find it incredible that on 26 March, the then Taoiseach declared not just the workers in Eir but all workers in telecommunications to be essential workers who had certain privileges in terms of showing up in the workplace, being able to work and not having their work discontinued.  I find it incredible that this was the same month that Eir lost just under one fifth of its call centre workers and it took it almost until the last few weeks of this year to start to replenish them.  I get emails on Monday morning, and I am sure other Deputies and Senators here can testify to this, from people asking whether there are any jobs and telling me that their husbands or wives have lost their jobs.  I find it incredible that Eir lost 80 employees who have been deemed essential workers and did well-paid work.  The salary may be questionable but that is for these workers and Eir to work out in contract terms.  To have lost 80 workers and to have waited months to replace them, I find incredible.  </p> <p>  I would like to hear more about Eir's customer care service.  I know Ms Lennon referred to Eir's call centres in Ireland and we know where they are located.  Does a call centre still operate outside Ireland?  </p></speech>

That is a simple thing to do.  There should not be many barriers to recruitment.  Many places are conducting online training at the moment.  I had to do so some months ago in a different area so we can all do that.</p> <p>  I understand that in May 2020, Eir sold its mast and tower infrastructure to a US group called Phoenix Tower International for &euro;300 million.  I am confused as to why Eir is still applying in its trading name for telecommunications mast antennae.  I am even more concerned by the proliferation of mobile phone masts.  Before anyone shoots me down, I believe they are good.  Masts are important infrastructure.  I have two mobile phones in my pocket.  I need them because we all depend on mobile phones but a proliferation-----</p></speech>

Proliferation of anything is not good enough.  There are five or six masts in my community.  Eir is not living up to the planning policy of co-location because each set of antennae it fits to a tower is lucrative.</p><p>It is worth &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000 in a calendar year.  Eir is putting up a dozen of these and there are another dozen across the same road junction.  There is proliferation and there comes a time when there is full 4G reception and 5G reception.  No networks are dropping where I am.  Networks are dropping in parts of west Clare where Eir has no masts.  Will Ms Lennon comment on co-location?  Is she following it?  Why is Eir still applying for masts when it is no longer its infrastructure?</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy.  In a country this small, we should all be on as many of the same sites as possible.  That is what has happened in other countries where specialised tower infrastructure companies take on that business and then encourage all the networks to use the same infrastructure.  That makes absolute sense.</p></speech>

We gave the majority of our masts to Phoenix Tower International, which a long time ago was devolved out of Eircom for exactly that purpose of sharing masts.  The vast majority of our masts, therefore, would be shared with other operators.  There are very few that only have an Eir mast on them.  It is possible that some of the newer ones will have an Eir mast working with our partners that, over time, will put more masts on them.  It is, however, certainly not our intention to have masts that only have an Eir antenna on them.</p></speech>

I am in a community with approximately 8,000 people in two square miles.  It is a huge population density.  There are approximately 25 mobile phone masts and there is no problem with the signal.  There is no need for more again.  Eir's network can probably take, perhaps, four times the population it is currently drawing out, and yet it puts in more.  I want the witnesses to say this in the committee.  I want them to spell out how much Eir's masts are making because it is not network driven.</p> <p>  A person in the west of Clare, two or three miles beyond Ennis, is off the radar.  I know many Limerick people enjoy weekends around Kilkee in west Clare.  A person cannot phone home when he or she is back there, although perhaps, he or she can in the town of Kilkee.  There is, however, something acutely wrong.</p> <p>   Eir is putting 25 or 26 masts into certain communities, totally breaching the co-location policy of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and national planning guidelines.  In other communities where there is a crying need for mast antennae, Eir has none.</p></speech>

There is something wrong with that.  I know because I have delved into this quite a lot over the years.  It is lucrative, and this is the bottom line.  It is lucrative because space can be sold.  For example, making a 12 m tower into a 24 m one, which is the application currently in my community, and it is a controversial one, and doubling the height of a tower suddenly makes it possible to sell off perhaps ten or 12 antennae spaces on it, each carrying a fee of perhaps &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000.  It makes huge money for the company in a year, but parts of County Clare have no mobile phone signal and it is like falling off the edge of the Earth.  Eir is not investing there.  As a telecommunications company, the largest in Ireland, in fact, it has an obligation.</p></speech>

I believe it needs to address huge areas arising from today's meeting.  In light of Deputy Lowry and the Chairman's comments regarding the relationship with National Broadband Ireland, I earnestly ask that this relationship be addressed urgently in the context of the customer and the person who requires a service as a private citizen and as a commercial entity.  I urge the witnesses to readdress that relationship.  This must be about people.</p></speech>

In my humble opinion as a customer of Eir, customer service and customer care are absolutely diabolical.  I say that as a customer.  A person dials a number and is asked to please punch in his or her number so Eir can remember for further queries.  It does not happen in my case.  That person then waits an inordinate amount of time.  I have spoken to councillors, one of whom, Mr. Jim Gildea, told me he waited an hour and ten minutes.  In my case, when I do get to speak to a customer agent, they are among the most professional and dedicated people I ever meet, because they must be lambasted by people every day.</p></speech>

In light of what Deputy Lowry said, Eir needs to leave here today, not in a combative mood with us, but to restore its credibility, its customer care and service, and its image, because customer care and image is about service provision: Eir TV not working, calls dropping, and services not being strengthened.</p> <p>  I believe Ms Lennon needs to clarify again and apologise to the people of County Sligo regarding her comments this morning and last night.  I do not believe Sligo is the problem, it is the structure within Eir.  I am told that Abtran is in Sligo and it is working.  I am told other businesses have moved to Sligo with not dissimilar issues to those Ms Lennon raised and addressed this morning in her opening statement.  I make the point to her, and I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on this, that there are several call centres in Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon supported by the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and they have no difficulties.  I ask Ms Lennon to reflect upon her comments regarding Sligo, because from talking to people there, I know they are incensed by the remarks.  I am from Cork, so I am not in Sligo at all.  Ms Lennon might come back to me.  I have one other question.</p></speech>

She might give us an update on the roll-out of 5G, please.  In terms of the broadband gaps that Deputy Lowry mentioned, I live in urban Cork and there are huge deficiencies in terms of broadband connectivity in places like Lehenaghmore, Monkstown and Ballinora.  That is why it is important we see a re-evaluation of the relationship with National Broadband Ireland.

That is part of our plan.  We will continue to push out 5G.  Our big roll-out is as much about upgrading all the 4G equipment because that will get to 99% geographical coverage, which everyone should be benefit from.  Potentially it is a source to work from home with until national broadband arrives everywhere.  </p><p> On the future of telecommunications, there has been a lot of investment in infrastructure in Ireland over the past five years, driven largely by ourselves.  When we finish our national build and NBI has done its rural build, Ireland will be in the top five in Europe in access to fibre.  It is future-proofed because it is fibre directly into homes.  There are services that none of us have thought of today that we will be able to take advantage of with direct fibre cable.</p></speech>

We made a strategic decision to bring care back in-house - it was outsourced before I ever joined Eir, never mind when I became CEO - because we thought it was a better way to deliver a better service for our customers, where the staff work directly for us and we can get them to buy into what we wanted to do for our customers.  We made that decision at the same time we made the decision to move out of Dublin.  Our contact centre in Dublin, which was not managed by us but by an outsourced vendor, had nearly 100% staff turnover every year because there is a lot of choice in Dublin for jobs and people were passing through.  We thought we would never get the quality of agent with the experience they need to deal with all the various issues that we get if they are always changing.</p></speech>

We had venues in Cork and Limerick already so we said we would expand them and put more resources in there, but we also wanted to go somewhere else.  We picked Sligo because we thought it would give us access to a whole new set of resources from Sligo and neighbouring counties, where people might come in and travel.  We got great support from the local council and from IDA Ireland and we picked Sligo.  We also have an Eir exchange building there and some of our field guys work there.  We built a contact centre from scratch in Sligo.  We put all the infrastructure in place, we hired the head of the contact centre and hired all the staff.  We in Eir - me and the team - underestimated the challenge and we also underestimated the impact of our Dublin centre, which was outsourced, getting smaller as people in Dublin went off to get new jobs, and the speed at which we could ramp up in Sligo, so at one stage they were out of sync.  We were losing people in Dublin and we were not hiring them quickly enough in Sligo.</p></speech>

It is important because people are incensed about it.</p> <p>  I have had contacts from councillors from Laois, Cork, Leitrim, Dublin, Tipperary and Kerry just about Eir and customer relationships.  I appeal to Ms Lennon: the staff when one gets through are phenomenal people, they deserve our thanks, but we, as citizens and customers, should not have to wait an hour and ten minutes or have to push 44 buttons and hear all the music for an hour and ten minutes, to get a reply.  I ask her to please respect her staff and her customers.</p> <p>  I concur completely with Deputy O'Rourke.  There needs to be recompense to the customer who has lost service or been discommoded through poor coverage repeatedly.  Eir is not the only company with customer care and service provision issues but I am stunned by Ms Lennon's remark about ComReg that she was surprised, given that they meet every two weeks.  Surely something must have been flagged in advance.  I thank Ms Carolan for being here and for her testimony.</p></speech>

I also have a litany of issues and faults across County Wicklow from Blessington to Arklow to Wicklow town.  There is a sense of frustration, anger, and isolation in many cases.  Other members have referred to it.  We are not going to fix all those issues today but in dealing with other utility companies, they often have a public representatives direct support line or email.  I find Irish Water very good in particular.  Could Eir establish something like that while we are dealing with and getting through the backlog of complaints?</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge Eir's front-line staff, similar to front-line staff in many sectors, who have been working hard through Covid in difficult circumstances, in particular, the call centre staff, the technical support and engineers.  It must be very demoralising for them to hear the company that they are working hard for and doing their best being dragged over the coals through the media.  I acknowledge that the staff that I have dealt with have been working very, very hard.  When we know staff are working hard, we need to examine management, infrastructure and engineering.  I have a number of direct questions.</p> <p>  Are the 340,000 fibre to the home connections fibre to the internal router in the house or is there any element of old copper in the system?</p></speech>

There are 1 million customers on the network at the moment.   It is a legacy network.  Where are the weak points on the network that Ms Lennon would say need investment?  Is it the final 100 m to the home?  Is it the hubs?  Where is it?</p></speech>

There are 340,000 rural connections.  We are overbuilding the fibre to the cabinet network to bring fibre to the home, to do exactly what we did to urban.  An element to those fibre to the cabinet customer are quite far from the exchange.  It goes from the exchange to the cabinet, which is fibre and then the copper brings it into the house.  People will experience difficulties and variations in quality because of the length of that copper line.  Our plan, which we have started, is to overbuild.  We will certainly do 1.4 million homes of the 1.6 million and bring that fibre connection straight in.  We are at 670,000.  When one takes the 340,000 away, we have done about 330,000 of those and are doing approximately 60,000 per quarter at the moment.</p></speech>

Where there is a whole fibre network and one has got rid of the copper, it affects the level of faults reported.  Copper loves lightning, it is not great with water, and so on, whereas fibre is much more resilient and, therefore, there is a much more resilient network with an all-fibre network.</p></speech>

I can come back with a specific number but our field engineers are set up with a front-line manager.  They have very small management teams there.

Is Eir experiencing any difficulty when a fault is notified to the service centre or call centre, with the diagnosis of that fault or with how it is recorded and then sent communicated to those in the field?  Is Eir having any difficulty between the fault report and repair?</p></speech>

Generally - I cannot say every single time because sometimes people miss something - that works very well.  It then goes to the UG and the field guy gets it and he goes out to fix it.  The problem we were having was that elderly customers in particular could not get through to raise their faults.  They are not comfortable with the online forms.  Some people are grand going online but some people are not.  The elderly customers were not necessarily comfortable with online forms.  The delay, therefore, was in getting the fault reported, not in our receiving it and getting it to the field guy to fix.</p></speech>

That brought a challenge, particularly with rural addresses, because we would go to the wrong address.  Once Eircode postcodes came out, we adopted them as a way to be very specific about the houses we go to.  They get updated only every quarter, however, so sometimes a customer gets frustrated because we use the Eircode postcode to match up the address on our network.  If it is not registered, we do not have the match-up and the customer says he or she wants to get connected.

A phone line would stop us having to write to Ms Lennon as often as we do.  I am not sure that is an efficient use of our time, or indeed hers, so that would be great, and I thank Deputy Matthews for bringing it up.</p> <p>  Ms Lennon mentioned that Eir is a private company, and it is, but in the eyes of the people, rightly or wrongly, it is still our flag carrier for telecommunications - telephone, broadband and so on.  It is a bit like Aer Lingus.  People will always look at Eir and Aer Lingus and say, "Those are our companies."  That is a responsibility and it adds to Eir's job but the idea is out there among people, so there are extra demands.  That is just a fact.</p> <p>  We have spoken a lot about the reputational damage but it cannot be overstated.  The Ceann Comhairle broke protocol a couple of weeks ago to refer to Eir from the Chair.  That has never happened before.  Our Ceann Comhairle is fantastic.  I think people on all sides of the House would agree he is straight down the middle, so these are issues.  I have been a Teachta D&aacute;la only since February but I have been working in politics for nine years.  There has always been a reputational issue with Eir.  It has exploded this year but it always was the sick child, so to speak, across not just telecommunications but any kind of company we deal with regularly.</p> <p>  I will move on to the staff who were lost earlier this year because it is quite head-scratching.  To lose a large percentage of one's staff in a place such as Dublin, where even during the pandemic there may have been the odd chance of picking up another job, is different from losing staff in places such as Sligo or other large regional towns, where jobs are not as plentiful, even in good times.  Did Eir do any research as to why those 80 people left?  Were there any exit interviews?</p></speech>

For some of them, it was just their circumstances.  They were sharing and there was no free space to do their work.  Some of them just found it really difficult.  It just was not what they expected life working for Eir in a contact centre to be like.</p></speech>

If that turns out to be genuine, that is, the call is not dropped because the person does not have good connectivity, that goes through our disciplinary process, but such cases represent a tiny proportion of job losses.  I think people found it very challenging and, of course, as our wait times got worse people were cross when they got through to the agents, so I think some of them just said, "No, this is just not for me."  We were incredibly disappointed.  Obviously, we put people through the training and so on.  At the start, when people started working from home, April was a good month connectivity-wise and productivity-wise.  I think there was a novelty and a relief but then it started to settle in.  Nobody thought we would still be working from home in November.  That was an unexpected challenge, and I think people just found it very difficult.</p></speech>

It is a very stressful job.  It was a part-time job for me and I found it stressful.  We have mentioned the wages, which are just above minimum wage, but I commend Eir on insourcing the contact centre.  It is a big job.  I worked at a contact centre that outsourced staff.  To improve upon the wages, and given the profitability of Eir, looking at the wage structure of the contact centre staff, retention must be considered.  I welcome the fact that, as Ms Lennon mentioned, there is maternity and paternity leave and sick pay.  That is not usual in contact centres.</p></speech>

We tend to undervalue contact service workers in this country.  I think a number of Deputies have spoken to the service they get when they reach the end of the phone being good.  If Eir is going to leave a charge on this in terms of insourcing and valuing them, and the company has done work towards that, it should continue to lead and look particularly at wages and supports in dealing with workers who are stressed dealing with an awful lot of negativity.  The witnesses may wish to speak about that.</p> <p>  What is the bonus structure Ms Lennon mentioned for the staff?  Is it based on call quality or unsociable hours?</p></speech>

It is based on the number of calls, a call quality element and an attendance element, so it is based on a number of things.  One of the things Mr. Storey pointed out to me just today is that 50% of our new hires are referred by a friend already working in Eir, so we do get people happy to recommend their friends to work for us.  As I said, though, it is a tough job, and I do value the staff strongly.</p></speech>

It is bigger than we would like it to be and bigger than we think it should be.  We have tried a number of things because, again, such calls clog up the system.  We have an initiative with our contact centres to the effect that we try to get it right and get it done on the first call and the customer leaves happy with his or her problem solved or the thing we have agreed to do done so we do not give them reason for complaint.  We have also done other things.  For example, if the same person has called us, say, twice, before he or she can get to call us again, we try outbound-calling him or her to say: "We know you have been on to us.  There is obviously something wrong or something that did not get fixed the last time.  What is going on?"</p><p>I believed that was a great idea.  What we found was that people do not always take outbound calls, for example, and then we get a call back again.  We are trying to minimise the number of inbound calls in the first place.  The reality, however, is that if we do what we say we are going to do when we receive calls from customers, and if they get through to us promptly, there should be no reason for them to ring back.  Members will have seen the number of ComReg complaints last night.  It is now down to under 100.  It means the majority of problems were not that difficult to fix.  Some are very hard to fix in that planning permission or whatever may be required.  Such cases are in the minority.  Most problems are straightforward enough to fix.  It may involve closing accounts, as Deputy Dooley mentioned.  It is a matter of doing what we say we are going to do, such as changing someone's promotion.  Where it is not being done, maybe it is because people are under great pressure, or another reason, and this gives customers a reason to all us back.  We are all over the question of how to prevent the calls coming in by doing what we say we are going to do.  However, we absolutely must answer the phones, which is really important.</p><p> I got emails and notes from my front-line staff last night.</p></speech>

Care in Eir is my responsibility.  It is my fault that there is an issue; it is not the staff's fault.  They are doing their absolute best in really tough circumstances.  The field staff have been amazing.  They wrote to me at the start and said keeping the networks up and not running out of capacity were a matter of national pride for them.  They have done that.  It is not just question of our network in that the capacity increases on all the Irish networks have generally stood up well.  One can see the investment over the past five years paying off.  The front-line guys, the care guys, hate the negative aspect.  It is justified and I am not pushing back against it.  Many of those concerned wrote to me last night and this morning to thank me for standing up for them in this regard, but we have to fix their problems.  It is not their problem; it is my problem and I have to fix it.</p> <p>  We have an initiative on wellness.  We are very conscious that people are at home on their own and that mental health issues may arise.  We did something last week for International Men's Day with the Happy Pear guys.  We are constantly sending out tips.  We have an employee assistance programme that covers everything from medical supports to financial supports, in addition to counselling, if needed.  We are constantly reminding people that the supports are available.  We are setting up the webinars and we got as much flu vaccine as we could get.  We did all these kinds of things so we are very conscious of looking after our staff.  It is harder to do so at this time because we do not see them physically every day.</p></speech>

There was always an Oireachtas email but it is a matter of a contact number.  There is always an element of failure when going through a Deputy to get matters such as these sorted quickly.  What are the variations in response times associated with the various means by which people can make contact with the company and deal with issues?  What will work better for people?  An earlier speaker mentioned contacting Eir via Twitter, for example.  What works?  I accept there are major difficulties.</p></speech>

It is a good approach if one does not feel the need to talk to us.  The customer gets an email saying we are on to the issue and, therefore, there is no need to worry it has fallen between the cracks or whatever.</p> <p>  We have a complaint number.  It is on our website.  That line's waiting time has been under five minutes consistently.

We will hire as many as we need.  We also want to get back to being able to handle 40 calls per day, if possible.  We are handling 30 now.  We would like people to be able to take more calls.

Generally, there is a low turnover.  The staff work their way up through the ranks and become very technical, or whatever.  Generally there is a low turnover of staff on the team.  Recently we lost a couple of staff because the HSE set up a contact tracing centre in Limerick.  The technical support element is based there.  We have lost a few to that.  It is unusual for us to lose technical support staff but six started this week so we are keeping the number up.  The technical staff do the triage of the issues.</p> <p>  On the field side, we have been running apprenticeship programmes for the past several years.  We have been refreshing the field staff as they have retired, and we are well on top of our fault service level agreements.

I do not want to repeat a number of points that have been made.  Obviously, Eir has been dealing with the time it takes people to make contact.  Issues have also arisen in that people who have passed away have been sent invoices.  I imagine Eir will need to review procedures in that regard.</p> <p>  People can sometimes understand delays given the added logistics and so on but when they are given false information, it is a problem.  In that regard also, Eir needs to review a whole pile of procedures.</p> <p>  I was not going to raise my next point but I will do so now.  It concerns County Louth specifically.  A man was experiencing difficulties with fibre-to-home broadband.  He signed a contract in December.  The KN group, the installation subcontractor, reviewed the property and said a telephone pole would be needed.  The customer agreed.  The subcontractor then said it was on the way but when he checked with Louth County Council, he discovered no application had been made.  He then contacted Eir, which said it was the responsibility of KN.  On contacting Eir, we were given information to the effect that the company is working on the issue.  That is the sort of issue arising.  We need clarity on this.</p></speech>

It is higher in Sligo but I do not have the exact percentage.  I think it is higher in Sligo because, to be fair, it was a new contact centre.  It literally opened in October of last year.  Our Cork and Limerick centres have been there for a long time, with established team leaders, structures and processes.  I can send on the exact percentages but it is higher in Sligo.  That may have been to do with people who, to be fair to them, were new to Eir, contact centres and the role and found themselves in a very difficult situation from March.</p></speech>

The vast majority of telcos outsource their contact centres because it is more cost effective.  We moved out of Dublin because of staff retention.  HCL Technologies was our contractor.  We had staff turnover of nearly 100% in Dublin.  We moved out of Dublin to Sligo and expanded our centres in Limerick and Cork because we wanted to hold on to our staff for longer.  We thought it would be better for them, for us and for our customers.</p></speech>

I also thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee.  I am sure that every Oireachtas Member will want to be here.  We expect there will be seismic change in customer care and customer service from now on.</p> <p>  The impact this has on the productivity of business customers who are waiting weeks and months to have their queries and issues dealt with is completely unacceptable.  That is apart from the health, safety and well-being of other customers because they are dependent on the connectivity.  I welcome that we will have access to a telephone line.  It is ludicrous that Oireachtas Members do not even have a line to get through on.</p><p>I want to ask how many customer care staff Eir had in December last year and how many it has now to deal with the queries.

I commend the staff who try to sort out the issues but people do not really know the extent of the problem because so many cannot get through.  I put it to Ms Lennon that if people want to listen to music for hours and hours, over weeks and months, they will connect to Spotify.  They do not want music from Eir, they want a service.  They want a service that can give them an essential piece of telecommunications infrastructure.  I ask Ms Lennon to go away from here today and to put that in place.  I ask that we would come back immediately after Christmas to see if we have the improvements we have been promised here today.</p></speech>
