The proceedings of Oireachtas committees are now conducted without the requirement for social distancing, with normal capacity in the committee rooms restored.  However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee rooms or online through MS Teams.  All those attending in the committee rooms and their environs should continue to wear masks, continue to sanitise, wash their hands properly and often, avail of sanitisers outside and inside committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Those who have any Covid-19 symptoms, no matter how mild, should not attend the meetings.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022040600002#A00400"><p>The meeting has been convened for the purpose of considering the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022, which was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 9 February 2022.  The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to Directive 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 to empower the competition authorities of member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market, ECN+.  ECN+ is intended to ensure effective and consistent application of EU laws, with close co-operation by its member states.  The Bill is also intended to strengthen the powers of the State in tackling white-collar crime, economic crime and corruption as part of the response to the Hamilton report, "Review of Structures and Strategies to Prevent, Investigate and Penalise Economic Crime and Corruption", which was published by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in December 2020.</p> <p>  I welcome Deputy Troy, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is accompanied by his officials.  There are 171 amendments tabled and groupings will apply to them.  I propose that we try to complete our consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> We will now proceed with our consideration of the Bill.  I call on the Minister of State to deliver his statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022040600002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for facilitating Committee Stage today, as well as for facilitating the time change.  I thank all members for their support for the Bill at pre-legislative scrutiny and on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  As members are all aware, this Bill is long, and it is complex legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to Directive 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018, to empower the competition authorities of the member states to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market.</p> <p>  The ECN+ directive is intended to ensure effective and consistent application of the EU laws with close co-operation by its members.  The ECN+ directive builds on the framework laid down in the EU regulation that sets up the ECN, namely, EU Regulation 1/2003 on the implementation of the rules and competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p> <p>  This Bill will implement one item from the programme for Government when it puts in place a new legal regime that allows the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to use administrative financial sanctions when dealing with infringements of competition law.  The Bill will strengthen the powers of the State in tackling white-collar crime, economic crime and corruption as part of the response to the Hamilton report, which was published by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, in December 2020.</p> <p>  Since the publication of the Bill, some small errors have emerged, as have places where more precision or technical language should be used.  Also, other legislation that currently is being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC, references similar terms.  It is the view of the Office of the Attorney General and of my Department, that standardising language across legislation that deals with the same principles and subject matter is extremely important.</p> <p>  Undertakings are dealing with an increasing number of regulations and legislation.  While this is better for society as a whole, it has never been the intention of my Department to introduce legislation that would needlessly hinder undertakings from operating.  It does not make sense to have different terminology across legislation drafted at the same time, and dealing with many of the same issues, except where a case can be made for its necessity.</p> <p>  As these legislative items that deal with similar matters are at a more nascent stage than this Bill, the need to standardise terms only became apparent in recent weeks.  I believe it is important to deal with these grammatical, technical and clarifying amendments in order that undertakings can better understand the rights and obligations that are being introduced in this legislation.</p> <p>  There are also more substantive amendments being introduced on Committee Stage.  I will give more explanation for the reasons and rationales behind them when we reach them.  </p></speech>

Authorised officers of ComReg have the powers to affix a seal on documents or premises as part of an investigation into potential breaches of competition law under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, while authorised officers of the CCPC have the same powers under the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.</p><p>This amendment corrects an unintentional omission of ComReg from paragraph (b) of the definition by including the Communications Regulation Act 2002.  It thus extends the definition of a breach of a procedural requirement to ComReg.  This will then allow adjudication officers in ComReg, as well as in the CCPC, to impose an administrative financial sanction on the undertaking which has which has breached a procedural requirement.  </p></speech>

Section 35 of the Bill clarifies that the existing section 39(3) of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, covering the powers of authorised officers of ComReg, does not apply to the competition powers being introduced through this Bill.  Instead, two new subsections, (3A) and (3B), are included in section 39, which give the authorised officers of ComReg powers to mirror those of the CCPC when each is acting as a competition authority.</p><p>Because of the clarification in section 35 that section 39(3) of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 does not apply to authorised officers of ComReg in relation to competition matters, that subsection should not be included in the definition of what should be considered a breach of procedural requirements for competition investigation.  The provisions already refer to the new subsection (3B), which is the correct reference for investigations into potential breaches of competition law.  As a result, both amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are to delete section 39 from the definitions of breaking a seal and of giving false or misleading information in relation to what constitutes a breach of procedural requirement.  </p></speech>

These amendments are related and may be discussed together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022040600002#B01600"><p>I move amendment No. 4:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 8, after line 36, to insert the following:  	&ldquo; &lsquo;commercially sensitive information&rsquo; means information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to&mdash; <br /><br />(a) substantially and materially prejudice or harm the commercial, financial or industrial interests of the undertaking or person to which it relates, <br /><br />(b) substantially prejudice or harm any other interests of a person in the conduct of the person&rsquo;s business, profession or occupation, or <br /><br />(c) substantially prejudice or harm the interests of the State or a public body (within the meaning of section 28N(5));&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>This grouping of amendments deals with commercially sensitive information.  Amendment No. 4 introduces a definition for &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo; into the Bill.  It is important that there is legal certainty surrounding the key terms that are used throughout this Bill.  In the drafting of the Bill, which was published in February, it was felt that &quot;commercial confidentiality&quot; as a term was easily understood.  In legislation, terms that are in common use in an industry are understood to take on the meaning that they would have within that industry.  It was a concern that defining the term might be difficult and that if the definition was too narrowly defined, it may unnecessarily restrict the operation of sections of this Bill.  However, after discussing the matter further, the Department is of the view that it is more important that there is certainty for undertakings in how the legislation operates.  Therefore, a definition is now necessary.  </p><p>The definition, as put forward in this amendment, clearly defines the term as it is understood to operate in competition law, that is, information that is disclosed would create substantial and material harm to undertakings.  The intention is that the term &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo; will be used throughout this Bill.  I believe that by including this amendment, we will clarify the legislation and make it easier for undertakings to understand and to navigate the provisions that are laid out in the Bill.  </p><p>The remaining amendments in this group reflect the decision to replace the term &quot;commercial confidentiality&quot; with the term &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;commercially sensitive information&rdquo; is more widely used, particularly in relation to competition law matters.  Therefore, using it would provide greater clarity for undertakings.  This will work to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are clear and are easily understandable.  </p></speech>

They are technical amendments - some deleting a word, some adding a word and some clarifying small typographical mistakes.  These amendments are not policy driven; they are merely tidying up the draft.  Amendment No. 5 changes the words &quot;a competent authority&quot; to &quot;adjudication officer&quot;, because enforcement proceedings are heard by an adjudication officer specifically and not by any other function within a competent authority.</p><p>Amendment No. 27 clarifies that a referral is made to an adjudication officer in line with section 15M.  Amendment No. 31 reflects that &quot;settlement&quot; is the more usual term used in respect of agreements reached with an undertaking in competition matters, and this is changed throughout the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 33 is intended to clarify that when making a referral to an adjudication officer, the competent authority has come to a preliminary opinion on foot of its investigation and reflects that it is only the adjudication officer who will make a decision on the outcome of the investigation.  All of these amendments are aimed at clarifying the meaning of the sections and ensuring that the Bill reaches the high standards that this Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas are committed to upholding.</p></speech>

Section 13 of the Competition Act 2002 lays down rules on the admissibility of evidence.  New rules on the admissibility of evidence are being put in place by means of the new section 15AW for inclusion in the Competition Act 2002.  The new rules are required to fully transpose the ECN+ directive.</p><p>In the interests of removing the potential for any confusion or overlap of the provisions in the future, amendment No. 7 repeals section 13.  Amendment No. 7 also repeals section 14B from the Competition Act 2002.  This section deals with applications to the High Court for orders in relation to certain agreements.  There is provision in the Bill to deal with these agreements, and again in the interests of removing the potential for overlap or confusion, section 14B is being repealed.</p></speech>

In order to reduce the administrative burden on authorised officers conducting investigations into potential infringements of competition law, it was considered that the additional written report provided for in section 15G(2) was unnecessary.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are consequential to that deletion, being a renumbering of the remaining subsection and deletion of subsection (4) which refers to the report in subsection (2).</p></speech>

It is still possible for an undertaking to agree to a sanction but this is now to be done under section 15X with reference to section 15Z.  This was done to reduce the complexity where an undertaking consents to implementing a structural or behavioural remedy.  Adjudication officers will still have the power to impose structural or behavioural remedies where they are necessary and the undertaking does not have to consent to take action without it being imposed.  These will be subject to court approval in the same way as other sanctions, including administrative and financial sanctions imposed by a decision by an adjudication officer or approved by the court.</p></speech>

When reviewing the Bill, we found there was an inconsistency with regard to how time was measured.  Some time limits were quoted in &quot;days&quot; and others in &quot;working days&quot;.  In the interests of clarity and consistency for all parties dealing with this legislation, I feel it would be better to use a uniform measure of time throughout the Bill.  Specifically with regard to the period of time within the appeals on the imposition of a prohibition notice made by the courts, it was agreed to use &ldquo;12 working days&rdquo; as the equivalent to 14 days.

Section 15P, to be included in the Competition Act 2002, sets out the provisions around ensuring the independence of the adjudication officers, including that where a member of a competent authority is appointed to act as an adjudication officer, he or she may not undertake certain other duties while acting as an adjudication officer.  For the sake of clarity and completeness, amendments Nos. 39 and 40 intend that this includes not undertaking such other duties that are required of an authorised officer.</p><p>Amendment No. 41, which is related to this, clarifies under section 15Q that an adjudication officer may not act as an authorised officer with regard to the relevant competition law.  The original wording had, however, unintentionally precluded such an officer from acting as an authorised officer in relation to matters other than competition law.  As section 35 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 covers authorised officers in relation to both competition matters and consumer protection matters, this amendment clarifies that this only relates to competition law matters.</p></speech>

Section 15AF provides that adjudication officers are bound by ministerial regulations when making decisions.</p><p>However, there was no obligation that adjudication officers should have regard to any regulations or guidelines that may be made by the competent authority.  As adjudication officers are acting under the delegated authority of the competent authority, there are some guidelines of the competent authority that the adjudication officers should take into consideration in carrying out that delegated function while still maintaining their independence as an adjudicative function.  One example is guidance, which the CCPC is preparing on foot of stakeholder consultations, on a methodology on how adjudication officers should go about calculating an administrative financial sanction they intend to impose on foot of a decision taken.  In the interests of transparency and giving some legal certainty to undertakings, the use of a common methodology on matters to be considered and how such a calculation should be undertaken by adjudication officers is something that they should be bound to take into account.  However, that methodology would not, in itself, lay down what level of administrative financial sanction should be imposed.  This ensures that adjudication officers remain independent in their duties in that regard.  There are also other guidelines an adjudication officer should have regard to, such as how an oral hearing should be conducted.</p><p> These amendments are intended to clarify that, while remaining independent in their function of considering the results of an investigation and making a decision on whether an infringement of relevant competition law has occurred, adjudication officers should have proper regard to relevant guidelines on how they should conduct their decision-making role.  Amendment No. 88 clarifies the text in section 12(1).  Amendment No. 89 deletes the existing subsection (3), with amendments Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, being consequential renumbering of the remaining subsections.  Amendment No. 93 expands the provision in section 15AG to allow authorised officers, as well as competent authorities, to follow such procedures for the conduct of an investigation as they consider appropriate, subject to the guidelines or other rules that may be in place regarding investigations.  Amendment No. 94 is consequential to the inclusion of authorised officers within this provision.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 100 clarifies how the CCPC and ComReg may co-operate together for the purposes of establishing a leniency programme and then co-ordinate the practicalities of operating such a leniency programme.</p><p>Section 15AP allows competent authorities to create leniency programmes in respect of infringements of competition law that are not cartels.  This will allow an undertaking, when facing investigations or prosecutions relating to a possible infringement of competition law that relates to other matters, such as abuse of dominance, to apply for leniency if it discloses the infringement and voluntarily co-operates with the competent authority&rsquo;s investigation concerning the application of relevant competition law.  Amendment No. 112 clarifies the intention of a leniency programme under this section.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 113 clarifies the language defining a competition authority in another member state.  Amendment No. 114 includes a provision which had been unintentionally omitted in drafting to ensure that competition authorities in Ireland have the power to assist the European Commission conducting an inspection as required by both the ECN+ directive and EU Regulation 1/2003.  Amendment No. 115 deletes a comma.  All these amendments are aimed at clarifying the meaning of the sections and fully transposing the ECN+ directive.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 118 replaces subsection (6) to clarify the wording within it on how a leniency statement or settlement agreement may be shared.  Amendments Nos. 119 and 120 include references back to subsection (6) in later subsections.  Amendment No. 121 amends the shoulder note of section 15AW on &quot;Admissibility of evidence&quot;.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 122 to 129, inclusive, expand the provisions in section 15AW to include all useful aspects of both the repealed section 13, which we have previously discussed, as well as applying the provisions of section 15AW to civil or criminal proceedings alike, and to the administrative sanctions proceedings that are being introduced through the Bill.  Related to these amendments on evidence and in the interests of reducing the administrative burden on the competition authorities and also on undertakings involved in the proceedings, I am making provision in amendment No. 130 for Chapter 3 of the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 to apply to proceedings under the Bill.</p><p>The effect of this amendment will be to make business records which have been used in an investigation to be admissible in such proceedings, without having to confirm such documents through oral testimony by way of exception to the rule against hearsay.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 144 deletes the existing section 15AZ(1)(b) and replaces it with a new subsection that allows for a competent authority to apply to the court on an <i>ex parte</i>basis for confirmation of the administrative sanction on foot of a decision of an adjudication officer, where the undertaking on whom the sanction will be imposed agrees to the application being <i>ex parte</i>.  This is to allow for faster, less costly and less burdensome procedures for the competent authority and the undertaking involved.  The application for confirmation of the decision of the adjudication officer can only be made after the time period for appeal of that decision has expired.</p><p>These amendments are aimed at clarifying the meaning of the sections and fully transposing the ECN+ directive, while ensuring that the Bill is clear and unambiguous. </p></speech>

The CCPC brought to the attention of the Department the fact that there is little guidance in how limitation periods apply in cases of civil enforcement proceedings.  The Statute of Limitations Act 1957 contains a six-year limitation period for actions for breach of statutory duty.  In the absence of any express limitation period under the Competition Act 2002, the general six-year limitation period for actions for breach of statutory duty could be applied by analogy to civil enforcement actions brought by the CCPC.</p><p>To date, the CCPC's practice has been to adopt a six-year time limit for initiating legal proceedings under section 14A of the 2002 Act in order to reduce the risk that any proceedings could be found by a judge to be time-barred.  However, whether civil enforcement actions brought by the CCPC are subject to any statutory limitation period is an issue that has not yet been considered and adjudicated upon by the Irish courts.  Legal proceedings taken by the CCPC could potentially be characterised as a public enforcement action, for which there is no statutory limitation period.</p><p>With respect to the new administrative regime, the CCPC considers that it would be very helpful for the primary legislation to clarify that there is no statutory limitation period for the CCPC to initiate administrative proceedings.  Investigations into potential breaches of competition law are normally complex can take a long time.  For example, the recent investigation into price signalling in the motor insurance sector was started in 2015 and only concluded in 2021.</p><p>It is not intended to allow the CCPC to delay in taking proceedings, where those are necessary, but it is also important the CCPC is afforded sufficient time to undertake its investigations and gather all the evidence necessary for proceedings, and that those proceedings do not then fail due to timing issues.  I consider this to be a useful clarification for the CCPC to enable it to be more effective as it undertakes investigations and enforces competition law in the future in the public interest.</p></speech>

We shall see.  I submitted amendments Nos. 156 and 160 to enable me to converse with the Minister of State on the need for the CCPC to promote the interests of consumers by providing information on price increases in the energy and fuel sector.  This is a topical subject.  The CCPC already undertakes this type of activity in respect of the financial services sector and promotes the interests of customers by providing information concerning financial services.  The CCPC does great work, but what I am interested in hearing the Minister of State comment on is if he thinks that work could be expanded slightly to cover the energy and fuel sector.  In the context of the current energy and fuel crisis, consumers would be open to receiving easily understood and digestible information regarding price increases in the sector.</p><p>Turning to amendment No. 160, during the past 18 months when energy and fuel costs were rising and international experts and analysts were predicting further rises, little by way of information was provided for consumers.  Often, the information consumers get is that the price has gone up, after that has happened.  With that in mind, consideration should be given to tasking the CCPC with undertaking analyses, studies and surveys on energy and fuel cost increases and publishing the information, which will only benefit customers.</p></speech>

I genuinely and fully understand the spirit in which it is being tabled.  We are all at one in this area.  We are all aware of the present volatility in electricity, gas and fuel prices.  In part, this is being driven by geopolitical factors and the war in Ukraine, which we all heard about earlier during President Zelenskyy's address to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  When we hear what the Ukrainian people are dealing with, we are fortunate we are in a position where we have an operating democracy.  While we can disagree, we do it respectfully.</p> <p>  The CCPC has publicly confirmed, and representatives from the organisation have appeared before this committee, that it is assessing a significant number of complaints received concerning fuel prices at the pumps, including in the context of the excise rate cut brought into effect on 10 March 2022.  As part of this process, the CCPC is engaging with the complainants and the industry and will obtain any additional information required.  The CCPC has publicly committed to providing an update on that work in due course.  When I met the chair of the body, I asked him to do that as quickly as possible.  The CCPC is conducting that work under its existing powers and in response to many complaints in the context of unusual market conditions.</p> <p>  The proposed amendment to section 11 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 encompasses several markets, covering electricity, gas and oil.  Several relevant State bodies already have responsibilities for these sectors.  Electricity and gas markets are interlinked in several ways and come within the scope of the sectoral regulator, which is the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  The CRU conducts market monitoring and publishes regular reports on conditions in the electricity and gas markets, including information on average prices, switching and renegotiations and changes in the market shares of suppliers and generators.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications provides data to the European Commission on consumer prices for the weekly oil bulletin, including home heating oil-gas oil, unleaded 95, and diesel and heavy fuel oil.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO&rsquo;s, monthly consumer price index, CPI, includes the component "Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas &amp;amp; Other Fuels" and is another way in which prices in these markets are tracked.  I believe the proposed amendment to section 11 of the 2014 Act is therefore not required as the CCPC&rsquo;s existing functions and powers under that Act are sufficient to permit it to undertake a study or analysis of any market, which may include energy and fuel markets.</p> <p>  I must also consider how the proposed amendment to section 11 of the 2014 Act could seriously impact on the ability of the CCPC to carry out its primary functions.  There is a risk that the proposed amendment could lead to an expectation that the CCPC would become a price monitor or regulator for the energy and fuel sectors.  This would be a significant change to the role of the CCPC and would create difficulties in the ability of the CCPC to deliver coherently on its primary functions.  Therefore, while I thank the Deputy for her proposed amendment, unfortunately, we are unable to accept it.</p></speech>

Representatives from the CCPC attended this committee and I met them separately as well.  It struck me that the volume of correspondence received on this subject indicates there is a view among people that perhaps the CCPC should have a role in this regard.  The work the agency does on financial services does not impinge on its other endeavours.  Between now and Report Stage, I ask the Minister of State to give some more consideration to this proposal.  I do not think it would in any way cross over into other functions, because this type of activity is done already by the CCPC.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to reflect on my suggestion and see if there might be some sort of a role for the CCPC in this regard.  That so many people have contacted the agency shows there is an appetite for the CCPC to have some role in this area.</p></speech>

As the Deputy quite rightly stated, a substantial number of complaints have been submitted to the CCPC.  They were put on the record of the Oireachtas committee and raised in the CCPC's correspondence with me.  The Deputy said she met the representatives of the commission and that they are analysing the complaints.  If the commission feels that complaints are valid, it has the power to explore them further.  I encourage anybody with evidence that substantiates or supports the work of the CCPC to come forward with it.  This Bill will give the CCPC additional powers so that if it finds companies engaging in uncompetitive behaviour, be it in the energy sector, insurance sector or any other, it will have for the first time the capacity to impose administrative sanctions.  A very welcome development in the directive and legislation, which I hope we will enact in the coming weeks, is that there will be a leniency provision.  This will give comfort to somebody in the sector with in-depth knowledge to come forward and assist the CCPC in doing its work.  When somebody in a sector exposes a matter or acts as a whistleblower, we can really get to the bottom of things.  This Bill will be very beneficial to the CCPC.  At present, the CCPC can conduct further analysis if it deems it warranted.</p></speech>

The amendments recognise the new powers that will be conferred on the commission by the passing of this legislation.  These will naturally mean its workload will increase.  The concern in such instances is that unless the money is provided to reflect the increased workload that the commission will be taking on, existing staff will be stretched to the point that it affects the organisation's ability to carry out necessary functions to the best of its ability.  For this reason, I have submitted my amendments.  We need to make sure the organisation is fully resourced and funded to deliver on what we all agree is extremely important work.</p></speech>

My Department and the CCPC recognise that significant adequate additional resources will be required to implement the new legislation.  In the past two budgets alone, the CCPC has received an increase of over 30%.  It currently has 146 staff and intends to increase this to more than 200 by the end of this year.  If the CCPC assessment is that additional funding is required based on the structures required under this Bill, it can submit an increased Estimate bid as part of the budget 2023 negotiations.  This bid is subject to agreement by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment and, if approved, will be incorporated into the overall departmental Estimates package, which will be the subject of negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for budget 2023.  The Deputy's amendments would set an unusual departure from that process whereby past spending would have to be accounted for rather than projected spending.  Accounting for projected spending is the norm.  While I thank the Deputy for the proposal, I am unable to accept these amendments.</p> <p>  If the budgets had been based on past performance in 2017 and 2018, the commission would not have received the additional 30% in budgets 2021 and 2022.  The best way is for the CCPC to come forward in advance of the budgetary process and make a business case for the funding it needs to carry out its work.  Recognising that this Bill was coming and to assist the CCPC in doing the necessary work and restructuring, we have made funding available in the past two years.</p></speech>

He understands what I am saying.  Nothing I propose would preclude an increase in the budget, as he knows.  In giving the CCPC additional responsibilities and powers, we must make sure the resources are in place.  All the powers in the world are no good if they cannot be exercised because of resource constraints, and this would not assist the commission in doing its job and helping consumers.</p></speech>

The CCPC can make a business case as to what is needed to run the service it provides adequately.  We have demonstrated in the past two budgets that we recognise a resource increase is needed.  In the past two budgets, an increase of 20% was given to the CCPC.  Its current staff complement, 146, will increase to 200 by the end of the year.  That is a testament to our recognition of the additional resources needed for the commission to implement what is in the new legislation.  I disagree with the Deputy on the setting of the budgets for the commission.</p></speech>

I get that if certain policy and other decisions are taken in the interest of the performance of the CCPC but, on matters such as funding and resources, I have a concern over what would occur if a Minister deliberately underfunded the organisation to ensure it could not do its job effectively.  There is no suggestion at all that any current Minister has any intention of doing this.  Should a Minister deliberately underfund the organisation to ensure it could not do its job effectively, the chairperson should be allowed to raise that, at the very least, with a committee, particularly where funding and resources are an issue.</p><p>This is more of a belt, braces and baler twine-type approach to insulate the CCPC from something that might happen.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree it would not be okay for any future Minister to defund an organisation as important as the CCPC and for that organisation not to then have the capacity to come before an Oireachtas committee to discuss the policy objectives of the Government. </p></speech>

I will give her a little context for where we are coming from.  The CCPC is a statutory body and the legislation underpinning it gives it statutory functions that give effect to policy.  It has a number of functions under section 10 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, which include the power to make recommendations to the Government on any matter impacting on consumer protection or competition, making recommendations to the Government on proposals for legislative change concerning consumer protection or competition, and submitting to any Minister proposals for amendment of an enactment, or for a new enactment, concerning consumer protection or competition.  Thus for the chair to criticise policy would effectively be to criticise the CCPC&rsquo;s own statutory functions, although I accept the Deputy is not talking about policy but resources.</p> <p>  Advice is given by the CCPC, and frequently sought by the Minister, in examining policy under the remit of the agency.  This is a fundamental tenet of the CCPC as the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, noted during the Oireachtas debate when the CCPC was being established in 2014: "The objective here is not to direct the ... [CCPC] in any area where it has independent freedom of movement and its own statutory remit.&rdquo;  The prohibition on commenting on Government policy serves to protect the CCPC's independence in its enforcement functions.  The CCPC does not consult with the Department in respect of appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment or before the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is part of ensuring the CCPC has full independence in carrying out its statutory duties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2022040600002#K00300"><p>I will raise a scenario, for example, where a Minister deliberately underfunds the CCPC to the extent that it cannot carry out its statutory functions and the chairperson appears in front of the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee and is questioned on it.  If it happens to be Government policy to not direct funds in that way, the CCPC is precluded from commenting on that.  I am not suggesting it is a problem we have now.  As I said, this is something for the future, but to the extent that the CCPC may have the capacity to bring those concerns it could not do so if was considered policy, even though the Committee of Public Accounts or this committee are the very places it should be bringing those concerns.  I am not trying to bounce the Minister of State into accepting the amendment, but does he agree there is some merit in affording that protection?  He talked about the protection that is there and protecting the independence of the CCPC.  That is very important but, equally, it infringes on the CCPC's independence if it cannot come before a committee to talk freely about a matter of Government policy, which in this instance specifically relates to funding and resources.</p></speech>

That safeguard is in place.  If any future Government decided not to adequately resource the CCPC, it would be going against the EU.  The provision the Deputy is proposing to delete is a standard enough provision for statutory bodies, such as the CCPC.  The 2003 legislation establishing Science Foundation Ireland contained a similar provision.  Indeed, the legislation that was before the committee just last year relating to the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, also contained similar provisions.  It is not something new that is being introduced-----</p></speech>

As I outlined in my opening contribution, it is more to protect the independence of where it is coming from.  I accept and share the Deputy's concerns regarding some future government because this Government has proved in the past number of years that we have been resourcing the CCPC and the CEA in recognition of their increased powers and additional responsibilities.  If there is a case where a future government decides not to adequately resource those bodies, it is bound by the EU and a complaint could be made there if such bodies were not adequately resourced.  I do not envisage that happening.</p></speech>

There is a new section for the CCPC and ComReg regarding how requests for information shall be made, and the obligation for a person, an undertaking under investigation or a delegate to respond to that request for information.  However, the existing provision in section 50 makes it an offence to submit false information and sanctions are available to the CCPC if such an offence occurs.</p><p>It was considered that creating an offence for the submission of false or misleading information to a competent authority was important because such information may be considered as part of an investigation or when making a decision which could erroneously lead to a significant administrative financial sanction or other sanctions being imposed on an undertaking.  A competent authority needs to be capable of sanctioning any party which submits false or misleading information to prevent such consequences.  </p><p> There are two separate amendments because the relevant provisions are contained in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, for the CCPC, and the Communications Regulation Act 2002, for ComReg, and not in the Competition Act 2002.</p></speech>

Deputies will recall that during pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill it was made clear that the granting of surveillance powers to the CCPC was for the purposes of investigation of the most serious cartel cases only.  </p><p>Deputies may recall that the general scheme of the Bill contained a head to add interception powers to the toolbox of the CCPC.  On reflection, I would like to defer that particular proposal pending further consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I am informed that the Department of Justice has undertaken a comprehensive review of the State's legislative framework for interception powers.  That framework, as provided for in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, is quite dated and in need of complete overhaul.  The review will, however, be a comprehensive review of the powers necessary to ensure that the bodies are properly equipped in dealing with ever-expanding forms of communication and that there are in place the necessary safeguards and oversight mechanisms to ensure we have a modern interception framework regime in the State.</p><p>I can see merit, particularly in light of this review, in the view that the State and the public would be better served with a single statutory framework dealing with these powers rather than a diffusion of such powers through sector-specific legislation with different approaches to oversight.  That is not to say that these powers will not be available to the CCPC.  I am assured that they will be introduced as part of that comprehensive exercise.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 171 expands the amendments already being made to section 39 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 relating to the powers given to authorised officers of ComReg when it is acting as a competition authority.  There are some additional powers which are available to authorised officers of the CCPC when acting as a competition authority, under section 37 of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, when compared with the existing power of authorised officers of ComReg.  It is important that the powers of authorised officers of both agencies, when acting as a competition authority, are the same to allow them to be fully effective in investigating possible breaches of competition law and also to avoid any potential challenge to an investigation conducted by either competent authority in the courts where their powers may differ.  This amendment for ComReg&rsquo;s authorised officers mirrors the additional powers being given to authorised officers of the CCPC through earlier amendments.  It also mirrors the existing powers of authorised officers of the CCPC under section 37 of the 2014 Act.</p></speech>

Section 12 of the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996 is amended&mdash;  	(a) in subsection (2), by the substitution of &ldquo;this section&rdquo; for &ldquo;subsection (1)&rdquo;, and<br /><br />(b) by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (2): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the Authority shall, subject to the consent of the Minister, have power to charge, receive and recover such fees as it considers appropriate from any person, other than the Minister, in respect of, or connected with, the performance by it of any of its functions, including functions provided for in&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) this Act or regulations made under this Act, or<br /><br />(b) regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972. </blockquote>(4) Any fee charged, received or recovered by the Authority under subsection (1) prior to the commencement of section 43* of the Competition (Amendment) Act 2022 shall be deemed to have been so charged, received or recovered in accordance with this section.<br /><br />(5) The Authority may recover, as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction, any amount due and owing to it by any person under this section.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 175 is an amendment I flagged on Second Stage.  It is a technical amendment to the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996, which governs the operations of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  The proposed amendment will modernise the language in section 12 of the Act that enables NSAI to charge fees for its activities and for the services that it provides.  The proposed amendment will not make any substantive changes to the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act.  It does not seek to alter or increase the level of any of the fees charged &ndash; it is purely to improve and modernise the language of the fee-charging provision, and to align it with similar provisions for other State agencies.</p><p>The revised text in this proposed amendment will update the Act to facilitate NSAI in charging fees across the broad range of its activities, which include, for example, issuing standards, providing certification, CE-marking approval work, and metrology services, including approving measuring instruments.  There is no impact on the Exchequer as a result of this amendment given its purely technical nature.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 176 and 177 are to expand the Long Title of the Bill to take into account the inclusion of clarification both the statute of limitations on enforcement actions taken by the CCPC on competition matters and the aforementioned introduction of an amendment to the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996.</p></speech>

Deputy Conway-Walsh had a view on the definition of a trade union.</p> <p>  I will deal with the student union piece first.  I am supportive of what Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is trying to achieve.  The only reference to a student union in the body of the Bill is in section 16.  The other references to a student union are amendments to the Universities Act, the Technological Universities Act, the Regional Technical Colleges Act and the National College of Art and Design Act.  The amendment, if passed, would not change the definition of students in those Acts.  It is always frustrating when Ministers give technical reasons as to why an amendment does not work, but we need to reflect on how to achieve what the Deputy wishes to achieve.</p> <p>  I fully accept and want to be clear about the fact that student unions are independent bodies.  They are autonomous and established for the purposes of promoting the general interests of and representing students.  We all engage on a regular basis with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and I want to thank it for that engagement, in particular during the Covid pandemic.  I met its representatives and discussed their views on what the Deputy is trying to achieve in the Bill.  I will consider this further between now and Report Stage.  I may accept the Deputy's amendment at that point or introduce an alternative.  I need to flag that there is some legal concern in terms of how we do this correctly and ensure there are no unintended consequences which I know the Deputy does not wish to have.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 6, I also intend to obtain some legal advice on this before Report Stage.  I note that the terminology recognising trade union and staff associations is used in other legislation in the education sector without a definition.  To be truthful, what we have tried to do is replicate what has been done in other legislation in the education sector.  I need to make sure there are no unintended consequences or knock-on effects in terms of definitions and how that transposes across other legislation.  I will consider amendment No. 6 further and may bring forward an amendment on Report Stage.  If the Deputy wishes, she will have an opportunity to further pursue this.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are my attempt to do that.  I note the Deputy's amendments Nos. 14, 16, 17 and 212.</p><p>These amendments address the objects of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, which provide that the HEA shall have regard to certain objects in performing its functions.  I am proposing an amendment to the object set out in section 8(1)(<i>b</i>).  The intent is to strengthen the provision with regard to the Irish language in the Bill.  It is now proposed that this object will read:</p> <blockquote> 	To support designated institutions of higher education in contributing to social, economic, cultural ... and environmental development and sustainability through leadership, innovation and agility; and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such support shall include the promotion and use by those institutions of the Irish language. </blockquote> <p>The HEA is required to have regard to this object in performing its functions.  I acknowledge Conradh na Gaeilge's work in bringing forward this amendment.</p><p>I am also proposing other amendments in the Bill to strengthen the provision in relation to the Irish language, including an amendment to section 9, which we will get to later, regarding the functions of the HEA, and to section 33 with regard to the strategy for tertiary education.  As I said at the previous outing on this legislation, I am proposing ten Committee Stage amendments to strengthen the role and promotion of the Irish language.  As I did at the previous meeting, I again acknowledge the work of Deputy Conway-Walsh on this and, indeed, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, who I see has joined us now and who also corresponds with me on this matter.</p><p>Amendment No. 24, in section 9, which relates to the functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, provides that the HEA shall support &quot;the educational and skills needs of persons in Gaeltacht areas ... and outside of such areas with regard to the promotion and use of the Irish language&rdquo;.  I will flag at this stage that I may even look to further strengthen that.  I intend to engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media further on this between now and Report Stage.</p><p>Similarly, I will mention amendment No. 58 in section 33, which relates to the strategy for tertiary education, now so I do not need to speak to it later.  This provides that the Minister shall have regard to &quot;policies relating to ... the promotion and use of the Irish language&quot; when preparing the strategy for tertiary education.  This will ensure that the promotion and use of the Irish language will form part of the strategy for tertiary education.  This is important.  It is quite significant because the strategy will set the policy direction for further education for training and higher education and research for a period of up to ten years.  My team and I believe that we are achieving the same aims with our amendments Nos. 7 and 8 and the proposed amendments I outlined to sections 9 and 33 as Deputy Conway-Walsh's amendments Nos. 14, 16 and 17.  I am not being argumentative on them.  I think we have potentially landed at the same place between amendments Nos. 7 and 8 in this section and the amendments I am bringing forward in sections 9 and 33.</p><p>Amendment No. 212 proposes to insert &ldquo;to provide for the strengthening of Irish medium higher and tertiary education&rdquo; into the Long Title of the Bill.  I am not proposing to accept this amendment as the Long Title lists the general key provisions for the Bill.  I think this provision is too specific for inclusion in the Long Title.  We believe that the provisions have already been included to strengthen the Irish language.  I am proposing not to accept the Deputy's amendments on the basis that I think we are arriving at the same point between amendments Nos. 7 and 8 and the amendments to sections 9 and 33.</p><p>I thank Deputies and acknowledge the cross-party interest at this committee in arriving at this point.  I will flag formally for the record that I am not finished yet in terms of intending to engage further with colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media who have engaged with my officials in recent days.  I am flagging my intention to potentially bring forward further amendments at Report Stage.</p></speech>

I welcome the news that he will look again at further amendments.  That is good news.  One of the reasons I submitted these amendments along with Deputy Conway-Walsh was to try to get a debate around the additional - it should not be a burden - responsibility on the HEA.  Without sight of those, we will still argue these out and maybe persuade the Minister when he is putting his amendments together to take on board some of the content of the amendments we tabled.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 8, I am not sure about the wording and what is meant by "without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing" in this context.  What could be unfairly prejudiced by a duty to promote the use of Irish?  It is the phrase "without prejudice" I am querying.  It is a good debate and hopefully we will move forward with some of the amendments that myself and others have proposed.  I believe this would be important, even if the Minister mentioned that amendment No. 212 should not be included in the Long Title.  Often, when changes like that are suggested, they are left to one side.  If it is not in the Title, it is seen by those who have a duty to implement the legislation as not having been stated.  We have a job of work to do to make sure that as we amend the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022, nobody can be under any doubt regarding the duty the HEA already has in terms of the promotion of the use of Irish.  It is not that we are proposing an additional duty; we are seeking to restate what is already there but has not been delivered on.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will correct me on this if I am wrong, but my understanding is that "Gaeilge" was mentioned just once, and then only in brackets, in the course of the full Bill as it was published in advance of Second Stage.  I acknowledge that the Minister has been very proactive in engaging with Conradh na Gaeilge, in particular, and has moved some distance to improve that facet of the Bill.  I very much welcome the amendments.</p></speech>

The central word in each of the amendments is &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;.  A matter being discussed by the committee at the moment is the future funding of third-level education.  We all acknowledge that there needs to be improved funding at third level, and while the State does make a very significant contribution to third-level institutions in this country, it is not the exclusive funder of third-level education.  We have a responsibility in paying over money to third-level institutions to make sure that the values of this State are reflected in how the money is spent.  For that reason, there should be an obligation on third-level institutions to provide details of transparency or from whence their other funding is derived so that the State can be happy that the values behind the other funding sources are commensurate with the values of the State.</p><p>Amendment No. 10 is a very simple one.  It proposes that after the word &quot;performance&quot; to insert &quot;improve transparency with regard to private funding streams&quot;.  If I am honest, I would prefer if it had even more teeth than it currently does.  It strikes me as an innocuous enough amendment at the moment.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 100 and 102 are perhaps more detailed.  Amendment No. 100 refers to &quot;including disaggregated data regarding private and public funding sources, and funding streams from entities outside of the designated higher education institutions that operate substantially for the benefit or under the auspices of the institutions, both inside and outside the State&quot;.  The reference to &quot;outside of the State&quot; is important in terms of knowing where the money is coming from.</p><p>Amendment No. 102 refers to &quot;a transparent, ethical framework for selection or acceptance of private funding streams&quot;.  That again is about ensuring that the funding that arrives into third-level institutions that complements the funding given by the State should be commensurate with the values of this State.  In one way or another, these three amendments go towards making those changes within the Bill.</p></speech>

For the record of the committee, I will state the factual position as of now in the legislation.  It is noted that conditions of funding apply when Exchequer funding is provided to a funded body.  As the Deputy has alluded to, there are not conditions relating to private funding sources, but he is arguing for the need for transparency around it, or at least more transparency in that regard.</p> <p>  Having looked at the matter, there are two areas in this Bill that are relevant to trying to achieve some of what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  Section 48 provides that: "A designated institution of higher education" or a funded body shall furnish to the HEA any non-personal data requested by the HEA, "in the format so requested".  This data may include financial data.  What we are doing in this legislation is enabling the HEA to request any data once they are not personal data - we all understand the reason for that - and the ability of the HEA to request it in a certain format, and being very clear that the provision does include financial data being provided to the HEA.  We believe that the enabling ability to do this is already provided for and that there is an ability through this legislation for the provision of data on private funding streams to be sought and secured by the HEA.</p> <p>  I also note the second change.  I am not sure we have discussed enough in regard to this legislation that under section 126 the HEA may "issue guidelines, codes or policies to designated institutions of higher education".  Again, it would be entirely appropriate that a guideline, code or policy could include the issue the Deputy is seeking on private funding streams.</p> <p>  It is important to give my clear view on the matter.  While colleges and universities in the sector have every right to seek private funding - some of that can be very good in terms of relationships and collaboration and we all agree with that - the duty in regard to being more transparent is important.  It is important not just for reasons of transparency but for the reputation of an institution.  I am aware that the joint Oireachtas committee has considered issues concerning human rights, for example, so I am entirely in agreement with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh on the need for transparency.  The idea of ethical frameworks, guidance and codes of practice is entirely where we need to be.  Where I am not necessarily disagreeing, but where I intend to reflect further between now and Report Stage, is whether we need to be more prescriptive in legislation or whether we have achieved what we are seeking to achieve in sections 48 and 126.</p></speech>

The Minister said he will consider the matter between now and Report Stage.  I draw his attention to the fact that the HEA initiated a review of higher education funding in 2017 and it emphasised the inconsistent and incoherent nature of the administration of funding, poor data collection and a lack of overall transparency in funding for higher education institutions, HEI.  Each HEI functions independently in sourcing private income and this makes assessing the full scale and source of the private funds in the sector difficult.  I accept what the Minister has said regarding the sections he cited and I will review the Bill with a view to seeing whether I agree with how much teeth they have.  Based on what the Minister said, I am happy to withdraw the amendment at this point.</p></speech>

I do not think they are controversial and I will take the Deputies through them.  Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment to align the wording of section 8(1)(c) with section 9(1)(c).  We are changing the word &quot;from&quot; to the word &quot;in&quot;.</p><p>Amendment No. 20 amends section 9(1)(c) to &quot;secure and evidence value for money in the expenditure by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s of moneys provided to it under <i>section 19</i>&quot;.  The previous subsection had provided that the HEA should &quot;secure and evidence value-for-money in the expenditure of public moneys in higher education allocated to funded bodies&quot; but this amends that provision to provide that the HEA is required to &quot;secure and evidence value for money in the expenditure&quot;, so it strengthens what we were originally planning to do.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 31 includes a new provision to &quot;assess the performance of funded bodies with regard to securing value for money in the expenditure of funding provided to them by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under this Act&quot;.  This is a new provision to replace the old section 9(1)(c) to provide that the HEA can assess the performance of funded bodies with regard to securing value for money in the expenditure funding provided to them by the HEA.  Amendment No. 200 is simply a consequential amendment reflecting the new provisions in section 9.<br/><br/>The other amendments in this grouping are from Deputies Conway-Walsh and &Oacute; Cathasaigh, namely, Nos. 12, 21, 28 and 29.  They are similar to some of my amendments but they are seeking to provide accountability and transparency in the use of funding under the Act.  I would argue that amendments Nos. 11, 20 and 31, which I am introducing today, provide for accountability and transparency and we have strengthened the original Bill as published.  It should also be noted that the designated institutions of higher education are fully accountable for the use of the funding provided under this Act in accordance with Part 3, Chapter 2, sections 37 to 42, inclusive, of the Bill, which provide for the provision of funding, conditions for funding, compliance with the conditions of funding and remedial and other measures.  We will get to a section on autonomy later in the Bill and we have been clear that while institutions are autonomous, they also have to be accountable for funding.  The idea that conditions of funding can be attached is an important development on Part 3, Chapter 2 of the Bill.  Section 63 of the Bill, which is the section on the accounts of certain higher education providers and the provisions on the keeping and auditing of accounts in the sectoral legislation, also provides a significant degree of accountability for the use of Exchequer funding.  It is in light of the amendments I am bringing forward today and the provisions we have put into this new Bill in section 63 and in Part 3, Chapter 2, that we are addressing and strengthening accountability in the Bill.  Therefore, at this stage I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 12, 21, 28 or 29.</p></speech>

We oppose the term "value for money" because institutional autonomy means making choices on what does or does not constitute value.  For the HEA to be tasked with securing and evidencing value for money is not practically achievable or appropriate.  Transparency is not negotiable but dictating what represents value for money could potentially infringe institutional autonomy.  It is not always easy to draw a line between education, research and beneficial outcomes for society but we know that all evidence internationally shows that strong and independent institutions provide the best education and research outcomes.  On amendment No. 21, again we oppose the term "value for money" because institutional autonomy means making choices on what does or does not constitute value for money.  Amendment No. 28 is again about how we quantify value for money and that is why we think that substituting: "full accountability" is more suitable.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point on what value for money is and value for money is not defined in that sense but the analysis of it is entrusted to the HEA.  The HEA's board is appointed under legislation with an accountability back to this House through me and through the likes of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Our institutions do excellent work.  We can all point to areas where there has not been value for money and there have been some high-profile cases that have damaged institutions, which none of us want to happen.  I want to be clear that there is no disagreement on autonomy or academic freedom and academic freedom remains the law of the land.  We have worked to strengthen autonomy and be clear throughout the Bill on the importance of same but it is entirely possible to be autonomous and at the same time be asked to satisfy the HEA on value for money.  I would be more inclined to agree with the Deputy if we were putting a rigid definition into the Bill on what value for money is whereas instead it is entrusted to the HEA.  We have a different perspective on how best to achieve accountability and transparency.</p></speech>

Nowhere in the Bill makes any reference to the public nature of our higher education system.  The value of having a public education system cannot be overstated and the public nature of same should also not be taken for granted.  We have seen the wholesale commercialisation of higher education over the last ten years and in some cases we have seen piecemeal privatisation.  Most people would be shocked to find out that more than one third of the primary school teachers we train come from a single for-profit private college and that the same college is moving into nursing this year.  People would also be shocked to find out that we provide millions of euro in funding to private colleges through competitive funding.</p><p>This represents a chance to draw a line in the sand.  This limited reference to the public sector in the general scheme was taken out and in the Minister's briefing note on the Bill he highlighted the Bill's role in providing a pathway for private colleges to become designated institutes for higher education, which we discussed in the previous meeting.  This is also included in the Long Title as one of the key aims of the Bill.  I understand that nothing in this Bill specifically states that designated institutes of higher education will be entitled to public funding and having met the Minister's officials to discuss this, they assured me this was not the intention.  However the Bill is full of references to the HEA's role in supporting designated institutes of higher education.  I believe this creates a huge grey area.  Once private colleges become designated institutes of higher education, they will want State funding.  They already get roughly &euro;20 million per year of public funding and their case will only be made stronger by this Bill as it stands.</p><p>We want the public nature of the higher education system to be referenced and protected in the Bill in order to remove that ambiguity and place a strong emphasis on the importance of maintaining a public higher education system.</p></speech>

Currently, more primary school teachers are trained by a private online college than in any other way.  That does have an impact.  It could have a negative impact in future if it is not regulated and if the ethic that underpins the Bill is not stated, such as in the form proposed by the amendment.  It started as an add-on to teacher training but it is now the primary provider of teacher training.  The amendment is an important rebalancing of the ethics behind what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

I wish to be clear in respect of wanting to develop, enhance and protect a public higher education system.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh referenced the funding discussions on how to sustainably fund higher education.  I intend to bring proposals to Cabinet, likely this month, in that regard.  I look forward to coming back here to debate that.  My proposals will robustly address that commitment to properly support and fund a public higher education system.</p> <p>  I do, however, need to make a couple of brief points.  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to her engagement with my officials on this issue.  It is important that there is a pathway in the Bill for an institution to seek to become a public institution, or a designated institution in the first instance.  I know the Deputy and I do not disagree on this.  I am not trying to suggest that we do.  There are institutions, however, such as Mary Immaculate College and the National College of Ireland, that do not currently have clear legislative pathways in respect of how they become a designated higher education institution, HEI.  It is important that we do not have to come back to primary legislation every time that happens because this is a sector that is evolving and changing.  That is the policy intent behind the pathway - no more and no less.</p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh is correct.  There are occasions when funding is provided to private and not-for-profit higher education institutions.  In fairness, she acknowledged that such funding is generally competitive funding.  If I withdrew that funding, I think she would give out to me because it is generally provided for very good reasons.  It is provided where we identify a sectoral challenge or issue.  It could relate to a specific group - I do not like the word "cohort" - of students in a certain region or a certain grouping such as disadvantaged students.  It is generally done where there is a need to respond quickly to an emerging issue.  I could reference specific examples - I am sure the Deputy could do so too - but I do not want to single out examples.  That is the purpose, however.</p> <p>  The strategy for tertiary education is the show in town in terms of an outline for how we want our higher education system to develop in the next ten years.  One of the key parts of the Bill is that the Minister of the day will prepare a strategy.  We will get onto that later in the Bill.  That strategy will show the policy intent for the following ten years.  That is where the policy intent should always reside, rather than in primary legislation.  Ministers come and go and elections happen.  The Bill allows the Government of the day to set out in the strategy for tertiary education how it intends to develop policy for the sector for the next decade.  </p> <p>  The Deputy stated that designation does not entitle funding.  There will be institutions that want to be designated HEIs but are not seeking to become public institutions.  There will also be institutions that may wish to become part of the public system.  Indeed, the Deputy may wish them to become part of it.  I do not propose to accept the amendment for those policy reasons I have outlined.  I know the Deputy would not do this to me but I would not like to be in any way misrepresented in respect of the clear commitment to developing a robustly and sustainably funded public education system that will on occasion partner with not-for-profit and private institutions on sectoral issues or regional issues or for certain groupings of students.</p></speech>

I agree with him in respect of institutes being able to be designated.  I still have a fear, however, that we have not underpinned the Bill with our intention to have a public education system at third level and, for that reason, I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

Precarious employment has been allowed to spread throughout higher education.  This needs to be a specific responsibility for the HEA.  Governance of the sector must relate to the working conditions of all workers in the sector.  According to the OECD, Ireland's student to staff ratio is 23.4, which is far out of line with the OECD average of 15.1.  This can only be addressed by a new, sustainable funding model.</p><p>In an effort to address the need for student-facing staff, colleges have engaged occasional or hourly-paid lecturers.  These employees are not technically lecturers as lecturing staff are defined as those contracted to undertake a range of academic duties encompassing teaching, research and contribution and scholarly activity.  Across the higher education sector, different job titles or terms are used to describe those engaged in this manner, including part-time teaching assistants, part-time assistant lecturers, occasional lecturers, etc.  Those engaged in this manner are usually on short, fixed-term contracts and are only paid for their teaching.  They have no opportunity to engage in research work, even though being active in research is core to the role of a lecturer and the higher education sector.  Trade unions recently informed this committee that some institutes of higher education have failed to afford the terms of the public sector agreements to those engaged in this manner.  The precarious nature of this engagement is further compounded by the fact that there is no sectoral engagement on industrial relations matters across the university sector.  None of this will be new to the Minister.  I hope he will accept this amendment, or at least the principle that the HEA should have a role in this area.  It is something we have to tackle head-on.</p></speech>

I accept that and I know they would too.  However, I do not believe this is the appropriate place for this amendment in legislation.  Due to where it would be in the Bill, and the Bill it would be in, it would not achieve what the Deputy wishes to achieve.  Working conditions are covered by employment legislation.  If we were trying to achieve something in this regard, it would be better placed in employment legislation.  We also have industrial relations procedures.  All our universities, technological universities and institutes of technology are required to have industrial dispute mechanisms in place in accordance with relevant sectoral legislation.</p><p>It is for that reason, albeit somewhat of a technical one, that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  However, I do not disagree with the broader point the Deputy is making, and which she has asked me to agree with, on the need for the HEA to be active in this space.  I am sure she will reflect on this between now and Report Stage.  I do not believe the amendment will achieve what she wishes it to achieve because employment legislation is the appropriate place for it.</p></speech>

To be very clear, academic freedom is something on which we are all agreed.  It becomes more important by the day.  To be very clear in relation to democratic values and everything else, academic freedom is the law of our land and remains so.  There is nothing in this Bill that in any way dilutes, modifies or changes the reality that academic freedom is fully and robustly defended and legislated for in this country.  I want to state categorically that this Bill does not affect the autonomy or the academic freedom of a university or any other higher education institution.  I do not think anyone can say this is a rushed Bill.  The process has gone on for a number of years.  There has been a lot of engagement and consultations with stakeholders, as is right and proper, to get this right.  At all times during the drafting and development of the legislation, protecting the autonomy and academic freedom of institutions was a key principle that was considered to ensure it would not be affected.  While I alluded earlier to the improvements we have made to the Bill by working together, I wish to be very clear that academic freedom is not something that was in any way missing or absent from the Bill.  Indeed, long before the Bill was even drafted, the key principle of academic freedom and institutional autonomy was protected.</p> <p>  Academic freedom is specifically provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act 1997, section 10 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 and in section 5A of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006.  This Bill does not amend those provisions relating to academic freedom.  They come with us, as it were.  In addition, the objects of the Bill include a provision on academic freedom.  According to section 8(1)(f), in performing its functions, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall have regard to the object of respecting "the academic freedom of higher education providers and academic staff in those providers".</p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has suggested, it is important to protect the freedoms of academic staff.  Given there is already provision in the sectoral legislation which comes with us as we pass this Bill, and considering the reference relating to the objects, we are categoric in our view, and on the basis of legal advice we have taken, that academic freedom will not be affected, diluted, modified in any way, shape or form by this Bill.</p> <p>  There is also a provision in the objects of the Bill on autonomy, which is interlinked somewhat, relating to designated institutes of higher education, "to acknowledge the responsibility of designated institutions of higher education for the performance and governance of those institutions".  While we are trying to get the balance right around transparency and accountability in some of the issues we were discussing, the autonomy of the institutions is very clearly recognised and protected in the provisions on the objects of the Bill.</p> <p>  I should also say that section 37 relates to a funding framework for all designated institutions of higher education.  It relates to the schemes and programmes run by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, with the use of public funds, and not the courses run by higher education institutions, HEIs.  Therefore, in relation to amendment No. 99, it would not be appropriate to include provisions in legislation around courses and student numbers.  However, such a provision may, and indeed, one would imagine will be, included the performance agreement by the institutions and the HEA.</p> <p>  I genuinely accept the bona fides of Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Conway-Walsh, the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in on this issue, but I am very satisfied that academic freedom is protected in the legislation.</p></speech>

Effectively, he is saying there is nothing in the Bill that undermines academic freedom and academic freedom is protected in separate legislation. That is all the more reason for it to be enshrined or explicitly referenced within the Bill.  As the Minister is aware, we live in turbulent times.  One never knows what is around the corner.  On that basis, the principle of academic freedom should be in every piece of legislation we deal with.  That is why I will be pressing these amendments.</p></speech>

It sets out in section 9 the functions of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in planning higher education provision and research and it lists a number of functions.  They are not as explicit as we would like in its function relating to the Irish language.  That is why we believe that one of the functions should be to plan for a progressive increase of opportunities to study and conduct research through the medium of Irish.  At the moment that is not available for students.  While there are 16,000 students who pursue their education through Irish at second level they do not have the opportunity to continue their studies as Gaeilge.  There are some notable exceptions and there is progress being made but the Bill is not explicit enough in our view in terms of the functions of the An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s that they must plan for Irish-medium higher education provision at a much greater rate than it has to date and also that it should also have a duty not only in what is set out in the Bill so far to meet the needs of the individuals of businesses and enterprise, professions and so on but  also to meet the needs of Gaeltacht communities.</p><p>This duty should also cover Irish speakers nationally, as well as, for instance, the EU institutions that have specific needs in respect of the Irish language given the language's recognition and the number of translators that they set out in their requirements.  </p><p> One of the big changes that is going to be, for want of a better term, forced upon the Irish public service results from our passage of the Official Languages Act (Amendment) 2021 earlier this year.  As an Oireachtas we have now set a target of 20% of all recruits in this regard.  Most of the recruits to the Civil Service and public service have been coming from universities at certain grades but if we are to try to reflect the demand for 20% of recruits to the service, it will not be at clerical officer or messenger level or grade, which is the grade I was at when I was in the Civil Service and I believe they got rid of after I left.  There is a need for our universities to provide courses so that we have the ability to recruit those who are fluent in the Irish language and, therefore, it is required, not just because of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment, but where there is a function of an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s with regard to the promotion and use of the Irish language.  That amendment is well and fine but our suggestions in amendments Nos. 22 and 23 go further than that where they refer not just to the promotion and use of the Irish language but specifically address the provision that is now required under the Official Languages Act (Amendment) 2021, and to also cater for a need or a discrimination in some ways for generations, where there was no provision of Irish language courses in all aspects.  </p><p> The outliers in this debate are Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann, Gaillimh, which always had a specific role, and Dublin City University, DCU.  These universities proved that a successful course can be run and a number of people can come through a course, such as in the Fiontar section of DCU where people received business training and the university conducted out its course entirely through the Irish language.  I went to UCD, however, where there was very little in that regard.  I could study Irish if I wanted, which I did, but I could not study history through Irish.  I could sit exams in Irish but not study it.  If I wanted to study history at the time, I would have to have attended University College Galway, UCG, as it was at the time, and that is still the case today.  How many years later is it now and the provision has not increased.</p><p> One of the issues we will encounter later, where I have mentioned the 16,000 students at second level, is that there are even more students at primary school level.  We do not have the exact figures as to how many students are proficient in the Irish language or who attend Irish language schools at university level.  There are pupils who attend English-speaking schools who are fluent in Irish and who would also like to study through the Irish language, so there is a mismatch there.  Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 try to capture that and reflect it in greater functions in an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.</p></speech>

As I flagged on an earlier Stage in this debate, we are engaging with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, as we should be, to ensure this legislation not just complements our legal obligations but complements also the effort to get to where we want to in respect of the Irish language.  In section 34, there is a heading, &ldquo;Planning for provision of higher education&rdquo;, and within that, section 34(4) refers to an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s making recommendations to the Minister in respect of requirements for student places.  At the moment it lists a great deal of different things that it may make suggestions or recommendations about, but not about the Irish language.</p><p>I believe that the Deputy is on to something in respect of the need to look at how we strengthen such provision.  We could work with him in respect of what his amendment is trying to achieve in section 34 in, potentially, two places.  I do not want to be overly prescriptive in these discussions and we need to engage with him on this but, first, the legislation as currently drafted states: &ldquo; An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall plan for the provision of higher education in the State by maintaining an on-going review of the demand for it ... [and] may, for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i>, consult with&mdash;&rdquo;.  It then goes on to refer to assessing the demand for higher education at regional levels, and, in section 34(4), which is probably the most relevant subsection, the recommendations on places.  It is in sections 32 and 33, as currently drafted, that I believe we can currently work with the Deputy and I may well table an amendment on Report Stage.  I can engage with the Deputy before Report Stage on this.  I take the point he has made.</p><p>I was in Luxembourg yesterday at EU meetings and was talking to a translator.  There is a great number of opportunities now for people with proficiency in the Irish language both in translation but also in the institutions, more broadly, and, therefore, the issue arises as to how we plan for that, as the Deputy referred to.  I ask that he might work with me and I with him to see if we can achieve what he is trying to achieve in a different section on Report Stage.</p><p>I want to move amendment No. 24 because it is an improvement on what is there but, in doing so, I want to flag, similarly to what I have just said, that I may come back and further expand it on Report Stage.  At the moment - and I appreciate that Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh welcomed this amendment as a start - we have added in a reference to the Gaeltacht areas and we have talked about the meaning of Part 2 of the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  &ldquo;Gaeltacht Planning Areas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gaeltacht Service Towns&rdquo; and there are &ldquo;Irish Language Networks&rdquo; are noted in that Part.  I would like to move my amendment No. 24 because it is an improvement on what is there but I also want to flag to the committee that I may return on Report Stage with a further amendment in that regard.</p></speech>

I am not sure where is the best place to insert the amendment, whether it is in section 34 or in this section and I will reflect on that.  It is important that this new aspect be covered.  As the Minister said, the Bill has been in gestation for quite a long time, as had the Official Languages Act (Amendment) 2021, but it managed to get through the hoop a great deal more quickly and it has very significant implications for every aspect of public service.  I have reflected that and have had a number of meetings with different Departments, as Chairman of Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, in trying to make those Departments aware of their, in some cases, onerous responsibilities now within a very tight timeframe, and the fact that the world has moved on.  The EU recognition jumped ahead of the Irish language in some cases and gave greater status and now, all of a sudden, we have to deal with that to ensure it is reflected here, which is good.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 39, which I did not mention but which I will move, deals with the fact that the current system does not capture the numbers who are in full-time Irish language courses.  The system has some information and states that there are so many engaged, as stated in answers I received back to parliamentary questions I raised recently in preparation for this Bill.  I was surprised, however, at these figures.</p><p>They were not inaccurate, but they were not full.  They were not complete figures that were usable for anybody.  It gave lists of students who had courses in which there might have been an element of Irish language rather than an Irish-language course.  We do not know the true figure but it is approximately 2,000 if one takes even courses that have a small portion of Irish tuition in them.  That is a big drop from the number of 16,000 going through schools.  Obviously, they are at different levels in secondary school.  I cannot remember the figure for primary schools although it is higher again and, thankfully, growing each year.  However, it means that there is a challenge for any institution, particularly the &uacute;dar&aacute;s, into the future.  If we capture it now, the planning can start for ten years hence so the courses will be available for the children who are in primary school now and coming through in the future.</p><p> That said, I have no problem withdrawing the amendments and working with the Minister to see if we can capture what we tried to do in these amendments in a Report Stage amendment.</p></speech>

We will engage with our colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and share with the Deputy their view on that.  My gut instinct is that we would definitely strengthen what the Deputy is endeavouring to do if, when the Minister of the day is being advised by the &uacute;dar&aacute;s with regard to student places and the like, we would put a reference to this.  That is something good that can come out of the exchange and I am happy to tease through the detail with the Deputy between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

The amendment provides that the HEA shall advise the Minister with regard to the funding required for higher education.  This arose from me following some of the discussions the committee has been having on funding and the view that the HEA should have a role in advising the Minister not just on policy but also on funding.

The function relates to section 18 of the Bill, which provides for co-operation between the two on the delivery of apprenticeships and the establishment and operation of the new national apprenticeship office.</p></speech>

Cross-Border student enrolment is broadly seen as mutually beneficial in economic, social and cultural terms.  Despite broad support in both the political system and wider society the number of cross-Border enrolments has remained at a very low level.  A targeted strategy is required to channel political support and bring about positive change.</p> <p>   In 2019-2020, 2,085 students from the Republic attended higher education institutions in the North.  This equates to just 3.5% of the overall student body in the North.  This has declined from 4,280 or  7.6% over the past ten years.  In terms of cross-Border student enrolment, the most recent available figures are for the 2020-2021 academic year and show that 1,624 students from the North attended higher education institutions in the South.  This means that students from the North make up less than 1% of third level enrolments in the South.  I feel that it is really important to have this explicitly here and I ask for the Minister to support my amendment. </p></speech>

She is entirely right.  We were very pleased in the horrific situation that has been Brexit to protect cross-Border education but more needs to be done.  I mean that we need to get an understanding as to why students from the North are not choosing to study her and <i>vice versa</i>.  One of the arguments that I have put very strongly, and I pushed it at a bilateral meeting with the UK's Secretary of State for Education recently and raised it on a number of occasions with his predecessor, Sir Gavin Williamson, is that we need a piece of research to be done where we ask students from Northern Ireland why they are not choosing to study in the Republic and <i>vice versa</i>.  I want to commit at this committee to that piece of work getting under way.</p><p>I have had very useful meetings in Belfast and Derry in recent months.  I expect proposals to come forward very shortly, probably as soon as this month, in terms of how we can fulfil the two Governments' commitments under New Decade, New Approach.  I am thinking particularly but not exclusively in terms of the Magee campus, which is the Derry campus of the University of Ulster, UU.  We need to see increased student numbers there.  We also need to see collaboration in the north west.  The Deputy and I were at the launch of the Atlantic Technological University on Monday.  We need to see an opportunity now, for example for the ATU, to plug in and collaborate.  I am fully in agreement with the Deputy on this matter.  I do think that we have seen significant funding to get that going and the Deputy will have welcomed the &euro;38 million in all-island research funding.</p><p>The only difficulty I have with this amendment, and I am not being pedantic, is I genuinely believe and I am advised that we have achieved its objective with the amendment that we have just passed, amendment No. 36.  I am not being difficult but we literally, on the basis of Deputy Conway-Walsh's engagement, tabled amendment No. 36, which was to be very clear that when we talk about the HEA promoting co-operation and collaboration we now say it needs to promote that in terms of student places and enrolment.  It is simply that I do not believe the provision is necessary twice. </p></speech>

I have done months of consultations as well as being rapporteur for the education committee on all-island enrolment.  Very interesting issues have arisen there in terms of the barriers that exist.  I believe that we can deal with many of them together and I would rather deal with the Minister in a collaborative way to increase the education opportunities at third level right across the country.  That can only be of benefit to all students right through the lifecycle from all communities so I do want to work with the Minister.  Rather than call a vote I could have further discussions with the Minister and revisit it on another Stage.  This matter is really important to all of us.  I withdraw my amendment and will bring it forward on a later Stage after further discussion.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 41 is slightly stronger as it deals with &quot;Irish medium education&quot; and &quot;language planning&quot; rather than just &ldquo;the promotion and use of the Irish language&rdquo;.  Perhaps we can examine the matter.</p><p>Amendment No. 44 reflects on who will be nominated by the Minister or who will adjudicate on policy in terms of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  It is the membership of the board that we deal with.  Given the failures of the HEA over years, as we set up &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta we should have within its members those who reflect and will champion the interests of the Irish language community and Gaeltacht areas.  That is why we have stipulated in amendment No. 44 that at least one of the persons appointed shall be representative of a Gaeltacht area.</p><p>I do not know how specific the Minister wants to be, but there must be some way we can ensure those who work in Irish-medium education, such as an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge and so on, can have a voice at that level so that what we have seen since the 1971 Act came into force is not repeated and we ensure the Irish language is a consideration at all times.  Iit should, perhaps, be the foremost consideration, but I am a realist and understand how society works.  At least, it should be a consideration throughout.</p><p> As regards amendment No. 46, we have had this argument previously.  I raised it during the discussion on the Official Languages (Amendment) Act.  It relates to the need for those who are chairs of various boards to have an understanding of the Irish language.  In the case of the amendment, we are asking that the Minister seek to ensure that the chairperson of the board is able to communicate proficiently in Irish.  It is not a significant ask, given that the vast majority of people in the higher education system have come through the Irish education system and, theoretically, many of them have that proficiency anyway.  The Minister may be surprised to learn how widespread are Irish speakers.  Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta celebrated its 50th anniversary last weekend.  It is an organisation that can find an Irish speaker anywhere in the world.  In the middle of the Ukrainian situation when the Russians were attacking, it was able to find a Ukrainian who spoke Irish and could explain exactly her circumstances and what was happening.  There are far more people with a proficient level of Irish than we give credit for; they just do not speak it regularly or do not get the opportunities to do so.  We need to not play down that but, rather, make sure that it flows, especially if we believe the Irish language is central to our education.  It is a small ask for the chairperson of the board to have that proficiency.</p><p> Amendment No. 49 is trying to ensure that 20% of members of the board have a proficiency in Irish.  This is another amendment that has been recommended by Conradh na Gaeilge.  I do not know if the Minister has listened to it on other amendments thus far.  The amendment proposes that 20% of the members of the board shall have a level B2 or higher proficiency in spoken Iris on the common European framework of reference for languages.  This relates to the system that is used for the Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge.  It is not a B2 in the leaving certificate; it is a specific ability that I believe is attainable by people who may wish to be chairperson of such a body in the future.</p></speech>

It is clear from my engagement with all Deputies on this series of amendments that it has been very proactive in respect of the Bill.  I do not think anyone in the history of campaigns has got 100% of what he or she is seeking.  Conradh na Gaeilge has managed to make a lot of progress.  The Deputy is correct.   There are areas on which I have a different view.  I will explain why that is the case.</p> <p>  The Deputy largely welcomed amendment No. 42, which I tabled, although I acknowledge that he prefers the wording contained in his amendment.  The rationale behind my amendment is that when a Minister is considering who should be on a board and what background and expertise that person should have, the promotion and use of the Irish language would  now be specifically included as one of the criteria that can be considered.  As one who has had the honour of being a Minister for a few years, I know the significance of this in the context of submissions received in respect of board appointments and the likes.   Let us say Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh is looking to be appointed to this board and there is a table with various columns for qualifying criteria, this amendment means that he could qualify because there will now be a criterion-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022040600002#N00300"><p>I think I would qualify on that one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.636" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022040600002#N00400"><p>The Deputy might qualify on many.  The amendment will make the promotion and use of the Irish language visible to the Minister of the day when he or she is going to fill the board. It will very much put that on his or her radar.  I believe it is quite significant and Conradh na Gaeilge does too.  I am pleased we have been able to do that.  That is the agreement bit.</p> <p>  Where I do have a different view is in respect of quotas on the board.  My fundamental problem with that is that there are so many groups that could make that argument.  One could argue that we should have a quota of people who are speaking up for or representing those with a disability or have a disability themselves, for example.  The Deputy and I would see great benefit in that expertise being reflected.  However, if one starts carving up the numbers on a relatively small board with specific ring-fenced quotas, the flexibility of the Minister to put together a competency-based board in the round is diminished.  That is my view.  I am making this point in a genuinely non-partisan sense.  I trust that the Minister of the day will make the correct appointments through a rigorous public appointments process and on the basis of the criteria set out, now including the Irish language as a specific criterion.  That is giving the Irish language a prominence that we have chosen not to give to some other areas that one could argue are of equal importance.  My worry is that if quotas of 20% were to be introduced in respect of various specific criteria, there could only be five such apportionments.  That is the challenge.  We have done this.  I did it in the Department of Health when I introduced the new HSE board.  One has to decide whether a board should be representational or competency-based.  I am not suggesting those are mutually exclusive but we are going for a competency-based board and the promotion and use of the Irish language will be one of the criteria.  That is my best way of explaining it.</p> <p>  I am a little terrified by the idea that appointees will have to show their results in a particular test.  For example, I appoint people to the board of Science Foundation Ireland.  They are very qualified and accomplished people.  I have never asked them to show me what they got in a science exam or a maths exam.  I am not dismissing these ideas out of hand; I am just thinking out loud somewhat.  I cannot think of a comparable situation in which we tell people to show us their grades but I accept that is the position Conradh na Gaeilge and the Deputy have put forward.  My view is that, comparing where we are at now with the HEA board and where we will be at as a result of the legislation, the visibility and promotion and use of the Irish language will be significantly enhanced in the context of its inclusion as a criterion for qualification for a person joining the board.  The Deputy and I will not agree on this but I believe that to go further could be somewhat unworkable or challenging in terms of trying to balance the ranges of interest and expertise one would want on the board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1485" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022040600002#N00500"><p>I have absolutely no problem with withdrawing amendment No. 41, given the progress that has been made in the context of amendment No. 42.  As regards the other amendments, it is difficult in the context of putting a board together.  It is about ensuring that it is captured.  We all live in the hope that it will be captured in the way the Minister believes it will by virtue of the inclusion of the criterion in respect of the promotion and use of Irish, but we lived in that hope for many decades in the context of trying to promote the representation of women on State boards.  The change, however, only happened when we legislated for it.  Change might be needed in future to reflect our diverse society if that does not happen naturally.  One of the reasons Conradh na Gaeilge and I have argued for these amendments is because that has not been happening.  There have been opportunities in the past but ability in the Irish language was not seen as a benefit in the context of appointments to boards.</p><p>I am aware of the whole system of appointments to boards and the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  I too will be dealing with two appointments to TG4 at a Houses of the Oireachtas committee in the next couple of weeks and this, in some ways, is a novel approach with appointments through the committee and the Minister.  There are different ways in which appointments can be made.</p><p> I will press this amendment but I will have a look again at it.  I will talk to Conradh na Gaeilge and others to see if there is a way of capturing what we want to capture without being too onerous on the appointments system.  The key part we are looking for is to ensure the board has an understanding of the importance of the Irish language and to ensure an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, which is what they are representing, has that to the fore.  Over the years I have found that people who do not speak the Irish language often do not understand the challenges those of us who do speak, or who want to continue education as Gaeilge, have, even on a day-to-day basis in just getting our rights and in our interactions with the State.  That is the frustration that has led to these amendments from Conradh na Gaeilge, and not just on this Bill.  It is also on a number of Bills over a long time.  The conradh would be first to acknowledge the huge progress in recent years in particular and progress by virtue of the fact the Minister has adopted some of its suggestions.</p></speech>

While accepting it is not where the Deputy wants to get to fully, reading the wording in the Bill, the change is significant in that the Minister of the day is being told by the legislation that "members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister [of the day] from among persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have sufficient experience and expertise relating to".  The promotion and use of the Irish language is there; that is the change.  I have thrashed this through with Conradh na Gaeilge a few times.  Far be it from me to speak for it but I believe its concern is that while it may be grand and well intentioned to include this in the legislation, will anything have changed in five years or ten years&rsquo; time?  I can understand this and that it is built on years of experience.  Again, not to speak for Conradh na Gaeilge, but it was asking of me whether it would be possible to review the provision or check to see if had made a difference.  There may be some scope in that space to discuss it.  The Minister of the day cannot review his or her own appointments to a board.  I am being very honest with this committee in advance of Report Stage and I want to be helpful.  I am not going to find myself in a position on Report Stage of being in agreement with quotas.  That is being truthful and to be helpful.  Again, if I think the aim here is to make sure the new promotion and use of the Irish language as a criteria is impactful, I believe this might be the space in which we should constructively think between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Bill provides that An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s may, for planning of the development of higher education, consult such Ministers, An tSeirbh&iacute;s, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, the designated institutions of higher education, the students&rsquo; unions, and other such bodies.  We believe the comhairle is one such body.  It is established by the Department of Education and charged with providing evidence, advice and supporting resources for the development of Irish medium and Gaeltacht education.  To develop a thriving Irish medium education sector at higher level, I believe An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta must work in tandem, and that recognition here would be important to ensure An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta becomes one of the specified bodies in order that administrative co-operation is encouraged and facilitated by this legislation.</p></speech>

I am open to correction on this, but I am advised the bodies specifically listed in the legislation are the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, SOLAS, and Science Foundation Ireland, and they are listed because of their statutory establishment.  They are statutory bodies and that basis is the reason we have chosen to include them explicitly as opposed to others.</p> <p>  On the other bodies, which the Deputy referenced, we are putting an enabling provision in the legislation that the Minister may by order prescribe a body for the purposes of this section, once it is established, in which functions are vested by statute or otherwise.  This provision can be used in the future to prescribe bodies.  Again, it is just a way of doing what we are trying to do here, which is to limit the specific and explicit outline to those three statutory bodies under my remit and that of my Department and to give the Minister of the day an enabling provision to prescribe other bodies.  I certainly see merit in what the Deputy has said.  If this legislation is passed, it will have the ability to look at how we can prescribe bodies, and no doubt the Deputy will be pursuing that vigorously with me.  My rationale is that I am satisfied with the enabling provision.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 72, again we deem it unnecessary because we believe it is already included in section 34(2)(f) in the term "such other bodies".  I understand this is not what the Deputy is trying to do and that he is trying to state it explicitly.  That is the difference.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 52 seeks to include a specific reference to Irish-medium higher education.  Section 20 provides that the corporate plan of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s shall include its &quot;objectives, outputs and related strategies for higher education&quot;.  We want to ensure Irish-medium education is included in that.</p><p>Amendment No. 53 proposes that after &quot;Minister&quot; on page 23, line 18, a reference to the Minister with responsibility for the Irish language, who is the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, be included.  This is to ensure the latter has a role in the corporate plan as it pertains to Irish-medium higher education, especially in respect of Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>Amendment No. 54 relates to section 21, which deals with the annual plan of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Our amendment seeks to ensure the plan includes specific performance targets, and information on the progress of those targets, for actively promoting the use of the Irish language as a medium for higher education, details of the allocation of resources to Irish-medium higher education and so on.  Setting out annual targets is a way of ensuring delivery.  Without those targets, the yardstick is missing and an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s cannot be held to account in this regard.  Some of what we are proposing here probably will be reflected in some ways under the Official Languages Act, but this provision is specific to the annual plan and seeks to ensure an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s does not just do the minimum that is required under the Act but that it does, in fact, reflect the successes or failures of its policies in this area in its annual plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.675" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022040600002#P01400"><p>It is entirely the Deputy's call but I would suggest that this proposal merits reflection on his part in light of the changes we made earlier to the Bill.  We now have significantly improved reference to the Irish language and its promotion in the objects and functions of the HEA.  This section needs to be read in conjunction with the provisions that already are in the legislation in terms of what must be contained in the annual plan, including the requirement to outline the proposed activity and specify the proposed allocation, the monitoring arrangements and how an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s shall have regard to its objects.  Those requirements now include the Irish language.  In fairness, when these amendments were being drafted, that was not covered.  The changes we have made mean the Bill now contains a number of additional requirements as to what must be contained in the annual plan.  There are four specific requirements and the annual plan shall now capture the changes we have made in regard to the Irish language.  It is my view that the issue is now adequately addressed.</p> <p>  In regard to amendment No. 53, which proposes to insert a reference to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, my view is that there are several places in which reference is made to consulting with other Ministers, as appropriate.  That captures the Deputy's requirement and ensures there is consistency across the legislation.  There will be occasions, under this Bill, on which the Minister of the day will be required to consult with other Ministers.  It might be the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in regard to the Irish language and, on another occasion, it might be a different Minister and in respect of a different matter.  The standard provision across legislation has generally been that requirements in this regard are captured by reference to consultation with other Ministers of the Government, where such is necessary or required.  It is a cleaner way of legislating to keep that standard provision throughout the Bill.</p></speech>

His amendments have moved the legislation on and these amendments may not capture that.  They relate to earlier amendments we brought forward.  This section refers to the annual plan and relates to the performance of the functions of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I was seeking to ensure those functions were more specific.  I will look again at section 9, where functions and all of that are defined, to ensure that this is, in fact, captured in the annual plan.  If it is not, I will come back with a further amendment on functions.  The Minister stated that it is not necessary to be prescriptive if the functions already cover what I am seeking to cover.  The annual plan is supposed to set this out and the corporate plan is similar.  If we get the functions right in section 9, then we will get the rest of it right.  I have no problem with withdrawing these amendments and looking again at the functions section.</p></speech>

As currently outlined, the section requires that if the HEA is to accept a gift of money, land or property, it requires my consent and that of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to do so.  The amendment removes the requirement for the consent of the latter for the receipt of gifts.  That Department generally is more concerned when something is costing it money.  The amendment provides that the HEA may accept a gift of money, land or property with my consent, without also needing the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have brought this amendment forward with the approval of the latter.  It is in the interest of administrative efficiency.</p></speech>

I hear what the Minister is saying but I do not see any reason or justification for taking out the requirement for the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is an additional safeguard.  It is all right to remove that safeguard while the current Minister, Deputy Harris, is in office, but there might be other Ministers after him.</p></speech>

It is more that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform does not have a specific role in a gift being received.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has conveyed this view to us.  It provides administrative efficiency instead of having to go through two departmental processes.  There are other provisions in the Bill whereby there are many things I cannot do without the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is merely that if there is good news for the sector in terms of something coming in we do not need the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform to consent to it because there is no expenditure cost to the State.</p></speech>

This phrase relates specifically to the Committee of Public Accounts.  While recognising that committee specifically deals with financial accountants and provides less space and need for debating the merits, we feel placing this restriction on the CEO is unnecessary.  The terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts should set the limits of the discussion.</p></speech>

When we read this in isolation it can sound a little stark.  As the Deputy alludes to, it is a standard provision at the Committee of Public Accounts.  From my memory of my days on the committee, at the beginning of every meeting this exact wording is articulated.  It is a standard provision.  We should not disrupt lines of accountability with regard to the Oireachtas on policy matters.  I am accountable to the Oireachtas on policy and nobody else is.  The line of accountability is between the Minister and the Oireachtas.  The Accounting Officer is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts with regard to his or her duties.  It is a standard provision for State agencies.  I am told it is not something in any way specific to the CEO of the HEA and nor is it meant to be.  It is a standard provision that is replicated across State agencies.</p></speech>

It is also there with regard to the HSE.  The purpose and justification for having a higher education authority is that it is a strong authority capable of providing oversight of the sector and acting as an advocate on the sector's behalf.  Including this limitation on the CEO means he or she has less flexibility to act as a voice for the sector before this and other committees than an official in the Department.  I am trying to get the balance.</p></speech>

We do not fully agree but I understand what the Deputy is saying.  The CEO of the HEA can and should advise the Minister on policy issues.  As a result of some of the improvements we have made to the Bill we have also included the funding issue.  The CEO of the HEA can be invited before any other Oireachtas committee for discussions and debates.  I know the CEOs of the HEA, SOLAS and probably Education and Training Boards Ireland have come before the Oireachtas joint committee for policy discussions.  There is no issue at all with this.  This is not meant to be a significant policy development on my part.  It simply replicates a standard provision with regard to CEOs of State agencies.  It is not novel.  The Deputy may not agree with it for any CEO of a State agency.  This is a broader point the Deputy may wish to make.  This is replicating what is the norm with regard to CEOs of State agencies going before the Committee of Public Accounts.  As the Deputy has rightly identified, it is the Committee of Public Accounts alone.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about taking the wording in isolation but it explicitly states the CEO shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any new policy of Government or Minister of the Government on the merits of the objectives of the policy.  It seems very restrictive and almost dictatorial in that sense.</p></speech>

They should do so and it is entirely appropriate.  To be clear, this is not a wording created by me or the Department to endeavour to be in any way restrictive.  It is simply seen by us and the drafters as a standard provision that we are replicating.  If any other Minister from any other Department were here bringing forward legislation I am pretty certain he or she would also have this standard provision.  It is not a provision of the Government.  It is also a provision of the Opposition.  Presumably the Committee of Public Accounts can change its own Standing Orders when it wants to do so in consultation with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the provision that all members of the PAC believe should be in place because it is read out at the beginning of each meeting when the witnesses are seated.</p></speech>

The section already includes a reference to the Minister having regard to any national policies when preparing the strategy and that those policies would include the policies outlined in the amendment.  The amendment is made to strengthen the provisions in relation to consideration of policies on social, economic, cultural and environment development and sustainability, and the promotion and use of the Irish language.  The issue of environmental development and sustainability is something Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has discussed with me.  We will return to it on Report Stage based on a discussion we had earlier.  The promotion and use of the Irish language is a debate we have been having extensively this evening.

It has moved us beyond the original position.  I thought this was going to happen, and we have moved and it is a good thing.  I may, however, come back with another amendment to tighten the wording.  As I said previously, I am not sure if the phrase "promotion and use of the Irish language" fully captures what is involved in this regard.  It may do so, though, and I will re-examine this aspect.</p></speech>

This is also an especially powerful place to insert the provision regarding the &quot;promotion and use of the Irish language&quot;, and I also welcome that.  Reference was made in the Minister's amendment to &quot;environmental development and sustainability&quot;.  I accept that point, but there is a place here to mention specific policy obligations regarding climate change.  Section 33(4)(a) refers to &quot;any national policies that are relevant to the strategy&quot;, but we must view this whole context within the framework of the enormous environmental challenge coming down the tracks.  It would be appropriate, somewhere in this proposed legislation, to refer specifically to these &quot;national climate policies, legislation and objectives, including the Paris Agreement [...] and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021&quot;.  </p><p>The Minister is not in the business of listing every Act in the context of national policy that could have a bearing on this Bill, but this is a more serious and overarching matter.  It will have to specifically inform education in future, especially concerning sustainability.  He has a great commitment to the development of the trades, and I refer to that aspect as well, and to the type of research and innovation that will be required in future to allow us to face up to the climate challenges in front of us.  Therefore, while welcoming what is set out in amendment No. 58, we could go further in specifically detailing and mentioning the climate challenge and the framework within which we must operate in facing up to that.</p></speech>

What I suggest we do here is similar to what I suggested the previous time we engaged on this topic on Committee Stage.  Perhaps we could consider the range of amendments the Deputy has submitted on the climate and biodiversity emergency in the round.  I committed to doing this the last day.  We can see where there may be opportunities to strengthen this Bill, and I am happy to do that.  The Deputy is correct; my speaking note tells me we do not list legislation because it already applies.  Even from a clarity perspective, sometimes it can be cleaner not to do so as well.  I do, however, take the point he is making regarding the emergency in this respect and the need for it to be reflected in all legislation we enact.</p> <p>  Something else I would like to explore, and I am asking myself this question out loud, concerns section 126.  Again, this is a section we might perhaps be talking about after we have passed the Bill, because it is an enabling section.  It is significant that the section empowers the HEA in respect of guidelines, codes and policies being issued to designate institutions of higher education.  That enables the authority to issue new codes, policies and guidance encompassing the relevance of "the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021".</p> <p>  I imagine what committee members are wondering, because I would be if I was in their position, is how they can be sure the HEA will move on this aspect once the legislation has passed.  This is something I would like to reflect on.  I make this point regarding this amendment and more broadly as well.  Overall, we do not want to be extremely prescriptive in listing all guidance, codes and modes of practice in the context of a range of important issues, including the climate emergency.  We do, however, want an assurance that once the legislation is signed by the President and becomes the law of the land that something is going to happen in these areas.  There is a responsibility on me to reflect on how I respond to this aspect more broadly as well, because section 126 is significant regarding the ability to do things on climate.  </p> <p>  It is equally significant regarding other issues I have been working on with the committee.  These include taking a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and consent, as well as many other issues that arise and that cause us, as a society, to say they must be addressed.  Undoubtedly, when this legislation is passed, whomever is Minister will be regularly asked in the D&aacute;il about section 126.  There are also references to this aspect in the consultation section and, therefore, I would like to reflect on the climate and biodiversity emergency with the Deputy and other members in the round between now and Report Stage.  I would also like to try to develop my own thinking regarding where the HEA is, and will, be concerning its priorities in the context of this new section 126 power.</p></speech>

It is a hot topic of conversation.  This has been going on for years and it is the elephant in the room in any conversation about higher or further education.  Within the context of the strategies laid out by the Minister, therefore, I feel strongly that the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education must be included in such a strategy and that this aspect must be contained in the legislation.</p></speech>

The section provides for the preparation of a strategy for tertiary education that encompasses &quot;the further education and training system and the higher education and research system&quot;.  This will be a high-level strategy identifying the objectives and outputs for the tertiary education sector.  My point is that this section is in that space.</p><p>We believe that the differentiation of institutional mission between the variety of higher education providers, and this is a diverse sector, is inherent in and outlined by section 33(4)(b).  In an effort to be helpful, I indicate that I propose to amend section 35.  Amendment No. 88 proposes, in the context of &quot;The [HEA] shall, in preparing a performance framework, should have regard to [...] the strategy for tertiary education under <i>section 33&quot;, </i>to insert &quot;taking account of the diversity of functions, objects and priorities of different higher education providers&quot;.</p><p>I am trying to capture what I think the Deputies are intending in section 35 rather than section 33 by expanding that section to include the words "taking account of the diversity of functions, objects and priorities of different higher education providers".  That would build on the piece I have already referenced in section 33(4)(b) relating to the differentiation of institutional mission between higher education providers.</p></speech>

The Bill as published includes a provision in 33(5) which states, &quot;The Minister shall, for the purposes of preparing a strategy, consult with such bodies or persons as the Minister considers appropriate.&quot;  However, some of our key stakeholders have requested to be named in the list.  This amendment endeavours to specify a wide list of stakeholders who shall be consulted by the Minister in preparation of the strategy.  The proposed amendment also includes consultation with such other bodies as the Minister considers appropriate.  This will provide for consultation with any persons or bodies who are not included in the list or, indeed, who may emerge in the future.</p><p>I am endeavouring to address what amendments Nos. 64, 65 and 66 are intended to do.  I acknowledge that both Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Conway-Walsh are trying to ensure that the Minister shall, not may, consult with student representatives; representative bodies, including the Irish Universities Association the Technological Higher Education Authority and others; and the trade unions which Deputy Conway-Walsh has listed.  In the amendment, I am listing all of those groups and in the process of doing so, we decided it would be useful to list a few more as well.  I think we have captured it, or that is my contention.</p></speech>

We welcome the inclusion of greater detail as to who the Minister will consult on the strategy for tertiary education.  However, there are still a number of issues.  While I welcome the specific inclusion of SOLAS, we need to strengthen the links and pathways between further and higher education.  I have raised with the Minister previously that less than 5% of the approximately 4,000 students in pre-nursing courses go on to degree level.  The figures are not recorded for pre-law courses.</p> <p>  I also very much welcome the inclusion of trade unions on the list.  Their absence was notable in the Bill as drafted.

My understanding is that we are trying to provide flexibility to engage with students' unions but also with other bodies of students that may emerge and which are not students' unions.  It is not intended to suggest consulting certain bodies ahead of others.  For example, I meet with an excellent group from Trinity College Dublin, led by Mr. Vivian Rath, which works on the whole issue of postgraduate students with disabilities.  It is not a students' union.  The Deputy is right to raise the matter but the amendment is not to suggest that the Minister of the day or the university can ignore the students' union.</p></speech>

I believe I am capturing his amendment in Government amendments Nos. 69 and 70.  Those amendments provide for consultation on the planning and provision of higher education in the State with trade unions or staff associations of members of staff of designated institutions which are recognised by those institutions.  A specific listing for trade unions and staff associations in the consultation provision was requested by a number of stakeholders following publication of the Bill.  I agree it is important that trade unions and staff associations of staff in designated higher institutions are consulted and that is why, in response to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, I am bringing forward amendments Nos. 69 and 70, which I believe achieve what amendments Nos. 68 and 71 are setting out to do.</p></speech>

As we acknowledged on Second Stage, much of the Bill relates to issues that have taken place, such as the extension of some of the supports during Covid.  Some of those supports have now expired while others will expire in the coming weeks.  A certain number of them will have a slightly longer tail.  There will be very few issues in respect of things that have already taken effect.</p> <p>  The Minister will note that the quarterly bulletin published by the Central Bank today stated that 10% of the workforce is currently working and receiving supports through the EWSS.  How confident is he that when this support is withdrawn - some of it runs to the end of April - those jobs will remain viable?  Is he concerned that a large number of jobs in companies are being kept alive by the scheme?  Has the Department carried out analysis in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.804" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022040600002#A00800"><p>It might be helpful to the committee to give the current state of play in respect of EWSS.  That will frame the answers I give to the Deputy.  As he stated, we are now in the final stage of the exit from the EWSS.  Most businesses will exit the scheme at the end of April and some businesses, mainly hospitality businesses that were affected by the 8 p.m. closing time, are due to exit at the end of May.  We currently have 22,000 employers and 260,000 employees supported by EWSS.  Although it is not possible to be absolutely definitive, we expect that by the end of this month, 18,000 of those 22,000 employers will exit EWSS.  That is equivalent to 160,000 employees.  We expect a considerable majority of the employers and a majority of the employees to leave EWSS in a few weeks, with the balance then due to exit at the end of May.</p> <p>   As regards modelling or analysis we have done in respect of the number of businesses that could find themselves facing challenges due to this, we have not been able to form a view in respect of businesses that could be at risk.  Indeed, we ran the EWSS for the duration we have to give businesses the best chance of being viable because they were viable before Covid hit.  I hope, therefore, that the vast majority of businesses will be in a position to return to successful trading, but I expect it will be towards the end of the year that we will have a better sense of whether the viability of employers will be affected.  My expectation is that the vast majority of businesses that are on EWSS will be able to exit from it and trade successfully.</p></speech>

The period for which figures will answer his question will be the first quarter of this year.  We will not have those employment figures for a few more weeks.</p> <p>  From anecdotal evidence and my engagement with a wide variety of employers, I have little sense of jobs that were available before Covid not being available now.  In fairness, it will take a little time - it will be towards the end of this year - before we are clearer on the interplay between leaving the EWSS and companies trading in a different economic environment.  We will not have the employment figures for a few more weeks, but I do not have any feedback at the moment regarding pre-Covid jobs no longer being available.</p></speech>

We also see vacancies in the services and manufacturing sectors.  Has any information been made available to the Minister as to why there are so many people who cannot fill the posts that they are advertising?</p></speech>

What I believe is happening is that there are many jobs that were available before Covid and were not available over the 18 months of the dark days of the pandemic but that are now returning.  They might not all be in exactly the same sectors, but there is no sign at all of job opportunity erosion happening within our economy.</p> <p>  As to why so many employers are struggling to attract new workers to their businesses, I do not believe it is due to a lack of people in most parts of our economy.  It is simply the case that more workers are needed for some parts of our economy.  The Deputy is aware of the pressures on the work permit scheme as we try to bring new people into our economy to fill vacancies.  People who performed jobs in some parts of our economy before Covid hit are making the decision to change sectors and do other work.  The restaurant and hospitality sector, which is before another Oireachtas committee at the moment, is on the front lines in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, it is having considerable recruitment difficulties.  It has indicated in some of its pre-committee statements that it views this as a major challenge to having a successful summer period.  There are some parts of our economy where there is a lack of workers, and there is a great deal of demand for additional work permits for those parts of the economy.</p></speech>

We have discussed this matter previously.  I believe it was first mooted by the Taoiseach when he was in America last June or July.  Commitments were made that it would be enacted before the end of the year or, at one stage, even before the budget.  The Minister is now providing for a legislative basis to exempt the payment from income tax, USC and PRSI, but when will the payment be made?  I understand that it will now be made in June, but I cannot see why it is taking so long - nearly a year from when it was initially suggested by the Taoiseach - for the Government to make the payment to our front-line workers.  There are still no criteria setting out who will get the payment, yet we are enshrining in legislation, and rightly so, its exemption from income tax, PRSI and USC.  Has the Minister any pearls of wisdom from his meetings and discussions with the Minister for Health and from collective decisions taken by the Cabinet about who will be paid this recognition payment of &euro;1,000 and when those front-line workers will receive it?</p></speech>

I have a list with me regarding the forms of job that will be receiving the payment.  It includes doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, porters, cleaners, medical laboratory staff, health and social work professionals, swabbers, vaccinators, home carers who were carrying out duties contracted to them by the HSE, those who were seconded or assigned to the HSE, such as Defence Forces staff who worked at HSE testing centres, ambulance workers employed by the HSE, and administrative staff who meet the criteria set out by the Minister for Health, including those in our emergency departments.  I have a significant list of who will be getting the payment.  There is still work being done on whether it needs to be expanded further.  I understand that the Department of Health and the HSE are finalising some work on this with trade unions, which will be completed soon.</p> <p>  As to when the payment will be made, the exact date is dependent on arrangements at local HR level, but I expect the payment to occur in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

The Minister has a list with him.  Are nurses who were working in GP practices and were involved in vaccinations on it?  Are those who worked through voluntary bodies like Cancer Care West on it?</p><p>Will the Minister provide us the details of the <i>pro rata</i>nature of the payment?  How will it be calculated?

My colleague Deputy Doherty asked most of the questions that I had.  On timing, I am sure the Minister is aware there were some reports yesterday in the media that it could be as far as June.  I understand the Minister said here today that he hopes it will be within the coming weeks.  Does the Minister have any concerns that it could take as long as June?  As he is aware, people are asking those questions, and when they see that kind of information being put out in the media, they have concerns.</p></speech>

It is the case, however, as the Deputy knows, that there are many different payroll operations included in the different sets of workers to whom I have just referred.  It may well be the case, because of when payrolls are run, for the workers I referred to, some of that may happen in early May and not all within April.  However, out of the workers and kinds of work I mentioned a moment ago, I expect those payments to be made to those workers in the majority of cases this month.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s other question regarding it going to June, the only circumstances where I can imagine something like that happening would be if there continued to be an issue regarding whether a particular worker was due to benefit from the payment.  Perhaps that might result in a late payment.  However, as I said, I expect the majority of them to happen in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Sections 5 to 10, inclusive, list those schemes, including a number of them administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  One such scheme is referred to in each of the six debt warehousing sections as the scheme commonly known as the &ldquo;live performance support scheme phase 4&rdquo;.

Obviously, this was a very important provision that allowed for a bit of comfort and space for businesses.  We see that, across the sector, about 10% of the eligible debt for warehousing has been warehoused, about &euro;3 billion out of the &euro;30 billion.  Different companies responded in different ways in taking up the initiative.  Some are paying back the warehouse debt that has been paid while others are warehousing a portion of it.  About 5% of the businesses have warehoused all of the Covid-19 debt, which makes up about &euro;300 million and 12,000 businesses.</p> <p>  The period now is coming to an end and we will start the period of a zero interest rate for a 12-month period until the end of April next year, after which the interest will start to kick in as normal, so there is still that window of comfort for individuals.  However, we have seen, and this is probably understandable, a low level of insolvency during the pandemic because of these measures that have kept companies on life support in some cases and, in other cases, that were just a comfort they needed to be able to trade through.  However, we saw an abnormally low level of insolvency.  Has there been any modelling within the Department to show what will happen as this timeframe lapses, there is a requirement on the companies to start to pay back the debt and the interest starts to kick in?  There have been suggestions in some quarters that a substantial amount of the &euro;3 billion that is warehoused could have to be written off as bad debt as companies may fold.  I just want to understand the Minister&rsquo;s assessment.  As always with any of these schemes, and we went in with eyes wide open with this scheme, there was always going to be a case where the Government was not going to get everything back, but without it, we would have had companies fold left, right and centre.  Has there been any early assessment by done by Revenue or the Department on where they see the total amount of the &euro;3 billion?</p> <p>  Adding to that question, given where we are at with the war in Ukraine and with it being one crisis after another - a pandemic followed by a war and economic sanctions that are having an impact not just on households and workers but also in some sectors and businesses, particularly those that have higher energy consumption or cannot access the type of materials they would have accessed heretofore - is there any consideration within the Department to looking at the debt warehousing timeframes for specific sectors that would be affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the economic consequences that flow from that?</p></speech>

The key issue first is what the Government has done to try to offer support to companies that will be facing difficulty or viability challenges as we exit from the emergency supports that are in place.  As the committee will be aware, we have put in place two significant legislative changes to try to provide support to smaller businesses, in particular, that find themselves in this difficult point.  First, we amended the Companies Act 2014 through an Act that was brought in place recently to extend the examinership process and increase the threshold at which a company is deemed unable its debts up to &euro;50,000.  That was a change made by the Government to help companies manage this moment of transition.  We have also brought in the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, which is a kind of dedicated and specific process to help small and micro companies that may have to go through a period of restructuring.  We have looked to amend the examinership model to help companies in that way.  Critically, we have made changes in our procedures to help companies when they approach this point.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question whether we anticipate how many companies will not be in a position to repay their debts, again, the answer is not at the moment.  However, Revenue will begin the process of outreach to those minority of companies that have continued to avail of warehousing and have not paid back any of their debt at all.  That is a small minority of companies.</p><p>Later in the year, when that outreach is complete, I think we will have a better idea as to what kind of liability issue we will face or whether a larger share of companies might be unviable than would normally be the case.  Revenue will start making contact with those businesses imminently.  It is worth noting, however, that 85% of companies have now either paid back their taxes in full in the month they were due or begun the process of doing so, showing, I hope, that we have got the balance right to date.</p><p> In response to Deputy Doherty's final question as to whether we are considering amending the provisions we have in place in respect of an interest rate of zero increasing to 1% and then all the way to 3%, we are not at the moment.  I would not give consideration to any change at all before we do the budget.  The engagement now under way between the Revenue Commissioners and these 12,000 businesses will, I think, give us a helpful steer as to what the payment capacity will be like.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 7 provides the necessary legislative basis for the changes approved by the D&aacute;il under the financial resolution of 9 March.  That financial resolution provided for a temporary reduction in the excise rates for auto fuels amounting to 20 cent for petrol and 15 cent for diesel motor fuels, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction in excise on marked gas oil.  These reductions were provided for in recognition by the Government of the impacts of the current fuel price increases on households and businesses.  The measures are VAT-inclusive and will last until 31 August.  While these increases in energy costs are driven primarily by global factors, the decision was taken to alleviate some of these impacts through the domestic taxation of fuel.  The measures implemented provide significant mitigation of recent fuel price increases.  It is impossible, however, to offset all the recent increases just by using the taxation system.  The excise reductions strike the balance between passing on a needed benefit to consumers, protecting our ability to collect tax in the future and respecting the minimum rates allowable under the EU energy tax directive.  The excise reductions come in addition to a temporary and targeted emergency support measure for licensed hauliers announced by the Minister for Transport to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 9 provides for amendment of the Long Title to include the excise duty reductions in the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.863" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022040600002#D03200"><p>I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions about amendment No. 7.  As we know, it relates to the financial resolution that was passed and that is just now being put into statutory law to ensure that it does not lapse after the 90-day period, or whatever the number of days a financial resolution can last is.  I am conscious that none of us can predict where petrol and diesel prices will be in the coming months.  I saw that in my local garage yesterday diesel was up at 195 cent per litre.  I know that that can vary from area to area and that, depending on further sanctions, we could see different price increases and pressures over the coming period.  I am concerned that this measure will lapse on 1 September.  It may be appropriate that it lapse on 1 September if prices stabilise, but they could go in completely the wrong direction.  I am also conscious that the D&aacute;il does not sit usually on 1 September.  Therefore, if through the summer period petrol and diesel continue to rise as a result of international pressures, although it is to be hoped the war will be well over by then, there would be a challenge to deal with this.  I understand that the only way we could do this would be to reconvene the D&aacute;il and pass another financial resolution at that point in time.  I ask the Minister to speak to the fact that he has chosen 1 September as the date on which this lapses.  I am very conscious that there is normally no D&aacute;il sitting at that time, and I suggest that that may be the reason the date was chosen as opposed to dealing with the matter six weeks later in the budget.</p> <p>  I have a second question for the Minister.  He acknowledges that we could go further in respect of petrol and that another 10 cent could be cut off excise.  Nearly 11 cent could be cut off the excise duty on petrol without breaching the European rules in this regard.  Has any consideration been given, for example, to suspending temporarily the diesel rebate scheme and ensuring that all hauliers are able to avail of that 7.5 cent excise rebate, given it directly at the pump?  The benefit of that would be that not only would the hauliers - or certain hauliers because not all of them get the rebate - benefit from it but all other users of diesel would benefit as well.  That would be in compliance with the European rules, so there is a possibility there to reduce petrol by 10 cent more and diesel by 7.5 cent more by introducing a measure that would suspend the scheme where the rebate would have to be applied for.  The hauliers would still get that benefit because they get the rebate directly at the pumps, but every other user of diesel would also get it.</p> <p>  Another question I wish to come on to is about home heating oil and the fact that excise duty was not reduced on home heating oil.  In America there are advertisements that say "This ad was approved by the candidate".  I am not sure if the Minister approved the fake news Fine Gael put out saying there was no excise duty on home heating oil.  As we know, excise duty comes in the form of mineral oil tax, which has two components: a carbon component and a non-carbon component.  The document before us is very clear.  We can all read.  That issue, in fairness, has been cleared up, but the carbon component of the excise duty on home heating oil could and should be reduced, given the huge increase that has happened.  It should be reduced on a temporary basis to release the pressure on families.</p> <p>  Furthermore, in three weeks' time the Government plans to increase excise through further increases in carbon tax on gas and home heating oil and a number of other fuels.  The Taoiseach has said that that will be offset.  What is the financial measure the Government plans to bring forward in the next three weeks to offset this increase?  For example, home heating oil will go up by &euro;20 a fill.  What is the financial measure or legislative instrument the Government will use?  Will the Government use this legislation, with the D&aacute;il in recess for two weeks so there will be one week left before the Government's carbon tax increase kicks in?</p><p>Will the Minister give the committee clarity on the schedule because the schedule deals with the increase that will happen on 1 May?</p></speech>

It is certainly not my intention to go back to the Government and ask for the D&aacute;il to be recalled.  The thinking behind that date had nothing to do with whether the D&aacute;il was sitting or not.  I will certainly keep under review the pressures that continue in relation to petrol and diesel, and then decide what is the right step to take on the current excise reduction.</p> <p>  On the question regarding the diesel rebate scheme, the Deputy asked whether I gave any consideration to cancelling it and making the change he referred to.  I did not.  While I will always face calls to do more, as the Deputy is making of me, and I understand why, the measures we have brought in for both petrol and diesel are considerable and ensure that the increase all fuel users are facing is not as big as it otherwise would be.  I know that is cold comfort with the challenge many are facing, but a 9 cent to 13 cent reduction per litre is still a significant response and is a measure that is costing the State many hundreds of millions of euro.</p> <p>  As to where we are with home heating oil, and the increase in carbon tax that is due to that, the Deputy asked whether I gave any consideration to reducing the carbon share of that excise tax.  The Government is committed to going ahead with changes to carbon taxing.  The Deputy made the point about the multiple crises we are facing.  The additional crisis we are facing, as he well knows, is in regard to climate.  This week alone, the United Nations warned all of us that we have so little time left to avoid a catastrophic decline in our climate.  The revenue from carbon taxing continues to play a very valuable role in trying to mitigate the effect of that damage and to invest in the areas that might make some difference to us in the future.</p> <p>  On the off-sets that the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste referred to yesterday and how they will be implemented, I am working with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on that.  Of course I know the deadline is 1 May.  When we have decided what we will do in conjunction with the rest of the Cabinet, we will then be able to say what the legislative means will be, if needed, for implementing it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.866" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022040600002#E00300"><p>I asked for clarity in regard to that.  Will the Minister clarify that the carbon tax is not hypothecated in law, that there is not a magic pool of money where carbon tax goes into one section, that it goes into the Central Fund and that there is a policy decision to spend that resource on mitigation measures, which not all happen?  If the banking levy, which is reduced as a result of the Minister's decision in the Finance Act last year, was at the same level as last year, it could pay for the lost carbon tax of, for example, not increasing home heating oil costs on people who are really struggling.  Home heating oil has gone up &euro;1,600 per fill and the Minister will increase it by &euro;20.  If one were to look for a dictionary example of a government out of touch, this would be a good example.  This would be an example of a society in crisis, trying to heat their homes, keep their family safe, and the Government's response is to push up the cost of home heating oil further in three weeks' time.  The argument that if we do not do this, it will take away from retrofitting or other measures, is not actually the case because it is not hypothecated in law.  Therefore, other resources from tax resources, such as the banking levy, which should be restored to the level it was at last year, could be used to fill that gap.  That is the first issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the mitigation measures the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, are talking about, the Taoiseach gave a commitment that no person would be worse off as a result of the carbon tax increases.  Will the Minister give the committee that same commitment, that every person will be no worse off as a result of the increase he plans to make to home heating oil and gas in the next three weeks as a result of the increase in carbon tax?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.867" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022040600002#E00400"><p>If the Deputy wanted to open the dictionary and find an example of an opposition that has been dishonest, he would find Sinn F&eacute;in in the same dictionary.  Sinn F&eacute;in comes forward and claims it is serious about trying to make a difference to the potentially catastrophic decay of our climate, but it will not advocate any measure that is challenging in order to make a difference to that existential risk.  The Deputy knows that the majority of scientists and economists, who are trying to form a view as to what we can do to save our planet, are of the view that an increase in carbon taxation can play a role in doing that in conjunction with other measures.  The Deputy knows that.  He continues to make the case that such measures are not needed despite the level of challenge we are facing.  He makes the case that he wants to be honest and play a role in avoiding and reducing the climate change crisis we are facing, but he will not advocate a single measure that is challenging or difficult to do it.</p> <p>  I am being honest in acknowledging that if we are going to reshape our economy and help protect our society as we do it, in the face of environmental disaster, all the ways of doing it are not easy.  I do not take for one moment the Deputy's trite points regarding the Government being out of touch or not aware of the challenge people are facing.  Of course we are aware.  Of course I know.  Of course we appreciate the huge challenges that so many are facing due to the rising costs of energy and daily living.  Of course I appreciate that, but my appreciation of it cannot diminish the need for me to also be honest.  The honesty about what we face is that, because so much of what is happening is outside of our control, we cannot protect or cover all the cost in relation to it.  I am aware of the commitment the Taoiseach made in ensuring that nobody is worse off due to the changing carbon tax.  I will certainly work to bring forward measures to the Government that aim to do that.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about hypothecation, he is right in that it is not legally in place at present.  We have not set up such a fund, but it is also the case that every cent of the last three increases in carbon taxation have been set aside to go into measures to either help with the cost of fuel going up or to invest in things that could make a difference to our economy and society being able to manage climate change.</p> <p>  I think what the Deputy is suggesting in regard to his point on the bank levy is that if I had charged the bank levy for another year, I could have avoided some of the costs that are here.  However, these banks are going.  They are getting ready to leave.  When they leave, the bank levy they were paying will go with them, whereas the expenditure commitments I am referring to here that we will have to incur, particularly when it comes to climate change, many of them will be permanent.  With that in mind, using a bank levy revenue, even if I were to do what the Deputy has advocated, that might only be available for another year will not help with funding expenditures and needs that are likely to stretch way beyond that.</p></speech>

There is nothing trite about me, a representative, having been elected by the people of Donegal with a substantial mandate, raising the issue of people in my constituency who are facing poverty and increased poverty as a result of the measure the Minister is advocating.  He says that he understands how they are suffering, but he will push ahead with the measure and push up the cost of keeping their homes warm.</p> <p>  I do not know but maybe the Minister was outside the country in talking about the experts.  His expert who was appointed to the advisory group was on national radio saying that this carbon tax increase in three weeks' time should not go ahead.</p><p>This was because there is a recognition that the price is going through the roof.  Carbon taxes and behavioural taxes have a role to play in changing behaviours when there are other options available to people.  We have seen an increase in the cost of filling a tank of oil, which two thirds of households in the west and the north west, and one third of households in the State, use as the primary source of heating their homes.  The price increase of filling a tank of oil has nearly doubled since the start of the year.  If there was going to be a behavioural change it would be that.  The point is that the Minister lumping on another &euro;20 every time one fills a tank is just creating more misery.  It is not going to make people run out and move to an air-to-water system in the morning or move to underground heating.  Most of these families do not have that type of resource.</p><p> I will make the point again that the Government's own expert on climate advice is saying that this is not the time to increase carbon tax on heating a home.  The Minister's own backbenchers have a motion down before the parliamentary party tonight calling for the Minister to see sense.  At least there is some hope in Fine Gael that not all of them are out of touch, but by God, if the Minister is not out of touch, he is telling me that he understands what is happening out there and he is deciding to go ahead with &euro;20 increase in home heating oil in three weeks' time, despite the fact that Social Justice Ireland has stated that people are at breaking point.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, one-parent family organisations and people on the front line are telling us this time and again.  Comments are coming into my constituency office, and I am sure to the Minister's constituency office, that people are not putting on the heating because they simply cannot afford it.  Where does the Minister believe that people are going to get the extra &euro;20 in three weeks' time?  It is easy for the Minister.  It is easy for people who have been elected to the Oireachtas because we are well paid.  It is easy for Ministers who are sitting round the table who are well paid and well looked after with all of their Garda drivers and all of the rest to say "Look this is important and they will get through it somehow".  A lot of people will not get through it.  For a lot of people, this is the breaking point.  The Government's role here is to protect people from the worst edges.  I am not suggesting that the Minister can do everything but he can do a lot more.  The very least that the Minister should do is do no more harm.  Yet, this is what he plans to do in three weeks' time by increasing the cost of home heating oil, by increasing the cost of gas, and by increasing the costs on these families and workers in trying to keep their homes safe and trying to keep their homes warm.</p></speech>

The Deputy is deliberately looking, again and again, to create the image of some kind of cosseted elite who are making decisions with the deliberate consequence of trying to add hardship and do harm to those we are privileged to serve.  The tone, the words, and the way the Deputy describes those who are privileged to be in Cabinet and to be members of the Government, is all about trying to drive a wedge between those of us who are privileged to be in government and those we serve through being in government.  That is what the Deputy is doing.  It is a clearly defined and clearly thought-out tactic, which I am not having any of.</p></speech>

Let me tell the Deputy that there are no pedestals over here.  I am trying to get the balance right between decisions that I know are needed to help our country in the years to come, to deal with trying to avoid the collapse of our environment and our biodiversity and to help in the here and now with the challenges and hardships that are here, which are created by the war and created by inflationary pressure.  I accept that these will be added to by changes the Government is trying to make to help to deal with where we are with climate.  This is what I am trying to do.  I am trying to get that balance right.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty referred to experts and to me being out of the country.  Did the Deputy have his radio off yesterday when we heard the chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council say this change is needed?  Is the Deputy aware of that?  The experts the Deputy refers to, including the person who chairs the panel that advises the Government, said that on balance, a change like this is needed and can play a role to fund the kinds of things we will need to do to help avoid the scale of climate challenge that we could yet face.  This is what the experts said.  I know that the Deputy is aware of the majority of expert advice that says these are part of the changes that are needed.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, have made a commitment that will bring forward measures that would aim to mitigate the effect of this on many at a time of difficulty.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I will do it.  Deputy Doherty must not think that he will get away with trying to delegitimise or challenge the intentions of those of us who are in government and are trying to do our best to represent those who are in need at the time of great challenge.  We understand that.  We understand the challenge we are facing.  Deputy Doherty does not have a monopoly on compassion and he certainly does not have a monopoly in understanding the kind of changes coming up that are needed in respect of climate.  The Government will, in the next few weeks, bring forward measures that will do as the Taoiseach has outlined.</p></speech>

I am glad that he has made a U-turn.  Maybe the Minister's backbenchers are getting him to be a little bit more in touch with where ordinary people are at.  The penny is dropping.</p></speech>

He will now increase it again, back to &euro;138.17.  As agri-diesel is generally purchased in tanks, most farmers and contractors will have had, at best, one fill in which they benefited from the reduction.  The Minister has given the sector, which is under huge pressure and struggling, as referenced and acknowledged by the Government, seven weeks of respite.  His intention, however, on 1 May is to restore the rate of mineral oil tax as it applies to agri-diesel to what it was on 9 March.</p></speech>

On 9 March 2022, the income derived by the Government from mineral oil tax on agricultural diesel amounted to &euro;138.17.  The Government made a measure on 10 March that reduced that to &euro;120.55.  On 1 May, the Government's take will increase to &euro;138.17 again, back to where it was on 9 March, and on 1 September it will increase to &euro;158.50.  These figures are not affected by the war in Ukraine, international factors or global influences.  This is the money the Government is charging on agricultural diesel.</p> <p>  Much of the discussion the Minister had with Deputy Doherty was on the benefits or otherwise of carbon tax.  A core benefit of that tax, we were told, was to change people's behaviour.  What alternative does the Government propose for farmers to the use of tractors and other vehicles using agricultural diesel?</p></speech>

If I had not put in place the measures included in this finance Bill, the increase in excise would have been from &euro;120 to &euro;158.50.</p></speech>

I wish to be really clear about that.  In the absence of the action I have taken, the increase would have been considerably larger.  That is all I claimed at the time and all I claim now.  That is not logic in my mind.  It is not my facts or the Deputy's facts, but the facts as laid out in this legislation.</p> <p>  Our farmers and farming community play an incredible role in looking after our economy and growing the food we need.  They are entitled to a double deduction for the carbon tax element of farm diesel costs.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of that.</p></speech>

I accept that for many in our farming community at the moment, the alternative to diesel-fuelled tractors is not readily available.  I know that is the case but that is why the Government has tried to help with other costs in relation to our farmers, for example, through the double income tax relief on carbon and the supports made available by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, at other points, such as with regard to the tillage sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.916" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022040600002#G02300"><p>The Minister said "not readily available"  Can I take it that is his term for "does not exist"?  The only alternative to farmers using tractors, in terms of technology, is not to produce the food they are producing.</p> <p>  On the double taxation relief measures the Minister mentioned, I am sure he is aware, because Deputy Doherty and I have raised the issue, of farm contractors carrying out an increasing level of the work taking place on our farms.  They do not avail of that measure, despite the fact they carry out agricultural work.   The Minister's Department committed that a review into that matter would be completed by the end of 2019.  We are approaching the middle of 2022.  What is the Minister's latest excuse for not having that review done?</p></speech>

I remind the Deputy, whose understanding of these matters may not be as clear as others, as he said to me earlier, that when it comes to carbon taxing, because of the tax relief in place for farmers, they have been able to claim back the tax increases that have happened in carbon since 2012.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of that.</p></speech>

Despite the difficulty so many in our farming community face at the moment, the majority of members of that community are still able to claim the tax reliefs available in our Finance Acts.  I reiterate the support that is there at the moment.  I know it is needed.  The review of contractors is under way and I expect it to be completed in advance of the budget.</p></speech>

It has been promoted at EU and domestic level that farmers pool resources and apply contractors and that, as opposed to having huge vehicles and machines lying idle on their lands for long periods, they contract somebody to carry out the work across a larger number of farms.  They have been doing that.  Does the Minister accept it is regrettable that a move in this area has not been made before now?  Does he accept that the increases in carbon taxes that will apply on 1 May and, in a double whammy, on 1 September as a result of the reversal of the temporary measures, constitute, in effect, an additional charge on farmers, one which they have no alternative but to bear?</p></speech>

It is through my recognition of the challenges that contractors are facing that this review is underway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.926" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022040600002#H00200"><p>I might beg the indulgence of the Minister and Chairman for a few moments because my question does not relate directly to excise duty but to additional factors that inform the cost to the consumer of fuel and energy.  Many of us, at least those of us on the Opposition benches, have been arguing for some months that the Government should seek a derogation from the VAT directive to allow the State to reduce VAT rates on fuel and energy for a period of time.  This derogation could ensure that the VAT rate would not go up to 23% on the conclusion of that mitigating measure.  We know the Central Bank has estimated that inflation may peak at 8% this year.  This could be a conservative estimate.  The Exchequer returns today are very impressive given the current context.  Income and corporation tax and VAT receipts are up considerably on comparable months, namely, the first quarter of 2019 pre-pandemic.  VAT receipts are up by 17%, which is significant in anyone's language.  It is fair to say that a significant composition of the increase in VAT receipts comprises VAT charged on the increased costs of fuel and energy for householders and businesses.  There is a strong case and policy rationale for some of that VAT windfall to returned to the pockets of those who need it most.  Many of us on the Opposition benches have been arguing for the Government to seek a derogation from the VAT directive at European Commission level and it seems as if some headway has been made in that regard in recent weeks.  Could the Minister update the committee on what headroom is available to him in respect of the potential reduction in VAT?  My interpretation of the Taoiseach's remarks in recent days about mitigation measures leads me to believe that the Government may be considering a reduction in VAT on fuel and energy on a temporary basis.  Will the Minister confirm that this is under consideration by him and his Government colleagues and let us know when he expects to make a decision on the mitigation measures the Taoiseach remarked upon in recent days?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-06a.927" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022040600002#H00300"><p>Regarding Exchequer returns, I acknowledge that VAT receipts for the first quarter - in fairness to Deputy Nash, he used the base of 2019 as opposed to that of 2020 or 2021 - are strong.  However, I would make the case that if we look at where we are with excise, we can see it is down.  Excise is down for a number of reasons.  The first is that we have cut the rate of excise, therefore, we would expect to see excise tax receipts fall.  However, we have some concerns that this is the first tax head that is being affected by consumption within our economy beginning to change as the price of something goes up.  While Deputy Nash is not suggesting that the outlook in our public finances for the rest of the year is rosy, I still want to make the point that if we accept, and I do, that living standards are under pressure and many are facing real struggles, that is not consistent with tax collection or tax receipts across this year getting better as the year goes on.  I expect that as we move through the year, we will face challenges with regard to additional costs to which we must respond.  Next week, we will publish the stability programme update that will outline our best thinking regarding where we are with tax collection and growth for 2022.  There is no more flexibility available to me than when I announced the set of measures contained in the Finance Bill a few weeks ago.  In the ECOFIN meeting yesterday, I raised the case for flexibility for clarification regarding what is possible both under this and future VAT directives and that is being considered by the Commission.  I expect it will be some time before I get an answer and can understand whether that answer will be of help.  I have no further VAT flexibility available to me now than when I announced the measures contained in this Bill.</p></speech>

To what extent do we respond when energy companies such as the electricity, petrol and diesel suppliers seek or propose an increase?  How do we react to that?  Do we test it or accept it as being normal?  Do we accept the suppliers' word that it is part of the ongoing situation that automatically arises out of the war in Ukraine or do we test it?  Are there means of testing it?  If so, to what extent do we exercise those means?  I have experience of seeing five, six and seven container ships anchored offshore in various heavy ports across Europe waiting.  When I inquired about it, I was told they were waiting for the price of energy to rise, which is interesting.  In order for us to know how best to deal with the situation, for example, a container ship going askew in the Suez Canal, to what extent do we attribute the fuel price increases to that?  Has this been done?</p></speech>

All I would say is the fact that every other economy is facing rising prices for energy coming through from a variety of energy suppliers points to the fact that the pressures relating to the cost and availability of fuel are real.  If we were the only country facing exceptional increases, there would be some concern regarding how energy is being supplied to us and at what cost but that is not the case.  Every other economy in Europe and across the world is facing these kind of challenges.  I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and his regulators will take time to see if there is any evidence of anything local having an impact on the prices about which we are concerned.</p></speech>

It leads me to my next point, which is that this strategy was adopted in the 1970s and 1980s.  The response to the request for information as to why increases were happening was a suggestion that everybody was doing it as a precaution.  I do not accept that.  I believe we need to test everything, particularly at the moment, because there is a grave danger of energy companies off-loading their concerns leading to a real negative impact on consumers, be they householders or other users of diesel, including farmers, fishermen or fisherwomen etc.  There is a grave danger that energy companies can succeed in off-loading the increased prices and it then becomes part of our way of life.</p><p>I do not accept that, at all.  I strongly support the idea that we have to justify everything, especially in times of crisis such as the present.  I compliment Deputy Doherty on his knowledge of the goings-on at the Fine Gael Parliamentary arty meeting.  He should come along some time for the fun of it, just for the photos.</p></speech>

However, we need to deal with this part because it is not sufficient to say there is a worldwide trend of increasing energy.  That is fine, but the worldwide trend then becomes the driving force as opposed to the necessity.  I am looking for the necessity.</p> <p>  There is another issue that needs to be dealt with by all parties in the House.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is right in that we have been very lax in our delivery of alternative energy.  Ten, 12, 14 or 15 years ago, politicians of all hues in the House made great capital out of supporting people who were in opposition to wind turbines and onshore and offshore wind farms and the opposition still goes on.  At the present time, I am intoning that the level of investment, either in onshore, offshore or other alternative energy, is far short of what is required.  We need to take that issue on board and enable the areas that are capable of providing the alternatives to do so without imposing negatively on the consumer.  It should not impose on the consumer.  What are the Minister's comments on that, apart from Deputy Doherty attending the Fine Gael meeting?</p></speech>

There is no doubt at all that if we want to increase our energy security, not to mention respond to the great challenge of climate change, all of those agendas point in the same direction of increasing our renewable energy capacity.  That is why the legislation is being brought forward and has been passed by the Oireachtas.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is now very energetic in trying to accelerate the delivery of those kinds of energy sources off our coasts.</p></speech>

However, I contend that the level of investment so far with regard to onshore or offshore energy alternatives is far short of what is required to meet the targets to which we have committed.  I am surprised the Opposition has not raised this issue because, in many cases, it was very vocal in its opposition to the provision of the necessary investment and was repeatedly to the fore in its objections and alleged concern about some of these issues.</p></speech>

That is why the legislation the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has piloted through the Oireachtas is so important.  It aims to bring clarity to the licensing regime off our shores.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Government will do what we can to try to encourage private sector investment to locate in a greater amount off our coasts.</p></speech>

It would also serve to meet the criticisms in some quarters that we have not done our job to the extent to which we should have.</p> <p>  It would also alert politicians to the fact that, when they oppose such proposals of investment in wind farms, solar farms or whatever, in terms of alternatives, onshore wind turbines are the cheapest to provide and the cheapest electricity to produce.  Offshore, it gets a bit more vague and expensive.  Some of it may not materialise at all.  It may not be feasible.  That is on the basis of countless attempts to do so all over the world.  The point at issue at this stage is how far we can tell the consumer that everything is in order to provide the alternatives in early days without bringing the economy to a halt.  That is not a criticism of any government, Minister or Department.</p></speech>

We will do that.  The Deputy is right.  We are not where we want to be in terms of having access to more renewable energy.  We need to do better than we are doing at present.  This is why I go back to the importance of the legislative change that has just been made.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, that change will end up with an agency the role of which will be to try to deliver what the Deputy calls for.  More important than the agency has been that a great many issues needed clarification with regard to our marine foreshore and its licensing and planning.  The legislation the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, brought forward had been years in the making, has been long called for, and has now happened.  I hope that lays the foundation for making the kind of progress the Deputy wants to see happen.</p></speech>

The section allows for no duty of excise chargeable on the special exemption licences, basically, the late licences, for events in respect of dates falling within the period.

It is a live issue today because of what is happening and I take the opportunity to raise it with the Minister.  I have also raised with the Taoiseach previously.  What is happening in Killybegs is a disgrace.  The Minister needs to take an interest in this sector.  There are companies, that, in fairness, have been supported by Enterprise Ireland and other State agencies, and which are employing individuals, that are at risk if this practice that is happening in Killybegs continues with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA.  The companies are in dispute as to how fish should be weighed when it comes onto the pier.</p> <p>  We have a particular issue with whitefish.  Whitefish has to remain in water.  Otherwise it cannot be used for human consumption.  We had a Danish vessel coming in on Friday.  The SFPA stated that they had to weigh a particular way, which meant it would be brought out of the water.  That meant it could not be used for human consumption and would only have to be used as fishmeal.  The Danish vessel went away and decided not to land.</p> <p>  Yesterday, we had a Norwegian vessel with 950 tonnes of fish on board.  The Norwegian vessel was told the same.  Prevented from landing, it went away.  It landed today at Derry port.  Derry port operates under the same EU regulations as Killybegs port because of the protocol.  The 950 tonnes have been offloaded at Derry port.  At the minute, there is a convoy of 40 lorryloads of fish carrying 950 tonnes travelling down from Derry back to Killybegs to get that fish processed.  We talked about the environment and the need to do more.  That is the height of stupidity.  Not only that, 56 workers were let go yesterday in the factory because they had no work for them because the fish did not land.  The Danish vessel is gone.  Another Norwegian vessel turned around and is away back to Norway because they heard about the craic that is going on in Killybegs.  If this gets out, as it is getting out, there could be long-term reputational damage.  This issue needs to be resolved.  Thankfully, there is a solution.  The industry itself has developed a weighing mechanism that the High Court has ruled can be used if it is externally approved.  It really needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  The issue in this section is interlinked with how the fishing industry is dealt with.  It is about the tax treatment of the decommissioning scheme.  An announcement was made on funding being provided by the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund to tie up vessels and this funding was to cover quota cuts.  There were quota cuts as a result of Brexit, vessels had to be tied up, and under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, money was made available.  Now we learn that, under this decommissioning scheme which is separate to this, the money that was provided to those who are in the decommissioning scheme, which is basically getting rid of their vessels for the tie up because of the loss of their quota, will be deducted.  This is not the way to treat this industry.  You cannot give with one hand and take with the other.  It is not fair.  There needs to be a proper approach to this industry.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn, my party's spokesperson on fisheries, is passionate about this, as is the industry itself.</p> <p>  I would raise with the Minister the need for him and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to sit down and look at how this scheme is operating from both a fisheries and a taxation point of view.  There are seven or eight companies based in Killybegs that do not process fish at all; they service boats.  The boats that they service are in the Irish fleet, but they also service Norwegian and Danish boats.  If they are not coming in, they have no boats to service.  There is an engineering capability.  It is fantastic that they are at the cutting edge but they are losing out as a result of what is happening in Killybegs.  That is three vessels in four days that turned around.  That is a serious issue.  It needs to be resolved quickly because the message is going out that Killybegs is not a welcome port for these foreign vessels and they are making a decision to not spend a day steaming in to Letterkenny and using up diesel - we know the cost of diesel at present - on the off-chance that they will not be able to land and that they will go back to Norway or go to Scotland or wherever they go.</p> <p>  The worst thing is I understand most of the blue whiting that was on Danish vessel was going to west Africa because it is a good fish, and it is a cheap fish for west Africa.  It is now going for fishmeal because once the water is taken out of it, it does not last and it will only be used as fishmeal.  Some of it was going to Ukraine as well.  It is ridiculous what is happening and it needs to be sorted out quickly.</p></speech>

This issue has been the subject of engagement through the consultation committee between the SFPA and the local industry that the Deputy mentioned.</p> <p>  I was not aware this matter would be raised.  I appreciate it is an important matter.  While the SFPA is an independent body of Government and, obviously, of me, I will certainly ask for a report on the matter because I am aware of the significant asset that is Killybegs and the scale of technology and expertise that is there.  It is important not only to the local Donegal economy but also to our maritime sector.  I will ask my officials and my Department will raise this matter and ask for an update on it.  The SFPA is independent but, nonetheless, it is a matter that I will look to understand more.</p> <p>  On the point the Deputy made regarding the fact that any aid received by a vessel owner under the Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme is deducted from the owner's decommissioning payment, I understand that this is a requirement of the state aid approval process for this scheme.</p><p>It is a requirement that has been made by the Commission to ensure that the scheme is consistent with state aid policy.</p></speech>

My final point on this is that it was the subject of a High Court ruling.  We know that the Commission's rule is clear, in that it can be either the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, that oversees the weighing of fish - currently, it performs spot checks on 5% of the total catch - or it can be done by a third party.  The industry, which developed this machine at great cost to weigh this type of fish without destroying the fish - the fish are taken out of the water quickly, weighed and then put back into water - is willing to give the machine to the SFPA and the SFPA would run it.  Given that the High Court has stated that the machine can be used as long as it is independently calibrated, there is a solution.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's statement that he will take an interest in this matter, given the importance of the sector, particularly to the region in question.  On the week that the town becomes a university town, with Letterkenny IT becoming a part of the Atlantic Technological University, this story is taking away from that positivity and potentially from the engine that drives the area and its hinterland.</p></speech>

The SFPA is independent of the Government, but it sounds like the Deputy has raised an important matter.  I will ask for an update on it.  My departmental officials have put a great deal of work into this section because the issue had been raised by the sector with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We knew that we needed to make progress on the matter in the context of Brexit's impact on the sector.  That is why we made the decision to deal with this maritime matter in this Bill.  We would not normally do that and would instead wait until budget day.  However, we appreciate that this issue is important to the sector.  In that spirit, I will try to find out a little more about the issue that the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>
