It is due to the fact that a vote has just been called in the Seanad and some members have had to rush off.  Other members are involved in votes at various committees so they will come in and out of the meeting.</p><p>I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  I am very grateful that the Ambassador of Austria, Dr. Helmut Freudenschuss, is with us today.  We are very pleased to have this engagement with him at a very important time.  We congratulate Austria on assuming the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on Sunday last.  We are delighted to have the ambassador with us today.  The Presidency is an important role.  As I stated previously to the ambassador and others, we appreciate the role played by ambassadors and the engagement they have with the committee.  We believe it to be very important and we take it very seriously.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite the ambassador to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Helmut Freudenschuss" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018070400002#G00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman, for your kind words.  I will start by paraphrasing what President Juncker said in the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago.  If my speech is a bit slurred it is not because I am drunk, it is because I have a problem with my gums, but I would prefer to be drunk.<br/><br/>My diplomatic career has lasted almost 40 years but today is the first time I have been invited to address parliamentarians.  That is an honour which I appreciate, but also a challenge to which I will attempt to rise.  I am not sure whether it is still politically correct to quote Woody Allen but he once famously said 90% of success is just showing up, so here I am, and so is my deputy, Ms Stephanie Winckler.  I remember very well the first Austrian Presidency in 1998, just three years after we joined the European Union.  I was then in charge of helping to co-ordinate Austria's participation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  It was all very exciting.  During Austria's second Presidency in 2006, I was ambassador to South Africa, which was demanding but less exciting.  Then came the Lisbon treaty of 2009, which brought a permanent President of the European Council, a High Representative for Foreign Policy and a strengthening of the role of the European Parliament, all of which led to a reduction of the responsibilities and possibilities of the Presidency.  Now we are entering into our third Presidency.<br/><br/>Contrary to some of my esteemed colleagues who have appeared here, I do not propose to go into great detail today because I would prefer to listen to the comments of members and, if possible, to try to answer some of their questions.  Austria views her role as Presidency primarily as a mutual broker and attaches great importance to the unity of the European Union.  This applies in particular to the major challenge of concluding the Brexit negotiations, despite the fact that the Presidency has no direct role in them.  It will also be in line with our traditional role as a bridge builder that we will approach the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework post 2020.  This task will not be an easy one, especially since Austria has already declared that we do not want to pay more than we do now.<br/><br/>I will now move to our priorities.  We have chosen the motto, A Europe that Protects, for our Presidency, and we want to give substance to this slogan in three areas.  The first is security and the fight against illegal migration, which can only be effective if we act jointly.  At the centre of these efforts are a reform of the common European asylum system, which is certainly not an easy task, and the strengthening of Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, with up to 10,000 personnel by 2020 compared with the current strength of 1,500.  We should also work more closely with third countries to provide assistance to those in need of protection before they enter the European Union and in order to ensure effective return policies.  Last week's European Council called for regional disembarkation platforms outside the European Union and four controlled centres inside EU member states.  However, it remains to be seen how that can be achieved.<br/><br/>Another complication is the plan by the CDU and CSU parties in Germany to establish so-called transit centres near the border with Austria and to send back those already registered elsewhere or those who are not entitled to asylum.  We are awaiting more clarification from our German colleagues and we will take the matter from there.<br/><br/>The second area where we want to give meat or substance to a Europe that protects is securing prosperity and competitiveness - that is a tongue-twister - through digitalisation, which means, <i>inter alia</i>, completing the digital Single Market and modernising public administration.<br/><br/>Members will not like the next bit, but I have to say it.  The Austrian Presidency will also aim to continue the work on the taxation of the digital economy to ensure that profits are taxed in the country in which they are generated.<br/><br/>The third area is stability in the European neighbourhood.  Building on the excellent work of the Bulgarian Presidency and the European Commission's enlargement strategy of February 2018, we will advocate for a concrete EU perspective for all western Balkan or south-eastern European states.<br/><br/>Finally, we look forward to the report and recommendations of the task force on subsidiarity, which is supposed to be published in the course of this month, and we plan to hold a high level conference on subsidiarity in November of this year.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming here today.  We very much appreciate the ambassador's presence before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018070400002#H00200"><p>Like the Chairman, I welcome the ambassador and wish him and his country well during the Presidency.  We are familiar with each other from having been on the European circuit over the years.  We have even been known to cross one another's paths on the football circuit from time to time.  All of the times in Europe have been trying times, none more so than the present time.  The issues the ambassador has raised are testing but Brexit is the big one because Europe cannot be the same again after Brexit.  We will never know what it will be like in the future.  We hear people say they want to go back to the good old days.  It is not clear which of the good old days are being referred to but I presume it is the first half of the 20th century.  I am not certain to which part of those good old days we want to go back.   When I say "we", some other countries in Europe, not necessarily only the British, have also expressed thoughts along those lines.</p> <p>  We in this country are very committed to the European Union.  The most recent opinion poll showed 92% of Irish people were committed to the EU, which is the highest or second highest in the European Union.  The EU is of great importance to smaller countries, which never really emerged from the economic shadows until the European Union became a reality.  The secret of their success is that in the EU they became independent and protected and there were no trade barriers or other barriers.  There are some people in Europe who want closer co-operation and some people who want less co-operation.  My question, in circumstances in which we set out to pursue the views of each individual state on the extent to which they want to be able to determine future policy in Europe, is how we are to get 27 member states to have a uniform opinion.  That is a contradictory and impossible objective.</p> <p>  Be that as it may, there are considerable grounds for believing we have been successful.  As the ambassador knows, we have a peace process in Northern Ireland, which continues to be helped by the European Union.  It came at the end of 30 years of guerilla warfare, during which time many thousands of lives were lost and great division occurred on the island of Ireland.  These generally faded away into insignificance as the island became one economic entity.  Taxation operated in terms of a single economy from the point of view of being part of the European Union and no border existed.  This has become a challenge for us insofar as a return to the old days would have a serious and negative economic impact on the country.  This is one of the issues on which Ireland has taken a very strong line with respect to Brexit and will continue to do so.  I compliment the European institutions, Mr. Michel Barnier and all of those involved in the Brexit negotiations on the manner in which they have conducted those negotiations on behalf of the European Union.</p> <p>  We have no antipathy towards the United Kingdom.  The UK took the decision to leave the European Union.  Sadly, some of the information made available to British people before they made that decision was inaccurate.  Some of the people who conveyed those inaccuracies to the public had been committed to undermining the European Union during their entire time in the European Parliament.  We are now in a position in which we have to live with whatever decisions are made.  We will make the best of this and continue to make a strong contribution to the European Union and its ideals.</p> <p>  I remind people of the vision of Europe held by the founding fathers - Schuman, Adenauer, Monnet and others.  In the Europe they envisaged at that time they saw an alternative to the chaos and destruction of the first 50 years of the 20th century.  They were right and will be proven to be right.  As I said the other day, the European Union was the biggest single peace process the world has ever known.  Some 550 million people are involved in a commitment to each other, to peace and to prosperity.  It is a commitment never known before in the history of Europe.  We have done very well.  The challenge for the future is to continue on the route or path laid down by Europe's founding fathers.  It is up to ourselves.  If we want to nitpick and go back to where we were, we know where that will lead.  History has repeated itself many times and unfortunately will continue to do so.  </p> <p>  I hope that, under the guidance of the Austrian Presidency, we will progress and perhaps the UK will have second thoughts.  Perhaps at some stage in the not too distant future the UK will decide Brexit was not a good idea and will revisit the issue.  That would be the best outcome.  The worst outcome would be a harsh Brexit that leads to a trade war in which countries, big and small, and their populations suffer.  Employment would also suffer and economies would suffer to such an extent that it would be patently obvious to all that the decisions made by some people were not in the interests of the people.</p> <p>  We keep in mind the need for enlargement of the European Union.  The western Balkans come to mind.  The area has always been one of contention in the past for one reason or another.  We must keep that in mind and we must be supportive of the thrust of European unity for as long as it takes.</p> <p>  I was glad the ambassador brought up the issue of digital taxation because I also have a view on it.  I do not disagree with him.  Taxation should occur in the countries in which the profit is made, not in some other country.  I resent that Ireland is deemed to be liable for the collection of taxation for the countries in which the profit was made.  That is a matter for the individual member states.  While it is being approached by the European Union at the moment under the heading of state aid, that is tendentious as far as we are concerned.  The theory that somebody will give us &euro;19 billion or &euro;13 billion of a windfall is grand thinking, but that is as far as it goes.  It is like the Tobin tax.  It is great if everybody does it, but if one country decides on its own to have a capital transaction tax or something like that, nobody will transact any capital in that country if other countries are free of that particular entrapment.  </p> <p>  I wish Austria well in the course of its Presidency of the Council.  I hope that the end of this year will see a better outcome for Brexit than appears will be the case at present.  We hope Austria's influence in the centre of Europe will be sufficient to convince all of our colleagues that together we stand and divided we fall.</p></speech>

I note in the ambassador's presentation that he raised migration, which is an issue that interests me and to which I try to refer every time I get an opportunity.  I regard migration as more important and pressing than Brexit because it has the capacity to break our Union and to bring it to its knees in a very short space of time if we do not take it on as a collective.  That means less in the way of barbed wire and borders and more in the way of co-operation as we go forward.  That is not to say that I am advocating an open door policy for anybody who wants to come.  We have to manage what is happening.</p><p>We have to take the traffickers out of the equation.  It is wrong in every sense of the word that traffickers can make money out of human misery.</p><p>When I went to Sicily we found that 93% of those who had landed could not reasonably have been classified as refugees and should more reasonably have been classified as economic migrants.  Europe has to have a place for economic migrants.  It has to have a place where we can upskill people from Third World countries and send them back home to improve their own economies.  I am not advocating an attack on the human rights of people.  I am advocating that as a Union we recognise our moral responsibilities.  The current plan of having disembarkation stations on the north African coast is doomed before it starts.  I am not sure how we will manage it but the middle of the Mediterranean is not the place.  I have huge issues with where we are going on that.</p><p> Allied with the migration issue is the issue of what I would term as soft terrorism.  From my observations in Italy, people arriving at a refugee or migrant station can declare they are anybody they want to be and can adopt an entirely new persona.  They can leave their past and their history behind them.  It is understandable that in some cases that will be the case.  People depart at speed sometimes to save their own lives.  We will have to find a better way of categorising people and establishing some sort of background on where they came from.  It is a serious challenge for the Austrian Presidency of the European Union as we go forward.  To a certain degree, the migration crisis has become slightly more controlled than it was but we still have a long way to go.</p><p> I would like to see policies developed or at least commenced under the Austrian Presidency so that we offer training, upskilling and repatriation and encourage the corporate world to invest in these countries.  They are all prepared to invest.  There are several examples in Ireland of footloose companies that pulled out, leaving 1,000 people unemployed in Ireland, and moved to places like China, Morocco and other places where they could get cheap labour.  The polo shirt or pair of runners one buys on the high street is no cheaper as a result of these companies moving to cheaper labour sources.  Clearly, there are supernormal profits being made by these companies.  I note the ambassador's interest in taxation.  I always love when foreign diplomats come here and have great interest in taxation just like we Irish do.  Maybe we should be looking at the corporate world to get some of the taxation from it.</p><p> There are many other issues we will have an opportunity to discuss over the next six months but I wish the ambassador well.  Leaving Brexit aside, which we always talk about in this room and I am sure Deputy Durkan has mentioned it many times, and although it is a huge issue, there are other problems that are much deeper and have the capacity to do far more damage.  I wish the ambassador well and I look forward to the policies coming forward.</p><p> I am sorry again for being late.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018070400002#J00200"><p>Like my colleague, I had to vote in the Seanad.  I welcome the ambassador, his colleague and other officials and representatives of other embassies in Ireland.</p> <p>  I will represent the committee on Monday in Vienna at the COSAC meeting.  I will be fully briefed on the priorities of the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  That is the first item on the agenda.  Ms Karoline Edtstadler, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior will be there.  I look forward to going to Vienna again.  It is a beautiful city.  I have been there before.</p> <p>  The ambassador is very experienced and is coming at a very crucial time.  He has long experience of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, so he will be in a very good position to assist and guide us in the very difficult waters we will be travelling through.</p> <p>  I looked at the attendance list for the COSAC meeting.  I hope the United Kingdom is not pulling out prematurely from participation in the European Union.  Will the ambassador confirm that?  He might not have the list but I do not see any attendees from the House of Commons or the House of Lords.  It will be very disappointing.  I was hoping to meet our colleagues there.  Maybe the list has not been finalised.  I am not quite sure about it but from the list that was circulated I cannot see the participation of the United Kingdom.  The COSAC meeting is a great opportunity to meet and discuss the future with our colleagues from the United Kingdom even though we are not negotiators.  Mr. Barnier is negotiating on behalf of the European Union and Mr. David Davis is in charge for the United Kingdom.  I am subject to correction.  My view of it was cursory.  It has happened before.  During the previous presidency there were no representatives of the United Kingdom Government there.  I hope it is the case that they have not finalised their numbers yet.  Normally there would be embassy representatives there too.</p> <p>  The next six months will be crucial.  There will be a crucial meeting in Chequers on Friday.  We hope the British Government will come up with very reasonable requests in the negotiations.  We do not want to go through the process but we are very concerned because there will be collateral damage as a result of what is happening at the moment.  As an island off an island off mainland Europe, we are the most affected.  I will not go into that detail.  We will discuss it on Monday in Vienna.</p> <p>  I welcome the ambassador to the meeting and thank him for coming.  I am sure we will have other dialogue in the next six months of the Presidency.  I have no doubt Austria will take a very practical approach to the Brexit negotiations to assist us in our situation.  The ambassador will be able to convey to Vienna the reality on the ground.  The ambassador has experience of the Northern Ireland situation, the Border, the 500 km and the 300 openings.  There is no better man to represent the views of Ireland to the Austrian Government than the ambassador.</p></speech>

Migration has become a big challenge since the European Council meeting last week.  Does the ambassador believe an agreement, understanding or some better way forward can be found during the Austrian Presidency?  It is vital.  It is something that comes up as a serious problem at different times.  For once and for all there has to be a sound and sensible solution to the migration problem and to controlling and containing it and having a solution that is acceptable to everybody.  I am interested in the ambassador's views on that.</p> <p>  In planning for enlargement, does the ambassador believe there will be an agreement reached during the Austrian Presidency with regard to the future enlargement of the EU and the issues, complications, debating and negotiations that will have to take place in advance of anything like that?  Does the ambassador see agreement being reached?  I am very interested.  I like to see people doing their work and plotting and planning their work.  I have been going through the ambassador's work programme for the six months of the Austrian Presidency.  It is certainly an impressive document by any stretch of the imagination and one that shows the ambassador will hit the ground running.  The programme of work is very impressive.  I am also very interested in the planned conference on subsidiarity.  Does the ambassador think he will be inviting representatives from national parliaments to attend that conference?  It is an important issue.  How many players will be invited to give their views and considerations from their experience of the issue?</p> <p>  Austria is very like Ireland.  It is a medium-sized country.</p><p>How will medium-sized countries like Austria and Ireland fare in areas such as trade, tourism and agriculture after Brexit?  Will we survive the knock of Brexit?  Will we continue to grow as we have done in the past 40 years?  Austria and Ireland have changed and evolved a great deal in 40 years.

I should have mentioned, also in partial reply to the remarks made by the Chairman, that Austria's Federal Chancellor Kurz will visit Dublin on Sunday to meet the Taoiseach.  It is the Chancellor's first visit outside of Austria since the country took over the Presidency, which shows the excellent and close relationship he and the Taoiseach have.  After he meets the Taoiseach on Sunday he will travel to the Border on Monday to see the situation there at first hand.  I am sure the Taoiseach will use the opportunity to explain Ireland's position in more detail.  I am sure the Chancellor, in turn, will inform the Taoiseach how he intends to proceed, especially on the tricky issue of migration, and follow up on last week's European Council meeting which addressed the issue of disembarkation platforms.  The Senator's question on whether the platforms will ever be established is a good one because so far no north African country has agreed to them.</p> <p>  I can answer the Chairman's question on whether enlargement is possible during Austrian's Presidency of the European Union with an emphatic "No".  We would be happy to reach agreement on starting negotiations with a couple of countries.  Serbia, Albania and northern Macedonia spring to mind but we are a long way from a concrete enlargement.</p> <p>  The Chairman suggested that parliamentarians should be invited to the high-level conference on subsidiarity.  I will, if I may, pass on his very good suggestion to Vienna.  Subsidiarity is a question for parliamentarians as well as members of governments. </p> <p>  The Chairman asked whether medium-sized countries will survive Brexit.  We will survive Brexit but not all medium-sized countries are in the same boat.  Certainly, the consequences of a hard Brexit would be more severe for people in Ireland than for us in Austria.  I imagine Austria would be in big trouble if Germany were to leave the EU.  Ireland and Austria are in a similar position but not an identical one.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked me to predict what will be the position in the European Union and Europe in the next 40 years.  If I knew I would be a rich man.  Unfortunately, I do not know and I will not dare to make a prediction.</p></speech>

As I indicated to Mr. Timmermans at a conference some months ago, we must also extend the hand of the European Union to the regions or local authorities because there is a tendency to deal with national parliaments only.  The problem is that the Union has difficulty in connecting with citizens.  The closest we can get to citizens is through regional or local authorities.  Representatives of local and regional authorities should be invited to attend the conference, even if it is only a token number.</p> <p>  Members of the European Commission have visited the Oireachtas.  Civil servants who work for the Commission should engage directly with local authorities in order that we bring all elected representatives into the family that is the Union we are trying to strengthen.  We have a great deal of work to do to strengthen it.  My colleague, Deputy Durkan, is probably the most committed European I know.  I would love to see the same level of commitment shown across the country.  We must turn the corner and stop blaming Brussels for all of the wrongs and having national parliaments take a bow for all of the nice things. </p></speech>

Rampant nationalism is the enemy of co-existence.  Europe has learned that lesson in the past and I hope that we, as European citizens, never have to learn that lesson again.</p> <p>  Interestingly, I proposed that we establish outposts in north Africa to assess immigrants when Ms Mogherini was appointed High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy five or six years ago.  I am glad my proposal has come back into vogue again.  I hope it works because it will eliminate the trafficking of people and criminality and assess whether people are travelling for other purposes.</p> <p>  I would like to make a point that was made numerous times by the late Peter Sutherland, a former European Commissioner.  He always advised us to think about the reasons people choose to migrate.  Sometimes they leave due to the breakout of war or to avoid starvation.  We now have what are described as economic emigrants.  Citizens of every country in Europe were economic emigrants at one time or another.  Many Europeans emigrated to the United States of America, which is having its own problems with immigration at present.</p> <p>  We must keep in mind that, regardless of what walls we build, what travel restrictions we impose and what laws we make, if there is a growing economy or economic abundance on one side of a wall and starvation and deprivation on the other side, they will have no effect because people will be driven to emigrate.  I agree with my colleague all European countries, not only front-line countries, must take specific responsibility and try to ensure prosperity is extended outside the borders of Europe in a way that caters for the people who are concerned about their future in their home countries.</p></speech>

We very much appreciate the opportunity to inform the thinking of the committee in preparing its upcoming report.  We strongly welcomed the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which signalled the priority of mental health as an issue across all political parties and provided an opportunity for Ireland&rsquo;s mental health system to be scrutinised at parliamentary level in a new way.  We also support many of the recommendations of the committee&rsquo;s interim reports, in particular those on increasing the proportion of the health budget allocated to mental health, including development funding, the prioritisation of the development of a mental health information technology, IT, system and the expansion of the existing suite of key performance indicators in the mental health services, all of which are relevant to today's discussion.</p>  <p>  Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s leading national coalition on mental health, with more than 60 member organisations which campaign together to drive progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  Since 2012, it has actively campaigned for increased funding for mental health services and supports for specialist mental health services and the mental health system as a whole.  In addition, in pre-budget submissions for the past six years it has called on the Government to invest in and ensure the implementation of a national mental health information system.</p>  <p>  Investment in mental health services must be understood as a question of resources for staffing because it accounts for 80% of expenditure on mental healthcare.  Investment in public mental health services is about ensuring that the right people are in place and available to provide support to people in mental and emotional distress across the country.  Between 2012 and 2018, &euro;210 million in development funding was allocated to the development of new mental health services.  However, it must be acknowledged that the investment occurred in the context of increasing demand for mental health supports and much of it was spent on areas of service delivery not specified in A Vision for Change.  That does not mean that those are not very important and worthy areas.  The amount invested in our mental health services is calculated based on the cost of implementing A Vision for Change but much of the development funding has gone to supports not specified in that framework, such as the National Office for Suicide Prevention and counselling in primary care.  The funding has also been used to maintain existing levels of service in the face of increased demand, to obtain out-of-area placements for services for which we do not have the appropriate facilities in Ireland and to cover the cost of agency staff who cover unfilled posts.  While the investment is welcome, it has been vastly outstripped by the challenges in the operation of the mental health services.  The ongoing shortfall of investment in mental healthcare in the context of significant increased demand since A Vision for Change was published in 2006 has led to a system that is at breaking point and in dire need of financial attention.</p> <p>In 2017, the HSE reported it required an additional &euro;98 million to achieve the staffing for mental health services set out in A Vision for Change.  This figure did not include investment in primary care and the voluntary sector for providing complementary supports.  Accordingly, notwithstanding investment by successive Governments since publication of A Vision for Change, the reality is that upwards of 10% more funding is needed in today's terms and in light of today's demographics simply to fulfil the mental health services programme published in 2006.  Millions of more euro is also needed to develop adequate capacity in primary care.<br/><br/>These figures reveal that a step change in investment in mental healthcare is needed.  We must be much more ambitious than heretofore.  We must think in terms of ensuring that everyone has speedy access to the mental health support they need.  If not, the costs will be felt everywhere else in our health and social system, from higher costs for physical healthcare to higher disability and illness benefit payments to higher supported housing costs and lost productivity for employers.<br/><br/>A report published by the London School of Economics, LSE, identified total expenditure on healthcare for mental illness - the term used in the UK - amounts to some &pound;14 billion a year.  In addition, untreated mental illness amounts to more than &pound;10 billion in physical healthcare costs each year.  If the same model were used for Ireland, which has higher cases of untreated mental illness, that cost would be in order of &euro;700 million.<br/><br/>The Healthy Ireland framework reports the economic cost of mental health problems in Ireland is &euro;11 billion per year, much of which is related to loss of productivity.  Similarly, a recent report published by the Work Research Centre, WRC, identified:</p><blockquote>The economic costs of mental health disorders are enormous, with figures suggesting this may amount to as much as 4% or more of GDP in some countries.  Although substantial costs accrue to mental healthcare systems, the main economic costs are located in the labour market and social protection systems, not just for those experiencing poor mental health but also for other family members.</blockquote><p>The high burden of disease attributed to mental health difficulties highlights the need for adequate investment in mental health.  The evidence based review on the refresh of A Vision for Change clearly identified:</p><blockquote>Studies have shown the substantial returns on investment that a broad range of prevention and treatment mental healthcare interventions can yield.  This may include better outcomes for the mental healthcare sector and for the physical healthcare sector, cost-savings arising from prevention, and substantial cost-savings and other contributions across other areas of the public sector, economy and society.</blockquote><p>In addition, the World Health Organization, WHO, recently reported that every $1 invested in scaling up treatment for depression and anxiety leads to a return of $4 in better health and ability to work.  That is a 4:1 return on investment.<br/><br/>In 2018, the total budget for mental health in Ireland is just &euro;912 million.  If fully realised, this level of expenditure will equate to just 6% of the overall health budget.  This proportion represents a decrease on previous years and is severely lagging behind both national and international standards.  Notwithstanding difficulties in comparing expenditure between countries, the WRC evidence review acknowledged that Irish expenditure was lower than better performing mental health systems.  An increase in mental health expenditure is required not only for new developments but to maintain existing level of service costs.  These costs increase each year due to demographic changes and other related factors.<br/><br/>Even though it is proving difficult to recruit and retain various specialist mental health staff, we believe it is possible to increase investment by broadening the scope of roles within mental health services and reserving scarce clinicians for roles they can uniquely perform.  Mental Health Reform has consistently recommended a shift of focus in recruitment of staff from primarily medical professionals to health and social care professionals, including psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers. Currently in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, there are fewer than 40% of the required number of clinical psychologists in post, fewer than 50% of social workers and fewer than 60% of occupational therapists.  How can a holistic service be provided in that context?<br/><br/>While there is a fundamental requirement to invest in specialist mental health services, there is also substantial scope to develop mental health services elsewhere in the system, including in primary care and across the community and voluntary sectors.  It is imperative that mental health is afforded financial parity of esteem in the wider health budget to reflect its significance in contributing to the burden of disease.<br/><br/>Mental Health Reform recommends increasing public expenditure on mental health services to 10% of the health budget within ten years and mental health staffing to ensure timely access to all relevant supports for anyone in mental health need, as well as population-wide prevention programmes.  This investment must include resourcing services at all levels of the system, from prevention to community supports to primary care and through to specialist mental health services.<br/><br/>There is no national mental health information system to report on the full extent of service resources, provision, quality and outcomes for community-based mental health service delivery.  Mental Health Reform has been calling for such a system in budget submissions since 2013.  It is not acceptable that more than 12 years after publication of A Vision for Change, there is no information system to account for the performance of more than &euro;800 million in public expenditure on mental health care each year.  There is widespread acknowledgment of the importance of such a system from national and international experts, the Mental Health Commission and from the HSE.  The development of an appropriate, electronic mental health information system based on key performance indicators, will assist in the full transparency and accountability for the evaluation, planning, funding and effective and efficient delivery of mental health services.  The WHO's guidance and the UN's human rights framework can inform the creation of an appropriate framework for performance indicators.  Such indicators are in use in England, Scotland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  Mental Health Reform recommends introducing a national, electronic mental health information system within three years of completion of the review of A Vision for Change to enable the planning, implementation and evaluation of service activity.  It also recommends developing up-to-date key performance indicators that show delivery of human rights standards and national mental health policy within one year of the review.<br/><br/>We are concerned that the restructuring of governance and accountability mechanisms within the HSE this year has led to the dissolution of the HSE's mental health division and national director of mental health position.  It is vital that coherent leadership in mental health at the national level is not lost in the new HSE structure and that there is clear authority and accountability for a distinct, national mental health budget each year and driving reform of the mental health services.</p> <p>Committee members may want to consider making proposals in this regard in the context of legislation which we understand is due before the Oireachtas to increase the HSE&rsquo;s accountability more widely.</p> <p> We welcome the wide range of recommendations made by the committee thus far in its interim reports.  We ask members when issuing their final report to consider the following issues which we believe are in line with the committee&rsquo;s terms of reference.  We need to develop mental health services for particular groups that might not get adequate access, including older people, children and young people in the care system, people experiencing homelessness, people from the deaf community, people with intellectual disability, those with autism and people from minority ethnic communities.</p> <p> We believe in establishing a national independent advocacy service for adults and children engaged in mental health services.  We have heard so many stories of individuals frustrated at not being able to get the support they need and yet it is remarkable that there is no national independent advocacy service to support individuals to seek redress, to seek the services they need and to ensure their voices are heard by the services.</p> <p> We need to ensure that the needs of carers and supporters of individuals with a mental health difficulty are attended to.  We need to ensure the development of adequate services for people engaged in the criminal justice system.  We must acknowledge that the criminal justice system is now sadly an ongoing part of the delivery system for our mental health services and that we must address the mental health need arising in the criminal justice system.  We need to invest in infant and early years mental health services.  We need to recognise and support the valuable, essential and complementary role of the community and voluntary sector in supporting people's mental health needs, including the development of peer-led services</p> <p> The committee previously received our full submission containing a review of A Vision for Change.  Further details of all those areas of concern are contained in that submission.</p> <p> Given the scale of money involved in mental health and considering the lack of systems in place to track and support performance against such spending at care group level, our specific appeal to the committee today is that accountability in mental health funding and expenditure is prioritised in its final report.</p></speech>

That does not mean they are not positive valuable parts of the mental health system.  For example, we support the National Office for Suicide Prevention, but A Vision for Change did not necessarily specify how much should be invested in suicide prevention.  Similarly the development of services such as Jigsaw were not specified in A Vision for Change, but we all recognise they are playing an important role that has been worth the investment.  The costing in 2012 for how much was needed each year to fulfil A Vision for Change has now changed because we still have many vacant posts that we need to fill.</p>  <p>  While I know &euro;98 million is a big number, we need to consider that it does not include investment in primary care mental health services or community and voluntary sector support.  It does not include, for instance, investment in counselling in primary care or psychologists as part of primary care centres.</p></speech>

The &euro;98 million does not include that.  We are currently spending between &euro;6 million and &euro;7 million a year on the counselling in primary care service.  That is helping 11,000 people a year to get free counselling.  The WRC estimated that 600,000 people, who might have a common mental health condition such as anxiety or depression, could benefit from such a service.  The gap is enormous.  Hundreds of millions of euro could be added to that &euro;98 million.  Every &euro;1 added in increasing easy access to counselling and psychotherapy would give a &euro;4 return on the investment because of lower healthcare costs for the rest of the health system, lower social welfare payments and increased productivity with people getting back to work more quickly.</p></speech>

It is, however, a very welcome development and it helps to facilitate people availing of good-quality counselling psychotherapy but I do not think we have to wait for the regulation in order to increase access.  The counselling and primary care service already has quality systems around using outsourced counsellors and psychotherapists and a HSE system is already in place to enable that.  We really need to significantly increase funding for the counselling and primary care service.  We need a substantial investment in all the options available to increase access.</p></speech>

It was asked to develop an interim solution and then it was told such a development would be part of the electronic health record.  I would be concerned about that being a medium-term to long-term development.  We feel there needs to be a greater sense of urgency in putting in place some basic information about what is happening in the mental health services.  For example, we met with Mr. Stephen Mulvaney, the first national director for mental health, and simply asked him to ensure we knew what the waiting lists for psychological therapies were across the mental health services.  It is a very significant indicator of the scope of provision and people who use mental health services have told us over and over again they want access to it as part of a holistic support structure, but we do not have it yet.  We need to come up with a set of discrete indicators as a priority.</p></speech>

My bugbear is when people say they need an increase in budget but we do not know how they are going to spend what they are to be given.  We have the highest budget <i>per capita</i>in Europe for mental health, at &euro;900 million, but we do not know how the HSE is spending massive amounts of it.  They use the excuse Stephen Mulvaney used when asked about the IT system, which is that they do not have the system which can show what is being spent.  I am always questioning how we can know that we need an increase.</p><p>Ms Mitchell seems <i>au fait</i>with how money is being spent, such as when she said &euro;3.5 million was for psychological services.  That seems an awful lot of money for 114 psychologists and I would love to know how it is broken down.  In the year since the budget I have been unable to get my head around the &euro;35 million.  Can somebody please explain, in very simple terms, what that figure means and at what stage we are with it?</p><p>It was said that we could save money by saving people, to the tune of &euro;4 for every &euro;1 invested.  Why will the Government not do this?  Why does it refuse to see the long-term saving from doing this properly?  What is stopping it?  I ask Dr. McDaid for real answers.  We need the truth about what is preventing this Government and the HSE from improving our services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018070400007#F02200"><p>I started to answer the question on how we know we need an increase.  Even if we do not necessarily have enough detail about particular community mental health team support, and how much it costs, we do know the kind of supports people want when they are in severe distress.  We know they want holistic support and want the option of psychological therapy, occupational therapies or social work support, such as with housing and other things.  We know that there are not enough people in those roles to provide those things for everyone who is currently being seen in the specialist mental health services.</p> <p>Often we hear anecdotally - we do not have the statistics because we do not have the information system - that a person's team referred him or her to a psychologist but the team said it would take six months or a year, and he or she has been waiting for that length of time.  We would hear people talk about gaps in their occupational therapy support because their occupational therapist, OT, may depart or may go on maternity leave.  The view was take at a certain point that we only need one of each of these professionals, for instance, there is one OT per team and one psychologist per team.  That is not what A Vision for Change says but there was a strategic view taken early on in the implementation of A Vision for Change that it was better to have one in each team than to have a bunch in one team and not in another.  That is a fair enough growth strategy but we never got to the multiples of these other disciplines that were supposed to be in the mental health teams.  That means, simply speaking, that the 30,000 individuals each year who are referred in to the specialist mental health services are not getting the holistic support they should get.  We would benefit from an in-depth evaluation of what happens in community mental health teams when someone is referred to them, what kinds of supports the person is offered, how well do those work, does the person recover and where does he or she end up in life.  We do not have such evaluation and it would be useful to get that done.  That does not necessarily mean that we should not ensure that those professionals are in place.  That is just the mental health services, and then what I have been talking about is in primary care.</p> <p> The WRC report is telling us that we are so low in our investment in giving people access to counselling and psychotherapy that there is a vast unmet need.  We can confidently say that if we made that investment in greater access to counselling and psychotherapy for people with common conditions such as anxiety and depression, it would reap rewards.  It would be a good investment and good value for money.  That is the basis upon which I would say it is worthwhile making the investments.</p> <p> Similarly, as we have argued on out-of-hours access to services, we have good evidence that where one provides out-of-hours access the referrals to accident and emergency departments drop.  It is expensive to have people going into accident and emergency, and then some of them will be referred into hospital.  We have good evidence that if one has good out-of-hours access to community-based mental health supports, one will have fewer people both referred to accident and emergency and in need of hospitalisation and it is value for money to make those kinds of investments.  Those are the kinds of recommendations that we have made through the years.  It is not pie-in-the-sky stuff.  It is stuff that we know works.</p> <p> The &euro;35 million-----</p></speech>

That is how that breaks down.  It sounds like a lot of money but when one thinks of it in the context of how much funding is going into the mental health system, it is very little.</p>  <p>  I would echo Dr. McDaid's point that we need to invest in services and supports such as this to ensure that people get the supports they need when they need them, and that if we do that early intervention piece, it will provide a return on that investment.</p></speech>

We should have fully qualified senior level psychologists operating in that space too.</p></speech>

Often what we have found over the years is that such funding can be subsumed by existing levels of services.  This is unfortunately because we know that there is such dire need for investment in new mental health services.  Over the years, we have seen some of that funding going into services such as counselling and primary care, Jigsaw services and the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  In budget 2019, that funding has to be boosted up.  That is what we would be seeking.  The &euro;35 million is not enough if we are to adequately invest in the mental health services.  If we are to see a change in terms of development of new services, we need to be considering at least &euro;55 million for development of new services in 2019.</p></speech>

I am trying to jump between two committees and it is not easy.</p>  <p>  I have a few questions.  As a committee, we are trying to come up with suggested solutions to the various issues that are coming at us.  One of the principal issues that nearly every group that has come in to us pointed out is staffing, the lack of staffing and the inability to get staff in the key positions, particularly in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams and adult mental health services.  Consultant psychiatrists cannot be recruited.  Often the consultant psychiatrist is the key person in the chain and as a result, referrals are not being made and key decisions are not being made because the person with the most important input is not there to make them.  It is not acceptable any more to say that we are advertising the position, the position is funded but we cannot get the person.  That is merely sending us around in a circle.  Has Mental Health Reform any thoughts on what we could do or suggest as a committee about rearranging CAMHS teams so that we can fill them with staff?  It might not be the ideal make-up but at least it is a make-up that can make decisions that can allow people to move on and get appropriate treatment and deal with 12 to 18 month waiting lists for young people trying to get into a service that they need today, not in 18 months time.  That is what I would principally be interested to hear the witnesses' thoughts on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shari McDaid" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018070400009#H00100"><p>We have a mental health service which is psychiatry led.  It is orientated in such a way that essentially all the decisions have to go through the psychiatrist.  From managerial decisions in terms of planning the service and the way the service is run to all decisions on individual cases, everything must start and end with the psychiatrist.  Patients are admitted and discharged by a psychiatrist.  While that expertise is invaluable, there is scope for more flexibility in the service than what we are operating currently.</p>  <p>  We do not have clinical expertise so we cannot speak on whether one clinical perspective is better than another but we can say we are aware of some other countries that do not organise the service in that way and their mental health services are functioning and they seem to offer more ways for clinicians from different backgrounds to be the first point of contact or to make decisions around an individual case at different stages and at different points of the pathway.</p>  <p>  It seems to me in the current context that we must explore how it is possible to loosen up the roles, not in a way that diminishes the quality of the support that an individual, a child or an adult gets, but to ask whether it is possible that some individuals referred to the services, as an initial point of contact could see somebody who is not a psychiatrist and if there was proper training in terms of being able to recognise the individual who needed psychiatric input, to be able to draw on that input appropriately but not to leave it as psychiatrists being the only gateway into support.</p>  <p>  I think there is scope for exploring that without wanting to come down firmly in terms of a particular model.</p></speech>

If one cannot get the staff one is looking for, accepting it is not an option so we must find other options.</p></speech>

It has been a wonderful advantage for members to work with them.  I commend everybody involved.</p>  <p>  Twelve years have passed and we still have not come up with a plan.  Twelve years ago, we should have been talking about training nurses and specialists, signing them up and giving them contracts even before they were qualified, thereby covering retention.  In that period of 12 years we had the opportunity and we are still looking at the demographics of areas where accommodation is more expensive.  We could have indexed linked wages and structures to that.  The HSE is wasting so much money that perhaps it could have bought a couple of apartments and put the nurses into them, like the NHS does.</p>  <p>  I wrote a synopsis from July 2017 to 2018 on the media coverage of the mental health services and how bad they are.  Regardless of how much we talk about this, the days of talking about it must stop if we must start from scratch.  It is now a couple of weeks before the summer recess and we should be coming back with a final report stating this is our plan as to what should be done and to start now.  The synopsis makes for harrowing reading.  Children with mental health issues are presenting at emergency departments, there are chronic shortages in mental health, more than 2,400 children are waiting for child mental health services and children are waiting 15 months to see a psychologist.  According to the Ombudsman for Children, we are not delivering on the promises we made and it was noted that suicide claimed 70 schoolchildren in one year.  Moreover, it has been reported that suicidal children face long waits to see specialist psychiatrists and that the ombudsman has called for increased mental health funding.  Finally, while referring to being really burned out, a child psychiatrist resigned as conditions were not fit.</p>  <p>  That is a brief synopsis of where we have come in one year in the mental health services.  This gives members a broad picture how bad the situation is.  No matter how much we talk about this, the days of talking have to stop.  We talk about money and ring-fencing but we have to take the realistic approach.  We have looked at the budgets over the years, including the additional so-called &euro;35 million or perhaps &euro;15 million with an imaginary &euro;20 million on top that could not be spent.  As the money could not be spent on recruitment, it was not spent.  We should be ring-fencing this.  The money that is being spent in the budgets now is only bringing us to a flat level as to where we should be.  It has been well documented that we are short approximately 500 staff members in the mental health service as it stands and it will cost many millions to bring our staffing level to where it should be.  We need an additional 500 staff members to bring us to what was envisaged in A Vision for Charge and we still would not have sufficient staff for the future needs.  We need to think in terms of forward planning because within the next five years, we will lose 1,700 staff within the mental health service due to retirement and whatever.  I love the honesty being expressed on the issue.  I appeal to the two Ministers responsible to set out a realistic plan.  If they will not invest in this plan, then as a Cork man once said, "Fail to prepare, prepare to fail."  That is what we are looking at in the mental health services.  I have no criticism of Mental Health Reform.  We are not here to criticise.  We praise people at times but inclusion and multidisciplinary teams get my goat at times because nobody knows how many are on each CAMHS team.  It is like going out to a GAA match with 15 on one side and nine on the other and they are calling it two perfect teams.  It does not work.  I think the Government has to look at that.  I do not care what way it is done; perhaps a pilot scheme in an area of high rates of suicide.  We should be investing in these demographic areas and starting the pilot projects.  The approach must be broad.</p>  <p>  As an all-party Oireachtas committee, we genuinely get on most of the time but I appeal to the members of other parties to go back and set a marker, a map and a route to run both a proper health service and a proper mental health service.  It goes back to plan A, that is, let us start by investing in training, by treating the people who work in the system with dignity and respect and let us not train our staff for export but to make them proud of the system.  We need to become inclusive in order that regardless of whether one is a psychotherapist, a psychologist, engaged in art therapy and so on, one is part of the full team.  We need to commit to building the full team.  We must make the cake with all the ingredients that are listed on the bottom of the box because if one does not have all the ingredients, one will not come out with the cake one wanted to make in the first place.</p></speech>

She talked about how the Healthy Ireland agenda is embedded in all the Departments, that there is an interdepartmental and whole-of-society approach and that taking care of one's mental health is a significant part of the approach.  Today, the witnesses mentioned the Healthy Ireland policy in their contribution and the economic cost of &euro;11 billion per year.  Of course that is only the economic cost and it does not include the cost to individuals and their families.  It became very clear from other contributors who attended our meeting last week that substance misuse is causing enormous mental health problems in this country.  Do the witnesses think we are doing enough to convey how substance misuse damages one's mental state?  Do the witnesses believe that people are aware that cannabis or alcohol inflict damage on one's brain?  As for conveying the message that exercise and eating well is important, I believe that a focus on preventative measures will be crucial to our report because we want to keep people well in order that they do not need to access services and we want to empower and enable them.  </p>  <p>  I would like to know whether sufficient use is being made of psychotherapists in the system.  Earlier reference was made to the number of psychologists and psychiatrists and whether sufficient use is being made of psychotherapists.  Again, a point that arose in some of our engagements is that there are approximately 1,500 psychotherapists here and many of them are available to deal with whatever cases come before them. </p>  <p>  Do the witnesses think the HSE should ensure art therapy is given a therapeutic role?  I know that art therapy is really important, particularly to young people as it helps them to express themselves when they cannot express themselves verbally.  The witnesses undoubtedly will correct me if I am wrong but I do not know whether there is a recognised position or proper grade attached to it.  Art therapy is really important to many people who are dealing with mental health issues.  Is there a recognised position?  Such a position would be beneficial.  While artists visit facilities on a freelance basis or whatever, without a proper grade they are in a vulnerable position.  If we want to provide art therapy then we must mainstream the service.</p>  <p>  Do the witnesses believe the facilities available across the country are adequate for what we want to provide to people?  Recently we all decided to visit our local child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Yesterday, I visited St. Fintan's Hospital in Portlaoise, County Laois.  As I travelled towards the main entrance I thought that were I a 14 year old who was being admitted there, I would be completely intimated by it because the entrance looked fairly forbidding.  I would feel intimidated even if I was an adult seeking care.  Should we not spend more of the capital spend on these facilities to ensure they look welcoming?  An awful lot of work has been done inside of the building but an awful lot of work remains to be done.  I ask the witnesses to outline what standard these facilities should reach to better help patients.</p>  <p>  Deputy Brassil mentioned the number of people who are available to deal with the cases.  Is there an argument to be made for upskilling additional clinical nurse specialists who could intervene at a very early stage?  Such specialists could also refer people, rather than have them spend time on a list waiting to be seen by a psychologist, psychiatrist, psychotherapist or whoever.  Is there scope for such a position?   </p></speech>

We certainly see the reduction in substance misuse as positive for people's mental health.  We also would like to turn that on its head a bit and make the point that it may be that many people turn to substances and alcohol misuse because of an underlying untreated mental health difficulty and, again, that is where there is potential.  If we can get people to easily access a low-level intervention much earlier then they may not end up in that situation.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right to say there is a link between substance misuse and mental health difficulties that is not discussed enough in the public domain, in both directions.  We could do much more in that regard.</p>  <p>  As for the question on the sufficient use of psychotherapists, earlier I stated we should vastly increase people's access to counselling and psychotherapy.  We should not underestimate the potential for psychotherapy within the specialist mental health services as well.  Some clinicians used to have the view that people with certain diagnoses were not appropriate for counselling and psychotherapy.  I hope that we have moved beyond that view.  Even if one has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, a schizo-affective disorder or a psychotic disorder, there might be real reasons one could also benefit from counselling and psychotherapy because one will likely have gone through real losses in one's life that one might need to explore.  There are issues of having become more isolated and all kinds of emotional issues that might benefit from being explored.  I say that as a layperson and not as a clinician.</p>  <p>  I am really glad the Deputy mentioned a role for creative arts therapists because it is something about which we have not always been vocal.  We would be very supportive of ensuring that a future mental health system incorporates and embeds the role of creative art therapists as part of the options available for people.  The area was neglected in A Vision for Change and that situation should be rectified in any future mental health policy.</p>  <p>  In terms of the facilities for mental healthcare, we know that there are problems with the facilities at all levels.  I refer to community residences around the country that are not accessible for people although they have been people's homes for years.  I agree with the Deputy when she mentioned day facilities and clinics that are not located in welcoming environments.  Many people have told us that many inpatient settings in acute facilities need to be upgraded.  My organisation would really support investment in that area and in ensuring there are respectful and welcoming environments for people in distress who seek assistance.  </p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we should explore the upskilling of clinical nurse specialists as one of the options.  We must consider all of the options and, therefore, should be open-minded.  I ask all clinicians to be open-minded about considering a range of ways that we will need to adapt to higher demand.  There is enough need to oblige us to call upon everyone who is able to provide different types of support and we must also be creative about drawing on their expertise.</p></speech>

She performs a very important role.  One of the central themes of the presentation was broadening the scope of roles within mental health services to complement clinicians.  What impact would it have on the service if we were to follow that?  It picks up on what Deputy Brassil said about having a psychiatrist-centred service.  If the scope of roles within the service were broadened, what would be the impact?  I note also the importance of primary care as a means to deliver a proper mental health service for people.  Dr. McDaid is looking for more resources for primary care.  What type of resources does she advocate should be put in place at primary level to improve services?</p>  <p>  I agree completely that CAMHS should be extended from five to seven days.  Does Ms Mitchell have costings on that service extension nationally?  It is one of those quick wins Deputy Neville asked for and something the committee could advocate in the forthcoming budget negotiations.  I ask the witnesses to address those questions.</p></speech>

The first relates to quicker access.  We are very well aware in the community that one of our biggest problems is giving people timely access to care.  The waiting list for CAMHS is the most visible aspect of that but there are other areas of the service where people cannot get access and where there are no lists to demonstrate that lack of access.  That is one impact that would be very visible.  The other impact would be in the context of choice.  If there were a greater variety of roles, individuals attending services would have more choice in terms of the kinds of supports they would pursue in their recovery.  That is very important from a human rights perspective because services should be in keeping with people's preferences for treatment.  It is also something we know people want.  We are all different in terms of what will assist our recovery.  For one person, social prescribing will help in getting a prescription for a community group or a gym whereas one-to-one therapy will work for another person.  For another person, it might be group therapy and for someone else it might be creative arts therapy.  Someone else might need medication while another person might need regular support from a psychologist.  To get philosophical for a moment, each person will have to shape his or her own recovery.  That is the reality.</p>  <p>  Mental health supports work best when they respond to the preferences of the individual.  When people attend a service which is more one size fits all, one finds that they simply switch off.  They may try to find supports on their own, but they may not be successful in doing so and their mental health may deteriorate.  While it is positive that more and more people from all kinds of backgrounds are coming forward for mental health support because we are reducing the stigma, if more men come forward for counselling and psychotherapy when it used to be more women or girls, something tailored to them might be required.  That is why we need to explore things like e-mental health whereby support can be accessed online by individuals who are not comfortable going to a clinic.  As such, more choice is a potential positive impact.  Ms Mitchell might be able to address the resources needed in primary care settings.</p></speech>

We could invest significantly in supports such as counselling in primary care and increase our investment in primary care psychology.  However, we need to go a lot further.  For example, GPs are trained in mental health, but there has yet to be an evaluation of the impact of that training.  We need to look very closely at whether people are provided with the information they require when they see a GP or another primary care professional.  Are they being referred to other community and voluntary supports in their local areas?  We are looking for primary care professionals to be able to identify where there is a mental health difficulty, assess it and the need for referral to other services such as talking therapies as well as to refer appropriately to mental health specialists.  The mental health system works best when there is appropriate integration and collaboration across the sector and the agencies within it.  We also need to look at effective collaboration between primary care services and secondary services.  For individuals who have been in specialist mental health services and hospitals and come back to the community or continue to avail of community specialist mental health services, it means also getting supports at primary care level.  Primary care professionals should be adequately resourced to provide that support.</p></speech>

In terms of a couple of quick wins, there is huge demand for talking therapies at primary care level and that is somewhere we could invest significantly.  Deputy Carey asked about the cost of extending services from five to seven days a week.  The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services has made a commitment to extend those adult mental health services which do not have seven-day cover to seven days a week and we know that is costing approximately &euro;5 million.  Given that there are fewer child and adolescent mental health teams, one speculates that the cost would be a little less albeit in and around the &euro;5 million figure.  Certainly, we are looking for 24-7 cover and that is just the first step towards it.</p></speech>

As ever, it has been an enlightening meeting.  The Mental Health Parity Bill passed Second Stage in May - which was mental health month - with cross-party support.  Unfortunately, a message was received from the Ceann Comhairle today to the effect that the Bill requires a money message from the Government.  The Bill's provision mirror those which are already in operation in the UK.  Could the witnesses address the importance of parity and having equality of supports?  It does not mean that for every penny spent on physical health, a penny must be spent on mental health services.  Rather, it requires that mental health has parity of esteem in the context of support.</p>  <p>  I refer to what are sometimes called silos and to the gatekeeping that goes on, particularly in respect of mental health supports for schoolchildren.  I have raised this with the Department of Education and Skills on a number of occasions.  A report by Dr. Rosaleen McElvaney of Dublin City University's school of nursing and human sciences, which was funded by St. Patrick's mental services, was published recently.  The report finds that primary schools are struggling to help suicidal children as young as four years of age.  It reflects what I experience as I go around talking to primary school principals, teachers and other staff who are struggling to cope with very serious mental health issues which are starting to arise and which were perhaps not as common ten, 20 and 30 years ago.  A great deal of it is to do with the Internet, what young children can access on it and the effect it has on them psychologically.</p> <p>Much of this is meant to be addressed by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, but there are issues with children being on the wrong waiting lists.  Sometimes they are on a waiting list for a year and then are told they should have been on a different waiting list.</p> <p> Will the witnesses comment on silos and the gatekeeping that goes on?  CAMHS have little to do with community psychologists and they are treated separately.  Will they comment on the disjointed nature of how we address the mental health needs of our young people in particular?  For example, it was reported that there were 110 children under the age of four waiting over one year for access to community psychology services.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that it is not all about money but money can be an indicator of intent.  For example, in our thinking around the budget for next year, we recommend the Government meets its commitment on &euro;55 million which the Minister for Health has indicated would be invested next year in additional development funding.  We also recommend that mental health services would not lose out any more in the overall health budget.  This is important because if it is not done, it sends a message that mental health is less of a priority than other parts of the health system.</p>  <p>  Parity of esteem can be thought of in another way, namely equivalent outcomes and quality of service in mental healthcare to those expected in physical healthcare.  For example, take the case of somebody receiving a diagnosis of cancer.  Imagine if he or she went into our cancer services and was told that he or she will get chemotherapy but not radiotherapy because we do not have enough of the right disciplines to provide it.  This would mean that they might not recover fully and may actually die but that is the best we can do.  That would not be considered acceptable by the public.  However, that is what we are doing every single day in our mental health services.  We are saying that we do not have the adequate supports in place for someone in mental distress.  In turn, this means that he or she may not recover as quickly or, in the worst-case scenario, he or she may lose his or her life.  We are saying this is acceptable.  We need to change that and start having a conversation about having the same standards of care and the same expectation of outcomes from mental health services as we do from physical health systems.  That brings the parity of esteem issue to a different arena.</p>  <p>  Silos are the bane of our system.  We orientate illnesses around a certain category and then it becomes hard to bridge that category to another.  Accordingly, we have services for children with disabilities and services for children with mental health difficulties.  If one happens to be a child who is in both categories, then one is bounced from pillar to post rather than getting a coherent system.</p>  <p>  We have advocated generally for a no-wrong-door approach.  In other words, if one seeks help from a public service that is, broadly speaking, relevant, then it should be the service&rsquo;s job to co-ordinate, integrate and find the supports one needs and then bring them to the patient.  It should not be a case of the services saying that the patient is on the wrong list or not in our group and, therefore, it is up to the individual in need to navigate and find the services he or she needs.  We have spoken about this in terms of individuals with mental health difficulties and substance abuse.  If the committee were to endorse that principle on a higher level, namely, that the entire mental health system should adopt a no-wrong-door approach, then that could apply anywhere.  That would drive services to have to be more integrated and to engage more with their peers because they would not be allowed to simply kick matters to touch.  They would instead have to find and engage with the myriad services that exist.  There are other specific examples on how to improve co-ordination.</p></speech>

We have seen the introduction of a specific component on mental health and well-being in the new reformed junior cycle reform.  That is to be welcomed.  There is so much more we need to do in that space if we are going to address the whole issue of prevention and early intervention.  We need to see mental health promotion programmes introduced at a much earlier stage at primary school level.  We also need to see supports in senior cycle in secondary schools.  If we are going to ask schools and teachers to provide that type of support, they need to be adequately resourced.  We need to be looking at providing training and professional development for schools and our teachers.</p>  <p>  In addition to prevention and mental health promotion, schools are well placed to be able to identify where there may be a mental health difficulty and refer a child or young person on.  Again, they need to be well supported in that context.  We know, for example, that schools in the UK can link in with child and adolescent mental health services and there are key liaison staff in specialist mental health services to provide that kind of support.  They are parts of England which have mental health advisers who support schools in actually implementing mental health supports and services.</p>  <p>  We really need to be looking at those types and models if we are going to push this forward.</p></speech>

This is unprecedented.  Usually, the ratio of suicide between men and women is 3:1.  In south Dublin, including Clondalkin where I live, Ballyfermot and Tallaght, in 37 deaths from suicide, more than 50% were women.  Many of them were mothers in their 20s and 30s.  Obviously, socio-economic disadvantage played a part.  Poverty, alienation, inequality and homelessness also have played a significant part in the past eight years where it has driven people to kill themselves.  That is the reality.  Will the witnesses comment on this?  Is this a spike or a new reality?  In the past six months, I know of four women who have died by suicide in my area.  One would normally not hear of this.  Poverty and social exclusion plays a large part in people's mental health.</p> <p>There is a crisis of well-being in society, which is obsessed with consumerism.  I do not say everyone is like that, but consumerism in a society where people are not being housed and are disadvantaged because of where they are from plays a significant part in how people perceive themselves.  That can affect people's physical and mental well-being.  Will Dr. McDaid comment on this point, particularly the figures from Dublin South-Central?  Anyone would view them as startling.  One suicide is bad enough, but this is a worrying trend.</p></speech>

They are worrying.  It would probably be difficult for anyone to say at this point whether it is a trend.  Suicide happens relatively rarely compared with the population as a whole, so it can be difficult to spot trends until after a few years have passed.  We feel it is important that mental health be seen as an issue for the whole of our society, not just the mental health services, and that specific responsibility be taken by all Departments for their role in supporting and promoting mental health in the population.  We have advocated for a "mental health in all policies" approach.  The committee's endorsement of same would be welcome.  Under it, every Department should consider how its programme of work impacts on people's mental health.  This should form part of its decision-making.  The same idea, albeit in a different format, was advocated by the independent monitoring group for A Vision for Change quite a few years ago.</p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that non-clinical factors will impact on people's mental health and put them at risk.  The Deputy mentioned a number of factors, including poverty.  Relative deprivation is arising as an issue, as are insecurity of housing tenure, social isolation generally and unemployment in terms of how they affect people's self-esteem and self-confidence.</p>  <p>  The mental health agenda has to be owned by every Department.  When considering next year's budget, social welfare expenditure, the minimum wage or housing issues, part of the thinking must be whether the decision being made will improve people's mental health or have a negative impact.  I would like this approach becoming integral to the way we think about mental health.</p></speech>

I hope that I will not repeat anything.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  I also welcome the representatives of the member organisations in the Public Gallery.</p>  <p>  I will fly through my questions, and Dr. McDaid might ignore repeats.  I have a difficulty with the oversight group for A Vision for Change.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, and Mental Health Reform conducted a review, but it was kicked down the road as part of an oversight review, which is one of the issues we are trying to tackle.  Will Dr. McDaid make a brief comment on this point?</p>  <p>  Regarding the matter raised by Deputy Kenny about our area in Dublin South-Central, I got a response from the HSE about the increase in the female mortality rate there.  The HSE believes that might just be ahead of the curve, which is frightening.</p>  <p>  Would Mental Health Reform welcome online consultations?</p>  <p>  I was chatting to Mr. Ray Burke of Mental Health Reform.  The Mental Health Commission's answer to us about places it had claimed were unfit for purpose or habitation was not great.  For example, it had been saying the same about St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane for ten years before it finally closed down.  The commission's response was that there was nowhere else for the people there to go.  Surely that should have been planned for during those ten years.</p>  <p>  Three child psychiatrists have resigned in the south east.  A part of that was down to the conditions of the infrastructure being used to deliver mental health services.</p>  <p>  Perhaps Dr. McDaid has discussed the skills mix.  Her submission refers to psychologists.  I would include advanced nurse practitioners as prescribers.  We often ask whether teams always need to be led by a child psychiatrist and whether the skills mix could allow for a multidisciplinary team - read the title to see what that means - to care for children, given the considerable shortage.</p>  <p>  We still do not have the full facts on the outcomes and KPIs regarding the &euro;1 billion that we are spending.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance stated in a report today that 300 health service staff were being recruited per month.  I would love to know who they are and whether they are front-line workers.  The rate of retirements almost cancels out that number.  There is no growth.  This is one of the major calamities facing our health services.</p></speech>

We asked Mr. Kevin Cullen of the WRC to prepare an analysis of the various options on e-mental health.  We can send that report to the committee.  It shows a strong evidence base for telepsychiatry.</p> <p>It is one of the oldest, longest-established digital or e-mental health initiatives.  It is quite well established, particularly in the United States where they have had to cope with remote areas and providing for specific scenarios.  </p> <p> With regard to the Mental Health Commission not closing services down even when they do not comply, I do not know why that is, but I know it seems to be different from the approach the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, takes.  It is hard to make sense of not closing services down in light of the fact that the lack of compliance is around basic regulations and minimum standards.  Services which are failing minimum standards are allowed to continue to operate.  That has to be looked at.  If that means stronger powers need to be granted from the commission, or stronger usage of those powers, that needs to be explored and dealt with.  We have seen deterioration.  We have not necessarily seen a straight improvement in services, even in things that do not cost money, such as care planning, where services might be okay one year but the next year might fail to comply, and the next year the same service might still not comply even though it had been a condition in the previous year.  We do not get the impact from that regulation that we need so that people can have confidence in the services they use.</p> <p> I was asked what the top three wins would be.  The third one that came to mind is about increasing access to supports in the prison system.  There is a huge need there which costs us greatly. </p> <p> We have talked about investment in mental health, and the relationship between this group and the oversight group.  One recommendation this group could make, even on an interim basis, that would be helpful is to ensure there is a costing of whatever comes out of the departmental review of A Vision for Change.  It is not obvious from the terms of reference of the departmental review of A Vision for Change that there will be a costing of what it will take to implement it.  Without that costing, we are concerned it would be less likely to be implemented.  If this committee could recommend that a costing is done, that would be great.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. McDaid and Ms Mitchell for being here today.  If Ms Mitchell could help us with finding out what the best practice is abroad, it would have significant impact for us.</p>  <p>  The issue of outsourcing keeps coming up all the time and, while we do not have time today, maybe Dr. McDaid and Ms Mitchell could help us with that also.  We have many agencies across the country which can supply on demand yet the HSE does not tend to outsource.  It seems to be the easiest solution of all, but maybe I am wrong.  Will the witnesses give us their opinion on that and, if it was to happen, how we would go about it?</p>  <p>  I thank the attendees in the Gallery also.  Meetings are sometimes long and drawn out.

All the information which the representatives of Mental Health Reform provided today will assist us in our final report.</p></speech>

My colleagues in the scheduled and unscheduled care performance unit and I are pleased to be in attendance.  I am the director of the unit, which was established in the Department of Health at the end of last year.  The core objective of the unit is to improve access for patients to acute hospital services and to reduce waiting times for scheduled and unscheduled care.  I am joined by Ms Susan Scally, who is a principal officer with responsibility for unscheduled care, and Ms Linda O&rsquo;Rourke, who is an assistant principal officer with responsibility for scheduled care.  Ms Mary McCarthy, who is sitting behind me, recently joined the unit as a principal officer with responsibility for scheduled care.</p> <p>  I propose to focus briefly on the current position with regard to waiting lists for inpatient day case procedures and outpatient procedures.  I will outline the actions taken to date to improve performance and the plans for the remainder of 2018.  If it is okay, I will update the committee on the waiting list figures to the end of June, which I received after I submitted my opening statement yesterday evening.  I will provide a brief overview on the work that is under way to increase the number of beds in the system in response to the health service capacity review.  My team and I fully recognise the impact on patients of long waiting times to access hospital services and the need to make real improvements.  The health service will treat 3.3 million people as outpatients this year.  It will deliver 1.7 million hospital operations or procedures outside of the additional work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  It is estimated that 435,000 of these 1.7 million hospital procedures, or just more than 25%, are from the waiting lists.</p> <p>  While this level of activity is not fully meeting the demand, progress is being made in improving access.  The investment that has been made in this area of health care is delivering better results for patients.  If we are to match the increase in demand for services and to reduce waiting times substantially and sustainably, the reform programme set out in Sl&aacute;intecare needs to be implemented.</p><p>The actions outlined to reduce waiting times, improve the accuracy of waiting lists and invest in additional capacity are, nonetheless, important and will improve access for patients.</p><p> The programme for Government contains specific commitments to improve waiting times for hospital procedures.  In total in 2017, &euro;17.5 million was provided to the  NTPF to purchase treatment for long waiting patients and in budget 2018 this investment was increased to &euro;50 million.  NTPF activity recommenced in April 2017 and, in July 2017, the number of patients waiting for such a procedure stood at a high of 86,100.  By the end of 2017, the numbers waiting had reduced to just under 81,500.  Inpatient figures at the end of June stood at 78,000, that is, patients waiting for a hospital inpatient or day case procedure, IPDC.  This represents a drop of 8,100 or 9.4% in the 11 months since July last year.</p><p> In April this year, the Minister for Health published the inpatient and day case action plan 2018, a joint initiative of the Department of Health, the NTPF and the HSE.  Under this plan, the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case treatment is targeted to fall below 70,000.  It is estimated that during 2018, approximately 133,100 patients will be added to the published waiting list.  To achieve the target of under 70,000, the IPDC action plan commits to remove approximately 145,000 patients from the waiting list this year through a combination of HSE and NTPF activity.  The NTPF accounts for 20,000 procedures.</p><p> Several factors, including the cancellation of elective treatment and the increase in emergency procedures due to significant emergency department, ED, pressures, have resulted in fewer procedures for patients on waiting lists in our public hospitals.  However, through the active monitoring of the action plan and the close collaboration with the HSE and the NTPF, it has been agreed that the NTPF will now target an additional 2,300 procedures in 2018, or a total of 22,300, to ensure targets are met.  This level of activity represents a significant increase on 2017, where some 8,200 patients were removed from the IPDC list arising from NTPF activity.</p><p> The NTPF, working closely with the HSE, has invited all hospital groups to develop proposals to maximise the use of existing facilities and capacity.  The NTPF advises that it has received 70 different proposals across all hospital groups.  Arising from this, from January to June this year, more than 3,500 offers for treatment in a public hospital have been accepted and 2,400 patients have been treated.</p><p> The outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge to be addressed in 2018.  At the end of May there were 511,000 waiting for an outpatient appointment but this was reduced by the end of June.  To address the issue of increasing outpatient waiting list numbers, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are finalising an outpatient action plan for 2018, which is due to be published shortly.  This plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with its national service plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of the waiting list, and trial a number of NTPF-funded interventions, including weekend and out-of-hours clinics.  The validation of waiting lists is an important part of the successful management of waiting lists and clinics.  Since the end of 2017, the HSE and individual hospitals have undertaken validation of waiting lists.  To build on this momentum, last month the Minister approved the establishment of a central validation function in the NTPF to centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE.  The fund envisages being in a position to commence validation of patient files from September of this year.</p><p> Work on the development of an integrated waiting list solution, tailored specifically to meet the needs of our health system, is being advanced this year.  The NTPF has examined the feasibility to progressing to an integrated system.  This report is being reviewed by my unit with a view to establishing a high-level governance structure at system level to lead on implementation.</p><p> Ireland is experiencing a growing demand for health care services, which is evident in the increasing number of patients being added to waiting lists and the increased pressure on our hospital EDs.  Increasing capacity is therefore central to improve access, both through our emergency departments and for scheduled care and waiting lists.  As part of budget 2018, the Government provided an extra &euro;30 million in 2017 and a further &euro;40 million in 2018 to alleviate pressure on our EDs last winter.  To the end of May 2018, total attendances were up 3.5% and admissions up 2.2%, compared to the same period in 2017.  For those aged over 75, in the first five months of the year attendances rose by 5% and admissions by 5.5%, compared to the same period in 2017.  This increased demand has contributed to an 11% increase in the number of patients on trolleys, compared with the same period in 2017.  Delayed discharges also remained elevated during the winter period.  The trolley figures during April and May began to stabilise relative to the preceding months in 2018.  The national daily average 8 a.m. trolley count has been falling since March, with 340 in March, 297 in April, 251 in May and 224 in June.</p><p> The health service capacity review indicates that Ireland has among the highest acute bed occupancy rates in the developed world at 94%, significantly ahead of the OECD average of 77%.  The national development plan provides for a major increase in capacity across the health system, including the development of new dedicated elective-only hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  The aim of these hospitals is to both increase capacity and provide for a better separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.</p><p> Increasing capacity alone will not address the challenges faced, but on the basis of significant reform over the next decade, the report recommends an additional 2,600 acute beds by 2031.  The NDP provides for the full complement of beds by 2028, three years ahead of schedule.  As a first step toward implementing the health service capacity review recommendations, the Minister asked the Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds which could be front-loaded in 2018 and into 2019 and 2020 to alleviate overcrowding.  This proposal will seek to increase capacity in both acute hospitals and community settings.  The implementation of this proposal will require a mix of capital investment, including a programme of modular builds.  A key element of the proposal is the identification of the workforce requirement and the development of plans to meet these requirements.  These proposals are currently under consideration by the Department and the Minister.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide a summary of activity under way.  My team and I will endeavour to answer, to the best of our knowledge, any questions from the members. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#F00300"><p>I am joined today by my colleagues, Ms Colette Cowan, CEO, University of Limerick Hospital Group, and Mr. Bernard Gloster, CHO area 3, covering Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary.</p> <p>  Each year our emergency departments, see close to 1.3 million patients and, on average, 25% of these patients are admitted.  The total number of ED attendances has increased year on year while bed capacity has remained largely unchanged.  This has created significant challenges for hospitals which manifest primarily in emergency departments but it is also creating challenges in terms of elective access.  In the current year alone, ED attendances are up by 2.3% compared to the same period last year.  This is on top of an increase in ED attendances of almost 3% during 2017 and 4.3% in 2016.</p> <p>  A key additional challenge facing our hospital and GP services is the sustained increase in the number of older patients presenting to ED.  During 2017, hospitals reported an increase of almost 6% in the number of older patients attending ED with some EDs experiencing upwards of 10%.  This year to date, a further increase in this age group has been observed with the number of presentations up by a further 3.4% compared to the same period last year.  Typically, patients aged over 75 have more complex care requirements, are more likely to need to be admitted to hospital for treatment and will have longer lengths of stay.  This means that the available capacity is under increased pressure as we do not have sufficient patient discharges every day.</p> <p>  The numbers waiting on trolleys at 8 a.m. fell by 3% during 2017 when compared to the full year 2016.  The number of patients on trolleys between October and December was consistently lower than for the same period in 2016.  These improvements were directly linked to increased capacity in a number of hospitals and sustained focus by hospital groups and community health organisations on reducing delayed discharges and improving patient flow.  Targeted funding for emergency services in 2017 enabled consistent improvements in the wait time for funding under the fair deal scheme and an increase of up to 300 beds during the year.  The trolley improvements were maintained to year end 2017.</p> <p>  The issues of overcrowding and the length of time patients wait in ED are a concern for both patients and staff, compromising a safe environment for assessing and treating patients.  In 2017, the HSE sought to tackle both issues through investment in emergency departments, with UL opening its new emergency department in June 2017, and upgrades were undertaken in St. James's Hospital and at Mullingar.  The major capital development of 80 beds, theatres, and an expanded ED in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, is opening on a phased basis in 2018.</p> <p>  The HSE has continued to focus on full compliance of no patient waiting over 24 hours and improvements have been made as compliance with this metric is now 95%.  A key challenge for most hospitals is the lack of sufficient isolation facilities or single rooms required to ensure that infection control issues are managed appropriately.  As a result patients can wait for significant periods for suitable accommodation.</p> <p>  In 2017, funding of &euro;5 million was provided to support the cost of upgrades in EDs and wards aimed at addressing infection control, security and environmental issues.  The first four months of 2018 have seen the number of patients on trolleys increase due to increased attendances and the age and acuity of patients presenting.  However, there has been a stabilisation from April onwards with May showing an improvement against the same period in 2017 of 2.5%.</p><p>The number of confirmed influenza cases and influenza outbreaks during the 2017-18 flu season exceeded all previous records in Ireland, including the 2009 pandemic.  The impact was particularly severe for those over 65 years of age, with 2,218 confirmed influenza hospitalised cases and 85 intensive care unit, ICU, admissions in that age group.  Key challenges this year have been the sustained increase in influenza cases, insufficient isolation facilities and delays in the discharge of patients to home and other community settings.  A further challenge was the incidence of influenza in nursing homes, which prevented new admissions from hospitals for periods in early 2018.  Funding of &euro;40 million was made available in winter 2017-18 to support surge pressures.  Of that, &euro;30 million was allocated to support additional home care packages, transitional care and aids and appliances, while the remaining &euro;10 million was allocated to support the opening of an additional 260 beds during 2018.</p><p> Notwithstanding the extraordinary measures taken over the winter period to manage emergency activity, there is evidence to suggest that access to elective care is being crowded out.  The Chairman and members will be well aware of the challenges that the HSE and, more importantly, patients are facing in terms of accessing outpatient and inpatient or day case services in public hospitals in spite of the significant volume of activity undertaken in hospitals on an annual basis, with 3.3 million patients seen as outpatients and 1.7 million procedures carried out.  The latest waiting list information shows that at the end of June 2018, there were 511,000 patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment and 78,000 patients awaiting a surgical procedure.</p><p> Although a significant volume of patients are waiting for treatment, we have begun to make progress in this area.  That is evidenced by a fall of more than 8,000 or 9.4% from the high of 86,100 in July 2017 in the number of patients waiting for a hospital inpatient or day case procedure.  The latest figures also show that 58% of patients awaiting an inpatient or day case procedure are waiting less than six months and 83% are waiting less than 12 months.  The progress in reducing the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure comes as a result of Government investment in the area, supported by increased focus and collaboration across the HSE, the Department of Health and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  In budget 2018, &euro;50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients.  The inpatient and day case action plan published in April is a joint initiative between the Department, the NTPF and the HSE with the aim of reducing the overall number of patients waiting for treatment.  Among its central goals are that by the end of 2018 fewer than 70,000 patients will await treatment, down from the historic peak of 86,100 in July 2017, and that 10,000 fewer patients will be waiting longer than nine months.  Under the action plan, the NTPF has committed to provide 20,000 procedures for patients through the purchasing of additional activity in public or private hospitals.  The HSE, working with the NTPF, has invited all hospital groups to develop proposals to maximise the use of existing facilities and capacity.  For example, in the University Limerick hospitals group, dedicated cataract theatre capacity is being opened in Nenagh Hospital and the NTPF will fund treatment for patients there in 2018.</p><p> Although progress is being made in reducing inpatient and day case waiting lists, the outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge, with 511,000 waiting for an outpatient appointment.  Each year, 3.3 million patients attend hospital outpatient clinics.  Slightly more than 70% of patients wait less than 12 months and approximately 60% wait less than nine months, while just under 50% wait less than six months.  In order to address the issue of rising outpatient waiting list numbers, the HSE and the NTPF are in the process of finalising an outpatient action plan for 2018.  The plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with the national service plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of waiting lists and trial several NTPF-funded interventions, including weekend and out-of-hours clinics.</p><p> It is worth noting that almost 500,000 outpatients did not attend their appointment in 2017.  The validation of waiting lists is, therefore, an important part of the outpatient action plan and the successful management of waiting lists and clinics.  Since the end of 2017, the HSE and individual hospitals have undertaken validation of waiting lists.  In order to ensure a consistent approach in that regard, the NTPF, through engagement with the HSE, has developed a proposal to establish a central validation office in the NTPF, which will centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE.  The NTPF has begun to engage with the HSE at national and individual hospital level to progress this proposal and envisages being in a position to commence validation of patients from September of this year.</p><p> Key enablers to the development of more sustainable solutions for access to services are the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the recommendations of the health service capacity review.  The capacity review acknowledges that our acute capacity is not sufficient to meet our current demands, with hospitals operating at almost 100% capacity.  The report sets out a clear plan for the delivery of 2,600 beds, as well as sustained investment in primary and social care services.  The HSE is working closely with the Department to agree a robust implementation plan for core recommendations of the review, with clear milestones for delivery of changes in the model of care delivery and investment in additional capacity.  The HSE has established a capacity steering group and more recently a task finish subgroup to progress this programme of work.</p><p> I and my colleagues will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

The report provided by Mr. Woods refers to the 2,600 additional beds required and the issue of elective hospitals.  Project 2040 contains plans in that regard.  What progress has been made on the elective hospitals projects?  For instance, Cork was identified as requiring a new hospital.  A committee was formed to further the project but I understand it has not yet met.  What progress has been made in that regard?  This is an urgent matter and if the relevant people are not meeting to identify sites, etc., how can the project be delivered?</p> <p>  The report refers to 477,000 people not attending for appointments.  What progress has been made in regard to updating how people are notified of appointments, such as by text and so on?  Many areas of the HSE now notify patients by text but all areas should do so.  Obviously, that would reduce the number of people who get the date of their appointment wrong for various reasons, such as ill health, and may not notify the hospital of that.  Some 477,000 is a significant number of non-attendances, almost 10,000 per week, and is a significant drain on the service.  For example, if 50% of patients do not turn up for their appointment at a particular clinic, a huge amount of time is wasted.</p> <p>  There is a substantial waiting list for gynaecological services in Cork.  Some 40% of those on the waiting list for the entire country are in that area.  What progress has been made in reducing the number waiting for gynaecological services in Cork and what further action needs to be taken?</p> <p>  In the past two weeks, I have become aware of a very serious problem in regard to access to psychiatric services for young people.  A young person was admitted to Cork University Hospital in April of this year but has not been seen by a psychiatric consultant as there are none covering that geographical region of Cork.  Consequently, the young person cannot access the CAMHS programme.  His parents are extremely concerned and he wishes to get access to services.  There appear to be territorial boundaries such that a consultant in charge of one area will not see a patient from another area.  In the era of modern medicine, it is outrageous that this 15 or 16 year old boy requires access to services but cannot access them because of entrenched positions.</p><p>I need some clarification in that regard.  This is an area in which we have seen a number of serious incidents involving young people and there is a need for access to services.  The consultant who was there has either retired or resigned.  There was a locum in place for period who has now gone and there is no consultant covering the area.  Young people who want to gain access to the service cannot do so.  There is a need for some accountability on the matter.  I have referred to someone who is on a waiting list.  The issue is extremely urgent.</p></speech>

It has been ongoing for decades and the blame game goes on all of the time.  I have read the Department's statement, but what is the plan?  The HSE does not act in a silo.  We need to refocus some of our attention onto the Department.  We now know about issues with the budget for this year.  What are the plans in that regard?  It will have an impact on our discussion.  When is the Department cutting things off or is it just going to run on?  The answer could decide whether we are to have a general election.  I am not joking when I say that.  There is a significant budget overspend.  How is the Department going to manage it, given the topic we are discussing?  Let us not have a generic, rubbish answer.  The officials are obviously planning for it.  I have been in Departments long enough myself.  What are they going to do this year that will be different from they did every other year?  Are they going to do something different?  They should tell us now in order that we can prepare for it.</p> <p>  Does the Department think the recent and forthcoming changes to structures in the HSE are having and will have any impact on service provision?  I would appreciate it if Mr. Bolger answered that question.  There is a lot of change.  A new board is being appointed before a chief executive, something I suggested to the Minister and in fairness he took up my suggestion.  It looks like there will be the reintroduction of regional structures, which is necessary.  There are new positions being advertised, as well as lots of stuff going on.  Is all of this change having an impact and, if so, is the impact negative?</p> <p>  My final question is about a budgetary issue from a departmental vision point of view.  When I look at eldercare services in particular, I have a real issue.  It is a real bugbear of mine that from a financial and a service provision point of view, there are escalating costs associated with home care as compared to helping people in nursing homes and also with people spending a night in an acute care setting.  The vision is not working to deal with people in the first tier and possibly the second and to provide a third.  This would reduce the problems of some of those working in the HSE because it would reduce the volume of people who end up in hospital and acute care settings.  That question is also for Mr. Bolger.</p> <p>  My other questions are for Mr. Woods, in particular.  I live in County Tipperary.  The two biggest issues for waiting lists and accident and emergency departments are South Tipperary General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.  They are on either side so we are getting it both ways.  It is a real issue.  Maybe Ms Cowan could outline to the committee how we got a fabulous new accident and emergency department which myself and the Chair visited.  It is three times the size of the old accident and emergency department yet the volume of people attending it increased dramatically over its capacity.  I presume there was research done into why that was the case.  If it was not at that scale in the beginning there are obviously underlying issues.  </p> <p>  On the pathways for the groups of hospitals across the country, I will use my own mid-west region as an example.  We have Limerick, Nenagh and Ennis.  I congratulate them on what they did on cataracts.  It is a great example and should be done around the country.  The centre is going to be in Nenagh.  The issue for me is that the pathways by which patients are being managed in the groups of hospitals across the country needs to change.  More people need to be moved out of the model 1 hospitals out to model 2 and 3 hospitals quicker for aftercare and pre-care and there are real issues in how that is happening.  There was only one ambulance in Thurles at the weekend, where there were 50,000 people.  Intermediate care vehicles are something I have been talking about for years; it is a bit of a joke really.  A small bit of investment there would move people pretty quickly.  We would not have the same level of issues in Limerick if we had people moved out to Nenagh and Ennis quicker.  Why is that not happening?</p> <p>  This is a rapid fire round.  Have there been any changes to how the HSE manages relations with GPs?  Are lists kept in respect of GP referrals to accident and emergency departments?  Maybe not for public consumption but at least for the HSE, are heat maps done of GP referrals to accident and emergency departments?  What are we doing to ensure that hospitals are run seven days a week instead of five days a week in respect of consultants and work?  Can Mr. Woods update me on the history, decision making and current deployment of modular units across the country?  This was decided some time ago.  There is a proposition from Limerick to put in a modular unit.  Will that be supported?  Will Mr. Woods answer me here and now?  Modular units are proposed for other parts of the country.  When was that first mooted in the HSE, what are the locations and have decisions been made on them?  </p> <p>  I have specific issues in respect of paediatrics.  This is a public matter so there is no issue about naming him.  Two weeks ago, a 14 year old boy called Matthew Quinn, who I went and met, was on the Six One news about waiting lists.  He has Down's syndrome and is waiting for a hip replacement for two years.  He slipped and needs an operation.  For two years he has been flipped between Crumlin and Tallaght.  I have read there are issues in the relationships between the two hospitals and in respect of paediatric services.  Meanwhile, a 14 year old boy with Down' syndrome who was asking me to help him get a new leg is waiting for an operation.  What is going on there?  This is only one case.</p> <p>  This is the real kicker.  Recently there was a lot of media coverage in respect of the hospital network in the mid-west.</p><p>By comparative standards, looking at the staffing ratios in the mid-west versus other parts of the country - and this was in the media for some time - there are 14% less staff in the acute services.  How did this happen?  Why was it allowed to happen?  Why was the mid-west not supported?  Will this be addressed?  Five hundred and sixty staff correlates to the highest mortality rate in Ireland.  Did anyone in the HSE know this?  The cost for those staff - doctors, nurses, specialists - is &euro;22 million.  When will this be addressed?  Why is the mid-west's employment levels, according to these figures, which I have not seen challenged - and if they must be challenged, they should have been challenged by now - that much below the employment levels of all other acute services across the country?  The Chairman knows what I am talking about.</p></speech>

Regarding additional beds and elective hospitals, I think the question asked related particularly to the south.  As the Senator may be aware, a group has been formed in the south around that specific hospital.  Its work would include looking at issues such as site selection.  Work is also ongoing centrally on the nature of an elective hospital and the kind of work that would proceed in it.  There is health planning work to be completed to determine the nature and shape of such a facility, and it has commenced.  Our planning function, both clinically and in hospital terms, is working on this.</p></speech>

We ran a session in Mary Immaculate College in Limerick on this in the not too distant past.  We are focused on getting good practice in place in order that we have optimal pickup and that patients have an opportunity both to be aware that their appointments are coming and to notify the relevant party if they have difficulties with the appointments.  The use of texting is partial, not universal, and needs to roll out more fully.  I accept that in this day and age we could and should look to do it more completely.  The wider point about learning is one on which we are very focused because we have very good practice in sites around the country.</p> <p>  Senator Burke referred to gynaecology in Cork and nationally.  We have asked all hospital groups to put forward proposals as part of the work with the NTPF this year for undertaking work both within their own facilities and where they do not have capacity outside in the private environment.  This would include gynaecology in Cork.  A commitment was made last year to undertake work, as I recall, in gynaecology in Cork.  I might offer to bring the Senator back a specific report on volumes in Cork and what is intended this year, but that was open to submission from the group, and I recall it has made proposals in the current year.  On the specific reference to Cork University Hospital and perhaps CAMHS, I might ask my colleague, Mr. Bernard Gloster, to address the Senator.  The Senator referred to an individual case.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am not aware of the individual case.  Cork is in community healthcare area 4.  As I am sure the Senator knows, Cork and Kerry combined have the second highest under-18 population in the country at 168,542.  They currently have a clinical whole-time equivalent workforce in the child and adolescent mental health services of 76.97, so just under 77 whole-time equivalents.  Their rate of seeing new referrals is not out of kilter with those of the rest of the country nor is their rate of referrals seen per clinical whole-time equivalent, WTE, available.  They are high on the waiting list end.  They have 630 on a waiting list, with 192 of those waiting over 12 months.  The 630 on the waiting list is out of a national figure of 2,600, so there are pressure points there.  Of the interventions that were made, probably the most critical is that nationwide this year a new grade was introduced into the psychology service of assistant psychologist, and 100 posts were deployed across the country in that respect.  I do not have the exact figure for Cork but I will follow up on the Senator's concern and query with my colleague, the chief officer, and ask him to write to the Senator directly about it.</p></speech>

A consultant not working in a particular area - I am talking about a geographical area now - cannot be transferred to another area.  That is the advice I am being given.  I have written to Gerry O'Dwyer, the CEO, on this matter, and the response I received from Ger Reaney by telephone was that there is no consultant there.  Therefore, this patient cannot be seen until a consultant is in place.  I was not aware until that phone call that there is an entrenched position whereby people will not be seen unless a consultant is <i>in situ</i>.</p></speech>

I just do not have the detail to be able to assist the Senator further with the matter.  However, I will certainly take it back up with both my colleague, Ger Reaney, and the national mental health office in the HSE.  I know from my own area in the mid-west that when there is a vacancy for or a gap in a position, while it obviously causes significant delays because people cannot cross over for the sheer volume of work they are doing in their own areas, I would not say that would apply where an acute emergency would arise.

I will answer the first two and pass the question about elderly care to my colleague, Ms Scally, who is leading a review of delayed discharges and that area.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what the plan is and what we are doing differently.  One of the key things we have done this year is to establish a new unit within the Department which has a clear focus on scheduled and unscheduled care.  This is my unit, and these are some of the members of the unit.  This is our clear focus and this is what we are interested in: driving improvement in scheduled care, which concerns waiting lists, and unscheduled care, which concerns trolleys.  To talk about how we are working, I will focus on three areas: what we are doing in terms of activity, what we are doing about finances and what we are doing to bring forward improvements.</p> <p>  We have sought to address activity by setting out and agreeing clear targets with the HSE and the NTPF, particularly in respect of inpatient and day-case activity.  We publish these figures with a very clear and, I think, very understandable target for the end of the year, which is 70,000 people.  We do not just say, "We will see you in December" and hope to be successful in meeting that target; we actually monitor the target every month.  We have trajectories that we expect the HSE and the NTPF to deliver each month and we monitor these.  The benefit of the monitoring is that, by working collectively with the HSE and the NTPF - we meet fortnightly at official level and meet with the Minister every month or six weeks on this issue - we are able to address or overcome any administrative challenges or any other challenges that arise.  There have been some examples of issues that we have been able to address.  Second, and more important, we are in a position, as I outlined in my statement, to introduce remedial plans when we are not making progress in line with the trajectory.</p><p>This year, at the end of April, we were able to sit down following the winter and say: "This is where we expected you to be in terms of your activity to meet the 70,000 target and this is where you are."  At that time there was a shortfall of between 2,000 and 2,500 procedures.  We were then in a position to go back to the NTPF through the HSE and say what types of steps could be taken to address that.  The plan that has been agreed, to which I referred, is that there will be an additional 2,300 procedures for which the NTPF will be able to offer treatment this year.</p><p> The second element is finances, and it links into that area in terms of remedial plans.  This year we have held back all the new funding relating to activity.  All the new development is held in the Department and it is released when we are satisfied the measures that were introduced have been delivered.  This brings an additional level of control to the process from our perspective.  It ensures that the priorities the Government has set out and funded are delivered.  Second, it gives the opportunity to avail of new opportunities as they may arise.  The best example we have this year is that there were certain projects that were not progressing fast and were not going to draw down funding this year.  They were the modular build in Clonmel, a delay in opening beds in Kilkenny and a centralised validation function we established.  By having greater control we were able to address that finance and then reallocate the money that was allocated for those to open the cataract theatre in Nenagh from July.  That is an example of how we are actively monitoring the finances and making changes mid-year to deliver.</p><p> The third piece is improvement.  We are taking an evidence based approach and we are fortunate that we are able to build upon the work of colleagues that was undertaken last year relating to the capacity plan.  That sets out the clear challenge the system is facing.  One of the big tasks of Susan Scally and her team for the first six months of the year was working with the HSE to develop proposals for where additional capacity could be introduced into the system.  We have also established a centralised validation function within the NTPF.  This is a very important function.  At one level it will ensure that the waiting lists and the challenges we are addressing are accurate.  It will also offer consistency to patients throughout the country in terms of communications and timelines.  A great deal of work has been done by the Department, the NTPF and the HSE to simplify communications with patients and to send out clear letters of one page that make it very clear what the person has to read, what the person has to do and what the person has to return.  We have trialled that with a number of groups and it has had an impact.</p><p> The next matter is working on the basis of the lessons learned process for next year.  In the context of planning for the coming winter, the key question is what lessons we can learn from last year.  It is not so much what happened last year, but the question we are engaging with the HSE on is what happened over and above what it had planned to happen.  We have had much discussion about this.  Liam Woods referred to influenza and we referred to some other issues.  It is not so much that we had a longer influenza season; it is about what was being planned, what happened and what lessons we can learn from that as we plan for next year.  To bring that together on what we are trying to do in terms of the improvement aspect, the ED task force is now in place and what is planned for September this year is an unscheduled care forum that will bring together members of the ED task force and, more importantly, people from around the hospital system and perhaps internationally to look at what processes worked-----</p></speech>

In terms of the bigger piece of the overall management of the budget, that is slightly outside my remit, if it is okay to say that.  However, we are being very clear that we have set out a plan for 70,000 patients and we are not expecting to see a fall-off in activity with regard to the hospitals.  What we have done this year in terms of the NTPF is that we are planning to continue activity into October, November and December whereas in the past activity would drop off in those months.  From my perspective there are no plans to shut off activity in the scheduled care side.</p></speech>

The third piece is that the Deputy asked about the structures and changes and what impact they are having.  We have set up a new governance structure with the HSE and the NTPF.  In my area, all I can say is that I do not think it is having an impact at present.  There has not been a huge amount of change in our particular area and we continue to meet the people on a regular basis.  In a large organisation such as the HSE there is always a period of change.  It is something we are very conscious of and, as I said, the increased engagement is a big part of that.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about elderly care and the cost of home care, nursing home care and hospital care, and a logical movement.  I wish to make one point about structure.  Providing care on a joined-up basis in the way the Deputy mentioned can be assisted by structure, but structure itself will not enable anything for a patient.  That is probably agreed.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the new ED in Limerick and whether the volumes were anticipated.  Colette Cowan can elaborate on this if it would be helpful, but certainly there was an initial peak before it fell off.  Then there was a gradual rise which is associated with care patterns in the mid-western region.  The underlying challenge, and the Deputy referred to it elsewhere in his questions, is that there is a growing demand for service.  In the mid-west that is presenting at a higher rate than elsewhere in terms of ED services.  The pathways-----</p></speech>

The Deputy asked questions about GPs, GP lists, referral patterns for individual practices nobody understood, the work of Shannondoc, which Bernard Gloster might be able to speak to, and whether that was understood in terms of a source of admission into hospitals or referrals to hospitals.  It is, and such data exist within individual hospital patient administration systems.  With regard to the pathways question and the movement of patients from a level 4 to a level 3 or level 2 facility or, indeed, into the community, the models of care are developed clinically.  The Deputy's question or statement is very sensible.  It is a direction we are seeking to travel, to provide as much care as possible at the lowest level of acuity and as close to home as possible or in home if possible.  Clinical pathways that have been and are being developed across the HSE are supporting that.  That is the intention of planning.  It is why the bulk of the winter funding went into home care support.  The Deputy's point about the economics of that is well made.  I agree that the best value and the best location of care are at home.</p> <p>  The ambulance service and transport issue in the mid-west is a good example of that.  Mayo, Letterkenny and Tralee would have similar pressures in terms of accessing ambulance transport-----</p></speech>

It also remains under pressure.  As the Deputy rightly says, the demand for increased bypass facilities to more major centres is a demand the ambulance service faces as well as the growth in calls.  In the mid-west region there is a pressure which Colette Cowan can speak further on around patient transport.  There is an advantage in having Nenagh and Ennis which allows for the movement to a more appropriate setting.  Sometimes the challenge in that is transport.  There has been a growth in expenditure on private transport at times to support that, which we would prefer to run through the public system if the national ambulance service can support it.  It has done so, but it remains under strain.</p> <p>  On GP relationships, there is work ongoing with GPs in terms of their referral practices and protocols around referral in some specialties as part of our outpatient planning.</p><p>There is a very good example in neurology where effectively a consultant, clinical leads and GPs have agreed protocols and the effect in practice has been to reduce outpatient numbers significantly and reduce waiting very substantially.  That is being expanded to other areas both in terms of specialty and across the country.</p><p> On the issue of a seven day working week pattern, there clearly is already some seven day working in terms of waiting list work.  Some of the proposals we are receiving are about running clinics on weekends and at night time.  Consultant contracts allow for seven day working patterns as do some other clinical contracts.  Not all contracts provide for this and there is work to be done in that area in the system overall.  The best capacity we can access most quickly is our own that is used most intensively.  I take the point Deputy Kelly makes and there is some work taking place on the issue.</p><p> On the issue of modular units across the country and whether a modular unit in Limerick and the University of Limerick hospitals group will be supported, there is a proposal from the UL hospitals group on a modular unit, as the Deputy is aware.  The HSE has submitted that, with other proposals, to the Department and would be supportive of it, subject to deliberations at Government level around increasing capacity in Limerick.  Underlying part of Deputy Kelly's question is the capacity constraint in the UL hospital groups, which we understand.  It has been well researched and clinically validated and we need to invest.  We would be supportive of growing capacity in Limerick, and that would include modular units.  I should add that we are in discussions with the Government which, with the Minister, will need to make decisions in the coming weeks to determine the outcome of that.  We are supportive of capacity as we know it is needed.  To be fair to colleagues in the Department, they are equally aware of it.</p><p> The Deputy raises a specific case of an individual child and an issue between Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals.  If I can, I would like to answer the Deputy directly on that individual case.  I do not have the details with me but I can do that.  The more general question the Deputy asks is about co-operation between the facilities and the pathway of care.  I get that and I will revert to the Deputy on that if I can.</p><p> The Deputy's final question was on staffing ratios and staff funding.  I am aware of the piece of work to which the Deputy referred but this is connected to the general point around capacity.  I have already acknowledged there is a capacity issue in the mid-west region.  I might ask my colleague, Ms Colette Cowen, to address the specifics relating to the report.  </p></speech>

This time last year, approximately 179 patients would go through the emergency department each day.  This year we have seen a growth of 5.5% in activity and 210 patients on average per day go through the emergency department.  Last Friday, we had a high of 229 patients attend the emergency department for treatment.  There is a number of reasons for that.  Of interest is that in comparison to last year we have an increase of 2,000 patients aged over 75 attending the emergency department.  This is a significant jump of 5.9%.  Of the 2,000 patients over 75 years who attended for treatment, the figures indicate that 30% will be admitted and remain in the hospital for a number of days to get the full capacity of care they need.  This is a major change.  We are aware that with population growth, we will have an increased need to treat older people in services.  It is known that the Limerick area has the highest number of people aged over 85 living alone.  These older people will acknowledge that they tend to come to the emergency department because it is a safe place for them to get treatment.</p> <p>  We have activity from the GP and Shannondoc referrals, which can be high at times.  It is important note in respect of general practitioners, however, that they are working flat out.  They are working long hours and they rely on us for the diagnostic access, which means they tend to send patients in for treatment and care.  We are in discussion with GPs on the development of an urgent care centre.  In recent weeks, a few of them visited an urgent care centre in the United Kingdom with some of my team and some of Mr. Gloster's team as part of the effort to find a diagnostic model that support the GP service.  I am aware that general practitioners are currently commencing or in negotiations on their contract, which is pivotal.  If one wants to assist the emergency department in the mid-west region we need the GP and the primary care service enhanced and supported in their role.  I know the negotiations are under way.  </p> <p>  Regarding staffing ratios in the mid-west region, I have a very bright clinical director working for me who analysed a great deal of data from the HSE's national human resources department shared his analysis of them.  Out of his analysis came his concern regarding the number of whole-time equivalent staff in the mid-west region.  We have discussed the matter and we will do further briefing and analysis with national HR to ensure we have the exact facts around those figures because we will need to examine the issue if it is the case that the number is so high.  Given that data can be subject to different interpretations, we need to be factual on that.</p></speech>

That applies in particular to attracting consultants to return to work because - and this is my personal view - their salary scale is not correct and must be reviewed.  Extensive work is required on how we attract staff at that level to work in the service in this country.  We will table a paper on that if it is of help regarding whole-time equivalents because I trust the person who raised this issue and did the analysis on it.  I need to work more with national HR on it.</p></speech>

I would like to go back to the basics and ask what the problem is because if one looks at our healthcare system from the outside, this should not be happening.  We have young boys and girls waiting for operations for spina bifida.  The average spinal curvature in cases involving scoliosis in Europe is 50 degrees, whereas in Ireland it takes so long to access surgery that curvature reaches 100 degrees and leads to preventable lifelong problems.  We have people waiting more than one year to be accessed for wheelchairs.  We heard at a meeting last week that a child aged two and a half years for whom there are suspicions of autism will not be offered treatment until he or she reaches six years in some parts of the country.  We are all aware that on a human level this is destroying people's lives.</p> <p>  In orthopaedics I ended up dealing with people in Cappagh Hospital because the waiting lists had become so long.  One of the clinicians told me that there was a reluctance in some cases to take on new patients.  The waiting lists were so long and the patients were in such severe pain that there was a fear that they would kill themselves or become addicted to morphine before they got to see a consultant and had surgery.  The human cost is extraordinary and we must ask why.  We spend as much money as almost any other country on healthcare.  In that case, the answer cannot be that we do not spend enough money.</p> <p>  The capacity review done by PA Consulting for the Department of Health shows that the average age in Ireland is considerably lower than in most other countries and we should, therefore, need considerably less healthcare assets than most other countries.  It also shows we have roughly the same number of general practitioners, acute beds, nurses and doctors as other countries.  What the data show us is that we spend more money than almost any other country on healthcare; we have approximately the same amount of healthcare assets as other countries; we should need fewer healthcare assets because we are younger; and yet we have some of the worst waiting lists in Europe.  In fact, a recent pan-European report showed that the Government waiting time targets of 18 months, if met, which the Government cannot do, would give us the worst waiting times in Europe.  That does not make sense.  If we spend more money than other people, we should need fewer healthcare assets than other people.  We have as many healthcare assets as other people and yet people are waiting in agony in circumstances which do not pertain in other countries.  Why is that happening here?  What are we doing so terribly badly, which other countries have sorted out, that is leading to this pain and suffering all over the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#M00200"><p>I welcome the deputations and thank them all for coming in.</p> <p>  The bed capacity review identified a clear need for additional beds in the system.  Mr. Bolger said in his submission that the Minister asked the Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds that could be front-loaded in 2018 and into 2019 and 2020.  What I have to say might save the Department a great deal of work.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has identified that 1,000 beds were closed.  I do not intend to get into the politics of who closed them and why, but they are closed and clearly available to be reopened.  These beds are situated throughout the country.  We know of 19 in Letterkenny.  I know my colleagues, Deputy Pearse Doherty and Senator Mac Lochlainn, have been campaigning on that.  Anyway, the beds are right across the system.  Perhaps the deputations can give me their views on where these beds are and how easily they can be accessed.  Does the Department intend to front-load them in 2018?  The submission is somewhat light on the detail and on where the beds will go.  Obviously, those responsible have clear sight of the plans for the 2018 beds and most certainly the 2019 beds, whatever about the other plans.  Will the witnesses provide the number and location of the beds?</p> <p>  That leads to my next question.  Will the witnesses identify how many of those beds are closed due to staff shortages?  I have a view on the relevant numbers.</p> <p>  That leads on to my next question, which is on the funded workforce plan.  My understanding is that the Department agreed a funded workforce plan with the nursing unions last year.  The Department did not hit those targets, which comes as no surprise, and, in fact, missed them by a considerable amount.  Much and all as the Department did not achieve its targets in 2017, there is no funded workforce plan for this year.  I understand this matter has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  What I do not understand is why there has been a delay in fulfilling what I understand to be an agreement between the Minister and the trade unions representing nurses.  Department officials do not need me to tell them but I will explain it for the benefit of saying it.  The Department cannot open the beds or solve any of the crises, however these multiple crises were created, unless the hospitals have the staff to do so.</p> <p>  We know the Bring Them Home campaign was a spectacular failure.  We know the HSE did not achieve the rather modest targets set out in the funded workforce plan.  If we can identify the beds &ndash; that would be brilliant &ndash; then perhaps the deputations could identify, in the absence of a funded workforce plan, how we will be able to staff those beds.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Woods comment on the practice of counting fourth year nurses as whole-time equivalent, WTE, staff members?  In my time, they were not counted as WTE staff.  If the HSE has started doing that now, will Mr. Woods explain why?  It is not that I am a cynic, of course; I am simply an optimist with experience.  Anyway, to the cynical eye, it looks a little like an attempt to massage the staffing figures.  I sincerely hope it is not, but Mr. Woods might explain whether that practice has commenced and, if so, why.</p> <p>  Children are waiting for scoliosis surgery.  Targets were established and missed.  We know the four month waiting target has been missed by a factor of years for some people and for 88 people in total.  I spoke to a parent on Monday.  She came in to see me in my office.  Parents are referring to the practice of what they call aggressive management of lists - these are their words and not necessarily mine.  A letter is sent out to the parents of children who have scoliosis severe enough to require surgery asking whether they still want the surgery.  I can tell the committee in advance that they still want surgery for their children but they do not get enough time to respond.  They refer to this as aggressive management of the waiting list and they are deeply unhappy about it.  They see it as a means of perhaps knocking people off the list.  Again, that is a mechanism by which the figures could be massaged.  Will the deputations comment on that?  That seems to be particular to this cohort but that could simply be because these were the people I was talking to recently.  We could debate all day whether the practice of sending out letters asking people whether they still want a procedure is a valuable use of time.  Certainly, in the case of children with scoliosis it is a reasonable expectation that they will want surgery.  The parents are reporting that they get such a short timeframe to respond and this is causing them serious problems.</p> <p>  Mr. Bolger went through all the figures on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  My views on the NTPF are already on record and there is no need for me to rehearse them.  The NTPF accounts for 20,000 procedures.  I have several questions about the NTPF.  Am I right in saying that of the 20,000 procedures a total of 10,000 have been done?  Halfway through 2018, how many have been done?  What value-for-money metrics does the Department use to assess whether it is getting value for money from the NTPF?  How is value for money established?  Can the Department point me towards the value-for-money figures, facts and statistics?  I simply cannot find them anywhere.  Reference is made to how the NTPF will account for 20,000 procedures this year.  Can the Department give the committee an indication of how many have been done and how many have been scheduled?</p></speech>

I offer my apologies in advance for leaving to go to the Chamber before the witnesses answer.  I will watch the proceedings later.</p> <p>  Mr. Bolger said there was a drop in the number of people waiting.  He said the figure is now at 78,000.  The Department must admit that is still a shocking figure and needs to be worked on.  Is there one thing that could solve this?  Sometimes it is not all about funding.  The answer may be along the lines of obtaining and retaining of staff.  Let us imagine the deputations could pick one thing.  What would solve it?</p> <p>  I am keen to hear the thoughts of the deputations on the outpatient service performance improvement programme.  As we know, a validation officer rings patients on a list - sometimes the officer sends texts messages - and asks whether they are still interested in staying on the list.  Some of my constituents have run into trouble with this.  Some have said that since they have been living with the condition for so long, they might as well keep going.  Another person was on holidays.  Yet another was careless and the letter was left on a window, as could happen to any of us.  I do not think it is a good system.  Will the witnesses offer their thoughts, please?</p> <p>  I am keen to hear the views of the witnesses on putting more funding into local hospitals.  We have a very good hospital in Bantry that could take the pressure off the larger hospitals in Cork if it was given more funding.  At the moment we are trying to enhance the rehabilitation and endoscopy units there.  What are the thoughts of the deputations on providing more funding for Bantry General Hospital and similar hospitals?</p> <p>  I agree with my colleague, Senator Colm Burke, with regard to the plans for a hospital in Cork.  It was announced with great bells and whistles.  Now, it seems to have died a death.  I take the point made by Mr. Woods that a meeting is imminent.  Will Mr. Woods keep the committee informed of any progress on the new hospital?  Obviously, that is something I am most interested in as a Cork Deputy.</p></speech>

Deputy Donnelly asked why this is happening and what the driver is.  If the capacity plan is looked at, while we can pick out different parts of it, it provides a clear evidence base of a system that requires a greater number of beds and a significant element of reform.  What we have demonstrated this year through the work with the NTPF and the HSE-----</p></speech>

That is what is happening.</p></speech>

There is this view that we need more stuff.  We need more acute beds, doctors, nurses and maybe we do and maybe we do not but the reality is that per age-adjusted population, we already have more of all of this stuff than countries who do not have our waiting lists so they clearly are doing something better than we are with the assets they have that we are not doing.  So what I absolutely am challenging is what is quite a lazy view and I am not pointing Mr. Bolger out.  Groupthink has settled in to the effect that we have people dying on waiting lists and have young boys and girls whose spines are curving because we do not seem capable of getting to them quickly enough.  The answer is that we need more stuff and the NTPF, which Fianna F&aacute;il supports and pushed for, is a sticking plaster, not a structural change.  Given that this new unit has been set up, it is great Mr. Bolger and his team are working on this, I am trying to force the thinking a little here.  It is just not enough to say more is needed if other countries do not have the waiting lists we do with broadly the same assets.  Beyond saying that we need more beds, doctors and capacity, what are we not doing that other countries clearly are because they are solving the problem with a similar level of assets to what we have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Bolger" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#N01200"><p>I take the Deputy's point and I will take his question in two parts.  There is a need for an investment and for additional capacity within the system.  There is an evidence base there to support that.  What we can see through the likes of the NTPF is that if investment is made in the right area, more patients can be treated.  I agree the NTPF is a process that is in place to treat public patients and to look at maximising capacity across the board, including in both public and private hospitals and the long-term plan on that, as it is set out in the national development plan, is the development of elective-only hospitals.  I disagree with the point that we do not need more capacity but I fully agree with the point that it is not just about more capacity and that we have to look at how we go about managing things differently.</p> <p>  When it comes to the inpatient on the day case side, the majority of it is treatment in hospitals.  That is where people need to be treated in most cases.  There are examples of where certain elements of it can be moved into the community but in general, those people need to be treated in a hospital.  In terms of the outpatient, and there is a lot of work going on in this area, there is a huge opportunity to move a lot of that activity and this is what is the basis of Sl&aacute;intecare and other plans over the years.  For example, we are told that most people who turn up for an outpatient appointment require two appointments.  They perhaps need a diagnostic and a meeting with the consultant and in many cases they are referred from their doctor just to receive the diagnostics.  I am not telling the Deputy anything particularly new here but the more of those services that are available in the community, the less pressure that will be on the consultants in the hospital system who do need to see a certain proportion of the people.  The capacity plan is clear that there is a need for additional capacity.  It is not just about beds and that is a point we might get to in terms of some of the staffing.  It is easy to identify additional beds.  It is about beds, additional staff and capital investment but it is also about reform.  That is what is happening.  The challenge is that we do not have enough slots to treat all of the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#N01300"><p>To return to the Deputy's original question as to what the problem is and where he quoted some data, the expenditure in the health system, whether it is understood at a European comparative level or OECD volumes at a glance in terms of doctors and nurses, I would look at the numbers of doctors in Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>elsewhere.  We are considerably lower and bed numbers are considerably lower.  The point about nursing is a point well made.  The capital infrastructure in our environment is not comparable with some of the other environments with which we would be compared and we know that it does need serious investment.<br/><br/>Underlying the Deputy's question and hypothesis is a very fair challenge to say that if we look at orthopaedics, an area he referred to himself, it is very true to say that the model of care for orthopaedics, part of which was developed jointly by a consultant in Cappagh, would clearly identify that up to 85% of an outpatient list can be addressed by a musculoskeletal, MSK, physiotherapist and a consultant will deal with the balancing 15%.  We need to shift the model of care and provide more of that in the community is the goal and that is happening.  There is a primary care centre in Galway where an MSK physiotherapist has been appointed and it is having a very good effect in terms of referrals to hospitals and providing care in the community.  That is the kind of investment that is not the same as saying we simply need more consultants.<br/><br/>The model of care for orthopaedics, the demand-supply analysis and the onset of growing demand based on obesity for knees, because the volume of knees to be done in the future will far exceed hips because of obesity, means we need to double the current number of orthopaedic surgeons we have, which is around 80.  That is over a period of time but the other point about ageing is true because on an age-adjusted basis, we are still younger than many of our comparator environments.  One of the challenges that we face, and Mr. Gloster can probably talk more on the operational side on older persons' services, is that we are growing old at a faster rate than others.  The rate of change is what is being dealt with on the ground and that is a real factor.  There are opportunities and I share the view that it is not just about getting more stuff, it is about getting the best that we can out of what we have and investing in capital sensibly.  Deputy Kelly referenced working outside the normal day and looking at our level 2 hospitals.  We are going to face frail, elderly and chronic condition challenges right across our whole healthcare environment, many of which may be able to be addressed in primary care and model 2 hospitals, as well as focusing the major hospitals on precisely what they need to focus on.  I agree with the Deputy's point.  I query some of the data because there are questions in that regard.  Our capital infrastructure, which, based on the new plan is growing substantially and is helpful, is a key driver so that we can be what we need to be.  The investment we need in equipment today is approximately &euro;350 million to bring it to where we would want it to be.  There are efficiency opportunities and productive opportunities within that.<br/><br/>In comparison with other environments, we are a cost-based funded hospital environment and many of the others are insurance and transaction based and that may be having an effect on some of the comparative data.  The shift to private spending by individuals in the Republic of Ireland has been quite high over the past few years and that contributes to the cost when we look at it at a macro level.  Often that data is not talking about HSE costs but about global health spend, which is very appropriate but there are real variations in what the HSE spends and what society as a total spends.<br/><br/>If an emergency department in Ireland is considered, four to five consultants would be as high as would be seen in an emergency department.  In Scotland they are targeting having ten emergency department physicians per department to provide care so there is strong evidence on the consultant side that we need significant additional resources but I entirely take the point that the need to drive performance and improvement and model change within what we do is also a piece of that.</p><p>It will not work and it will be too slow to wait for new buildings to appear to resolve the service challenges that we face.  I take the point.</p></speech>

We will have to agree to disagree about the data.  This is the Department of Health's capacity review and it unambiguously shows that we do not have significantly fewer healthcare assets than others.  It shows that we have more than some countries and less than others.  Those are the facts.  Given that we are younger and have approximately the same assets, what do other countries do that we do not?  Has Mr. Woods identified a number of actions that they have taken which we have not, which do not cost much money?  We are facing into the next budget.  The fiscal space is tiny.  It is a fraction of what Sl&aacute;intecare envisages as being required for all of these beautiful reforms.  We will be living in a very resource-constrained world.  I am pushing this so hard because the extra capacity, about which we will have a longer conversation outside of this meeting, costs a fortune.  What can we learn from countries which, with the same assets, have solved this problem that we have?  What can we learn that does not cost a lot of money?</p></speech>

The international evidence base, as it refers to clinical practice and location of care, is precisely what we use in clinical planning.  Orthopaedics is an example but there are many others.  There is strong awareness in the HSE, both at population health planning and individual clinical practice levels, as to the need for services and the ideal locations for such service provision.  The thinking which the committee engaged in with regard to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, relating to the appropriate location of care, is an important dialogue which has been referred to on a number of occasions here.  We see high appropriateness of admission in acute services.  When we look at appropriateness of a day of occupation of a hospital bed, we see an opportunity to move people into community facilities or home, with support.  We have to seize that if we are going to get the best value and the best health outcomes at the lowest cost to the taxpayer and to the Exchequer.  Those models will drive where we need to go.  That is about both investment and change; it is not one or the other.  There is a requirement for both.  I would be happy to get into a deeper dialogue about the learning relating to the models of care and integrated care delivery in chronic conditions.  There is interesting work in the HSE on supporting chronic conditions on an integrated basis across hospitals and community care.  That kind of work is a major part of getting the system right in the future for the population demands that we clearly have, which will grow significantly.</p></speech>

There was an issue relating to a bed capacity review and 1,000 beds being closed, referred to by the INMO.  Working with colleagues in the Department, we have looked at all capacity and locations where we can open space.  We have identified that.  That will sometimes require alteration in a facility.  There may sometimes be an opportunity in current physical infrastructure.  We have looked at that and made proposals in that regard.  We would have to look at the INMO list of 1,000 beds with regard to the infrastructure.  There may be adjustments to where specific beds are.  I am not aware of that.  We have high awareness of what we have and what we can do within our current infrastructure.  There is a wider issue of moving beyond that to the 2,600 beds required in the capacity study.</p></speech>

The counting of staff in the HSE is a matter for human resources, HR.  To explain what has happened with the counting of graduate nurses, and not divert from the Deputy's question, as she referred to, student nurses were counted as 0.5 and not one, up until the end of last year.  In the whole-time equivalent reports from January, they are counted as one.  They are not all in the acute environment but most are.  There are approximately 870 whole-time equivalent reported students in the acute environment.  Last year, at the same time, that was reported at 435.  That is in our published whole-time equivalent data set.  On the question of why that is, that was a change made within HR.  In some senses, it is helpful for me because it levels out the headcount-----</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about scoliosis surgery and aggressive waiting list management.  Overall, the approach to managing waiting lists is set out by NTPF policy.  While it should be focused and competent, if I heard "aggressive", it would be a concern.  I am happy to check that out.  The time targets are short for scoliosis, with a four-month clinical target, so it requires a fair amount of contact with individuals and families.  We have to manage that, and that is part of the challenge that the Children's Hospital Group and individual hospitals are working on.  I will certainly look at that and would be happy to hear more about any concern regarding aggression.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the WRC.  There are matters before the WRC between the HSE and nursing unions.  She referred to the recruitment level, the workforce plan and the total number of nurses.  There are issues and we are working on them.  From an acute hospitals perspective, I work with a funded position for all staff, including nursing.  That is expressed in our pay and numbers, and is contained within the nursing workforce plan.  There was a challenge late last year.  Part of our success in that is putting in new development posts.  In the acute system, 1,100 new posts are being funded this year, of which approximately 500 are nurses.</p><p>At all stages we are seeking to convert from agency nursing to employed nurses.  Last year we converted about &euro;7.5 million in agency cost into nursing cost, and we did the same with medical locums.  There are issues and we are working on them.</p></speech>

A number of patients were offered treatment in December 2017 and treated in January 2018.  We try to keep the window between the offer being accepted and the treatment happening as narrow as possible.</p> <p>  We have responded to questions on value for money via parliamentary questions.  A competitive process is in place under which the NTPF goes out to tender for treatment.  They have to take into account the treatment required and the location of the patient.  Different tenders are in place with different people around the country and this ensures the NTPF gets the best price.  The fund reports to the board, its accounts are subject to audit and it appears before the Committee of Public Accounts.  No specific value for money review has been done of the fund's initiatives but there are controls which ensure they get value for money.  The controls ensure everything is competitive with open tenders for all processes.</p></speech>

How does Mr. Woods decide that it is good value for money?  We have heard from the head of the NTPF, who is a public servant, to the effect that the private sector is always better.  I am not convinced that it is and I have not been convinced by any of the answers I have received that the Department is convinced either.</p></speech>

The NTPF has prices which come through from the health purchasing office.  It does not get block funding, as there would be for a public institution, but uses the same model as applies to treatment in the private sector.  It agrees a price with a hospital and pays that price when it is satisfied that the treatment is undertaken.  This provides a richer source of information for the NTPF to challenge prices.  It does not take on all tenders that come through and has, at times, been unwilling to fund a particular procedure in a particular location if it is outside acceptable price limits.  It has tight controls to ensure it gets the best value for money.</p></speech>

Life expectancy in Ireland is slightly above the EU average.  We are seeing a growth in the over-65 population of approximately 20,000 people every year, with a growth in the over-85 population of 2,500 per year.  The health status of the older population is probably the most critical factor in terms of demand on services, with 86% of people over 65 having at least one chronic disease and 65% of people having two or more morbidities.</p> <p>  In the community healthcare sector, both for mental health and services for older persons, the value of a student nurse came with the fourth year placements.  When it was originally negotiated it was on the basis of two students in and one whole-time equivalent, WTE, out.  There was an expectation of full employment and that, accordingly, the students would finish at the end of the term but now there are so many vacancies that the students are staying on as preregistered between September and Christmas.  There is never a time where there are no students in the system.  The counting of a WTE is based on the traditional 37.5 hours and not related to the grade of student.</p></speech>

There is an imbalance between the demographic changes in the population and capacity, by which I do not mean just bed capacity.  We concentrate on bed capacity but there are huge capacity issues in other services, particularly in primary care.</p> <p>  How does CHO 3, with which Mr. Gloster is most familiar, anticipate the manpower issues in general practice arising from the retirement of GPs?  How does it intend to recruit GPs and manage manpower?  There are many issues relating to hospital avoidance and the GP was the gatekeeper to the health service in this regard, acting as a filter to sift through the information to decide who needed to go further for treatment or investigation.  That system is breaking down now because of manpower issues and because GPs are working to capacity.  How would a CHO area anticipate recruiting and retaining GPs and developing that service?</p><p>As for the reduction in the number of inpatient procedures by 8,600, which is 9.4%, what proportion is accounted for by actual treatments, and how many of those are just validations of lists?  I refer to cases where people do not need the treatment any more - they have gone to Northern Ireland, have opted for private healthcare, are no longer seeking the treatment or perhaps have passed away.  What proportion of that reduction reflects actual treatments as opposed to validation?  Perhaps the witnesses might outline the common treatments that are being delivered through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Are they just day cases or are they serious cases of hip replacement, knee replacement and those procedures that require a considerable length of time in hospital?  </p><p> Mr. Woods and I believe Mr. Bolger referred to the 8 a.m. numbers for patients on trolleys.  I have been looking at the trolley figures for the past number of years.  The numbers are rising year on year.  This year to date, the average number of people on trolleys per day is 500, which is not in keeping with the 8 a.m. figures the witnesses have provided.  Are the 8 a.m. figures different to the trolley watch figures? </p><p> Why is University Hospital Limerick consistently the hospital with highest number of people on trolleys, with perhaps double the number of the nearest rival hospital?  I have my own views on that.  I think there is a much greater catchment area for the University Limerick hospitals group.  There is no model 3 hospital in the group, only a model 4 hospital, so everybody tends to end up in casualty there before they are filtered.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment on that.</p><p> Following Deputy Donnelly's contribution, I note that the average number of beds for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, is 4,800 per million.  We are at 2,800 per million.  There is a huge disparity there.  The bed capacity review anticipates that the population of the country will increase by a million over the next ten or 15 years.  A million patients equates to 2,600 beds.  The 2,600 beds that are proposed in the bed capacity review may only be keeping track of the increase in population.  It many not actually be a net increase in the number of beds per person.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment on that.  Ever year, flu season arrives and winter initiatives come in.  As a result of that, elective admissions are quite often cancelled between the months of November and March.  How can the health service keep track of elective procedures if, because of bed capacity issues, a bed cannot be found to carry out an elective procedure for four months of the year?</p><p> I refer to Sl&aacute;intecare.  It has been 400 days since the Sl&aacute;intecare report was published and we still have not got the Government response.  The Government seems to concentrate on costs, but really Sl&aacute;intecare is talking about reorganising and reforming the health service.  It concerns integrating services and hospital reduction measures, that is, how patients can actually be treated in a better location than a hospital.  It refers to treating them in a community setting and re-orientating the health service towards primary and community care.  I know Ms Cowan has an interest in this.  Perhaps she might comment on that. </p><p> Finally, I refer to the "Bring Them Home" measures directed at nurses.  I think only three nurses have been recruited this year.  There were 15 last year, 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015.  The witnesses might comment on the reasons why we cannot get our nurses to come back.  I apologise for the large number of questions.  </p></speech>

In my professional experience it is important to highlight the good work done by many of the staff in the appointments sections of our hospitals on a daily basis.  They are often on the receiving end of the wrath of patients and GPs who ring up looking for appointments.  I think it needs to be put on the public record that they do a fantastic job.</p> <p>  The situation regarding general medical and surgical appointments around the country is not too bad.  They are within an acceptable timeframe.  However, certain subspecialties, like urology, neurosurgery and ear, nose and throat, ENT, are a joke.  Last week I raised the case of Ms Angela Phelan, a lady who was put on an urgent waiting list to see a urologist in University Hospital Waterford.  She received a letter saying that she would be seen in 65 months, which is five years.  That is not acceptable.  By definition, "urgent" means high priority.  It means acute, it means critical and it means that we need immediate action.  I am surprised that there is not a raft of medical-legal cases in this country from people who are dying and suffering on urgent waiting lists, not routine waiting lists.  It is not acceptable.  For example, a routine appointment in the urology service in University Hospital Waterford takes nine  years.  That is almost two D&aacute;il terms.  How can the HSE stand over this and what is it going to do about it?  That is my first question. </p> <p>  The second question concerns the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  As a GP, I think it is becoming more and more difficult to access this service.  GPs are being forced to jump through more hoops to get young people assessed.  I have received letters and parents have approached me to say their child will not be assessed by CAMHS because after I send in the referral letter, the service rings the parents and says that the GP has not assessed this patient.  I would not have referred the patient if I had not assessed them.  Of course I assessed them.  They are not even believing the referral letters they are getting from GP surgeries.  That is not acceptable.  I have been speaking out about this.  I have spoken to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, about this on numerous occasions.  We need a 24-hour emergency access phone line for GPs to access CAMH services for vulnerable patients who are suicidal.  It is a service that would not be abused and it is something that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  My third point is that I want to follow on from what Deputy Kelly said with regard to modular units.  They are an excellent idea and I seek an update on the modular unit proposed for Mayo University Hospital.  </p> <p>  My final point is concerns community and district hospitals.  What is the HSE's plan?  Does it have a plan to develop these facilities?  In my opinion, they facilitate discharges from acute hospitals and prevent admissions to them.  Is there a specific plan for community and district hospitals?  With regards to what Ms. Cowan said about GP contract negotiations, that is a myth.  There are no negotiations.  They are non-existent.  Let us get that clear. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#Q01000"><p>Long threatened comes at last.  A number of points are being raised that we have raised here before.  One thing I worry about is the morale of those within the health services, who always happen to be the fish within the goldfish bowl from a critical point of view.  As the last speaker said, a lot of important work has been done and dedicated staff do a great job.  However, there is some flaw in the system somewhere.  I refer to the point raised by Senator Swanick a few moments ago about someone who gets an appointment for two, three or four years later.  That is farcical and is an insult to the system.  It is an insult to human intelligence and to the patient.  Effectively what it says is the patient does not need any treatment at all and should come back in ten years.  That is what should be done.  The problem is that the person in question remains on a waiting list for a long time.  As a result, when their condition deteriorates they come to the accident and emergency unit because they have to go somewhere.  Such patients are concerned about their health and their families are concerned about them.  To what degree can the witnesses identify and influence the deficiencies within the system that impede smooth progress from the moment that the patient comes into the GP to the referral?  Has the HSE had an audit carried out to reveal them?  It should not take six months from the GP's referral to get the consultant to meet the patient, and another three, four, five or six months before any action is taken.  That is just about the most outrageous system I have ever heard of anywhere.  If those results were seen in a factory somewhere or in any other organisation in society, it would not be tolerated at all.  Yet in the most sensitive area, that of health, this is commonplace.</p> <p>  There is another issue on which I would like a response.  I do not propose to wait here for the answers.  I expect to get the answers at some stage between now and next week.  Otherwise I will put down parliamentary questions.  In case someone says I will not get the answers in parliamentary questions, the answer to that is I will.</p><p>The age profile of the population has been referred to as one of the main stumbling blocks as to why we cannot provide a proper health service.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, that that is not correct.  We have a younger cohort of population than almost any other country in Europe.  The people who come into this country are young, in their 20s or their 30s.  That is being balanced all the time.  It is not sufficient to say we have many old people who have three or four procedures a year and so on.  I do not buy into it.</p><p> Have the deficiencies in the system been identified?  Is there a lack of GPs?  Is there a lack of consultants?  We have identified a lack of beds.  Another 1,000 beds or so would make up the difference.  I remember during the boom times ten years ago that there were unacceptable waiting lists, even though there was plenty of money available.  I do not understand why we are not progressing.  We are in the top three or four in terms of expenditure in the OECD countries, but we are in the third or fourth worst in dealing with patients, waiting lists, downtime and so on.  Why should that be?  The point made by Deputy Donnelly is accurate, that there is something wrong somewhere.</p><p> Can the witnesses tell the committee how many of the facilities are vacant or idle at any given time in any week, and for how long, for example, clean air theatres and different types of theatres?  When a patient comes into the system, is there a guarantee that patient will move through the system smoothly and out of the system again?  Is it a lack of anaesthetists, nurses or beds or a combination of all?  To what extent does each of these issues constitute a proportion of the totality of what is required?  We need to know that.  Any efficient body will need to know exactly where its weaknesses are and what can be done to speed it up.</p><p> Some hospitals have better records than others in terms of waiting times, bed accommodation and so on.  Why is it that they are successful while others are not?  There are obviously contributory factors.  I do not expect to be told today but I expect to get the answer to that too.</p><p> I know there are many good people in the health service.  I would like to have a health service that everyone would want to identify with, that every patient would be happy to be part and parcel of, and that as a result of that we would move forward, taking our responsibilities seriously and recognising them.  Incidentally, I do not have a hang-up about the private or public sectors, but they should be able to compete with each other.  It is always a good sign for both of them but it does not always happen.  If it is found that the private sector is creaming off the top a certain number of patients who are easy to handle or whatever the case may be - I do not know - but I would like to know about it.  We trotted this out before about primary care centres.  I do not know.  The jury is still out on the primary care centres.  They are fine facilities and they look good.  I am not so sure of the extent to which they are cutting off the flow of patients at the community level before they go to the hospital.  I am quite sure they could.</p><p> Today's long-term patient on a long waiting list will be an emergency at some stage.  We either deal with it in the first instance or we deal with in the last.  I do not expect to get the answers today.  I have parliamentary questions about all of them, and they might be answered in that way.</p><p> I appreciate the Chair's patience in waiting for me.</p></speech>

When my colleague, Deputy Donnelly, was asking Mr. Bolger why the situation was different here when he was comparing the spend per head with other countries, eventually Mr. Bolger said it was not just about beds but was about staff and reform.  Will he elaborate on what reforms he was referring to?</p> <p>  Again in response to Deputy Donnelly's questions, Mr. Gloster mentioned life expectancy in Ireland being higher.  While I do not want to misquote him and I know Deputy Donnelly has left, is Mr. Gloster saying that Deputy Donnelly was not comparing apples with apples, in that it is simple to take a top-line figure for a spend per head, but when there is universal access for children under six to GP services and a roll-out of vaccination programmes, there will obviously be a spend, so it is not as simple as just comparing the oversimplified figures that the Deputy supplied?  Will Mr. Gloster elaborate on that?  Maybe I misinterpreted what he said.</p> <p>  In response to my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, Mr. Bolger said the Department does not get into comparing prices and that it does not take on all the tenders that come through.  Thank God that someone is keeping an eye on the chequebook.  He also said that he believes there are controls in place to get value for money.  Again, thank God for that.  When representatives from the HSE come in, it is always someone else who made a decision somewhere else.  I go back to Mr. Woods and Deputy O'Reilly who was talking about whole-time equivalents and student nurses.  Mr. Woods is the national director of acute hospital services operations in the HSE, yet he needs to talk to somebody in HR about who decided that a fourth-year nurse was one whole-time equivalent and not half.  The vast majority of the times that we ask questions of people in the HSE, it is someone else's job.  It happened recently with the CervicalCheck issue.  People continually say that it is someone over here or someone over there.  I am worn out with it always being someone else's question to answer.</p> <p>  The real questions I wanted to be answered were asked before I came in and obscure responses were given.  Can somebody, perhaps Ms Cowen, outline why things have improved with the retention of graduates?  Has it been looked at?  Are there plans to focus in on the reasons that we are retaining more graduates and to increase the retention of graduates?</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned primary care centres.  I am a firm believer in Sl&aacute;intecare and in moving treatment into the community from the acute hospital setting.  In Smithfield, Dublin, there is a good primary care minor injuries clinic that contributes to accident and emergency department avoidance.  Many people are treated there, and there are good nurse practitioners working there, plastering up people with injuries and referring them to the Mater Hospital.  It may not be true but I have heard this service in Smithfield is becoming very popular.  I used to refer many people there myself when I was working in the community.  I found it to be a brilliant service but people did not know about it at the time.</p> <p>  There is a cultural issue where people think they have to go to an acute hospital.  It is just in us to think the best place to go is Crumlin with a sick child or the Mater with a broken arm.  What steps is the HSE taking to try to address that cultural issue, so that people go to the primary care centre as opposed to the acute hospital?  I also hear that patients who should go to St. James's, Tallaght or Blanchardstown are going to Smithfield and in turn ending up referred to the Mater, which receives many patients who would ordinarily be dealt with by the other hospitals.</p><p>There is now a capacity issue when it comes to the referral of patients because so many people are being taken in from Smithfield.  How will this be addressed?<br/><br/>There are challenges in the area of step-down facilities.  I have heard that when consultants sign off a patient as being fit to return home, they sometimes are reluctant to go to a step-down area.  Have any of the witnesses a solution for this?  Anecdotally, there is no reference to an exit plan when patients are admitted and it is not discussed until it is time to exit.  This is often the case with older people.  If a patient from Dublin 1 is discharged and then is sent to Mount Carmel Community Hospital, which is near where I live, for their step-down he or she might say he or she could not go all the way over there.  Has the HSE put anything in place to try to address this in order that when a patient is admitted, he or she is told that after he or she has been fixed up, he or she will be sent to a particular step-down facility and that is how it works?  I am not talking about forcing people to go anywhere but about bringing patients and their families along with the medical professionals on this journey.<br/><br/>I visited Carlow-Kilkenny hospital a couple of years ago, where they had GP referral to fast-track people through the emergency department.  The Mater Hospital has something similar for older people, where a GP can refer them and it bypasses the emergency department.  It works very well.  Older people and their families are much happier with it and it is far preferable not to have older people with chronic conditions waiting in emergency departments, which is not suitable.  What plans does the HSE have to replicate the system used in Carlow-Kilkenny and that in the Mater?<br/><br/>Recently I heard that 477,000 hospital appointments were missed.  I understood that outpatient hospital appointment lists already factor in such no-shows.  Will the witnesses elaborate on this?  It is not the case that doctors are waiting in emergency departments twiddling their thumbs waiting on this 477,000 people.  It is built into the figures that a certain percentage will not turn up.<br/><br/>Finally, Mr. Woods said that a roll-out of texts was the way forward.  Surely that could be done over a weekend.  We are back to IT.  Even the most basic, small community pharmacy now has a text service for their patients.  I cannot understand how it is that things are done very safely in the community with appropriate data protection and so on but when it comes to the HSE, we almost need two years to do everything and a team of people to implement something that I would have a young one do for me over the weekend.  It is constantly the case that everything seems to take longer.  No one seems to know who is responsible.  It is like the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i>.  I would like the witnesses to address those points.  I apologise that I cannot stay to hear the answers.  If the witnesses cannot answer them today, I would like them in writing soon.</p></speech>

On the Chairman's question about GP recruitment, we have two vacancies in the mid-west that we are attempting to fill in the mid-west, one in north Tipperary and one in Thurles.  On anticipating those, we have a fair indication as to when people are thinking about retirement.  Many of the Chairman's GP colleagues will stay on for quite some years but we have a general indication.  On what the system is trying to do about that, nationally, last year, the HSE's target was to have 187 GP trainees.  The actual out-turn was 170.  That gives an indication of the transition in respect of filling some of the places.  This year's target is 198.</p> <p>  In the mid-west, one thing we have tried to do to mitigate the difficulties in recruiting is use the job-share scheme in some practices.  A contractor might decide to go on reduced time in later years before they retire.  Another doctor comes in and eventually takes on the practice.  In the two or three cases where we have done that, it has been quite successful.  It is a bit different to the assistant with a view to partnership.  </p> <p>  The challenge in relation to GP recruitment will not become more level or ironed out until the contract issues have concluded.  That is being attended to by the Minister and the Department and negotiations are ongoing.  </p> <p>  We have tried to expand the range of supports available to GPs.  The Chairman will be very familiar with the Shannondoc system in the mid-west area.  It was originally intended as an out-of-hours emergency service and is effectively an extended day's service in terms of people's expectations.  There are more than 100,000 contacts to that service annually.  Luckily, we have been able to provide additional supports.  The Chairman is a particularly strong supporter of the community intervention team.  Last year in the mid-west, GPs alone made 290 referrals to the community intervention team as distinct from sending people to hospital.  That is one small snapshot of its work.</p> <p>  That is the direction in which things are going but I would not dispute that GP recruitment is very challenged.  We are probably somewhat more fortunate in the mid-west in how the numbers have fallen but we are challenged.</p> <p>  Senator Swanick, who had to leave, made particular reference to the use of district hospitals or community nursing units.  Between us, my eight colleagues across the country and I have 7,002 public beds and 1,982 of those are used as short-stay beds.  All of them, other than those used for people coming in from home for respite, are predominantly associated with hospital flow of one type or another whether it is rehabilitation, step-down, transition and so on.  Some 5,020 of them are in the long-stay system.  We are very committed to the community nursing unit system.  The Senator might be familiar with the Government commitment to the refurbishment programme or the new build programme for which the regulations were amended to take us to 2021.  There is in excess of &euro;500 million being spent to enhance that sector.  The public community nursing units are very much a feature of our plans for the future.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked a specific question so as not to misunderstand my intervention in respect of Deputy Donnelly's point.  For clarity, I was not necessarily arguing that Deputy Donnelly's observations on international comparators were in any way out of kilter.  To be fair, he was relying on the capacity review for much of it.  The point I was trying to make was that in the Irish context, while we have a younger population in some respects, one must look at the health status of the older population.  Life expectancy is above the EU average in Ireland because fewer people are dying from circulatory and other diseases because of advances in medicine.</p><p>It does not mean that people do not have those diseases and, indeed, they have dependencies on the healthcare system as a result.  That is why this year, we will deliver very high concentrations of support to older people in hospitals and the community, such as more than 17 million home support hours.  It is not as simple as noting Ireland's young population compared with other countries and asking why things are different here.  The status of our population and, in particular, the fact that 65% of those over 65 years of age have at least two chronic conditions, as members are aware, creates significant dependencies on every part of the healthcare system.</p><p>  On the use of primary care centres, we are always looking for ways to encourage people to utilise what is available to them in the community.  </p><p> Ms Cowan will address the issue raised by Deputy O'Connell in regard to the model used in Kilkenny.  I am aware that general practitioners in the mid-west are fortunate to have other routes available to them, such as an acute medical assessment unit, a surgical assessment unit, a bed bureau and so on.</p><p> On step-down facilities, Deputy O'Connell referred to Mount Carmel Community Hospital.  A very successful initiative was introduced for the winter of 2016-17, repeated in 2017-18 and effectively is now an all-year-round system.  It is a transition care system that allows people to convalesce or be cared for outside an acute hospital while, for example, awaiting the completion of their fair deal process.  We have had some very good successes in that regard and the system now runs throughout the year.  Approximately &euro;2.5 million per month is spent on it and over 200 cases per week are approved, each of which has an average length of stay in transitional care of 22 days.  Were it not for the scheme, those patients would be likely to spend that time in the acute system.  Deputy O'Connell rightly referred to care plan and consent issues in that regard.  Some hospitals use the transition care system more than others.  Limerick is the highest and best user of the transitional care system.  It is a very effective intervention and we probably will have to sustain it long into the future.  To go back to Deputy O'Connell's point, we must also try to work with people on consent and care plans, which is not always easy for many reasons to do with families and choice and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.301" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Bolger" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#T00200"><p>The Chairman asked what proportion of the 8,000 reduction in the number of inpatient procedures is accounted for by validation of lists.  A level of activity underpins that change in the waiting list.  I will revert to the committee with further details on the changes since last year.  Since the start of this year, 54,000 people have been added to the list and 57,000 removed.  That is the result of both HSE activity, which includes an element of validation, and NTPF activity.  The 8,000 is the net result in terms of the waiting list.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the elective procedures targeted by the NTPF and whether that is being done on an inpatient day case basis.  The inpatient day case action plan we published in April set out seven high-volume procedures to be targeted, namely, cataracts, hip and knee replacements, varicose veins, tonsils, cysts, coronary angiograms and the excision of lesions.  An eighth category, gastrointestinal, GI, scopes, is slightly outside that grouping.  In addition, the NTPF set aside funding for those waiting more than 18 months for a procedure.  As mentioned, there is funding to enable hospitals to bring forward proposals to address specific waiting list challenges they face.  The NTPF delivers the seven high-volume procedures, GI scopes and a range of other procedures.  It has more than doubled the number of procedures it offers through the private sector from approximately 20 last year to 50.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan referred to the length of time people wait for outpatient appointments.  We have already touched on some of the initiatives under way.  There has been much discussion of validation, which is a critical part of the system to ensure we have accurate lists to help with planning.  Several members questioned the style and form that would take, such as, for example, patients having seven days' notice or being required to confirm by phone.  Such queries indicate the rationale for the establishment of a centralised validation office, namely, that we will learn from best practice and that a standard approach led by the NTPF will be taken to the validation of waiting lists across the system.</p></speech>

The NTPF has found that offers of treatment lead to a validation process.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked about the role of the NTPF.  In my earlier responses, I made the point that the NTPF is a statutory body.  Its function is to assess the price and it has a commissioning body in place to that end.  We have a governance structure in place to manage that statutory body.  There is no passing of the buck.  It is clear that the NTPF has statutory responsibility for pricing but we have a clear governance structure for its management.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell also asked about the range of reforms required.  The capacity review contains several scenarios, two of which are very stark.  One concerns the introduction of a very extensive range of reforms, all of which are set out in the capacity review, and a subsequent requirement for 2,600 additional beds.  The capacity review also points out that issues in terms of staffing and planning were not considered but it highlights future work that must be carried out and the reform programme that must be undertaken in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.  All of the documents produced to date indicate that extra beds are needed.  The capacity review sets out a very ambitious range of headline reforms and also points to other work that needs to take place, including the issue of theatre capacity, to which reference was made.</p></speech>

Ireland currently requires 2,600 beds per 1 million population.  Thus, if our population increases by 1 million, we will need 2,600 beds just to stand still.</p></speech>

The capacity report attempted to capture that requirement.  The report makes clear that 2,600 beds will be required following an extensive programme of reform.  If there is no reform and we stand still, the plan indicates that more than 7,000 beds will be needed.</p> <p>  On specific reforms, Ms Scally will deal with areas under consideration in terms of increasing capacity.  We have also outlined several important administrative reforms that are being introduced to improve system efficiency, such as the validation office and the badly-needed integrated waiting list.  A delayed discharge review is now under way to understand the factors of relevance in that regard, such as whether it is a capacity issue or relates to the ability of the acute and community systems to communicate or a combination of both.</p> <p>  Ms Scally will provide details on modular units, which form an important part of the capacity plan.</p><p>They can be delivered much more quickly and, based on the experience of the UL group, the quality of accommodation that can be offered is different from what I imagined a modular build would have when we started on this project.  It will play a significant part in the system going forward.  We have identified a number of sites where modular builds could be used to increase capacity.</p></speech>

We are looking at 94% occupancy at the moment across the hospital system.  We are trying to bring it down to the international norm, which is approximately 85% occupancy.  To do that we would need to inject an additional 1,200 beds immediately.  The HSE has come forward with proposals which it developed, having consulted intensively with hospitals and carried out rapid analyses of demand and capacity.</p> <p>  I can give the committee a rough number for acute beds.  There are potentially 600 beds and just under 300 community beds.  The process is under deliberation at the moment and validation is ongoing, meaning the number may change as the process evolves.</p> <p>  The modular programme is a significant element of the capacity plan.  The Minister wants to fast-track the delivery of these beds but there is a lead-in time for the construction of modular beds of between 12 and 16 months from the point approval has been given.  It is important that all available mechanisms are used to ensure there are no bottlenecks or delays and Clonmel has been mentioned as a good example of where there have been delays.</p> <p>  A number of members referred to additional capacity.  There is a need for reform in this area and the HSE is looking at a more integrated approach to patient care, in particular identifying a need to strengthen clinical interventions to improve care pathways, specifically around rolling out the acute floor model, strengthening palliative care in emergency departments, old person's frailty and reablement teams, and measures to support infection control, which was a major issue last winter.</p> <p>  Mr. Gloster spoke about delayed discharges and initiatives to support people returning home, including the winter initiative.  The independent expert review of delayed discharges was undertaken under the aegis of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly.  Graham Knowles, the chairperson of the UL hospital group, is chairing the committee, which will focus strongly on the monitoring data we use and the factors that impact on the length of stay for patients, specifically to deal with bottlenecks in care.  There will be interim recommendations to the Minister of State at the end of August which will inform winter planning for 2018-19, with final recommendations by the end of September 2018.</p></speech>

There was a question on why UL was always the highest for trolleys.  It has persistently had one of the highest attendances and it is rising faster than most other hospitals, which is a factor in the trolley numbers.  Our report for May showed three other hospitals with higher trolley numbers.  I was asked about the difference between trolleyGAR, which the HSE reports, and trolley watch.  I would not focus on the data because the underlying condition is unacceptable but we can provide our own information.</p></speech>

The trolley watch data count beds up the house, while the HSE data typically does not, though in some instances it does.  The trolley watch data also count beds whose purpose has been changed, though it is still an actual bed.  We have spoken with the INMO about this.  We used to reconcile them with the INMO to provide the information to the public.  The effect on flu and planning electives this year was significant, with 4,800 admissions relating to flu where there had only been 1,500 in the previous year.  We know, as everybody does, that the flu comes annually but the scale of the impact was high and it was a mixed strain, which brought its own complexity.</p> <p>  We can count all the electives as we see all the cases performed through the patient administration systems and the HIPE records which we have.  I was asked about cancelling.  Many hospitals do not book in January or February but their systems track what is done and what is cancelled.  Senator Swanick asked about the unacceptable waiting times in Waterford, where the patient to whom he referred had a 65-month referral.  I am seeking clarification on this and will provide it to the Senator when I get it.</p> <p>  There was also a question about CAMHS access, which we discussed earlier.  The Deputy made a proposal relating to a 24-hour access number for GPs and I will refer the query to our mental health services.  There was a query about community and district hospitals, which Mr. Gloster addressed, and the GP contract.  Another question was on the modular unit in Mayo and Deputy Kelly had a further query about the history of that.  There were proposals in Mayo and a theatre proposal in Galway, which involves replacing an orthopaedic theatre and which is proceeding.  Clonmel is the first example of additional capacity proposed for this tranche of modular builds but there are others on the table, which are the subject of deliberations with Government.  As for the decision-making process, the creation of the idea is local, having come from the local hospital group in Clonmel.  The decision-making process is subject to funding but this has been resolved in the case of Clonmel.  It involves the HSE leadership team and directorate on expenditure over certain limits.  Our estates function is involved in the practical progression of the development.</p></speech>

On any audit of the system of referral, to answer the Deputy's point the NTPF audits waiting list processes from time to time and consequently, there is an audit.  We have dealt with the age profile point.  The Deputy asked about how many facilities are down at any one time, perhaps referring to the opportunity to use more intensively theatre and other facilities that are available but not in use, potentially at night and the like.  A theatre productivity programme has been undertaken in the HSE to ensure we get optimum capacity but it also extends into working day and bed capacity.  Clearly, doing more operations requires more beds and more staff.  That ties into the capacity dialogue on the 2,600 beds.  The Deputy referred to performance at hospital level being an issue, and that is true.  There are variations.  This touches on Deputy Donnelly's question.  On competition among providers being a good thing, that was a view.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell raised the retention of graduates and asked why retention of graduates was improving.  I will ask Ms Cowan to answer that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Colette Cowan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#V00500"><p>Yes, and the Chairman had a similar question.  The most important issue with graduate nurses is to capture them before they leave the country.  In previous years we were slow at that and the young graduates would go to the UK and other places very quickly.  The UK would send people here to interview them.  We have put a process in place now.  They are upwardly mobile young people who want to travel the world at some point in their career.  We offer them permanent contracts with opportunities to take a career break within them.  In the past week, three of them have contacted University Limerick hospitals group to come back from their travels after their career breaks.  At least we are ensuring they will come back to a post here.  From talking to intern students and having the personal history of students qualifying, they would say they are wary of permanent contracts but they will take them if they are offered.  They are not interested in going straight into higher diploma education because they have just finished four years in college but they will do it two years' hence.  They have a big problem with accommodation.  They cannot get accommodation when they qualify or they cannot afford accommodation and they cannot travel from home because they cannot get access to transport in rural areas or they cannot get a driver test.  These are clear problems for these young people, as I am sure they are in other sectors.</p> <p>  When we surveyed them they said they needed support when they come onto the floor and training to deal with the real front-line pressures.  That is what turns them off sometimes and makes them leave the country.  They need support to deal with public expectation because they are the first point of contact when people are under pressure.  Also, there is a professional expectation of them and, in my view, one must mind them for the first 12 months and then offer them the higher diplomas or whatever they wish to do.  They do not know in the first year after they come out of college into what they wish to expand.  I believe we must incentivise them to stay through accommodation, transport and the like.  That is not just nurses but professionals at every level in the country.  As I said earlier, there is the same issue with trying to attract consultants back into the country.  We need to make some other offering to get them to come back and work in our services.  That will solve the waiting lists, theatre problems, opening of beds and so forth because our own staff will be retained.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.321" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018070400002#V00600"><p>To finish, Chairman, there was a further question about the Smithfield local injuries unit from Deputy O'Connell, which is associated with the Mater Hospital.  The Deputy correctly said it is very popular and is growing its volumes.  In fact, the level of referrals now to local injury units nationally is 94,000 per year, so there is a strong growth in attendances at those units.  That is true of Gurranabraher in Cork, where there is a unit on the hill.  People do not know about this so we ran a social media campaign for local injury units last winter, which was very successful.  It brought many patients to the units.  We will continue to do that.  On the issue of culture and awareness, the Deputy is right that many people still believe they need to go to the Mater Hospital rather than to the local injuries unit but that is changing and GPs have responded very positively to the extension of hours in Smithfield.  Regarding the notion that the Mater Hospital ED is taking a specific additional burden of work arising from the work of the local injuries unit, the EDs in the area are all growing, including that of the Mater Hospital.  There is no specific evidence that would say it is growing disproportionately more.  As there are local injuries units of various types associated with St. James's Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and others, that facility is available elsewhere although the Smithfield one is a fine facility.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if the HSE or the hospitals overbook outpatients.  It is true that part of the booking practice is an awareness that people will not show up but there are also opportunities for us to use the available space more productively.  However, the statement is correct.  The Deputy referred to the roll-out of texting and said that somebody could do that over a weekend.  The HSE must be cautious in terms of our general data protection regulation, GDPR, responsibilities and general data protection and be sensitive to consent issues with patients but within that context, we wish to use electronic means.  We would like to have an electronic health record online for a patient, so clearly that is something we want to achieve.</p></speech>

I do not believe there was the same trouble recruiting at the height of the property bubble.  There is more at play than simply the cost of living.  I believe it is the conditions in which the nurses and every other grade are working that are contributing to making the HSE an unattractive place for people to work.  That is the observation.</p> <p>  I had to return to my office to do some work and I was contacted by somebody from Roscommon who was watching these proceedings.  The person is obviously very interested in the capacity issue because there are currently 12 people affected by a closed nursing home.  He referred to delayed discharges.  Obviously, opening beds and step-down and care of the elderly beds in the community is central to dealing with the delayed discharges problem.  I will put to the witnesses the question that was put to me.  Is it not somewhat counter-intuitive to close nursing home beds, as is happening in the case of the Rosalie unit in Castlerea?  The HSE is closing beds on one hand while on the other, it is complaining, rightly, about delayed discharges.  Nobody wants to have delayed discharges and we certainly do not like using the terminology that was used previously to describe those people.  The person asked me whether there is a plan for those 12 people in the first instance.  Also, how does one square that with what is now being called the capacity dialogue?  It used to be the capacity piece.  It was the piece and now it is the dialogue.  How does the capacity dialogue in which we are all so enthusiastically and energetically engaged fit with saying on the one hand that we need to increase capacity, which we all recognise is true, and on the other, we are closing down the very beds those people should be able to access?  It appears to be counter-intuitive.</p> <p>  Thank you, Chairman, for allowing me to speak again.  I had not intended to return to the committee but I was contacted by the person from Roscommon.</p></speech>

Can Professor Cowan give me an update on the 96 acute-bed block, which is being funded through the capital plan?</p><p>Funding was achieved to allow the design to proceed.  What is its current status?  What is the timeframe?  When will it be built?  Will the witnesses give an indication that it will be built alongside the existing accident and emergency department, the new ED and above the dialysis unit?</p><p> I have discussed at length and over a long period with both the HSE and the Minister, Deputy Harris, the building of 16 modular builds - temporary builds - at University Hospital Limerick.  What is their current status in terms of the planning process?  From the point of view of logistics, and subject to funding forthcoming, when does the HSE expect to be ready to start building it, and how long will it take?  I think what people in Limerick and the mid-west really need is certainty surrounding bed capacity.  We have an issue of bed capacity in Limerick and the mid-west.</p><p> I wish to ask Mr. Bernard Gloster about St. Camillus Community Hospital.  Once again, it is a matter of bed capacity.  What is the current status of the &euro;50 million St. Camillus project?  Will Mr. Gloster give me an indication of the timeframe?  I believe we in Limerick specifically occupy a unique position in the country.  The Chairman will be aware of this.  We have a bed capacity issue.  It is a key issue apart from everything else.  Ms Cowan and Mr. Gloster might deal with both those points for me.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  The first concerns University Hospital Galway and the spinal unit there.  I will read the witnesses a line of correspondence from a senior consultant there: &quot;As you know, our ability to access major elective spinal surgery in the University Hospital has virtually come to a halt due to the lack of resource allocation.&quot;  What is being done to give the hospital the resources it needs in order to be able to carry out vital spinal surgeries?  At the end of the list there are people who have been in excruciating pain for a number of years and are absolutely at their wits' end.  If University Hospital Galway cannot do it, is there somewhere else across the Border or abroad where the surgery can be done?  Can someone within the hospital system find a pathway or say, &quot;The buck stops with me and I will find a way to take this person, or however many people, out of the excruciating pain with which they must live every day&quot;?  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is not an option because it states in the correspondence:</p><blockquote>Regrettably, the spinal service is not in a position to give me a date or a review of surgery at this time.  The man is not suitable for referral to the National Treatment Purchase Fund or referral to a private hospital due to the complex surgery needs.</blockquote> <p>We cannot just leave such people in excruciating pain and do nothing about it.  Judging from what is being presented here, one would hardly think we have a system that is almost the worst in Europe.  Every time we have personnel from the HSE before us, in committee and otherwise, they paint this picture that everything is happening and things will get better and better, yet we see that things are getting worse all the time.  Reference was made earlier to shifting the deckchairs around on the <i>Titanic</i>, and that is certainly my view of the matter as well.</p><p>I really must take up the issue of nursing.  I spoke to a number of nurses who live in Birmingham over the weekend and asked them why they do not come back to work within the system here.  They are not a protected species and they do not need to be minded.  The nurses I know certainly do not.  What they want is a safe working environment.  They say the Irish health system is too high-risk.  They wonder what will happen if they go into a high-risk situation.  They will be trying to do the work of three or four people.  They wonder what will happen if they make mistakes and who will have their backs if they make mistakes and lose their licences.  That is what they are trying to weigh up, rather than some of the things Ms Cowan mentioned, which may be concerns of a lesser degree.  What our nurses deserve is to be provided with a safe working environment.  There is a real crisis within nursing and recruitment.  The nurses also say the recruitment process is just too complex and that there are too many blockages along the way.  Can the HSE simplify that process?  If people have the qualifications and experience to do the job, they should be put into that setting and let work in their own country because people have a right to do that.</p><p>I think Mr. Gloster said &euro;500 million is to be spent on district hospital beds.  Will he tell me how many beds this will equate to and perhaps where they will be?  How many step-down beds did he say there are?</p></speech>

The short-stay beds are predominantly used for different types of step-down care.  People might go for rehabilitation after a hip fracture, or people might convalesce.  There is a variety of uses.  We also buy short-stay beds in the private nursing home sector for transition.</p></speech>

We always refer to our own cases.  Half of the 20 beds in Belmullet District Hospital were closed down due to the wisdom of someone within the HSE and what was the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time, even though we stated it would be a major mistake.  Now there are people in Mayo University Hospital whose wish is to be cared for within the district hospital setting.  What are the major hold-ups here?  If &euro;500 million is available, what are the blockages that need to be unblocked?  Perhaps the witnesses might explain that for us.</p> <p>  Regarding the missed appointments, one of the biggest problems people have is where services are moved - say, to Galway Hospital.  I am all for a centre of excellence but also that the other services be provided on the ground.  Obviously, the HSE needs the integrated appointments system as well.  People do not have the transport, so the public transport is not there to match up with their appointment times.  If someone is living on &euro;188 or &euro;200 per week, to get a private operator or individual to bring him or her from, say, Erris to Galway is just way above and beyond his or her means, and this needs to be looked into as well.  We had Bus &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority before us last week, and this is one of the questions we asked, yet they close down routes all the time that connect to the hospitals and the transport connectivity is not there.  I think the HSE has a role in this.  Actually, they cited that the HSE's response in terms of having a proper integrated transport system was dismal and certainly not consistent.</p> <p>  If we are to solve the problem within the HSE long term, we need to look at the education system.  We have a whole cohort of young people doing their leaving certificate this year.  They must go through the health professions admission test, HPAT.  Obviously, there must be standards, but for people choosing to go down the medical route who are 18 and 19 years of age, that passage needs to be made easier for them.  It is not about lowering standards but about the fact that young people who would make excellent doctors and who have a real sense of social justice, equality and fairness are not just driven and motivated by money.  What communications do the witnesses have with the Department of Education and Skills in having a real look at the long-term recruitment and long-term education that is needed to give us the numbers of consultants, doctors and so on that we need within the health service?</p><p>When will we see a proper, purpose-built hospital at Merlin Park?  The former Taoiseach cited several years ago that the regional hospital in Galway was not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with the Rosalie unit because three years ago I spent nine months there covering as the chief officer, and it was quite a hot topic then.  Essentially, the Rosalie unit had developed into a quasi-type of later life psychiatry or mental health facility.  Given their advancing years, many of the residents who utilised the unit at the time were identified as quite possibly being within the remit of nursing home care.  This led to a lot of discourse that the unit was maybe going to close and so on.  During the time that I was involved I gave an indication that while I did not believe the evidence would support the unit's retention or continued use for psychiatry of later life, it quite possibly might have a role in the context of older persons' services and care generally.  To be fair, I do not want to commit my colleague to something he cannot do, or to undermine his position.  When the Deputy raised this point I sent him a text and he has assured me that no decision has been made yet on the unit.  I believe there is quite a bit of narrative around it because I am aware that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice have both spoken on the issue.  Obviously, there is some local narrative and discourse around the matter, but my colleague, Mr. Tony Canavan, who is the HSE's chief officer in that area, has said to me that no decision has been made yet.</p></speech>

Although there is no decision yet, in fairness to the Deputy, to the question and to public anxiety about it, I am sure that Mr. Canavan will also wish to bring clarity to the matter.  I will certainly do that.</p> <p>  Senator O'Donnell spoke of St. Camillus Community Hospital in Limerick.  I can confirm the situation there because I went there two weeks ago.  I met the design team and I have seen the plans.  They are very exciting plans.  The history of St. Camillus Community Hospital is in the city and we are continuing to use that site.  It is proposed to build 75 beds on the site.  They are replacements for the existing long-stay beds.  I believe there was some confusion that they may be additional beds.  They are replacement beds because of the regulations, which are inspected by HIQA.  In terms of progress, I am told by the estates department that the pre-planning discussion will happen over the summer and a formal planning application will be made by the end of the summer.  It will probably run on for longer than an average planning application because there is quite a lot involved and because of the nature of the site.  It is hoped to put a spade in the ground in 2018, and to have the project completed well before the regulation deadline of end of 2021.  The unit will be built in two phases; 50 beds over two floors and then a 25 bed section on a single floor.</p></speech>

There is some moving to be done on site.  The only aspect after the planning that will dictate the start date will be the cash profile in the capital plan next year.  The money is approved within the 2021 programme, but as the members are aware the cash is profiled each year.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh asked about the &euro;500 million.  This investment programme in public, elderly residential care units is not for additional capacity but for replacement capacity.  It replaces, predominantly, the old nightingale wards in the older institutional system to provide facilities for older people who are in long-term care in a space that is compliant with regulations and consistent with modern day best practice.  It is a replacement programme.</p></speech>

On the margins we could lose two or three beds in places, or we could gain.  The difficulty with that programme is that it was announced by the then outgoing Government in February 2016.  We are experiencing some challenges as we progress through the programme now because of increasing costs in construction since that announcement.  This will have to wash through, but we are in very close negotiations and discussions on this with the Department.</p> <p>  Reference was made to closures of some beds, and while I do not know specifically about the Belmullet facility I am aware that in my own facilities in the mid-west two things happened that essentially saw some reduction in the numbers of beds in public units.  The first issue was that up to 2011 we were continuing to count the very old historical number of beds.  Even though the beds were physically there they had not been used for quite some time.  We recalibrated the system to give a more accurate count of open beds from 2011 on.  Where units lost beds it was because the site itself was being refurbished.  The regulations and regulatory requirements from HIQA is very high in the built environment and the amended regulations to allow us to continue up to 2021 only came about in 2016.  Before 2016, therefore, there were some regulatory pressures that led to some bed closures.  When our maintenance people go in to rebuild wards some capacity could be lost in the existing sites.</p> <p>  The other reason that bed closures could be experienced in community nursing units is not dissimilar to bed closures in acute hospitals, which is the workforce issue.  In different parts of the State we are very challenged in terms of recruiting the workforce we need for those facilities.</p></speech>

The HSE conducted its own capacity analysis prior to the national capacity plan, which showed that we needed 150 acute beds on the site to deal with the emergency acute activity that was coming in through the new emergency department.  The 96 bed and 60 bed blocks were very timely in that plan.  We have advertised for a tender to design for the 96 bed blocks.  We have funding to do that but we have no other funding in the capital plan yet.  The 96 bed project is in the capital plan to be funded from 2020 onwards.  It will be a three year build.</p> <p>  The modular build is a 60 bed block, on which a lot of work is under way.  The proposal has gone to Government for discussion for funding with all of the other plans for the State under modular builds.  We have a timescale for it and we could realistically get the block up within a 12 month period.  We have the site identified and the planning process under way.  Boring and testing was done in the area last week and we plan to be shovel ready pending approval to proceed.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to comments that were made about nursing being a protected species.</p><p>I do not believe I said on the record that the profession was a protected species, nor would I ever.  I am merely giving feedback from the staff themselves, and from the industrial relations representatives.  It is important that this be taken on board, notwithstanding that staffing issues, stress and the turnover of staff at board level is difficult for staff as well.  I understand that and take that point.  </p></speech>

They felt that they were exposed and vulnerable in situations like that.</p></speech>

The staff work in very high-octane environments and it is very stressful.  I was saying that we have to support these staff if we want to keep them working in the country.  Staffing is part of that, and the task force for staffing indicates that.  We consistently work on that day in, day out, to try to get staffing levels right.</p></speech>

Perhaps she can expand on the benefit of urgent care units and what they are all about.</p> <p>  The second issue concerns outpatient and inpatient waiting lists.  The theatre in Ennis is under-utilised, perhaps to 50% of its capacity.  There is huge difficulty with outpatient facilities.  There was a plan to move off-site which did not receive planning permission.  Perhaps Ms Cowan might address those issues.  The outpatient facilities in Ennis are inhibiting consultants from coming out to supply outpatient services there and to move away from the pressurised regional hospitals.  Perhaps she might elaborate on urgent care facilities and using the facilities in Ennis to their maximum potential.</p></speech>

We engaged with our colleague, Mr. Bernard Gloster, the chief officer, and his team to discuss how we could support patients that just need access to diagnostics.  These patients would come into an urgent care centre model on the campus rather than going into the busy emergency department.  They would be seen there in a unit run by GPs.  This model is used in the UK.  The GPs could then refer into the emergency department if the patient required anything other than the diagnostics.</p> <p>  A team of people went to the UK, including an emergency medical consultant, and they are now working on a proposal for what this scheme might look like.  This will be something that we could test in the Irish system which would take away some of the pressure of patients who may be waiting for long periods for care requiring only a quick turnaround.  We can share that paper with the committee once it has been written up.  The team is in the middle of working on it at the moment.</p></speech>

We are creating clinical linkage between the spinal unit in Galway and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, recognising the point that was raised by him.  He asked if there are options internationally.  The cross-border directive scheme is there, but for complex spinal surgery that would be quite difficult to operate.  A connection with the Mater is being created however.  I will provide the Senator with a report of that before the end of the week on that and send copies to the committee.</p> <p>  We have spoken about nurses and transport.  There was a reference to long-term workforce planning with regard to doctors and nurses.  Work has been done with the education system to address the need for doctors, and as the committee will be aware, there has been some uplift there in previous years.  We have recently appointed a head of workforce planning within the HSE.  As Mr. Bolger said earlier, the requirement to engage in workforce planning now on the basis that additional capacity is coming into the system is clearly strongly indicated.  This will be a key focus for us in the coming period.  </p> <p>  There was a question about when there will be a proposal for Merlin Park University Hospital.  The Saolta University Health Care Group putting proposals relating to Merlin Park to the HSE.  That is one of the dialogues that is taking place on capacity.  There are some proposals with us in that regard.  The group is also looking at the full Merlin Park site and what the future of the two locations is.  There are currently proposals to put a facility in Merlin Park. </p></speech>

The issue about increasing training places is that we will lose our graduates if the hospital system is not a magnet system that attracts people to come and work in it, because they will choose to go abroad rather than work in the dysfunctional system that we have.  While we need to educate nurses, doctors and other therapists, we also need to create an environment that attracts them, as opposed to repels them.</p></speech>

Some recent discussions with clinical colleagues about the gap between the post-2012 and pre-2012 consultants could be an issue.  Other contractual matters probably need to be considered as well.  Overall, there is a question of planning for the numbers we need and then there is an issue about having attractive employment.  The overall strategy of shifting to care in community and allowing hospitals to focus on what they need to focus on will help that attractiveness, as will capital infrastructure.  The integrated plan for health should create that environment.</p></speech>

We have gone back to the table to revamp it and reapply for planning to try to get it over the line.  It is of exceptional importance.  The current outpatient clinic is small, and we cannot get consultants to move there.</p> <p>  With regard to the theatres, we are focusing on the model 2 hospitals as part of our new strategy document around transforming.  The ophthalmology centre in Nenagh Hospital is one example.  We have worked with Ennis Hospital on developing the ear, nose and throat, ENT, service.  A new consultant will be commencing in the autumn who will operate and develop the ENT service in Ennis.  This will address the waiting list problem facing ENT services in the area.  That will be the first step for Ennis Hospital.  We have some work to do regarding the bowel screening programme there as well.  Ennis Hospital is the only hospital in our group that provides a bowel screening service.</p></speech>

Accompanying me is my colleague, Neil Maher, assistant principal officer in the rental market unit in the Department.</p> <p>  Regulations setting out minimum standards for private rented accommodation generally were first set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993.  However, a number of changes have been made to the regulatory framework since 2008 to reflect the requirements of a modern rental sector.  The current minimum standards for rental accommodation prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 were introduced in July 2017.  The purpose of the regulations is to provide residential rental accommodation that is safe, efficient, durable and comfortable.  These regulations specify minimum health and safety requirements across a range of matters, including fire, structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, safety of gas and electricity supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure their rented properties comply with the regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority.</p> <p>  The sector faces a number of serious challenges in regard to the minimum standards, including the low rate of inspection, high numbers of non-compliant properties, inconsistencies with interpretation and application of the standards and guidelines, and lack of follow up and enforcement action.  The strategy for the rental sector recognises high-quality rental accommodation is critical to the success and sustainability of the residential rental sector and its attractiveness as a long-term accommodation option for households.  It sets out a number of important actions to ensure the safety and quality of rented accommodation, by bringing rental standards up to date and strengthening processes for inspection and compliance.  </p> <p>  A review of the standards was conducted in 2016.  The aim was to ensure that the applicable standards reflect requirements of a modern rental market, contribute to delivery of high-quality housing and provide increased protection for tenants by addressing critical health and safety concerns, with particular focus on three main areas: to introduce changes to existing provisions in order to reinforce them and to include additional provisions not already covered; to strengthen local authority implementation through closer collaboration, co-operation and dissemination of best practice; and to focus on increasing awareness around the minimum standards.</p> <p>  The Department published comprehensive guidelines in August 2017 to assist and support local authorities in implementing the regulations.  To increase the numbers of properties inspected, specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity has been identified from 2018 with annual targets for both inspection and compliance agreed with local authorities.  The objective is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year with the aim of achieving a 25% annual inspection coverage rate by 2021.</p> <p>  A rental standards working group was established in 2017 to develop proposals and make recommendations to give effect to the actions related to standards under the rental strategy.  Three specialist subgroups are being established, including an IT subgroup to develop and roll out a national standardised IT system, and to develop or purchase software solutions to upgrade from current spreadsheets and Word systems in the short term; a training subgroup to develop and implement a training programme for enforcement officers, and host an annual seminar to share knowledge, best practice and to support continuous professional development; and a human resources subgroup to examine, make recommendations and secure agreement on all other HR aspects, including annual inspection targets, staff numbers, grading structure, funding, qualifications, legal services and so on.</p> <p>  Since establishment of the Residential Tenancy Board, RTB, more than &euro;36 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts with more than 229,000 inspections carried out.</p> <p>However, additional resources need to be provided to local authorities to facilitate increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance.  Provision has been made for an allocation of &euro;2.5 million in 2018, with further increases proposed each year up to 2021.</p> <p>  The Department recently issued letters to local authorities outlining the reforms and improvements envisioned for rental properties under the strategy.  The letters set out annual targets and requested each local authority to prepare an implementation plan to achieve them, including details about staffing, resources and other needs that will be required.  Individual implementation plans have now been received and are being examined prior to engaging directly with the local authorities concerned with a view to finalising and assisting with implementation and delivery.  Opportunities for delivering the inspectorate function on a shared basis, for example, legal services, will also be explored and implemented as appropriate.</p> <p>  I thank the committee again for giving the Department this opportunity to discuss accommodation standards for the rental sector.  I look forward to discussing this in more detail now with the committee.  I reiterate the Department's commitment to continue to prioritise and deliver on this important area.  My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to any questions or comments the committee may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosalind Carroll" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#D00800"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and committee members for the invitation to attend today to discuss the important issue of standards in the private rental sector.  I am accompanied today by my colleague, Janette Fogarty, assistant director with responsibility for dispute resolution services.  As the committee is aware, the RTB is not directly responsible for the inspection and enforcement of standards in the rental sector.  However, as the national public body set up to support and develop a well-functioning rental sector in Ireland, the RTB has, within its broader remit, an important role to play in the quality and standard of rental homes.  I will set out the RTB's role in relation to standards and further issues for consideration.</p> <p>  The RTB has 340,000 tenancies registered representing 174,000 landlords and 705,000 occupants.  With regard to regulating minimum standards in the sector, the RTB has a number of roles.  Since 2004, the RTB has provided funding to local authorities at the direction of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to enable them to meet the cost of inspections of private rented accommodation.  The total money distributed to date is more &euro;34.5 million, with &euro;1.7 million provided in 2017.  Traditionally, one-fifth, or 20%, of the RTB registration fee income was ring-fenced for inspections.  However, this was suspended from 1 July 2016 in light of the RTB&rsquo;s decreasing registration income.  Despite this suspension the RTB had already set aside funding from previous years in a trustee capacity for inspections, and another &euro;1.2 million remains available to be drawn down for inspections in the RTB funds.</p> <p>  The RTB also has an important role in relation to standards arising from its dispute resolution function.  In addition to the standards for rented housing regulations, there are obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act for landlords to comply with the rental standards and also to carry out all necessary repairs and replacements to rented dwellings.  This means that a tenant can refer a dispute to the RTB in relation to the standards and maintenance of the dwelling or breach of landlord obligations or responsibilities.  In 2017, 603 cases relating to the standard and maintenance of dwellings were received by the RTB.  The nature of these cases vary and range from issues such as mould, damp and pest control to appliances in need of repair or replacement and issues of heating.</p><p>To facilitate the local authority inspection programmes to enforce minimum standards, the RTB shares data on registered tenancies and associated details to local authorities on a periodic basis.  </p><p> As the primary regulator in the sector, the RTB wants to play its role in ensuring a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspection and enforcement process across local authorities.  In this regard, there are opportunities to enhance both the RTB and local authority role in data sharing to improve regulation of the rental sector from both a standards and a registration perspective.  As a member of the departmental working group on rental standards, the RTB is exploring opportunities to use its capacity around data intelligence to ensure better compliance with minimum standards and the broader regulatory framework.  </p><p> As a national body with a national database of tenancies, one of the most important roles of the RTB involves education and awareness.  We have a broad reach, which allows for consistency of messaging on important issues.  In August 2017, following the tragic fire in Grenfell Tower in London, the RTB issued correspondence and an information leaflet to 175,000 landlords to raise awareness of fire safety and the updated minimum standards for rented accommodation. The RTB has also been rolling out targeted campaigns on social media over the past number of months with engagement from local authorities and fire authorities.  </p><p> The RTB is developing a voluntary landlord accreditation scheme to support landlords to comply with their responsibilities and to increase professionalism within the sector.  A key part of the scheme will be to raise awareness and encourage best practice in the management of the homes landlords are providing, including an overview of minimum standards and landlords' obligations with regard to these.  The RTB believes that as the accreditation model matures, there is potential for it to be used as a certificate of compliance across all regulatory areas.</p><p> To conclude, the issue of minimum standards in rental accommodation is very important.  For tenants and their families who are living in poor-quality, unsafe or substandard accommodation, this can have a serious and detrimental impact on their lives.  From our perspective, there are two issues to be addressed.  First, we need further education and awareness with a consistent approach at a national level to inform landlords and tenants of their rights and obligations.  Second, we need to work in partnership and develop better ways of reporting to deal with the very serious issues of overcrowding in rental homes that are below standard or dangerous.  It is the RTB's view that we need to find a way to differentiate between these very serious cases and other cases of non-compliance that can be dealt with by working with the relevant parties through education and awareness.  At present, our reporting system and regulatory framework does not differentiate between the two and it is important that we have an accurate understanding of the actual levels of non-compliance in the sector and the level of seriousness.  The RTB is on the working group on rental standards and is supportive of increased inspections of rental accommodation.  We are committed to working together in partnership across regulatory areas in a more cohesive manner.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by our chief executive officer, CEO, Mr. John-Mark McCafferty, and our legal officer, Mr. Gavin Elliott.  Threshold was founded in 1978.  We are a national housing charity whose aim is to secure a right to housing, particularly for households experiencing poverty and social exclusion.</p> <p>  Threshold's input to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government's discussion on this issue comprises the following: an examination of poor standards in the sector drawing on case studies from clients accessing our services; consideration of enforcement and inspections; Threshold's policy on an "NCT" for housing, how it would work, the benefits to the State and the pitfalls of self-certification, defining and dealing with overcrowding and dealing with openness and transparency.  </p> <p>  In our opinion, the Government can no longer shy away from its commitment to provide quality housing and adequate standards for those in housing need and to ensure minimum standards are strictly adhered to in the private rented market.  Inadequate physical standards consistently rank as one of the top complaints raised by clients with Threshold.  I will provide a number of examples - as we all know, we have had a very difficult winter - of not untypical cases presented to Threshold on a daily basis.  Such cases include that of an expectant mother living with two young children in accommodation that is heated inadequately through two small electric heaters, a couple and their two children who all sleep in the living room of their home, which is heated through an open fire as long-term problems with the central heating have resulted in cold, damp and mouldy bedrooms and a couple and their premature baby living in a cold and draughty property where the heating and shower are broken and some of the windows do not close properly.  These are just examples of the wide-ranging cases that come to our organisation in respect of minimum standards and their breach.  </p> <p>  A significant number of rented properties are substandard and the current system of local authority inspections is failing to enforce the minimum standards required by law.  In the year to date, Threshold has dealt with 585 standards and repairs queries and in 2017, our housing advisers dealt with 1,261 queries relating to standards.  We live in an era in which employees are afforded protection in the workplace by health and safety regulations, diners in a restaurant can expect that the kitchen of the premises is regularly inspected to ensure health and safety standards, road users are obliged to adhere to preventative road safety measures that ensure vehicles on Irish roads are in sound working order and a consumer can insist that a good is "fit for the purpose".  Someone looking for a home to rent is a consumer but a potential tenant's familiarity with building standards is limited.  Tenants do not carry a damp meter with them when they go to view a property.  Many tenants are afraid to reject or walk away from a letting, particularly when supply  is so scarce and rent levels are astronomically high.  Few consumer goods more strongly merit protection than a home.  This includes freedom from damp and condensation, proper heating facilities, adequate ventilation and hot and cold running water.  </p> <p>  Unfortunately, enforcement and inspection of standards in the private rented sector are recurring concerns for Threshold.  In 2016, the number of dwellings that did not meet regulatory requirements stood at 10,418, which is an increase of 1,978 based on the 2015 figure of 8,440.  More dwellings were inspected in 2008 than were inspected in 2016.  In 2016, legal action was taken in only 16 cases nationwide.  Fourteen of these were concentrated in Dublin.  Within Dublin, South Dublin County Council inspected 1,355 dwellings and Dublin City Council inspected 1,751.  However, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council only managed to inspect 271 dwellings.  In 14 local authorities where dwellings did not comply with standards, zero notices were served on landlords for improvements to be carried.  In our opinion, this represents a failure in the system.  </p> <p>  Threshold believes the introduction of a certification scheme or an "NCT for housing" is the best approach to address the shortcomings of the current system.  In such a scheme, the burden of proof for compliance with minimum standards should rest with the landlord who should be required to provide a certificate of fitness to the local authority before a property is rented.  The integration of such a scheme with certification requirements relating to energy efficiency, fire safety, tax obligations and registration with the RTB would promote greater compliance in general.  Given the importance of this issue and the historic failure of the policy-making system to respond to this, Threshold recently established an online petition to seek public support for an NCT-type certification system in rented accommodation.  As of late June, the number of signatures is 10,229.  </p> <p>  How would a certification system work?  The property would be inspected by an independent and suitably qualified professional, the certificate be displayed in the rented dwelling, a certificate would be valid for a fixed period, the landlord would be required to supply the RTB with the details of certification, the certification scheme could be rolled out on a phased basis and an indicative fee structure could be established that would be affordable for landlords and would be tax-deductible.  </p> <p>  What would be the benefits to the State?  The onus would be placed on landlords to prove that they are compliant with the minimum standards.  A prospective tenant would be assured from the beginning that the dwelling complies with all legal requirements.  In our opinion, overall compliance levels would rise.  </p> <p>  We do not believe that self-certification is the answer to the current problem of poor standards in the sector.  It relies on landlords being caught and we are all aware this is no deterrent in the current system.  There needs to be sufficient sanction for failure to comply with minimum standards and self-certification is not going to achieve this.  Threshold believes that if car owners cannot self-certify a motor vehicle then rented homes should be no different.  </p> <p>  Overcrowding in the private rented sector is a serious issue that is increasingly coming to light through our services.  As a result, we believe it is imperative that a definition of overcrowding for private rented accommodation is inserted into existing minimum standards for accommodation to enable local authorities or a national agency to inspect properties and ensure compliance.</p><p>While there are minimum standards covering some aspects of private rented accommodation, the regulations are silent on how many people should occupy the accommodation provided.  Previously a landlord had to state the number of occupants and record the estimated floor space but this obligation was removed by section 62 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, and their inclusion would be useful in terms of measuring overcrowding in order to inform policy.</p><p> Finally, I would like to raise the issue of openness and transparency.  At the moment there is no openness and transparency in relation to the properties that are inspected.  In our opinion it should be clear and evident from the statistics that the properties that are inspected are those that are most deserving of being inspected in particular, properties that re pre-1963; properties that are more likely to be in breach of minimum standards; and properties where a local authority would be aware of potential shortcomings, as in for the sake of argument, unfortunate situations such as Priory Hall.</p><p> Can I thank the committee for their indulgence and for their invitation to appear here today?</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague here from Dublin City Council, Mr. Colm Smyth, principal environmental health officer and I will touch on some of the elements of the written statement considering the time issues.</p> <p>  First with myself and Mr. Smyth representing Waterford and Dublin respectively, we present a reasonable picture of the largest urban authority and a smaller urban authority in Waterford city, with a significant rural element in terms of the county area.</p> <p>  We broadly agree and are working with the Department on the current policy position which is to ramp up inspections as quickly as possible and we see 2021 as being the realistic position for reaching a 25% target in terms of inspections on an annual basis.  We see that being prioritised.  Our general view is that this would be very dependent on the data being generated, if we were to move to a risk-based approach, and a rate of around 20% may well achieve such compliance, as long as it is a targeted risk context.</p> <p>  There has been significant improvement over recent years.  I note the Threshold reference to 2016, but the simple reality is that there has been in excess of a 50% increase in 2017.  There will be a further 50% increase in the rate of inspections in the current year.  There is a significant effort and resource going into this issue.  Dublin City Council in the current year have employed 12 additional environmental enforcement officers to ramp up their activities.  In my own instance, where I already had one with back office support, now we have increased that by employing a further inspector.  We would see ourselves as moving to between 15% and 20% of inspections annually by next year.  Right across the county there is a very significant additional resource being provided.  We are working with the Department in terms of the areas that Mr. Dunne would have outlined already, and we will see that bringing about significant improvement.</p> <p>  Patently, we would accept the position as outlined by Threshold in some respects that there is an element of contravention and, human nature being what it is, we must strive to get the balance between enforcement and compliance right.  The nature of contraventions vary very significantly, from nominal contraventions, that do not necessarily have a major impact on the living conditions for those tenants occupying the buildings, to things that are more serious, in terms of health and safety or otherwise.  We want to gather this data ultimately and are currently looking to develop an ICT system that can report comprehensively in that context.  We have listed some of the types of contraventions and I will not go through all of them.  It is fair to say that pre-1963 properties are a particular difficulty.  We are also finding difficulty with the most recent regulatory changes in 2017, where in regard to some of the elements provided for in terms of window restrictors or carbon monoxide detection or otherwise, people simply have not caught up with or may or may not be aware of them.  There is certainly a need for the provision of further and continuing information to such landlords.</p> <p>  We have outlined a number of improvements that we would intend to achieve in the first instance in our statement and we would equally say there are spaces that we would certainly be open to dialogue on, and on which perhaps the Oireachtas or the Minister have a role in enhancing powers.  </p> <p>  It is certain, and I would emphasise this, that the resource base around the inspection regime is very significant and has to be ramped up really significantly if there is going to be impact in this context.</p> <p>  At the end of the day, there are a number of choices.  Who then pays for that?  There is the landlord, the State, and the tenant, obviously.  In general terms the landlord suffering these costs will ultimately pass them on to the tenant, which is the reality.  We need to get to a point - which we are not at the moment - where full compliance is the norm.  It is fair to say that the majority of landlords, particularly professional landlords, are compliant.  It is equally the case that there is a minority where compliance is not the norm and the challenge for us, as regulators, is to ensure compliance.  We welcome dialogue about how we get there.  We are seeking continual improvement here and we welcome this committee's consideration of this issue because our common goal is very simple.  We want to ensure we get to a point where compliance is absolutely the norm.</p></speech>

Ms Carroll talked about the need for partnership, joined-up thinking and synergy.  Before we proceed, I contacted a number of councils across the country yesterday, as I would do as standard practice before any joint Oireachtas committee meeting on housing, planning and local government.  I would circulate a certain amount of documentation and encourage them to come back and engage - it is one of the things I do.  I received the largest volume of emails from councils and I will cite just three, without naming individuals, and one,  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which was mentioned by the speakers.  Their councillors tell me that the provision for inspection for D&uacute;n Laoghaire is close to 2% of the rental income, approximately 300 of the 15,000 budgeted for.  There is general frustration in Wexford and Meath where the common theme in all of the emails received is that a lot of people come from social housing lists.  They are known and the accommodation has been identified as being unsuitable, with damp, mould etc.  These people have been prioritised for housing.  Yet, within weeks, these same houses that the council have come out and looked at as being not suitable for their housing needs, are filled again with another group of people.  These people are then back on to the council saying, within weeks, there is damp, mildew, mould and the same problems recur.</p> <p>  I am particularly thinking of a block in my own area - which I am not going to single out here because I do not think it would be right or proper - which has effectively become a whole ghetto of really bad stuff.  I went into a house the other day where the landlord had divided up one room into a three-room unit, drilled a hole in the wall for an outlet for a shower, and rats were coming up from the manhole.  That is out in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  These people - I checked to see where these people went - ended up getting accommodated by the housing authority.  No one is saying "stop".  The argument is that there is a crisis and we need accommodation.  People keep getting stuck in this kind of accommodation and we need to address this issue.  Where it has come to a council's attention that accommodation is unsuitable and they have had to move people out of that accommodation, they should immediately have to serve some sort of order or restriction.  That accommodation should be condemned and it should not be rented by other people.</p><p>Dr. Hayden's suggestion on an NCT makes sense.  Threshold has been campaigning on tenancies long before anyone else.  This is an initiative that makes common sense.  If one does not get an NCT for one's car, one does not drive the car.  It is as simple as that.</p><p> We must be very clear.  The same roles have to apply for social housing.  I accept Mr. Walsh mentioned that in the report.  We have social housing stock that is not fit for purpose.  I have seen letters that were written to tenants asking them to get Domestos, pull the beds out from the walls and wash the walls.  People with asthma and really serious bronchial problems are in accommodation that is not suitable.  Sometimes the entire focus is on the private sector, which I accept needs to be addressed, but the same standards and NCT-like approach should be applied to social housing because we have social housing stock in this country that is not suitable.  I have seen some very unsatisfactory accommodation.  That is an important point to make.</p><p> In 2016 the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, devised a strategy for the retail sector and launched Rebuilding Ireland.  Many things were going to happen, including the introduction of a new standard of regulation and increased inspections.  There was reference to coverage, compliance, ring-fencing funding and the development of efficiencies with IT services.  That was all talked about in 2016 and it is now 2018.  Everyone is on the same page.  Everyone wants to get the thing done.  It makes sense for us as a committee to promote an NCT-like approval for housing.  We can discuss it later.  If a property does not reach the standard, it is taken off the market and is not let.  We have had a good discussion today but we need to progress it.  Threshold has set out a very simple model which is doable, practical and easily understood and it is something we should pursue.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.</p></speech>

I think he is right.  We recognise there is a difficulty in standards in private rental accommodation.  The idea of an inspection regime is to have an impact on those standards and to improve them.  Obviously, that is not working.  The incremental strategy is designed to increase the impact and to improve the standards.  We have revised the standards.  The regulations came out in July 2017.  We have issued guidelines to local authorities on how to implement the standards.  We have set up our working groups.  As Senator Boyhan said, a partnership approach is needed.  We are committed to that.  We are committed to increasing inspections, but there are also other areas on which we need to focus.  Education and awareness are very important.  We must make sure each landlord is aware of the standards and the legal obligation he or she has to enforce the standards, and the responsibilities and liabilities they put on them.</p> <p>  I will sit down with Threshold and go through the NCT approach with it.  I do not make any commitment but I will consider it.  There are options such as self certification as well as an NCT approach and there might be an option for outsourcing inspections with a certificate at the end of it.  There are plenty of options but I think we can sit down and consider it.  There is a commitment on behalf of the Department going forward to try to increase the inspections.  Part of that approach is to ensure we follow up on enforcement where a property is in serious breach and in serious non-compliance.  Enforcement for landlords who do not take their responsibility seriously will send out a quick message that it is the responsibility of landlords and they have to get in line.  Many landlords do comply and if minor non-compliance is brought to their attention they remedy it very quickly.  I am not attacking all landlords, it is just a cohort that does not seem to accept its responsibility.</p></speech>

That is the key.  We have a fragmented regulatory structure because we have the local authorities on one side and us on the other and I think there is a lot of room for us to improve that.  We will work in partnership over the next year to try to address that.  It should not matter whether a member of the public refers an issue to us or to a local authority.  We can put systems in place to deal with that.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the stock coming back in and also to data intelligence.  Mr. Walsh talked about risk-based frameworks.  At the moment, when one sees a list of contraventions, that is all it is; it does not identify what is serious versus what might be a minor infringement.  In terms of targeting the bad stock we must get to a point where we have a red rating to identify the work that needs to be done.  We must put in a framework to address the seriousness of the various issues.</p> <p>  At the moment we are developing a landlord accreditation scheme.  The idea behind it is to look at landlords in their overall responsibility.  We want them to be able to say they have done a course which says they know not just about the standards but about everything they should be doing and that they would do an exam at the end of it.  We think there is potential for the NCT to be pulled in as part of that.  There is a lot of potential in that model which we are piloting at the moment.  We should be able to report to the Oireachtas on that in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hayden" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#G00400"><p>I am going to work backwards with Senator Boyhan's comments.  I completely agree with his comments on social housing.  There is a major issue there in terms of the funding of the maintenance of social housing.  We are well aware that an awful lot of what happens in social housing is reactive maintenance.  In most local authorities there has not been a stock condition survey since the early 2000s, so we have a major issue with the quality of social housing.  A lot of people do not seem to realise that the standards for rented housing also apply to social housing and there is an issue there that must be addressed.</p> <p>  On inspections, it is our experience that a lot of local authorities do reactive inspections.  In other words, they inspect HAP properties, for example, or they inspect where there are complaints, rather than having a proactive inspection programme.  In terms of resources, I completely agree, the inspection system has to be properly resourced.  We have to also accept that there are some local authorities that will not have the resources, in particular smaller local authorities.  The shared services model needs to be investigated.  We see, for example, the shared services model operating very well in relation to HAP with Limerick city and county councils.  There is room to look at that model to a greater extent.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Boyhan for his support for the NCT system.  In terms of the partnership model, in our opinion the NCT system works complementarily with the current inspection system, which places the onus on the local authority to prove a landlord does not meet the standards and it is a multi-stage process in many instances.  The advantage of a certification system is that one has to have it from the very beginning before one is entitled to rent property.  There is really no difference between it and a partnership process but what we propose would make it easier rather than more difficult for local authorities to fulfil their function.</p> <p>  Going back to the issue of properties not meeting standards on a consistent basis, I do not wish to be negative towards some local authorities, but there is a very big difference between them.  We are aware of some local authorities that do inspections in a brand new apartment block, carry out inspections on a selection of ten apartments and tick a box for 300 inspections.  I compliment Mr. Smyth who is here with us today for the intensified inspection programme Dublin City Council carried out between the canals, which specifically targeted pre-1963 properties that were known to be in multiple occupancy and were far more likely not to meet minimum standards.  It is very important that we do have an open and transparent system when it comes to inspections.  One of the advantages of an NCT-self certification system is quite simply that when a landlord is registering a property with the RTB, as he or she is legally obliged to do, and he or she does not present a certificate of compliance when the property is registered, clearly, one has a breach.  The bottom line is that one can focus on those landlords who are outside of the sector, because if they are outside of the sector in relation to compliance on one level, we know from experience they will be outside the sector in compliance with everything else, be it fire safety, tax or overcrowding.  No matter what it is, non-compliance in one area generally signifies non-compliance in another.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#H00100"><p>We are legally obliged to meet minimum rental standards for social housing.  We are seeking to achieve them and looking to move to a planned maintenance and inspection regime.  That is a dialogue that is happening with a separate section of the Department to that of Mr. Dunne and Mr. Maher.  There is certainly distinct movement in that space.  However, sometimes the political system is a little ambiguous in it.  The simple reality is that there is tolerance of any increase in any context in the resource base, through rent increases or otherwise.  There is as a consequence a risk of a diminution of overall standards.  In other words, everything will meet the minimum standards, as distinct from the other way around.  That is a challenge for us because, as local authorities, we want to push up our level of service, but in some respects that comes at a cost.  Generally, there is no reflection of this in the income base.<br/><br/>Equally, on investing in our houses generally at a policy level, there is a matter for the Oireachtas and the Minister to consider.  In reality, our current policy is that we build houses and within a relatively short period we give them away on a subsidised basis by way of tenant purchase schemes and otherwise.  From a policy perspective, investment in an asset that a tenant is entitled to purchase and that will, therefore, be taken from the local authority in the future is not terribly rational.  That is all I will say in that context.  <br/><br/>I consider the social housing function as being slightly separate.  I take the speaker's point to some degree in the context of the local authority housing properties that were mentioned.  However, there are different functions.  Housing inspections are generally all made within one Department, but the scheme of letting priorities prescribes the circumstances in which a house is to be let in any individual local authority area.  As such, it may be that somebody is housed because of the scale of the property required relative to family size or because of any number of other circumstances, as distinct from meeting minimum standards.  I do not think one can align the two directly, although I am not denying the essence of the point.  However, first, we have to adhere to the scheme of letting priorities.  On the other hand, I take the point that perhaps there should be clearer communication that a property needs to be inspected if issues are identified.  I can only speak for my local authority, but I know this to be the case - any arm of our organisation that becomes aware of an issue in a rental property brings it to the attention of the inspectors and <i>vice versa.  </i>If there is a serious fire standards contravention, for example, we bring it to the attention of the fire officers who, if necessary, can act under the Fire Services Acts.  I am not saying that is absolutely uniform, but it is the space to which we are getting.  I do not know if Mr. Smyth wishes to comment on the issue.</p></speech>

Creating risk profiles of properties that are more likely to be non-compliant, which is what we did under the intensified inspection programme, is labour and resource-intensive, but it does actually get results in the long term.  It can be a long-term undertaking.  For our part, within Dublin City Council we have set up a private rented unit to give a corporate response on properties that are inspected.  This means that there is improved joined-up thinking and inspections between planning enforcement, housing standards enforcement and fire safety standards enforcement.  They are better co-ordinated, certainly within Dublin City Council, and I presume that is the case within local authorities across the board.</p></speech>

It is eight months since the "RT&Eacute; Investigates - Nightmare to Let" documentary was broadcast and the D&aacute;il unanimously supported a motion, of which one of the central recommendations was the introduction of a system analogous to the national car test, NCT.  While the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme obviously showed the very extreme end - nobody is saying that is the reality for the vast majority of those of us who live in the private rental sector - we do have a difficulty.  I understand what Mr. Walsh says.  He believes the vast majority of landlords are compliant, but the problem is that we do not know that to be the case.  That is not me giving landlords a hard time; it is the very opposite, in fact.  The issue is we do not have data to confirm it.  I think most of us who engage with the private rental sector a lot are of the same view - we just do not know.  For example, the data available to us, limited though they are because some of them are a little dated, show that when one looks at the relationship between levels of inspections and levels of compliance, there is actually a far higher level of compliance than some people think.  Mr. Walsh is right that there is a spectrum.  There is very minor non-compliance which can be rectified very quickly, while there is very extreme non-compliance.  We need to be very honest with ourselves in getting a read on what is happening.</p> <p>  I do not understand why it is going to take us until 2021 to get to a 25% inspection rate.  In the first instance, that is a matter directed towards the Minister and the Department.  If it is only going to cost &euro;10 million over four years to bring up staffing levels, I do not see why that &euro;10 million could not be made available, given the fiscal space that will be available next year.  The issue is whether local authorities could ramp up inspection rates to 25% in one year, particularly those that are at the bottom end of the inspection regime. with an inspection rate of 1%, 2% or 3%.  The 2016 report of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC - again, the data are old - showed a large number of local authorities that were already at a figure of 10%, including Mr. Walsh's.  To move from 10% to 25% might be more possible in a year or two years.  If the Minister was to make a policy decision that &euro;10 million would be made available immediately, from the point of view of the Department and that of the local authorities, how quickly could we move to a 25% rate, accepting that there would be differences between local authorities, depending on their current performance?  </p> <p>  Different people have different ideas about the NCT-style system.  My preference would be to combine the local authority inspection with the NCT certificate in order that when the local authority carried out its inspection, it would issue the certificate.  Dr. Hayden is absolutely right - any new landlord entering the system should have  to have an NCT certificate before they let.  If 25% of the remainder of the rental stock was inspected in one year, all other landlords would be caught over a period of four years.  All new landlords would have to request it and would not be able to let without it and all existing landlords would obtain it over four years.  A landlord would then simply have to ensure he or she had it.  The certificate would be renewed every fifth year for a relatively modest administrative fee.  The scheme would be relatively revenue neutral for the local authorities, but it would not be prohibitive for the landlord or the tenant if it cost between &euro;50 and &euro;80 to have the inspection carried out on a five-yearly cycle.  I think a landlord could handle it.  If we were to do it in that way, we would get the benefit of the Threshold proposal, that is, putting an obligation on the landlord.  There would be a revenue source for the local authorities to cover part or most of the cost of inspections and by the end of a period of four to five years all landlords would have the NCT certificate.  Inspections would continue on a rotating cycle.  If it could be tied in with the accreditation system, as Ms Carroll says, we could have something really robust within a very short period.  It would not be self-certification; it would not be private sector-led and there would not be concerns about spiralling costs.  For me, that is the model that combines the benefits of what everybody here is recommending and I would like to see it progressed as quickly as possible.  </p> <p>  I support the risk-based model, but coming from a local authority area where we have very few old rental buildings, I note that we have a lot of new rental buildings that do not meet standards.  We need to factor this into the risk-based model also.  We have lots of developments in Newcastle and Rathcoole and some in Lucan and Clondalkin that were built during the Celtic tiger era and which already have significant standards issues.  They should be included. </p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the responses of the Department, the County and City Management Association and the Residential Tenancies Board to the point Threshold is making about overcrowding.  It is absolutely right about how we should progress.  Moreover, I refer to the penalties for serious breaches.  Under the current legislation, someone who is in breach will receive an improvement or a prohibition notice.  Again, in most cases of non-compliance that is fine, as an improvement notice will help to sort out most of the problems.  However, it seems bizarre that if someone is in significant breach, there is no immediate sanction.  I am talking about the small number of very extreme cases.  I would like to hear people's views on how we can strengthen that aspect.</p><p>The Minister is considering this issue not in terms of the next piece of RTB amending legislation but the one after that.  What level of prohibition would be appropriate to hit those instances of extreme non-compliance?</p><p> One issue that has not been mentioned but which we raised during the debate in the Oireachtas is the role of estate agents and letting platforms in advertising properties that do not meet minimum standards.  There must be a responsibility and a liability on the letting platforms and, in particular, estate agents because while staff of the letting platforms do not visit the properties they advertise, estate agents do.  For example, one prominent estate agent is advertising properties in my constituency that have received neither planning permission nor a building certificate.  It is a matter of public record.  In fairness to the local authority, it has made a complaint to the Property Registration Authority, but I believe stronger legislative sanction is required.  What are the delegates' views on how that could be achieved?</p><p> I wish to raise two final points.  It is unacceptable that people living in social housing do not have access to the same rights and protections as those in the private rental sector.  That makes no sense.  The only reason it does not happen - Mr. Michael Walsh will panic when I say this - is that the State does not want to foot the bill in having that responsibility in the short term.  The cost of giving social housing tenants access to the RTB, particularly on issues related to standards and maintenance, would be phenomenal.  Mr. Walsh is correct that there is a problem in meeting the cost in that regard.  I am not sure if increasing rents would be the best solution, although it would be one, but ring-fencing rent payments coming into local authorities and only allowing that money to be used for maintenance could help to an extent.  There is also the recognition that social housing is subsidised and that the State has a responsibility, as the landlord, to maintain these properties.  There is a question mark against the level of financial support given to local authorities to meet these requirements.  Take a look at the housing stock to examine windows and see if there is damp.  Local authority managers will know this.  I am not criticising local authorities, but the system has not been set up in a way that allows local authorities to use the rental income in the first instance.  Again, I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on that issue.</p><p> The last issue is damp.  While overcrowding is an issue, damp is a big issue.  It is an issue in older private rental stock, newer Celtic tiger private rental stock and social housing.  The difficulty is that tenants are being blamed for damp and mildew on the basis of "lifestyle issues", as they are called.  We need to examine the matter from a policy and legislative point of view to provide greater clarity on who is responsible.  We had an architect and chartered surveyor before the committee when we discussed this issue. They said a problem was developing in many European countries because the improved energy efficiency of new builds meant they were retaining more moisture.  In addition, some of the units are smaller and there are higher levels of occupancy in social housing and some sections of the private rental sector.  This combination is driving damp conditions.  It is not a lifestyle issue linked with the tenant but a structural problem.  Do we need a policy or legislative response?  I believe it will be a bigger problem into the future.</p></speech>

On the provision of support by the Department for local authorities, we do not fully fund the inspection regime.  We make a contribution of &euro;100 per inspection to support them; there is, therefore, an additional cost on local authorities to ramp up the resources available.  The incremental approach was adopted to allow them and the sector in general to adapt IT systems, look at efficiencies and a consistent approach in implementation and application across all local authorities.  There can be recruitment issues in having the necessary staff.  An extra &euro;10 million would not be enough because there are many other issues that have to be addressed.  As Mr. Michael Walsh said, if we could achieve efficiencies and have a proper risk based approach to properties, the target of 25% might be reached earlier or, as he said, a figure of 20% might suffice.  </p> <p>  As regards an NCT type system, we will take a look at it.  As I am quite new to this, I am not sure of all that is envisaged.  There are different options, as the Deputy said.  There are local authority inspections which could lead to certification.  We can meet Threshold and the different partners to discuss that issue.</p> <p>  With regard to social housing stock meeting private sector rental standards, as I only deal with the private rented market, I am not fully aware of the social housing side, but there are standards and the local authorities are active in trying to improve them.  They engage with the Department in a different forum from the ones with which I am involved.  </p> <p>  There are penalties under the enforcement procedures.</p></speech>

Again, when we work with the working groups and partnerships, we can look at penalties to see if there is an easier way to force enforcement and compliance.  Introducing penalties is a very tricky subject, but I am willing to encourage it.</p> <p>  Estate agents and letting platforms are not on my radar.</p></speech>

We are all concerned about it.  It is not part of the minimum standards for private rental minimum accommmodation, but there is a case for its inclusion.  However, one gets into difficulty with the definition.  We all want to deal with severe cases of overcrowding, but we do not wish to penalise families that have an additional member.  It is about getting the balance right and giving the right powers to the local authorities to implement and enforce it.  We are in ongoing discussions with DCC on some proposals; therefore, it is on our agenda.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned dampness.  As I am not a technical person, I will have to have a word with our building standards people to see if they can shed any light on it.  If there is something we can do in amending the regulation on dampness, we will do so, but I cannot comment on it further than that.</p></speech>

To echo some of what Mr. Paul Dunne said, we believe there has to be something on overcrowding.  There is a definition in the Housing Act 1966 which the CCMA representatives can address.  We must also be aware of what is in the Residential Tenancies Act, under which a landlord can serve a notice of termination in respect of somebody who is overcrowded in his or her property.  The instance the Deputy mentioned in the "RTE Investigates" programme and some of the very serious incidents we have seen are driven in a totally different way from some of the other instances where people are struggling to afford rents and there might be three children in one room, which would not meet the standards under the Housing Act 1966.  We do not want to see something being introduced overnight whereby many tenants would be put at risk of suddenly becoming homeless because we were going to serve notice on them where the local authority had stated it was not in compliance with the regulation.  We must be very careful about how we do this.</p> <p>  On our perspective, it is about a definition of serious overcrowding.  The Residential Tenancies Act contains a definition of serious anti-social behaviour and one could probably mirror something like it in the serious overcrowding piece.</p><p>It is important, particularly because of the type of housing market we have at present, that we try to differentiate between some of the issues which are occurring.  A person might need six months or so to find somewhere else that is a more appropriate size or he or she might be working with a local authority to move into social housing.  He or she should be not placed in a vulnerable situation in the interim.  That is the only thing that we would say requires caution.</p><p> To be clear, much of the overcrowding that received media coverage in recent months may not relate to tenancy agreements.  It may, in fact, relate to licence agreements.  We must consider where they fit within the legislative and regulatory framework.  Often, we get cases on overcrowding and it is the landlord bringing the case.  It is sometimes down to subletting or to Airbnb.  In many cases we have seen, the landlord was not even aware of the overcrowding.  We need to examine how this occurs.  A landlord might have let to one tenant who went off and made a business and suddenly put ten people into the property.  How does that get dealt with in the law?  It is a complicated area and we need to be aware of it.</p><p> I also wish to comment on the issue of damp and mould.  We get many cases coming to us.  As I said earlier, over 600 cases came to us last year in terms of standards and maintenance.  Another 10% of our cases involved a breach of landlord obligations and many had to do with the standard of the property involved, repairs and so on.  Ms Fogarty might comment briefly on the type of cases that come to us and how we deal with them.</p></speech>

Landlords and tenants have rights and obligations.  Some of the cases for breach of obligations would be in standards and maintenance, for example, that the landlord may not have carried out repairs and replacements.  In that regard, our decision makers have the discretion to award damages if there is a breach of obligations.  We have seen cases for damp and mould and failure to carry out repairs and replacements.  The average award given would be about &euro;1,000, with the maximum of about &euro;7,000 having been awarded to tenants in certain cases where there was a breach of obligations to carry out the repairs and replacements.  They would range from damp and mould to not fixing the cooker, etc., to not complying with minimum standards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.408" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hayden" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#K00300"><p>The issue of damp very much relates to energy efficiency.  It is estimated that approximately 20% of rented dwellings have a building energy rating, BER, of F or G, which is pretty low.  More than 55% are likely to be considered to have poor energy efficiency, with BERs between D and G.  Research by the ESRI has found that households living in relatively energy inefficient properties spend substantially more - up to &euro;419 more per year - on energy than households with better BER ratings.  That is a very important factor to take into account when we are looking at issues such as damp, for example.</p> <p>  On overcrowding, we would be in complete agreement.  There is an absolute need and requirement to have a definition of overcrowding within the legislation.  There are a number of existing definitions, as Ms Carroll has pointed out.  There is the 1966 definition and there are also good examples of overcrowding legislation to be drawn from the international framework.  However, one way or the other, the fact of the matter is that there are serious examples of overcrowding that go well beyond the enforced overcrowding that we are seeing because of a lack of accommodation.  We are seeing situations in our services where shift workers are, for example, sharing beds at different times of the day and night.  This is not and should not be a race to the bottom.  We have to bear in mind that we have an obligation to ensure that we have robust legislation, particularly around the health and safety of tenants, which has to be our primary consideration.</p> <p>  I am very glad the issue of licensees was raised.  We have serious concerns.  We need legislation over and above the existing residential tenancies legislation to incorporate the protection of licensees.  It is one of the most significant issues coming into our services at the moment and licensees have little or no protection under Irish law.  We would like to see the Residential Tenancies Acts amended to include licensees for protection.</p> <p>  On the difference between social and private rented housing, for many years we have increasingly been seeing a fudge on where social housing ends and private rented housing starts.  Under the Rebuilding Ireland strategy, two thirds of the social housing requirement is to be provided through the private rented sector.  Under the 2009 Act, somebody who is receiving support in the private rented sector is deemed to be in receipt of a social housing support.  It is Threshold's position, and has been for a very long time, that social housing tenants and private rented tenants should be brought together under the same regime, particularly in respect of dispute resolution and enforcement of tenancy rights.  As matters stand - the European courts have spoken on this - local authorities are acting as judge and jury in the context of their own tenants.  There is no independent mechanism for tenants to air their disputes outside of the body that is, in effect, their landlord.  From the processes of natural justice, we have taken the position for a very long time that we want to see the residential tenancies legislation extended to incorporate all social housing tenants, whether they be of voluntary housing associations, approved housing bodies, traditional council housing or social housing tenants with their supports provided through HAP, RAS, rent supplement or any other format.  We think the distinction between private and social tenancies is really not relevant as we are going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.409" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#K00400"><p>Mr. Smyth addressed some of the issues so I will just speak to just a couple.  In the context of inspection and meeting standards, we are moving towards a similar regime in terms of social housing.  For example, a pilot inspection programme was done in County Clare recently.  We are taking lessons from that and are in dialogue with the Department to move forward to a specific inspection regime across the country.  That will lead to questions regarding the required resources or otherwise but we would certainly see ourselves in that space from next year.</p> <p>  As to the question of why not before 2021, it is partly because of the fact that some are lower than where they are at the moment.  In my case, I would see us being at 20% by next year.  I think a good number of local authorities will be in that space.  The better immediate achievement here would be for everybody to get to 20% by 2020 maybe, so that we are getting very close to it.  That is really significant incremental improvement.  Taken in context, Dublin city needs another 70 or 80 environmental officers to achieve that.  There is an issue with workload.  The courts system is failure here in some respects because at the moment we are putting a major emphasis on getting compliance with improvement notices.  I do take the point, and Mr. Smyth might reflect on this, that in the extreme cases we do need to have significant sanction.  The balance between compliance and enforcement is a continual tension in all enforcement regimes.</p> <p>  There are other things in terms of us moving forward.  We need to do it on a relatively planned basis.  I am chair of the housing committee and one of the great challenges we have is that the 31 local authorities do not all go off in different directions and that we keep this co-ordinated.  There is a role for regionalisation in terms of back office supports in particular, so that we develop the skill sets on the enforcement side of things in terms of going to court and taking the follow-up.  We believe there is space for us to do that.</p><p> We need to improve our liaison with the RTB.  There are simple things such as the unique identifier.  We need our reporting to be based on the geographic information system, GIS.  Unique identifiers such as Eircode are not available to us in that context.  I see a very significant improvement coming by next year in terms of our systems and the reporting that develops from those systems.  The targets will ramp up significantly.  There was a 50% improvement last year and there will be a 50% improvement this year.  Incrementally, it is very good in terms of where we want to get to.  We want it to be on a planned basis.  The ultimate outcome here is compliance.  The ultimate outcome has to be that the landlord wishes to achieve compliance before rather than after the fact.  It is happening after the fact at present.</p><p> Mr. Smyth has a number of points to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Smyth" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#L00200"><p>I will address the issues relating to overcrowding, damp and mould.  I did a very quick analysis of the intensified inspection programme we did between 2012 and 2016.  We did them in approximately 12,000 or 13,000 units and overcrowding was not an issue.  It is a relatively recent phenomenon, possibly a result of what is happening in the rental market.  This is a complex issue.  If legislation is changed, that will have an impact in the context of other legislation.  Dublin City Council is very conscious of that.  It is important to look at natural overcrowding as a result of increases in family size versus gross overcrowding of properties.  We have looked at that.  The other issue in recent times is in owner-occupied properties where owners have found it difficult to meet mortgage repayments and rent out a room.  It used to be for one person but now it is for two, three or four people.  That is another issue.  If the owner is living on the property, it does not come under the regulations.</p> <p>  We have looked at private rental accommodation in a general sense and we would welcome a change in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to include definitions of overcrowding which would consequently be brought into the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations under which a local authority can determine occupancy rates in gross and extreme cases of overcrowding.  It is not for minor overcrowding.</p> <p>  Instead of going through the District Court, we would like the local authorities to be given powers to take cases to the High Court or the Circuit Court in extreme cases where the property is not compliant with standards, is overcrowded or where there is any issue the local authorities deem to be serious or putting tenants' lives at risk.  We feel that would be of benefit.</p> <p>  On damp, mould and condensation, I absolutely agree it is a highly complex issue.  It is a highly complex matter to deal with in both new and old buildings.  Heating, ventilation, insulation and the use of a property all have a bearing on mould, damp and condensation.  It is complex.  While retrofitting may increase thermal efficiency, it may also increase the consequences of condensation in the property.  I would welcome further discussion on that.</p></speech>

I listened to the proposal for an NCT-style system.  Such a system would make a huge amount of sense.  As Dr. Hayden said, a house is one of the most important things in a person's life.  It should go without saying that there could be certain standards to comply with.  When Dr. Hayden talks about an NCT-style system, it is really the same as a certificate of compliance.  In a sense, the witnesses are all talking about the same thing.  It is about setting the standard.  Is that correct?</p> <p>  We are talking about overcrowding.  Sometimes there is an undercapacity or under-occupancy in social housing.  My question for Mr. Walsh is about local authorities auditing occupancy in housing.  How often is this done?  I am aware of situations of families living in a four-bedroom houses where the mother has passed away and a son has taken over.  There was full occupancy at one point but now there are two or three bedrooms in a social house that are not being occupied.  How often are audits carried out to ensure, particularly in light of the current crisis in housing, the situation is assessed in order to ensure that social housing is sufficiently occupied and that there is not misuse?</p> <p>  In Dublin, rent accounts for almost 49.6% of a single person's income.  Outside of Dublin, the figure for last year was 10.9%.  In some cases, most of a person's income is going on rent.</p> <p>  I will leave it at that.  Most of the questions have been asked.</p></speech>

The data on under-occupancy in social housing are readily available to us.  We have cause to know that level of information because of rent assessments so we have it readily available.  I do not have the data at my fingertips but there is a level of under-occupancy in social housing.  Primarily it is as a consequence of the partners of elderly people becoming deceased.  It is quite difficult in a social context.  We seek to voluntarily move people into smaller units.  There is resistance in many instances for obvious reasons.  People are attached to their homes, as they have known them over a sustained period of time.  Equally, people have no wish to move away from their neighbours.  It is a very sensitive area.  We are continually seeking to engage with people.  In most local authorities, there are no rights of renewal for a sibling or a child in a scenario in which the person is not the primary tenant.  That varies across local authorities.  There is an objective across all local authorities to achieve greater occupancy levels rather than the other way around.  We have to do so conscious of the social circumstances of our individual tenants and the responsibilities we have towards them.</p></speech>

Senator Grace O'Sullivan is correct in that it is very much to do with certificates of compliance.</p><p>One does not wait to be caught by a garda on the road to see if one's brakes fail.  We want to know that the brakes work before somebody gets into the car.  Similarly, we want to know that the property is safe before somebody resides in it.  That is, in effect, where we got the NCT moniker.</p><p> With regard to under-occupancy, I will not answer for the social housing sector but it has certainly been a difficulty for a long time.  Many single people are living in the private rented sector because, historically, much social housing has been geared towards families and tends to be in the three-bedroom style.  It is important that, as we look at the change in demographic profiles, single people should not be confined to the private rented sector.  When a three-bedroom property comes back to a local authority, it should be reviewed to see if it can be subdivided into two single units, for example.  There is no logical reason to take back a three-bedroom property and put it back out as another three-bedroom property.  There is an issue with single people being trapped in the private rented sector.</p><p> I am glad that the Senator raised the issue of rent, which is of huge concern to Threshold.  It is important that affordability in the rental sector is addressed.  We have seen a commitment from Government to the introduction of affordable rental housing.  We have yet to see any detail as to what that will be.  There is no question or doubt that we increasingly see people come in who are in jobs and are seriously at risk of homelessness because they cannot afford to put a roof over their heads.  That has to be addressed.  We also want to see effective implementation of the rent pressure zone legislation.  We have made numerous proposals to the Government about this.  That has to work effectively if we are to have any possibility whatsoever, in a market where we will not see adequate supply for a period, of making sure that people are not forced into positions where they go without food and necessities to pay rent.</p></speech>

We have a housing crisis.  Rented properties are a massive issue.  We have a lack of supply.  We are trying to bring in a system to help people.  There are cases in my area where landlords will not take housing assistance payment, HAP.  They take cash.  Since we have a lack of supply, we force people, since they cannot find proper accommodation, into homes where the landlord will not take the HAP.  Mr. Michael Walsh said that it should be getting better with current rental policies.  I do not see it because there is no joined-up thinking between organisations, and we have a dilemma.</p> <p>  The figures here relate to funding to local authorities for inspections.  Since 2004, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, has been providing funding for local authorities through the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There is over &euro;34.5 million, with &euro;1.7 million provided in 2017.  There are 31 local authorities.  I ask for the facts, figures and breakdowns of who got what and what accountability there is for every local authority.  How many inspections and enforcement proceedings happened?  There were none.  I do not blame anyone here for this but the biggest issue is staffing.  Most local authorities are under much pressure with staffing.  I hate the summer because every time the summer comes, through no fault of the local authorities, if someone is on holiday, they are lucky to get someone who will do that work as well as their own.  They could be trying to do three jobs and they do a great job.  I am not blaming the local authority staff.  We have excellent staff.  It is a problem across all 31 local authorities.  I can speak for my own local authority in Carlow.  It is understaffed.  Can we have accountability in respect of that money?  I see that provision has been made for allocation of &euro;2.5 million in 2018 with further increases proposed up to 2021.  The Department issued a letter to all the local authorities on 5 February.  The letter set out annual targets and requests each local authority to prepare an implementation plan to achieve this, including staffing, resource and other needs.  Will the witnesses be accountable about this?  Will every local authority come back to them?  I understand that each local authority is different, gets different funding, has a different system and has its own book relating to tenants and private landlords.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is having a summit relating to-----</p></speech>

We have all 31 chief executives - I would always call them county managers - there.  Can we not all work together on a plan?  I have only learned all of this since I have come to these meetings.  Dublin is able to say that its policies are different and Waterford's policies are different.  If policies are not similar, the only ones who lose out are the tenants and the people in private rented accommodation.  What was the outcome of the letter that was sent to all the local authorities?  What different issue faces every local authority?  Can we have a breakdown of the &euro;34.5 million and &euro;1.7 million provided to the local authorities in 2017?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  It is an issue since people are taken off the housing lists and it is deemed that they have a house, yet repairs need to be done.  This goes back to every local authority.  Activity in respect of my local authority's repair system, whether for dampness or another issue, is very low.  Other local authorities do much more work than some.  That is not acceptable.  The witnesses should get together and have a scheme for all local authorities, whether to fix dampness, a cooker, a fireplace, windows or doors.  These are all issues for which local authorities state they do not have funding.  Some local authorities are doing it and others are not.  That is unfair because in the end, everybody pays the rent.  It is the same throughout the country.  The cap is &euro;150 to &euro;180.  The highest earner pays, whatever the number in the house.  The proper money is paid across the country, through the local authorities.  We need to look at that.  Could the witnesses get a system together and work on joined up thinking?</p> <p>  We spoke about the NCT.  It is probably a matter of wording.  There needs to be a proper NCT for private rentals.  I come across cases relating to private rental not working.  Rent pressure zones were introduced recently and I asked the Minister many times how can he expect a rent pressure zone to work when he will not bring it in to every local authority, that is, when neighbouring local authorities have it while others do not?  Every local authority should have this.  We have none in Carlow.  Wicklow, our neighbouring county, has it.  That does not make sense and it is unfair on the local authorities that do not qualify for it.  I do not understand, when we are in a housing crisis and are told that we need to do things urgently, why the Minister will not bring it in across the 31 local authorities.  He says we have to go back to look at phase 2.  Some local authorities did not qualify under phase 1, so he has to look at phase 2.  He cannot guarantee if the other local authorities will qualify.</p><p>That is unacceptable.  I am not blaming the witnesses but there must be a joined-up approach and every local authority must get its fair share of funding.  I acknowledge they cannot compete with the cities such as Dublin and Waterford but the smaller local authorities need to be looked after.  That is where we are failing.  I firmly believe that the biggest issue we have is the lack of supply.  The rent pressure zones are not working.  We need accountability in housing.  We have good landlords - there is no point in saying otherwise - and we cannot categorise every landlord as not being good, but we need a balance.  I have been to several houses on which landlords need to do work and they are just not doing it.  I get on to the council and the council says that is not its remit.  We need to look at enforcement and legislation.  The biggest issue is staffing.  It is a massive issue.  I could talk all day about housing and local authorities, but perhaps the witnesses could come back to me on the points I have raised.

We must do a lot of work on data and find out exactly what is going on with the private rented sector.  We will work on the quarterly return we get from local authorities to expand it.

We have all the plans in now so we are going through them and will sit down with each local authority.  The plans set out specific targets for each local authority to reach the 25% target by 2021.  Obviously, each implementation plan we have is different but, generally speaking, team-wise, resources are the major issue.  We are coming from a situation whereby local authorities were very badly hit by the recession and lost 25% of their workforce.  The reality is that it has taken time to start escalating that back.  As a Department, we are supportive of any sanction requests we get from local authorities.  They are starting to come in now.  I refer to the inspectorate function.  That implementation process is very much in train and complements the other processes we are carrying out around streamlining training, for example, as I said earlier.  We will have a programme rolled out and standardisation of the application of the regulations and guidelines.  This will effectively bring all the inspectorate teams together across a number of programmes in order that out of that, it is hoped, they will also develop a network and we will have a consistency in application of the regulations and guidelines.  There are many things going on that are starting to make a difference.  Even last year, the indications are that inspection figures were up 4,000 on the previous year.  We want to move things forward more quickly, but the changes being made are starting to take effect.  I think those are the main issues the Senator raised.</p></speech>

Separately, the CCMA housing committee has a number of subgroups that are working to try to join up some of these animals but specifically the private rental standards.  The Senator says it is unacceptable that there are different standards in different local authorities.  I agree with her only in the sense that we should all seek to meet the minimum rental standards.  After that, it is an essential part of local democracy that the budgets be set locally and that there be different cultures and traditions surrounding housing generally across different local authorities.  There should be scope within the overall regime.  The local authorities are independent corporate entities and in terms of local democracy some element of flexibility is needed but the simple reality is that by law, we must meet minimum rental standards.</p></speech>

The money that goes out every year, and which we are directed to distribute by the Minister, is based on the number of inspections, so the more inspections a local authority does, the more money it gets.

Whether it be HAP or rent supplement, paying under the counter and topping up has been a feature for low-income tenants for decades.  Obviously, where there is a significant shortage of supply, the pressure on tenants is even greater than when there is more property on the market.  I ask Mr. McCafferty, who works on the front line, to add to that.</p></speech>

The issue comes through in our client case work and has been evidenced in recent weeks by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report.  Our advisers are working on it on an ongoing basis.  Clearly, where there is, as Dr. Hayden pointed out, such a reliance on the provision of de facto social housing through HAP and other supports, the importance of access and retention within the private rented sector through something like HAP and the importance of it working are real concerns where there are landlords in the current market with limited supply saying they are picking and choosing.  This can be challenged through existing legislation.</p> <p>  I wish to say one word about energy efficiency.  There is a relatively low baseline in terms of energy efficiency and there is a way to go.  As we approach higher levels of energy efficiency - points were raised about intensification and there being more people per housing unit - the issue of damp is coming to the fore more and more.  I think it is seen in the likes of Scandinavia.  We need to monitor and work proactively on it.</p> <p>  It is important that the partnership we are talking about extends beyond this morning and to an ongoing structured liaison with the local authorities, the Department, the RTB and organisations such as ours on issues of standards raised this morning.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  My comments do not reflect on anyone; it is just the situation we are in at present.  We must admit that the current system is not fit for purpose and that something radical needs to happen in respect of the rental market.  When I talk about the rental market, I do not just mean the private market; I mean the public side of it as well.  One of the disadvantages of this is that the biggest landlord, namely, the State is itself, is outside the regime.  It needs to be brought into whatever the future regime will be.  The NCT system as a model has been mentioned and is thrown out there a lot.  When it was mentioned years ago in the context of the motor trade, it was said it probably was not workable and could not happen.  It is now becoming an acceptable part of life, and we now have just over 2 million vehicles registered in Ireland that must go through an NCT system.</p><p>We also introduced the building energy rating system, BER, which is now a standard part of life.  These things can be done.  I agree that it takes time and that resources must be put behind it.</p><p> An inspection system would have two different aspects, one of which would be the physical structure of the building and whether the layout, ventilation, fire alarms and so on complied with the regulations.  This would a physical inspection that could be carried out.  This should be done regularly and no new tenancies should be signed up without that inspection being done.  That should be the starting point and it should then be reviewed every so often.  Critically, an unannounced inspection regime should also be brought in.  We should target 20% to 25% of all properties with unannounced inspections to deal with overcrowding, equipment not being in place and issues around damp.  This would be an holistic approach, but with two different systems.  It can be done if the will is there to do it.  As a society it needs to be done.  Social and local authority housing has to be brought into the system but would a local authority inspect itself by being its own inspector?  Would we rely on the private sector to do this?  Would we rely on the Residential Tenancies Board?  In fairness, it would not be very hard for the local authorities to inspect themselves and maybe another approach needs to be taken in how we do it.  We must, however, achieve an NCT-style system where the physical structure of the building is inspected before anybody can occupy it, and then we need a target of 20% to 25% of unannounced inspections annually on rental properties, which would deal with day-to-day issues of overcrowding, damp and lack of equipment.  These are just a few issues I wanted to raise, and if anyone would like to come back in, they are more than welcome.</p></speech>

The difficulty with the data on the Department's website is that the most up-to-date data on the private rental figures is 2013-2014.  If there are more up-to-date data, perhaps the Department could forward them on.  I assume that the most up-to-date data are the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, annual performance and indicator reports.  If there are other sources that we do not know about, maybe the witnesses would let the committee know because it saves them having to give it to us.</p> <p>  With regard to the rent issue, as raised by Mr. Walsh, the most up-to-date figures from one of the NOAC reports tell us that rental income during 2014 across the local authorities was &euro;348 million.  The costs of maintenance, rent administration and the community function was almost &euro;297 million.  The Waterford local authority had rental income of &euro;11 million but the maintenance and administration was &euro;7.1 million.  Clearly there is money there.  I am not saying that the &euro;6 million spent in 2014 was sufficient, and perhaps the Waterford local authority would have wanted to spend more if it had had it.  Is it a problem that rents are being diverted to other areas of local government expenditure or is it that rents could not cover the level of maintenance that is required?  I ask this in order for us to understand the issue properly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#O00400"><p>It is a complex question to answer.  I will refer to the situation in my area.  In general terms and keeping it very simple, the housing function plus central management as the overhead of the organisation and the maintenance function is generally managed in the overall budget.  There are other areas such as community services where there is a significant imposition of costs, with much of it focused on local authority estates and otherwise where there is expenditure.</p> <p>  We are looking at resources overall.  The answer to the Deputy's question will, in some respects, come from the inspection system.  We must have a standardised inspection system.  I take the point about local authorities conducting inspections, but regardless of who does it, the inspection system must be standardised and uniform in the private rental and the public rental sector.  As an indictor, that cost comes in at around &euro;150 per inspection contracted out.  It is not an insignificant amount when applied to 130,000 or 135,000 houses.  It needs to be done nonetheless because ultimately it is all about information and data.  If that inspection regime were in place now, one could start assigning costs to remediation of the issues that have been identified.  Resources are not that bad in the space but we would need to be able to prove that, and one of the problems is that post Celtic tiger and post recession, we have been forced through a diminution of resources into reactive maintenance and so on.  The optimum scenario is to have a planned maintenance regime that people clearly understand that is targeted to achieve the minimum rental standards.</p></speech>

Is rental income being diverted into other areas of service delivery or is all the rental income remaining within the housing function, especially the maintenance, administration and estate management functions?</p></speech>

This has been forced by the general financial situation.  The simple reality is that post 2008, the sum of the income has declined significantly and it is a question of trying to manage the overall income base annually.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

It is very simple.  In a few simple words, how do we progress NCT-style rental property inspections from here?  The Department has said that it is anxious and that it is keen to look at it, but we need stronger commitments than that.  These proceedings are televised and many people who are involved in social and affordable housing, the rental sector and tenancies tune in to these and they are very interested in engaging with these meetings, albeit externally.  How can we go from this room today and progress the issue?  We all know the problems.  Everyone is talking about the problems.  Nobody is saying that there is not an issue or a problem, but I am interested in hearing from the County and City Management Association, because its members are at the coalface of the problem, about the NCT-style inspections.  I would also like to hear from the Department and from Dr. Aideen Hayden of Threshold on what they would like to see in place with regard to rolling out the NCT-style inspections.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised an interesting point that it could be done over a period of years through the local authority inspection programme if it could be guaranteed to reach all rented properties over a period of time.  We would not be remotely prescriptive on that.</p> <p>  Threshold has done some work, through a subcommittee of Dublin City Council and with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  A report was produced for the housing strategic policy committee in the council.  One of the proposals was that the current requirement for a BER certificate for all rented properties could be expanded very simply to include minimum standards and, as illustrated by the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" Nightmare to Let programme and issues such as overcrowding, it would include requirements for fire safety.</p><p>Rather than a BER certificate, there would be a combined certificate which covered all the areas with which the landlord was required to comply.  We believe that certificate should be valid for a specified period, unless something happened.  It would be similar to how if one has a car crash and the vehicle is wreck, a national car test, NCT, certificate does not remain valid to put it back on the road.  If something comes in the way, such as some sort of significant damage, the certificate would cease to be valid.<br/><br/><i>Prima facie</i>, if one has a certificate, it is valid for a period, it is displayed on the wall of the rented property and can be seen by a prospective tenant to the effect that the property complies with minimum standards.  It might be signed by a local authority, or there could be a list of qualified persons who could provide a certificate of compliance similar to when a property is surveyed for conveyancing purposes.  That would be attached to any tenancy registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  When the landlord puts in his or her registration details, ideally at the same time as lodging his or her deposit, although a deposit protection scheme might be an issue for another day, he or she would also lodge a copy of the certificate or the certificate number which goes with the registration.  That would provide evidence that the property had been sufficiently inspected and had the certificate of compliance.<br/><br/>People cannot be expected to do this overnight, but as the bedsit ban was rolled out over four years, we think four years would be a reasonable period to roll this out.  This could be cost neutral for a landlord.  There is no reason it should cost significantly more than a BER certificate.  It ought to be tax deductible similar to other costs and expenses.  There is no reason a reasonable landlord should regard it as an additional imposition.</p></speech>

Cost is the issue that concerns me but we are happy to explore it.  We want to get to a standardised inspection regime that is recorded through IT.  It should not be that difficult ultimately to transition that into a certificate.  The question is how we get there.  We argue with the Department about the cost of inspections which we say cost us &euro;150 to &euro;200.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman referred to unannounced inspections.  They are nearly impossible.  One will be knocking on a door with no one there to open it.  Our difficulty is that it is desperately resource intensive in trying to get access and get around the place.  Neither is it only the inspections, as they lead to further work, whether it is issuing a certificate or otherwise.  If I recall correctly, there are more than 300,000 rental properties.  If each costs a couple of hundred euro to inspect, that is a total cost of &euro;60 million that must come from somewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.470" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosalind Carroll" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#P00400"><p>To return to the NCT-type certificate, the RTB is very concerned about standards and is supportive of change around them.  It is probably supportive of the idea of certification.  We must look holistically across what we are doing in the rental sector.  We are in the middle of looking at legislative change in rent pressure zones, sanctions and registrations, and we need to factor in everything in the sector.  One cannot deal with one aspect alone at any time.  We have 340,000 tenancies and 174,000 landlords.  Dr. Hayden spoke about bringing it in over several years.  For certainty in the market, there should be a clear idea of where we are going, what we are doing and when things will be brought in.  Speaking to the stakeholders with whom I work, they feel that considerable surprise is brought upon them, along with the number of properties contracted last year for the first time in several years, which worries me.  It might seem like a cost but sometimes it is what can come across as very anti-landlord rhetoric.  We have all said here that we are discussing a small minority.  We need to ensure that we are doing this in way that is supportive to the sector and in such a way that landlords can deliver and comply.</p> <p>  We must also acknowledge that there is a huge lack of knowledge.  Both I and Ms Fogarty spend a lot of time with stakeholders trying to give them information and education.  Most landlords do not know the standards.  They do not know that they had to bring in window restrictors or that they need to install carbon monoxide detectors.  We have to start with basics.</p> <p>  There is much focus on the property but behind every property is a landlord and a tenant which is why we are focusing on a landlord accreditation scheme.  The NCT-type scheme needs to come in under that.  We have looked at models in Wales, for instance, where there is an accreditation scheme which is all about the landlord.  If the landlord does not comply with the standards, he or she does not get a licence.  It is not about the property, but about the landlord.  Without that licence they cannot act as a landlord to the property.  They must give it to an agent or someone else who must be accredited.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, we must go away and map out how this will work along with the other things we are introducing.  We need to look at legislative change.  Dr. Hayden says that it would come in and the RTB could do something but we could not do anything without legislative change.  If an NCT-type scheme were introduced, we would also have to go back and consider the Act which regulates the RTB.  It is a complicated framework but we are very supportive of getting to the right place.</p></speech>

In fact, having a strong NCT-type system is good for compliant landlords because it prevents what we hope is the majority of compliant landlords being undercut by rogue traders.  We had this type of conversation with the Irish Property Owners Association the previous day.  They came in assuming that the committee was anti-landlord when we are not.  Like everybody else, we are looking to find the right balance.  I would say that we are expecting two pieces of legislative reform from the Minister, so part of the reason we are having these conversations is for precisely the reason Ms Carroll mentioned, namely, to ensure that what is in those legislative packages assists us all in achieving it.</p> <p>  While I know that Ms Carroll was not saying that any of us were being anti-landlord, behind every non-compliance is a tenant who is left to try to police that by taking cases to the RTB.  It is important that we get that balance.</p></speech>

What I mean is that what emerges from all our discussions, whether here or elsewhere and often when it is in the media, can be construed in that way.  I spend a lot of time with stakeholders who feel that, whether it is right or wrong.  We need to find a way to ensure that they see the NCT-type scheme referred to as a support, something that they can deliver over a period, and to which we bring some certainty.  The Deputy is right and I did not want to make inferences on the committee, so I apologise.</p></speech>

We are keen to engage with policymakers, local authorities, the Department and the RTB on this and would welcome any further engagements, both inside or outside of the Oireachtas, to progress the matter of standards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.475" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hayden" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018070400002#P00900"><p>I take Ms Carroll's point.  The system of landlord accreditation in Wales put a much heavier burden on landlords and a much greater onus on them than any ten NCT-type certificates.  It requires them to receive training and education along the lines of continuing professional development.</p><p>I do not see members of the Irish Property Owners Association, IPOA, jumping up and down welcoming that one.</p><p> Through the NCT system, all we are doing is asking landlords to comply, not with additional burdens, but with what they are already required to do.  There is no additionality.  As Mr. McCafferty said, we are making it easier for the bulk of landlords who, as we are well aware, are compliant.  Threshold is just as concerned about the loss of small-scale landlords in the system as anyone else.  It is our tenants who are most at risk of small landlords leaving the private rented sector.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, and institutional investors do not want our tenants - low-income tenants on State supports like HAP.  They are coming into the market at the top end and are not interested.  I am not here to defend landlords but those trusts and investors are getting preferable tax treatment under the current system.</p><p> I am not suggesting we impose greater obligations on compliant landlords.  I am simply saying there is a system with which people are supposed to be complying.  All we are asking them to do is pay more or less the same money they are paying at the moment, which they can use to reduce their taxes, to get a certificate that says they are complying.  This will maker it easier for local authorities, the RTB when it gets its enhanced powers, and the Department to identify those who are not complying, because that is the bottom line.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, it is our first appearance before it.  In fact, it is perhaps our first physical public outing.  The Legal Services Regulatory Authority is a new organisation.  As such, we thank the committee very much for giving us this opportunity.  I introduce my colleagues, Dr. Brian Doherty, chief executive officer, and Mr. Ultan Ryan, secretary.  As we provided the committee with an advance copy of our statement, I will not need to go through it word for word.</p> <p>  As the members know, the narrative behind the authority is that the Act was signed into law at the end of December 2015.  The authority was legally established on 1 October 2016 and the members of the authority were appointed by the Government following the statutory nomination process.  That is quite an unusual approach in the sense that there are nominating organisations which provide two names to the Minister who, in turn, seeks approval of the nominations from Government.  The nominations then go before the D&aacute;il and Seanad for separate resolutions before the members are appointed by the Minister.</p> <p>  The authority commenced with no staff, no accommodation and no money.  We thank the Department of Justice and Equality for helping us at the start-up stage to identify and secure the very experienced Ms Renee Dempsey, who took on the role of interim chief executive for the authority as well as our experienced secretary, Mr. Ultan Ryan, who has stayed with us.  Ms Dempsey and Mr. Ryan did a terrific job in the early period with no staff.  They helped to secure our funding through the accounting labyrinths by the end of 2016.   The authority faced an initial challenge in that we were required under the law to present within six months of the authority's establishment day two reports to the Minister for subsequent laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We were required to engage in public consultations and to prepare reports on legal partnerships and multi-disciplinary partnerships.  Both of those requirements were met.  Our reports have been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available on our website.  Dr. Doherty came on board as permanent full time chief executive in September 2017 and he has shown remarkable and effective leadership.</p> <p>  There are six lay members of the authority who are nominated by the Citizens Information Board, the Higher Education Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Institute of Legal Costs Accountants and the Consumers' Association of Ireland, respectively.  Of the non-lay members, one is nominated by the Bar Council of Ireland, one is a solicitor nominated by the Legal Aid Board, one member is nominated by the Honorable Society of King's Inns and two are nominated by the Law Society.  The authority has a lay majority and a lay chair and each member is statutorily required to act on a part-time basis.  The authority is required by law to be independent in the performance of its functions and to act in the public interest.  We all understand that we are nominees and not representatives of the nominating organisations.</p> <p>  The authority is tasked with regulating the provision of legal services by legal practitioners and ensuring the maintenance and improvement of standards in the provision of those services in the State.  We have six overarching objectives which are set out in law, including to protect and promote the public interest; to support the proper and effective administration of justice; to protect and promote the interests of consumers relating to the provision of legal services; to promote competition in the provision of legal services in the State; to encourage an independent, strong and effective legal profession and to promote and maintain adherence to the professional principles of legal practitioners as specified in the Act.</p><p> Within that overarching mandate there are a number of specific functions, which are listed in my opening statement, and I can go through them if the members wish me to do so.</p></speech>

We are required to disseminate information in respect of the education and accreditation requirements and other matters to which I referred; to specify the nature and minimum levels of professional indemnity insurance; to establish a system of inspection of legal practitioners for the purposes prescribed in the Act; to receive and investigate complaints; to maintain the roll of practicing barristers; to promote public awareness and disseminate information to the public in respect of legal services, including the cost of such services; to keep the Minister informed of developments in respect of the provision of legal services by legal practitioners and to make recommendations to assist the Minister in co-ordinating and developing policy in that regard; to undertake, commission or assist in research projects and other activities in respect of the provision of legal services, which in the opinion of the authority may promote an improvement in standards for the provision of those services and public awareness of them, and make recommendations to the Minister arising from those objectives; and to perform any other functions conferred on it by the Act or by regulations made under it.</p> <p>  We are also required to conduct appropriate public consultation processes and to prepare and furnish reports to the Minister, including recommendations, regarding the education and training of legal practitioners - an area to which I will return - the unification of the solicitors&rsquo; and the barristers&rsquo; professions and the creation of a new profession of conveyancer. </p> <p>  By the end of March 2017, we had carried out the immediate public consultations required.  We had submitted a further report on legal partnerships at the end of July and two more statutory reports followed at the end of September, which again involved public consultation exercises.  The first was a report on the establishment, regulation, monitoring, operation of multidisciplinary practices in the State.  The second dealt with certain matters relating to barristers, including the restriction on barristers holding client money and the retention or removal of restrictions on a barrister receiving direct instructions in contentious matters. </p> <p>  We also have had to build the necessary governance and operational infrastructure of a modern State body.  We have terms of reference, a code of governance, a protected disclosures regime and we have produced annual reports for 2016 and 2017.  We are committed to a culture of openness and transparency and the minutes of each authority meeting are available online as soon as they are agreed.  We have developed and published a strategic plan for 2018-20 - which we have included in the documentation forwarded to the Chairman and members - which sets out the timeframes for some of the deadlines for meeting some of the functions envisaged by the Act.</p> <p>  We are still a fledging organisation.  We are in temporary accommodation.  We have a small number of staff but we have sufficient for our immediate needs.  We have a small project team to meet the statutory deadlines which are still outstanding and to put in place the infrastructure required.</p> <p>  Currently, we are involved in four key projects, as well as developing the personnel and organisation structures.  One project includes establishing the framework required to introduce legal partnerships as a new business model for the delivery of legal services.   We hope to have that necessary framework in place before the end of the third quarter of the year.  Our next significant task is to establish the roll of practising barristers.  This will list, for the first time, all qualified barristers who intend to provide legal services in the State, including those who work outside of the Bar library or are in-house barristers.  Work is under way on this and we hope to have the roll completed and available online at the end of the year.  We are carrying out a review of section 34 of the Act on the education and training arrangements for legal practitioners.  This has required an extensive public consultation, which has just been completed.  We will report to the Minister on that, with recommendations, by 30 September 2018.  Our other task is pertinent to the point mentioned in the letter from the committee.  We are carrying out a review under section 6 of the Act, requiring the authority to make recommendations for legislative amendment as it considers appropriate arising from its findings and conclusions.</p> <p>  We have prepared and submitted our first strategic plan.  We believe it sets out a realistic and achievable timetable for the introduction of the new regulatory regime and the delivery of the full range of functions of the authority.  Clearly, there is a quite an amount of work to be done.  By October 2019 we plan to have introduced the frameworks necessary for both the legal service delivery models of legal partnerships and, following that, limited liability partnerships.  We also plan to have delivered a series of significant statutory reports, including a review of the education and training of legal practitioners, a review of the admission of persons to the legal professions and a review of the Act.  In addition, we plan to have established the roll of practising barristers and we are working on the introduction of a levy on the legal profession.  We also, by October 2019, will have commenced the receipt and investigation of complaints and we will be in a position to conduct disciplinary hearings under Part 6 of the Act. </p> <p>  We believe the authority, acting within the framework of the Act, has the potential to act as an agent of significant change in the landscape for the provision of legal services.  Our approach will be in line with the principles set out in the Act, which I mentioned, and will be measured and consultative.  We are at an early stage in our development but we intend to continue to deliver on our statutory and governance obligations, while planning and delivering on the ambitious possibilities for future reform set out in the Act.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members and we look forward to engaging with them.</p></speech>

I have another meeting at 10 a.m. and must leave to attend it but I hope to be back.  I will ask a few questions before that time and I will certainly be back if I can make it.</p> <p>  We have to consider this discussion in the context of the fierce resistance put up by the legal profession to the introduction of this legislation and the fact that the previous Minister, Alan Shatter, basically allowed the legal profession to rewrite the original legislation against the backdrop that reducing legal costs in Ireland was the only troika demand that has not been implemented.  According to the National Competitiveness Council, legal service prices were 8.3% higher in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2012.  That is the backdrop, namely, a battle to avoid regulating the profession.  The authority has been established for a number of years but progress has been incredibly slow.  I am not blaming the witnesses or personalising the issue but I would like to tease out why that has taken so long.  The authority carried out the statutory public consultations and completed the reports that have been laid before the House but it has not yet found a permanent office.  It took a year to get a chief executive for the authority and it has only just published its strategic plan.  The process is moving incredibly slowly.  How many of the functions under the legislation are currently operational and how many are not?  Given that matters are moving very slowly, can Dr. Thornhill account for the delays?  Are organisations such as the Law Society standing in the authority's way, is there a cultural reluctance to move matters froward or is there some other way in which Dr. Thornhill can account for the slow progress?   </p> <p>  The authority's public complaints function is a major issue for the public.  Is it anticipated it will come into effect in the first half of 2019, which will be three years after the Act commenced?  Why will it have taken three years before the public can bring their complaints to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority?</p><p>Does Dr. Thornhill have any qualms about the fact that while this was an area of reform, we are two years on from the regulatory authority being established and that has not been forthcoming yet?</p></speech>

First of all, as a former chair of the National Competitiveness Council, I was involved in reports which commented, I think over a period of ten years, on the high cost of legal services in Ireland.  I am very much aware of the background.</p> <p>  On why it has taken so long, it has been a matter of frustration for us that it has taken so long.  The regulatory authority was established on 1 October 2016.  That was purely a legal act.  There was nothing there other than an almost complete membership of the regulatory authority - it was not quite complete.  We were not able to meet as a full regulatory authority until 26 October.  Then we had to find accommodation and begin the process of trying to develop an administrative and management resource because, as the Act says - deliberating and wisely -  members of the regulatory authority can only act in a part-time capacity.  I am a former civil servant - I left a number of years ago.  One of the things that struck me is how much more rigorous, demanding and time consuming the public administration requirements are today than they were 20 years ago.  Painstaking processes now have to be undergone in respect of procurement and appointments. All of those take time.</p> <p>  We moved as quickly as we could.  We had an interim chief executive - a very experienced individual - in place quickly.  We immediately began the contractual process of appointing a recruitment consultant from a process supervised by the Office of Government Procurement.  That was not there in my time as a civil servant.  The process ended in Dr. Doherty's appointment as chief executive.  Ideally, we should not have begun without staff.  We should not have had the statutory deadlines we had to meet for carrying out consultations but those are facts and requirements of the Act.  We were obliged to allocate such resources as we had in that area before we could get into the business of building up the structure of the organisation.</p> <p>  In respect of the disciplinary procedures, I take on board what Deputy Clare Daly stated.  It is taking some time.  One of the factors we want to be absolutely assured about when we open those important functions - because not only do they open up the possibility of redress for clients of legal services but they also have very serious implications for legal practitioners as well - is that we are resourced adequately in respect of personnel and facilities to handle that work and that the basis on which we are doing it is absolutely legally sound.  All of that requires very careful attention to detail and planning when it is being done quickly.</p></speech>

The opening statement talks about the unusual requirements in the beginning.  Is Dr. Thornhill saying all of this should have been done before the Act was passed?  It is almost as if we were suspicious - which we would obviously not be - that the organisation was set up with two hands tied behind its back to create an inevitable delay in the carrying out of its functions.  It is so slow for even a justice issue.</p></speech>

I was not involved and I am not terribly familiar with the detail.  I see no evidence in our engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality or the Minister of an intention to keep us in a type of limbo situation.  It is quite the contrary in fact.  I have heard it said - but never to me officially - that one of the reasons we were established in the way we were - without offices, staff and funding - was an anxiety on the part of the Minister and the Department not to be seen to be interfering in our affairs.  I do not know what credence can be attached to that.  We were launched on a very flimsy craft.  The Department did give us practical help at that particular point.</p></speech>

In those minutes, the members felt the regulatory authority's independence was potentially being undermined by the Department.  An external consultant was engaged and I refer to the rest of that as well.  It reflected a certain tension between the regulatory authority and the Department.  This ties in with my question, which Dr. Thornhill referred to in his opening statement, about the establishment of the framework to introduce legal partnerships.  Dr. Thornhill is saying that this will be in place by before the end of the third quarter of this year.  These partnerships were fiercely resisted by the Bar Council and the Honourable Society of King's Inns.  Is Dr. Thornhill saying that, by the end of September, legal professionals will be in a position to get partnerships up and running at long last?  Is that what is clearly being said?</p></speech>

To be fair to the Department and the Minister, in that particular instance, there was anxiety to get legal partnerships - and, following those, limited legal partnerships - up and running.  The unanimous view of the regulatory authority at that time - myself, the professional and lay members all agreed on this point - was that the Department's intervention was inappropriate.  That was conveyed to the Minister in strong terms in the minutes that Deputy Clare Daly would have read.  Since then - and Dr. Doherty can go into this in more detail - we have had very satisfactory co-operation with the Department.  I put that down to perhaps an excess of anxiety and zeal on the part of the Department to get things moving without a sufficient appreciation of the practical issues we had to contend with.</p></speech>

It cited one trial where a barrister's brief of &euro;30,000 was charged.  That was double the amount a Queen's Counsel would seek in England.  A brief fee, as we know, only covers trial preparation and the first day of hearing.</p> <p>  One of the jobs of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority is to protect and promote the interests of consumers in respect of the provision of legal services.  It is also charged with promoting competition in the provision of legal services in the State with a view to driving down costs.  What does the regulatory authority see itself doing to reduce costs in the short term?  Is the regulatory authority optimistic it can play role in that?  This is a major issue for people and the MPS said it had been involved in a case where the award made was dwarfed by the legal costs.  In one case of misdiagnosis, damages were settled at &euro;100,000 but the legal costs were &euro;268,885.</p><p>In another case damages of &euro;17,500 were awarded, but legal costs were &euro;46,000, which is utterly ludicrous.  Is Dr. Thornhill confident that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be able to reduce costs?  What measures will it take in the short term to do so?</p></speech>

On the specific issue of disproportionate and inappropriate costs or costs that are too high, it can be a matter of complaint to the authority.  </p> <p>  On the structural reforms provided for in the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, there are a number of pillars, the first of which is the introduction of legal partnerships, followed by limited legal partnerships.  This will change structures in the legal profession.  As I understand it, the intention behind the legislation is that it will change some of the competitive and cost dynamics in the provision of legal services.  There are other provisions such as multidisciplinary partnerships.  We have suggested this and it is implied from our advice that should be implemented downstream once there has been experience of legal and limited liability legal partnerships.</p> <p>  We have reviewed the education and training of barristers and solicitors and are aspiring to have a range of policy and practical changes to improve and create a more competitive dynamic in the provision of legal services.  Can we guarantee that there will be a dramatic change overnight?  We cannot do so, but we will certainly hope there will be significant changes in behaviour.</p></speech>

We know that the authority is supposed to be self-funding, to be funded from the operation of a levy on legal practitioners.  I asked the Minister a question about this last month.  My concern is that, in spite of the fact that the authority is supposed to be self-funding, to date it has cost &euro;3 million - &euro;1 million in each year from 2016 to 2018, with no sign in the meantime of anything being levied on the Law Society of Ireland or the Bar of Ireland.  The answer I have received is that "we are in the process of setting up the levy."  We are dealing with two organisations that are sitting on a pot load of money.  Why have they not been asked to fund the authority?  Why should the taxpayer have to pay it?  The sum of &euro;3 million is not insignificant.  I also point out that the money that has been paid upfront by the State is supposed to be recoupable by it.  When does the authority envisage the State getting its money back and the legal profession starting to cough up?</p></speech>

The other challenge is that the Act is interlinked; therefore, there are certain pieces in it that need to follow in order.  One of the key elements of the levy on the professions is the roll of practising barristers.  In order to calculate the levy, we need to have the roll of practising barristers, for which, as required under the Act, there is a six months establishment phase.  The roll went live last Friday, 29 June.  There is a period of six months allowed for from that date for the establishment phase.  The roll will be established fully in 2018 and the levy notices will issue in 2019.</p></speech>

Dr. Doherty is acknowledging that it is something that is open to interpretation.

Dr. Doherty is saying that is not his interpretation, which is fine, but what is the Department's interpretation of the section?</p></speech>

We will have a further meeting with it later today.  This is an issue that must be resolved.</p> <p>  As Dr. Thornhill raised the issue of one of the statutory reports we have to complete - the review of the operation of the Act - under section 6, it will actually include a review of the levy provisions.  The authority brought forward the review of the entire Act in order to aid its commencement in the manner in which we wished to do it.  We are engaged in a public consultation process on all aspects of the operation of the Act, but specifically mentioned in section 6 is the operation of the levy provisions.  We have engaged an economist to look at the levy to ensure it provides a funding stream.  We also are engaging on the issue of recoupability, on which I will be meeting the Department.  The executive must submit the report under section 6 to authority members by 6 September, with a view to publishing and submitting it to the Minister on 30 September.</p></speech>

People look at successful bodies.  At the beginning, there is significant work to be done, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation presents it as though it will be easy.</p> <p>  As alluded to by Deputy Clare Daly, the most important point is that the public will have confidence in this body.  The Deputy is an able legislator.  One of the impressions she conveyed is that the legal profession managed to get this legislation changed for the benefit of itself.  I welcome the fact that, as the regulator, Dr. Thornhill, is a lay person.  I also welcome the fact that the majority of the people on the board are lay people.  It is appropriate that the regulatory body should not be dominated by members of the profession it is regulating.  However, is it the case that this regulatory body has been captured by legal interests or the lawyers on its board?  What can Dr. Thornhill say to give confidence to the public that he is putting its interests first and foremost in the establishment of this body?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.547" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Don Thornhill" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018070400002#G00200"><p>That is an interesting question and one that I am conscious of as chair.  At the first meeting of the authority, I reminded members that they were there to represent the public interest, not as representatives of their nominating bodies.  I am satisfied all members of the authority are conscious of their wider public interest obligations.  When it comes to seeking legal advice, we have had, and have, some distinguished lawyers as members of our authority but we do not seek legal advice from them.  We seek independent legal advice, particularly regarding our documents.  That is one precaution against what one might regard as subtle capture by a particular interest.</p> <p>  We also have other strong interests on the authority from the consumer and legal education spheres.  It is often the case that impartiality is helped when one has contending views and opinions.  I see it as a particular responsibility on myself to ensure that independence.  The episode to which Deputy Clare Daly referred was in itself significant.  I shared a sense of severe disappointment when I saw the initial communications from the Department.  Those were shared unanimously by members of the authority.  We had no hesitation as an authority in dealing openly with this issue, rather than doing it by way of conversations.  We felt it was important that we should put the discussion of the authority into the full minutes of the authority meeting and to convey them in writing to the Minister in order the public knew what was going on.  That was one instance of where we were conscious of our independence.  As chair, I was particularly conscious of that.  It is a process of being vigilant and being aware of what the public interest is.</p></speech>

On the one hand, there are the interests of the legal profession and, on the other, the interests of the Government.  Part of the reason there was opposition to what was originally proposed by the previous Government was that it would have given the Government too much control over the regulation of legal services, particularly in circumstances where the State might be a defendant in cases.  Is Dr. Thornhill satisfied the authority is standing up to encroachment from the Government and from the legal profession?</p></speech>

Shakespeare said, "Let's kill all the lawyers".  It is not a question of lawyers being popular.  From the public's point of view, however, there are legitimate concerns about the legal profession, namely, complaints procedures, costs, and, one which may not get much traction in public, education, in order to broaden the diversity of those coming into the legal profession.</p> <p>  Is it Dr. Thornhill's objective and intention that when the complaints procedure is up and running, there will be a mechanism on a website for the public to make complaints about members of the legal profession whom they allege have been involved in misconduct or wrongdoing?  How will that operate in practice?</p></speech>

Under the Act, there is a regimen as to how complaints will be received by the authority.  We can take complaints about inadequate legal services, excessive costs and any act or omission of the legal practitioner which constitutes misconduct.  There is quite a structured system by which those complaints will be processed for admissibility.  There is a problem-solving informal resolution and mediation scheme within the Act.  There is a function for the authority to determine complaints at certain levels and for the establishment of the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.</p></speech>

We are currently working with an external adviser on the staffing requirements of the authority, determining and analysing the workload we will inherit from both the Law Society and the Bar Council.  What is required under the new structures is more formalised in law.  The informal resolution process, which has been carried out to some degree by the Law Society, is now enshrined in legislation.  Once we are satisfied we have a robust staffing plan, we will take it to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its sanction for the staffing levels and grades required.  It is certainly our intention that we will be able to take complaints from the end of quarter two.  It will be one of our objectives that they will be dealt with in a timely and robust fashion.</p></speech>

There is a bit of an awareness that if one has a complaint about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one directs it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  I am conscious, however, that it has been in place for a long time.

The Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator is outside the scope of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA, which is provided for under Part 10 of the Act, which has yet to be established.  One of its tasks will be to maintain the register of determinations, which will be a public document and will assist in public information and comparative analysis of legal costs.  We have a role to play in that also.  One of the specific functions under section 13 is to promote and disseminate information to the public in respect of legal services, including the costs.  There is a research function we will have to undertake to ensure the public are aware of the range of costs available.  As the Deputy mentioned, the promotion of competition through legal partnerships and potentially multidisciplinary partnerships will be one other strand that may have an effect in bringing down the cost of legal services.</p></speech>

That point has been made in a few quarters.  The knock-on effect of that would increase competition and it might drive down some costs.  There may be multiple different aspects of what is both enshrined in the Act and other factors and rights leaning towards decreased costs.</p></speech>

The education of people entering the legal profession is extremely important not only for the purpose of having well qualified lawyers who are important in any society but also because, as in every other country, one can only become a judge if one is a lawyer.  We have had a discussion for many years about the judiciary Bill.  One of the objectives of this committee is to try to increase and broaden diversity within the Judiciary.  Obviously, there is a responsibility on the legal profession and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to broaden that diversity by enabling more people to gain access to legal education in order that they can become lawyers and judges.  Is the issue of broadening access to legal education of concern to Dr. Thornhill?  I would have thought costs is a precluding factor for many people when they want to try to become lawyers.  I would be interested to hear his comments on that.</p></speech>

I would approach this from the position that competition is better than its absence.  Essentially, is the legal education landscape a monopoly or an oligopoly?  I am not sure how one would describe it.  I will not go much further than that.  We have completed consultation and are preparing a report, which we will publish in early September, in which the issue of access will be very much to the forefront of our minds, and I believe it is to the forefront of everybody's mind.  For example, most people in Ireland are aware of how difficult it is not so much to qualify as a barrister but to get traction and develop a living as a barrister.  That, in itself, is limiting in terms of the number of people who can pursue a career at the Bar.  Limited partnerships, legal partnerships and the other forms of partnerships will allow for the early employment of young barristers working in a legal environment.

Forgive me if my questions are a little different as I do not know enough about this matter but I am interested to learn about it.  To follow up on Deputy O'Callaghan's point on education and opportunity, he made the point that the efforts we have been making to bring more diversity and societal representation into the Judiciary have not been easy.  We are up against serious obstacles.  Regarding people studying law, it is fair to say that the vast majority of people becoming solicitors and barristers come from a well off background.  Many of them come from private schools.  It is an elitist profession.  For example, I know a girl who trained to be solicitor and when she had completed her training it was as if she had to serve her time in that she was paid very little for the first few years.  One could not do that without parental support.  Only those who come from well off families could possibly spend so long trying to get on the first rung of the ladder at which point they could get a decent wage.  The system seems to be structured to keep it elitist.  Will the authority be able to challenge that?</p></speech>

It would be our intention that the legal profession would be an open access profession.  What the Deputy said is interesting.  It is the anecdotal perception many of us have.  We all know bright people who qualified for the Bar and had to give us active practice at the Bar because they simply were not earning enough to support their families or they were relying too much on the financial support of their parents.  My anecdotal experience is that I know of clever sons and daughters of my friends who went to London.  In all cases they did postgraduate law degrees in London and ended up working in high reputation chambers very quickly.  The same would not have happened in Dublin.</p></speech>

We see the various reforms, particularly the legal partnerships and the limited liability legal partnerships, as affording that.  To take the specific instance of young barristers, we see those as a vehicle under which newly qualified barristers will be able to seek employment while practising law.  The role of barristers will also include a comprehensive list of barristers who are available to practise law, which has not been the case up to now.</p></speech>

That will be challenging for the authority to address.  While it is relying on the partnerships to address that and bring costs down a little, as far as I am aware no ceilings have been put on costs in the legal profession in Ireland.  I have dealt with plenty of those in the profession and I know my way around the Four Courts fairly well for different reasons.</p><p>The variation in what can be charged by different people is phenomenal.  There does not seem to be any kind of measure or control over what someone can charge.  Is that manageable?  Can the LSRA just go there and be effective? </p></speech>

There are no price control provisions in the Act.  It does not state that we can regulate the fees that will be charged.  The Act also provides for an office of legal costs adjudicators which is independent from us.  The role of the office will be a public one and one hopes it will, over time, establish norms that will be viewed as reference prices.  In other words, the consumer would be aware of what the going rate is for the provision of certain types of legal services.  If we take an example at the other extreme, a consumer going into a supermarket has a general idea of the price of particular commodities in the supermarket and whether it is an expensive store and he or she will make decisions accordingly.  The other factor is that we have no role in the management of the Courts Service or the management by the Judiciary of its processes.  There are a number of actors in the legal costs area.</p></speech>

As Dr. Thornhill mentioned, the LSRA has just finished a public consultation exercise on legal education and training in the State.  This was done under section 34 of the Act and the report is broad and significant for the LSRA.  We have a research team currently involved in pulling together a wide range of data.  One of the issues to be encompassed within that report is access to legal education and professional training as solicitors and barristers for those from a less wealthy background.  The LSRA will address that issue and a range of other matters in its report to the Minister, which, by statute, must be submitted by 30 September this year.</p> <p>  As Dr. Thornhill said, a number of aspects of the 2015 Act deal with legal costs.  One point I will add to what Dr. Thornhill already said is that the LSRA will be able to investigate any complaints of charging of excessive costs.  The LSRA will have a research function and will publish information on the costs of legal services.  Under the Act - I believe it is under section 150 - legal practitioners will be required to provide estimates of the cost of legal services in advance of providing those services.  There are a number of different aspects that will hopefully increase transparency around legal costs for the benefit of the consumer and may also serve to bring costs down.</p></speech>

We all know that if someone comes onto a building site and wants to do carpentry but has not served his or her time, he will not be of great benefit to the builder.  He will be only worth apprenticeship wages.  In the case of someone who qualifies in the legal profession, however, there seems to be an abuse of the recruits entering the profession in respect of wages.  This creates a major obstacle for a broad section of society gaining entry to the legal profession.  Will the LSRA have an influence or potential influence in that area if a barrister takes on a devil, which is like an apprentice?  Will the LSRA be able to have an impact on what that apprentice, so to speak, is paid?</p></speech>

We have attempted to get as broad a perspective as possible, including in the public consultation to which we had 35 responses from different organisations.  We have also sought the experience of trainee solicitors and barristers as well as the masters in that relationship.  We are seeking their input to see what possible difficulties there may be at that point of their career.  When we report under section 34 in September we are required by statute to make recommendations on any issues we identify that may be remedied.  It is our intention, as we stated in the strategic report, to do a broad and comprehensive analysis of legal education and training, including the issue of access that Deputy Wallace raised, and to make recommendations to the Minister on 30 September.</p></speech>

I refer to the division of roles between barristers and solicitors, with barristers acting as sole agents and solicitors acting in partnership or as single agents.  The reforms and changes that will follow the application of the Act will be the first time for more than a century that there will have been changes in the structures of the delivery of legal professions.  One would hope that increased competition will prevent the types of abuses referred to by Deputy Wallace.  In a more competitive market, for example, a solicitor will not have the comfort of being able to underpay staff, if such is happening, simply because good staff will go elsewhere.</p></speech>

This is a serious problem.</p> <p>  In response to a point raised by Deputy Clare Daly regarding the levy, Dr. Doherty indicated that the expenses the LSRA will incur in 2018 will form the basis for the levy in 2019.  Deputy Daly asked about the moneys spent in 2016 and 2017.  Is it not a runner for all the LSRA's expenses for 2016, 2017 and 2018 to be built into the levies for 2019?

I do not want to make a definitive statement on the issue while we are still taking legal advice on it.  We have obtained the advice of an economist on the provisions of the levy and we have been meeting with the Department throughout.  We met officials on Monday and we will meet them again later today to discuss the issue.</p></speech>

I assure them that in more than seven years as a Member of the Oireachtas, I have received more complaints about solicitors than I have about garda&iacute; and that is saying something.  If the LSRA will be in a position to deal with complaints about solicitors, my God, it will be under an avalanche.  I wonder if this will be possible?  We know for a fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, does not have the colour of the money it requires to its job properly.  We have argued that GSOC remains designed to fail because of a lack of proper legislation and funding.  Will the LSRA receive the funding necessary to deal in an effective manner with all the complaints that will come its way?</p></speech>

We are still under the control of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to public expenditure.  Nonetheless, the facts will be there.  If we have an unmanageable backlog of complaints from which our determinations of admissibility are significantly in arrears, it will make a very compelling case for us to levy accordingly and to recruit the staff to be able to deal with that.</p></speech>

This simplifies it to quite an extent because the levy provisions are quite complicated.  If the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA, were to have an increase in complaints, it would lead to an increase in costs which would lead to an increase in the levy.  If there is a significant increase in complaints about the legal profession, which the LSRA is statute bound to deal with, it would be reflected in the following year's levy.  There is no cap on the levy in the provisions as drafted.</p></speech>

The authority first has to make a decision as to whether a particular complaint is admissible.  If it determines it is admissible, it then goes into an informal dispute resolution or mediation-type process.  If it is not resolved, it goes into a more arbitration type of process.  We will have a complaints committee which will operate in a series of divisions.  This structure in itself will allow for the efficient handling of cases.  If, however, either a lawyer or complainant is dissatisfied with our original decision on admissibility, it goes to a review committee and that committee's decision must be taken on board by both sides.  The structures in the Act were not our design.  We have encountered issues as we are working through the implementation of the Act, but this seems to be a thoughtful and well-designed structure.</p></speech>

I want to start with education and training.  The strategic plan mentions that education and training will be kept under review and recommendations will be made on the availability and quality of education and training.  How do the witnesses envisage this playing out in terms of the Law Society and the Bar Council and the provision of training and education?  Do they expect there to be other providers who will be registered with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority?  What do they see as the competing interests?  Clearly, we have had an historic duopoly among the two bodies.  What do the witnesses envisage occurring in education and training in legal services?  Will it be in the context of the two existing providers?</p></speech>

Something we have also put in the strategic plan is that we will be independent in our decision-making.  This means we have to follow the evidence to where it may lead us.  We are still in process of gathering that evidence.  We see the section 34 report as significant.  We have been heartened by the fact we have had so many submissions and we have had engagement from members of the legal profession in some of the firms in Dublin and elsewhere, from junior barristers and junior solicitors.  We are still in the process of analysing this evidence.  The research team was conducting interviews on Monday and Tuesday of this week, so it is too early to say, from the point of view of the LSRA, as to what the direction of travel might be regarding the issues the Deputy has raised.  The intention and the statutory imperative is that by 30 September we will have published and submitted a comprehensive report that will deal with the issues raised by Deputies Chamber and Wallace.</p></speech>

There is a facility under the Act for us to revisit this issue in future years.  Further scope is built in with regard to several issues but also with regard to education and training.</p></speech>

The Higher Education Authority is empowered to take a direction and all aspects of education and training would not necessarily be at the Minister's discretion.  Within the LSRA's 11 key functions are many references to research, recommendations and reports to Ministers, but very little on the LSRA's own discretion on matters, which leads me to query the quality of the board's independence.  If the LSRA refers everything to someone who has a de facto veto in every aspect, will this be an issue?  Within the 11 key functions, many references to the Minister are made.  What is the thinking of the witnesses on this?  Is it a matter of concern?  Is it a matter they would like to see addressed in the future legislative context?  Are the witnesses happy with the quality of their independence in terms of the current legislative basis?  Would they like to see anything looked at in future?  They are now before an Oireachtas committee and we want to hear about it.  It has been a slow process during the first two years.  The LSRA found it difficult to get up and running.  It started with two staff.  It has not set up the complaints process yet, obviously the costs issue is still ongoing, and it has to refer to the Minister with regard to education and training.  Are there legislative roadblocks in its current workings?  What would the witnesses like to see changed to give the LSRA greater discretion to act according to its functions?</p></speech>

For example, let us consider the specific instance of legal education and imagine the current providers have provisions that prevent people from qualifying unless they have gone through the current educational institutions.  If a report were to suggest that there was room for more dynamic and varied provision arrangements, then that is something that would have to be challenged.  I will not go any further than that at the moment.</p></speech>

One aspect is around education and training but there are many others.  Dr. Thornhill referred to keeping Ministers informed in respect of the provision of legal services, including the cost.  Is much of this a recommending or research role rather than exercising the independence of the authority around the provision of legal services?</p> <p>  I am a little concerned because the strategic report has many references to the Minister.  The members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality know that agencies of the State are rather bound to the Department and Minister in their legislative context.  That makes it difficult for them to function according their remit.  Has the board examined whether the authority is constrained by the current legislative basis to do the things it wishes to do?</p></speech>

They could possibly arise at a later point as we become more operational.  I will go back to my response in the earlier discussion with Deputy Clare Daly.  Our frustration was at being pushed off from the shoreline in a rather frail canoe.  That is where most of our frustration has been to date.  The issues mentioned by Deputy Jack Chambers have not confronted us yet.  We will grow in experience.  The quality and composition of members of the current authority are impressive.  I have no reason to believe that will change over time given the nature of the nomination process.  I think the present authority and future authorities will face up to any challenges.</p></speech>

I have not heard enough in terms of education and training.  I understand the authority has an ongoing report.  I would like to see the authority being more forthright in the exercise of its independence.  I realise and appreciate the authority is at an embryonic stage.  The authority representatives want to be careful about what they say and the associated implications, but it has been a slow start in the context of a two-year window.  There are serious issues around cost, such as those gone through by Deputy Clare Daly.  There are issues around the complaints process as well as education and training.  These issues are within the statutory remit of the authority.  The public needs to see strong statements from the authority to get progress.  I hope we get more commentary from the authority.</p> <p>  What I have learned here during the past two years is that bodies related to the Department of Justice and Equality might have been reluctant initially to comment on particular matters.  We started engaging with them and, within two years, because of their frustration and because they found it difficult to exercise their independence, they have become far more forthright in the recent period.  The authority should learn from the experience of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, to which Deputy Wallace referred.  I recall two years ago everything was fine and there was little criticism from the people there.  They said there was proper engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality.  It was all politically correct around the engagement of the commission and how it was getting on.  Underneath it all, it was very difficult for GSOC.  The authority needs to learn from the experience of the commission.  I appeal to the authority not to keep referring to the Department and the Minister.  The authority will need reform in terms of the legislative basis.  There is a great deal of recommending to the Minister and I fear that nothing will change unless the authority exercises its independence, and that is something it can do.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Deputy Clare Daly may wish to come in afterwards.</p> <p>  In his presentation Dr. Thornhill spoke about protecting and promoting the interests of consumers, while the advent of the complaints function has been referenced by Dr. Doherty.  Is there a cut-off time?  Are historical cases open to being addressed by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, or might they be statute barred?  In my role as an elected public representative I have come across cases, the genesis of which would have been years ago, such is the nature of the legal profession and its outworking.  Many years later there could be some serious matters of continuing concern and dissatisfaction.  Is there a cut-off time or are they open to being addressed by Legal Services Regulatory Authority?</p> <p>  Allied to that question, will Dr. Thornhill advise us not of the individuals but the make-up of the review committee that was referenced?</p></speech>

In effect, the Act provides for three categories of complaint: the provision of services of an inadequate standard; excessive costs; and misconduct.  There is no time limit for the making of a misconduct complaint.  There is a three-year time limit for making a complaint about services of inadequate standard or excessive costs.  The time limit runs from either the date of the incident or the date on which the client became aware.  If the client was to become aware of the provision of inadequate services quite some time after the fact, a complaint would still be admissible.</p> <p>  The review committee is made up of three persons.

What does the proposition "translate the unification of" entail?  Where stands the proposition?  What has the Legal Services Regulatory Authority done to date in this area of responsibility?</p></speech>

We have not yet reported on the matter.  We have not done so purely because of time pressures.  We have not investigated the particular issue.  There are varying practices across common law countries, which are the easiest comparators.  As far as I know, Singapore is the only country to have a totally unified attorney or lawyer profession.  The classic distinction is that a solicitor is involved in an array of functions on behalf of clients - probate, conveyancing, litigation, etc. - whereas a barrister is responsible for giving opinions and advocacy.  For a number of years solicitors in Ireland have raised the issue of the advocacy role.  Solicitors now have the right of audience, as it is referred to quaintly, in the upper courts and can act as advocates.  What will be the outcome of our deliberations on the issue?  Some argue vehemently that not only are there economies in the current dual track, but it also means that people can have access to the best barristers in the country.  There is obviously a cost issue for some people under what is called the "cab rank" rule, whereby barristers line up and take briefs from solicitors.  Clearly, any reform in this area would be very fundamental for the profession.  Perhaps the draftspersons were wise in drafting those provisions, particularly the four-year rule, to give us all an opportunity to see how legal partnerships and limited liability legal partnerships worked because, in effect, they provide for the possibility of solicitors and barristers working under the same roof and dealing as a unity with a client.</p></speech>

It does not suggest an option which entails interchangeability, with an individual holding a specific responsibility, that he or she can be a solicitor today and a barrister tomorrow or both on the one day.</p></speech>

Aside altogether from some people seeing a change of this type as the end of civilisation as they know it - others see it as presenting great opportunities - there are prohibitions on barristers holding money on behalf of clients.  With a unified profession, people who today are acting in what we consider to be a barrister role might, in fact, also be holding clients' money.</p></speech>

On the other hand, solicitors hold clients' money.</p> <p>  Deputies Mick Wallace and Jim O'Callaghan asked about young barristers and Dr. Thornhill and Dr. Doherty responded accurately in that regard.  I do not want to walk into the dark side - one refers to the other as the dark side; I suppose it depends on to whom one is talking - but there is a practice of holding clients' money and withholding payment to a barrister for services given.  A number of reasons were given for young barristers not being able to stay the course; it all comes down to affordability.  However, it could take years for payment to issue.  While it is not a word I like to use, there is a significant drop-out rate among young qualified barristers in moving over to a solicitor's practice, into corporate work or perhaps away altogether, with all of their years of study and preparation lost.  It is attributable to a number of issues which include the fact that solicitors who hold clients' money do not pay barristers as readily as I believe they should.  I ask Dr. Thornhill to comment on that issue.</p></speech>

What the Chairman has said is interesting.  Undoubtedly, there are practical barriers to entry to a satisfying professional career as a barrister.  I have had personal experience of benefiting from it.</p><p>I had several colleagues who had studied at the Bar when I was a civil servant.  Their period of study at the Bar certainly helped them to become remarkably effective civil servants and make great contributions, not just to the drafting of legislation but also to the implementation of policy.  I can think of a number of cases when I was saved from rash acts by a colleague who had legal training.</p></speech>

I advise members of the committee to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system and will interfere with the broadcasting of the meeting.  Being discussed by the committee today is the issue of supporting and facilitating the arts.  I welcome the witnesses who have come to discuss this matter.  I can see that some of them have travelled a long distance.  From the Galway International Arts Festival we have John Crumlish, chief executive, and Paul Fahy.  From Tyrone Guthrie Centre we have Adrian Moynes, chair, and Robert McDonald.  From the Kilkenny Arts Festival we have Eugene Downes, director, and Olga Barry.  From Listowel Writers' Week we have M&aacute;ire Logue and Catherine Moylan.</p><p>Before I ask the witnesses to address the meeting, I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses that the opening statements and any other documents they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The presentations from the witnesses have been circulated to the members.  I remind witnesses that their presentations should not exceed five minutes in duration.  To commence our discussion, I invite the representatives of the Galway International Arts Festival to make their presentation.</p></speech>

We are very happy to be here.  Mr. Fahy, our artistic director, and I will run through this quickly between us.  The key point we would make at the start is that we are no longer just a festival.  We also produce and tour work.  We have also started First Thought Talks, which is our discussion platform.  We see these as the three legs of the stool that make up the culture organisation that is the Galway International Arts Festival.  The key statistics in respect of the festival for 2017 were that 210,000 people attended, that the festival had an economic impact of &euro;29.5 million, and that there were more than 200 performances in 33 venues over 14 days in one town.  Those are the key statistics.  We want to tell the committee a bit about what we are and we will then move on to our recommendations.  That is the first thing we are.</p></speech>

We also shifted towards becoming a producer-led festival in 2011.  Since then we have produced 14 productions of original work which were made for Galway and toured around the world.  That was between 2011 and 2017.  Since then we have toured extensively with these works, alongside our co-producers, in the UK, the USA, Europe and Australia on multiple occasions.  Those shows have received more than 34 nominations for theatre awards and have won 14 national and international awards.  In 2017 alone, in addition to the festival, we also toured for 16 weeks in Ireland and internationally.<br/><br/>Our discussion platform, which Mr. Crumlish mentioned, First Thought Talks, was established in 2012.  Since then we have hosted 94 events featuring hundreds of high-profile panellists with an ever-increasing audience.  The aim of the festival discussion platform is to present the very best in discussion on forward-thinking ideas across a broad range of topics.  First Thought Talks is also becoming an entity in its own right.  We have presented internationally in New York.  The first independent First Thought Talks platform will happen in October of this year at NUI Galway.<br/><br/>All of that garners a huge amount of media coverage for us.  This year alone we have had more than five articles in <i>The New York Times</i>.  The committee members can see some quotes in the submission<i>.  The Guardian</i>last year rated us as &quot;One of the Top 5 Summer Festivals in Europe&quot;.  <i>The Irish Times</i>called us: &quot;The biggest, most exciting, most imaginative explosion of arts activity this country has.&quot;  The BBC referred to us as &quot;One of Europe's most important cultural events&quot;.  All of this also brings communities together, including both audiences and artists.  The members can see from the breakdown of the statistics that 63% of our audiences are domestic, with a large number, 45%, coming from Galway.  The 37% of audiences made up of overseas visitors has a very great economic impact, as Mr. Crumlish has said.  The breakdown of the gender of our attendees is that 55% are female are 45% are male.<br/><br/>The 2018 festival is nearly upon us, beginning in ten days.  It is the biggest ever festival for us and the biggest music programme we have ever undertaken.  We have six festival world premieres and five Irish premieres.  We are introducing the new idea of a festival garden in Eyre Square as a central hub for the festival.  We have an expanded free programme.  Some 25% of the festival's programme is offered free of charge to audiences.  We have also presented Enda Walsh +GIAF in New York this year.  We have also increased our festival programme of First Thought Talks, which will run during the middle weekend of the festival.  Our aim is to deliver the very best experience to as wide an audience as possible and to bring audiences and artists together.</p></speech>

The festival in 2017 was our biggest ever.  Now 2018 is our biggest festival ever and 2019 will be our biggest festival ever.</p><p>We are scaling up into 2020, when Galway will hold the capital of culture designation.  This will be hugely important for the west of Ireland and the wider cultural community in Ireland.  It is a real opportunity, one we will not have again for 26 years, and this has very much influenced our thinking in the intervening time.  It is probably the most prestigious cultural designation in the world.  It rarely has been to a region this small so we have to make the most of it.  We will also have to partner with a lot of people in the west and outside of it to deliver the best possible experience to the maximum number of people and to do service to the brand west of Ireland and brand Ireland with a view to looking outwards to Europe in that regard.<br/><br/>Galway International Arts Festival creates world class arts experiences for thousands of people.  It has always been the mission of the festival to create the best possible experience for as many people as possible.  This has been our mission for 41 years.  Approximately 25% of our programmes are free of charge and we also subsidise many of the festival tickets.  We see ourselves as a major platform for Irish artists and a platform on which international promoters can view the Irish work being showcased from around Ireland.  Many promoters from the UK and the US come to the festival to see what we have on, with a view to taking it up.  A key part of the festival is our productions with Irish artists nationally and internationally over as long a period as possible.  There are things we created three years ago still touring, which is very exciting in terms of the work provided and from a brand Galway perspective.  It is also very good from a brand Irish cultural perspective.  We see ourselves as a major flagship for brand Galway.  The national and international media quotes mentioned would indicate that this is more and more the case.  The touring very much supports that view.  If one is in New York one is more likely to get <i>The</i><i>New York Times</i><b><i></i></b>than would be the case if one is in Galway.  Last year, we had three pieces of work in New York in the space of one year, which were mentioned five times in <i>The</i>New York <i>Times</i>.  As a result of this new work on &quot;Grief is a Thing with Feathers&quot;, which premiered in Galway April this year, got more column inches in <i>The New York Times</i>than it did in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It is about getting out there and building a brand for Irish culture.  <br/><br/>We made three recommendations, the first of which is around our fund ambition.  We would be of the controversial view that currently the arts are being funded for their existence and the notion of ambition is somebody else's job in the sense that the State must turn and start funding ambitious projects if we are to compete on the world stage.  It is very acceptable that throughout the recession it was difficult for the State to continue to support the arts, and it did so very well in terms of keeping that broad landscape going, but we are over that and, if we are going to be world class in terms of our culture, the State must now move to the next stage and fund ambitious projects.  We also believe that festivals should be supported to produce new work.  This is an expensive business and a risky business.  Not every production will be a success.  These are great platforms to produce new work because they have good audiences and they create a lot of access.  People come to see the work.  There is an existing network of festivals that allow us to get this work out there.  <br/><br/>We also believe it should be key that festivals showcase as much Irish work as possible.  The State funds the development of a lot of Irish work and we believe that this work once funded and invested in should get out to as many people as possible for as long as people.  We think festivals can play a vital role in providing a showcase for helping that work get out there.  </p></speech>

I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire caithfimid &aacute;r mbu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l don choiste as an deis th&aacute;bhachtach seo labhairt libh inniu agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an t-eolas a roinnfear anseo inniu ina chuidi&uacute; agaibh.  I will speak very briefly about the nature of the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, following which my colleague, Mr. Robert McDonald, will speak about its day-to-day operations.</p> <p>  The Tyrone Guthrie centre is unique in that it is a gift to the whole of Ireland, North and South, under the terms of a will.  In effect, those of us who are privileged to be on the board and be working there are trustees of a gift to the nation.  The board consists of nine members, four from Northern Ireland and five from this State.  Artists come from all over Ireland.  The centre has three streams of income, namely, the two arts councils in Ireland and revenue from the artists who stay at the centre.  Those artists come from Ireland, North and South, but also from throughout the European Union and further afield.  This week, we have some Italians and Americans in residence at centre.  The centre is an artists' retreat and a place where creative work is done.  Put simply what we do for the artists who choose to stay with is we put a roof over their heads and we put the dinner on the table in the evening.  This is a tremendous asset to anybody trying to finish a novel, write a short story, compose a work of music or finish a painting.  They do not have to think about the daily bread for the duration of their stay.  </p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Robert McDonald, at this point.</p></speech>

The centre is a retreat in the sense that artists come to it to create work.  A lot of this work is showcased at festivals.  Every week we receive books in the post and letters from people thanking us for the time they spent at Annaghmakerrig to complete or edit a book of poetry or a new novel.  We also receive numerous invitations to exhibitions throughout the country from artists who have spent time at the centre.  In terms of what we do, people say that a week in Annaghmakerrig is worth three weeks at home in terms of getting the work done and drilling down into the work in hand.  It gives them the time and space to finish the work that can then be presented at the various festivals, galleries and exhibition centres around Ireland.</p> <p>  Since we opened in 1981, the centre has supported approximately 7,000 artists.  We are open 24-7, 50 weeks of the year to support artists to get on with the work, get the book finished, get the play finished and get the exhibition ready and so on, so that in turn can be presented at venues throughout the island of Ireland.  We have a very strong link with Belfast.  As mentioned by the Chairman, Mr. Moynes, the board comprises four directors from the North and five from the South.  It was a joint cross-Border initiative when Sir Tyrone Guthrie handed the house over to the State and we have maintained that strong link to date.  We are very proud of that connection.  </p> <p>  Currently, we are booked out.  I am preparing a planning application to build two more cottages.  We have a capital programme funded by the Department, which is just about to expire.  We also receive support from the Ulster Guard and Villages Fund, which normally supports projects in the North but because Monaghan is part of Ulster it is happy enough to support us and to give us a grant of &pound;150,000, which helped with the matched funding to make improvements to our dance studio and to build a new rehearsal space that we are providing for the theatre sector, which is increasingly taking time with us to develop new work.  What do we want for the future?  It is important that artists are supported.  At the end of the day, they are the people who make the work and exhibitions.  Without them, all we will have are theatres full of empty seats and the only items hanging in our galleries will be caretakers' coats.  The Government needs to recognise that the individual practitioner, supported by the festivals gathered here today, are the ones that make the work.  Without them, we have nothing.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.   We are delighted to be here today with our colleagues from around the country.  I would like first to inform the committee of some news which I heard only a couple of hours ago, namely, that my colleague, Ms Olga Barry, who is currently the festival producer, will be my successor as festival director as of September.</p><p>We are looking forward to sharing our particular experience in Kilkenny in the course of the session.  To begin, we will consider the idea of a festival and its essence.</p><p> When the idea of a festival was first born on the slopes of the Acropolis in Athens 2,500 years ago, its artistic and civic dimensions were joined.  It was a festival of the Dionysia, in honour of the god Dionysos, premiering new theatrical works, some of the greatest tragedies and comedies ever written.  It was an occasion for thousands of Athenian citizens to gather, not just to experience and vote on these new plays but also to debate the great political, military and social issues of their time, an artistic and civic experience.  In the 2,500 years since the challenge and opportunity for festivals all over the world and in this country are how to make these special times moments of intense artistic creation and civic experience locally and as citizens of the world, from near and far, who sometimes gather in very remote places on this island.  The intensely emotional, deep, tough stuff in the great tragedies that those citizens experienced 2,500 years ago at the festival of the Dionysia was among the most extreme of human experiences.  Festivals are places where we can experience something extreme that we do not experience in normal life.  At the same time they saw the great comedies of Aristophanes which lampooned and satirised the politicians of the day.  The light, celebratory and intense, deep, tough stuff coexisted in that festival space.  That is another challenge for festivals today. </p><p> The final point to make about the DNA of festivals concerns the sheer improbability that a group of citizens, an artist or group of artists in a place, whether it be a rural area, a town or a city, can envision something that is not there and be determined to make it happen.  The first modern festival in Europe took place in the 1870s in a small town in Bavaria where a single artist, Richard Wagner, who was not even from Bayreuth decided it was the place where he would reinvent theatre and music and create the greatest opera house in the world and bring people to it from all over the world.  He made it happen in a place where there was nothing.  In 1951 in a small seaside town on the south-east coast of Ireland, Wexford, a local doctor decided that he would create one of the world's great opera festivals and, with intense communal effort, that is what it became.  In 1974 in Ireland's mediaeval city a group of classical musicians, artists and poets decided to make a festival.  From the beginning they wanted to have an international festival, a place people from all over the world and artists could share and so it became, with Seamus Heaney as the first poetry curator.  </p><p> With that in mind, we are looking forward to discussing the ecology of festivals in Ireland in 2018 and its resilience but also its frailties, the delicacies and challenges.  I will ask my colleague Ms Olga Barry to make a brief initial comment on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olga Barry" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018070400002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to participate in this meeting.  </p> <p>  Without wanting to sound too negative, one of the topics we ought to discuss is the fragility of the sector.  Even today it takes a huge amount of faith to believe the snowball will get us to the opening night and that everything will happen.  A myriad of things can go wrong on that journey.  In Kilkenny, for example, the formal infrastructure for performance is very poor or the venues are scarce.  We are constantly intervening and trying to mobilise alternative spaces, which has a great positive impact when international artists come and find themselves performing, perhaps in a 13th century cathedral, with all that brings.  With all of the specialness, there is great risk, as well as fragility.</p> <p>  The infrastructure of the professionalisation of the arts, the teams behind the machinery that get artists' best work onto stages and concert hall platforms, requires volunteers of extraordinary commitment and faith in the people leading the festivals and organisations. Without the communities&rsquo; support, they would quickly collapse.  That needs to be cherished and celebrated in a very deep and meaningful way as part of the ambition, international work and "platforming" of new work in festivals.</p></speech>

It started straight after the Acropolis and is an internationally acclaimed festival.  Our aim is to bring writers and audiences together in the unique surroundings of Listowel.  The festival was born out of its literary heritage and is 48 years in the making.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Moylan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018070400002#D00400"><p>We have over 100 events in the short four or five days of the festival.  Writing is in our DNA in Listowel.  As we cannot help it, we embrace it.  It is innate to everybody.  Being from Listowel, part of the responsibility and what we achieve is that we support, embrace, encourage and mind the authors and audiences who visit us every year.  In the 1970s and 1980s when writers such as John B. Keane rang someone like Joseph O'Connor in London and said he had an audience for him, it gave him recognition from somebody he respected and admired at the beginning of his career.  The same is happening to this day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.690" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms M&aacute;ire Logue" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018070400002#D00500"><p>Yes, it is.  Christine Dwyer Hickey came to Listowel over 20 years ago.  She just happened on the festival, wondering what went on at it.  She started writing, won the short story competition and six years ago won the biggest prize in Ireland for the Irish novel of the year, supported by us and the Kerry Group.  That shows that there is a legacy from the grassroots, that Listowel looks after its authors from their emergence to their establishment.  They love to return because they see what it means for emerging writers to come to Listowel.</p> <p>  We were the first people to introduce a creative writing workshop, which was brought to Listowel by Dr. Bryan MacMahon after he had come across it in America.  We have extended the festival to create a national children's festival and a young adult festival too.  We are looking after the grassroots and bringing writers forward with us.  Our budget every year is approximately &euro;280,000, depending on the size of the festival.  We were lucky this year to have it voted best Irish festival in the Irish hospitality awards.  We were not surprised but delighted.  The 50th festival will take place in two years' time. </p> <p>  There is a board of directors with a chairperson, as well as one full-time member of staff and two part-time members of staff and a community employment scheme person.  These are the people who produce the festival.  The most important group beneath them is the voluntary committee which is made up of between 40 and 45 people from Listowel and beyond who devote one year to the festival.  We hold bi-monthly meetings, separating into the different areas - literary, public relations and marketing.  Everything is done in-house.  There are no consultants.  We have to do it all ourselves because our budget is so tight.  Out of it comes the experience that is Listowel Writers Week.</p></speech>

Some of us may get a chance to flex it more than others, but in Listowel we have a creative press.</p><p>We have a physical environment that supports every element and muscle of creativity one might have.  Everybody from the local bingo hall to the shops and the hotel is involved in it; we are all in it together.  The physical size of the town lends itself to the festival.  It is very warm and friendly.  From a psychological perspective, to refer to what I said, there is buy-in from everybody in it.  There is a level of support, whereby, whether one is having a cup of coffee or giving a reading, one will receive encouragement from every person one meets.  There is great camaraderie within the committee which is supported by those living in the town and north Kerry.</p><p> As to experience of the festival, there are literary competitions for which which people can prepare now and which they can enter up to March next year.  We have other novel ideas such as having a cup of tea with Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n or elevenses with Emma Donoghue, which is something quirky and different which, in a way, allows people who might not see themselves as typical literary festival visitors to go along to it.  They can sit down, have a cup of tea and listen to something diverse and different.  There are also lectures.  There is an historical and literary walk around the town that takes people on a journey of the mind and to see all of the landmarks associated with our great writers such as Bryan MacMahon, John B. Keane and Sean McCarthy.  There is wealth.  As it is in our DNA, we just embrace it.</p></speech>

Our approach to programming is that we rip it apart, tear up the rule book and start afresh.  We have a new page and look forward.  We always review what did and did not work.  We have to do that.  The first thing we do is review ourselves to see what was positive and what we can do in the future.  It is a new blank sheet.  Obviously, in the office we are constantly researching what is new and up and coming, what is in the news and who are winning awards.  The festival is born out of this and our invitations are issued.  We are in contact with theatre groups that are doing new, young and innovative theatre to bring them to the festival because we have a theatrical production every lunchtime and evening.  We also have art exhibitions, poetry and music, all of which are put together as soon as a festival is over.  From July on, we are programming until the festival begins again the following year.  We will ask our writers who came this year what their experience was and whom they could recommend who might come and enjoy the festival.  We ask our audiences what they like.  All of this is very important to build our festival for the following year.</p></speech>

It is what Listowel people do best.  As I said, it is part of the culture, but we also do it with a little fun.  People like the informality, charm and friendliness of it.  Some of the responses we received from authors in the past included: "It is such a memorable week," "It is a revelation that words cannot describe," "There is a level of intimacy," and "There are readers and writers everywhere."</p></speech>

Some 15% of them are international visitors.  We are constantly trying to target new audiences, which are important, as they participate through their feedback, suggestions, market research and word of mouth.  Our audiences love the festival.  They just seem to be at home at it.  It is the type of festival where even if one is alone, one is never on one's own.  Somebody said to us one arrived as a stranger and left with a group of friends.</p></speech>

Last year I was sitting beside a visitor whose name was James and who was from County Mayo.  I asked how the festival was going for him and he said: "I left school when I was 13 years old, so my education is coming to Listowel Writers Week.  I have come here every year for the last 30 years."  At the age of 70 years, last year he published his first book of poetry.  I like to think Listowel Writers Week was part of the reason, in giving inspiration and providing somebody like him with an opportunity to experience a world of creativity, literature, imagination and fun.</p></speech>

We always continue to develop and sustain the literary festival's uniqueness.  We are passionate about ensuring we have a well run festival.  Our authors and audiences are first and foremost in our minds.  We always try to develop and expand our target markets and attract new audiences.  We seek to be fully inclusive in our programming and give our audiences variety and choice.  We are building the grassroots through our children's festival.  Ms Moylan and I were both children of Listowel Writers Week and are now overjoyed to be working for it.  It is so positive.  Working in the arts is a really positive and wonderful experience which we are trying to build through our children's festival and now the young adult bookfest which we introduced about two years ago for transition and fifth year students.  There is an educational element to it from the leaving certificate English examination papers.  Three years ago we had approximately 250 transition year students, while last year, on 15 November 2017, we attracted over 850.  They want to come and be involved in the festival.</p></speech>

We are very lucky to have a pretty town that is very well maintained and respected.  There are many heritage sites.  There is the castle in the middle of the square and an arts and heritage building at the centre of the town.  We like to create synergies between the buildings in the town, the organisations and us.  Everybody wins, including the Office of Public Works and the Department, because we are all in it together.</p></speech>

They include funding and growth.  Listowel is a small heritage town in north Kerry with a population of 3,500.  As the availability of accommodation is hugely important, we are expanding our reach to Ballybunion, Tarbert and Tralee where audiences can stay there and come to the town.  Staff is a huge issue, while obviously sponsorship is foremost in everybody's mind.  As we do not have access to corporate companies, we are very lucky to have Kerry Group which has supported us for the last 35 years.  It is key for us and works in partnership with us.  There is competition.  As there are literary and book festivals popping up all over the place, we must remain authentic.  We have to be sustained and ensure ours will continue to be the primary literary festival in Ireland.  Obviously, the accessibility of our location is hugely important.  That is a positive, but it can also be a challenge.  We take it as a positive because we are located in a beautiful heritage town.</p></speech>

Some of them are in the throes of their work, with events taking place in a few weeks; therefore, we appreciate their attendance.  </p> <p>  This is the culture and heritage committee, but I do not know why we do not call it the arts and culture committee or why we wiped the word "arts" from both the name of the committee and the Department.  It is extremely important that those on the committee know about the brilliance of the work happening throughout the country.  We sometimes live in a cocoon here and do not know what is happening.  We are also not vocal enough about it.  We are vocal about footpaths and 1,000 other things, rightly so, but we are not vocal enough about the arts and the massive part they play, from both a Dionysian and civic point of view.  We are grateful the delegates are here because we know the effort that was made to come here.  I also thank them for being such a flagship for the island because sometimes - I say this being part of the political system - politics does not come up to that standard of expression of who and what we are.</p> <p>  I have a few general questions about which the delegates might think before answering after my colleagues have contributed.  </p> <p>  Are there synergies between the delegates?  Do they co-operate with the Tyrone Guthrie Centre and find that some of the artists go on to attend the Galway and Kilkenny arts festivals?  Do they think that they, as leaders in the arts and especially in running a festival, communicate well enough with us?  Do they think they could lead a little better?</p><p>Are they being clever enough in that regard?  By "clever" I mean artistic and creative enough or are they simply letting this happen because they are very busy?  Do they believe they could find a better route to us as Oireachtas Members?</p><p> Coming to the Galway International Arts Festival, can the witnesses tell me how many people they employ permanently, non-permanently and on a voluntary basis?  Can they discuss the cost of the festival and the gift of the Government or the Arts Council or whether there is such a gift?</p><p> This might be an awful thing to say but sometimes I believe the static theatre is a little dead and that one will find more of the living theatre at festivals where the original work or touring work is shown.  We can get a lot of repetition.  Could the witnesses discuss that?</p><p> The witnesses are wonderful and I think of them as a type of new Edinburgh.  If they had a need, what would it be?  Could they name an ambitious project they might have in the back of their heads?  They spoke about projects being expensive and risky.  Have they an ambitious project in mind?</p><p> Where does Creative Ireland come into the witnesses' world because it is certainly coming into ours?  We have a huge number of books, pillars and all kinds of things on it.  Could the witnesses speak to that and whether they are involved in the capital programme?  Have they asked about that?  How do they see it?  Have they been contacted by Creative Ireland?  Have the witnesses contacted Creative Ireland and, if so, has it come back to them?  Does it see itself as part of the witnesses' world?</p><p> I ask the witnesses from Listowel Writers' Week to tell me specifically about their funding.  The witnesses might speak to the general questions as they see fit.  Will I ask the panel to answer those questions or does the Chairman want to call other members?</p></speech>

The nature of the people and the love for what they do almost surpasses any barriers that are put in their way.  As a result, we have developed in spite of ourselves and the barriers.  We have brilliant individuals, festivals and almost entire cultures because of the nature of the people and their determination.  The love of what they do drives them and surpasses all barriers.</p> <p>  Being familiar with Listowel Writers' Week I believe it is probably the most unique and enjoyable event in Kerry culture if not in terms of the entire country.  I recall being Mayor of Kerry in 2014 and awarding prizes to schoolchildren who had partaken in poetry and essay competitions.  Those children would not have the opportunity to show their creative ability without Listowel Writers' Week.  The way the committee has reached out to the education system and to young people in particular has been exemplary.  As a result, the festival is something that is to be enjoyed.  I do not believe I have ever come across a person who had gone to Listowel Writers' Week and not come away having had a thoroughly enjoyable experience.</p> <p>  I want to record my appreciation and the appreciation of the people of north Kerry for the wonderful and unique event that is Listowel Writers' Week.  Ms M&aacute;ire Logue and Ms Catherine Moylan highlighted the challenges they face.  At the top of their list is the one that challenges everyone, namely, funding.  From an Oireachtas budgetary point of view, in terms of the money we give to the arts relative to the bang we get for our buck, every euro we put in we get back in spades.  However, the level of funding must be greatly increased.  The success of all of these festivals in Galway, Tyrone and Kilkenny is because of the people who drive them, not because of the funding we make available to them.  As a Parliament, we should do much more from a funding point of view.</p> <p>  I have one question which might be appropriate for all the witnesses.  With regard to volunteerism and staffing, are there are challenges in respect of the issue of Garda vetting?  That particular process is necessary but it is an arduous one to go through.  Has it reached the levels of festivals yet or can the witnesses recruit and work with volunteers without having to go through that process?</p></speech>

I missed the Galway Arts Festival presentation but Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will have me well tuned in and, hopefully, I will get to hear more from the witnesses also.</p> <p>  It is fantastic to have the witnesses here this morning.  I would be singing off the same hymn sheet as my colleague, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  It is wonderful to have people from the arts speak to us this morning with such enthusiasm about what they do.  As a former arts student of the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, and having studied with the Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, in curatorial studies I know what it is like at the coalface in terms of trying to curate, conduct and pull together festivals, as the witnesses do.  I take my hat off to them because they do amazing work with sometimes very little appreciation for it.  However, as alluded to already, the witnesses are one of this country's best human resources, both nationally and internationally.  That is hugely important.</p> <p>  I am from County Cavan and a former member of Cavan County Council.  The first bursary I was ever given was to the Tyrone Guthrie Centre.  I remember thinking that I was going down to road to County Monaghan but wondering what I would do there.  At the time I had been commissioned to do a public art piece for the first fleadh held in Cavan.  I recall going through the gates into the Tyrone Guthrie Centre and seeing the beautiful estate and grounds.  I wrote down three words about that, namely, the atmosphere, the isolation and the conversations I had with other artists.  I was not in any way prepared for that experience, which was probably one of the most precious I ever had when I was working as an artist.  I returned a few years later as a curator to do a different type of work.  I was not producing the art work but thinking about artists, themes and briefs for exhibitions I wanted to curate.  As a fellow Cavan-Monaghan person, I am proud and delighted to see the witnesses here today.  They do amazing work in the centre.  The wonderful aspect of it is that it touches all the arts disciplines in terms of its dance studio and artists' studio.  It is wonderful to hear that it is expanding the centre with its cottages and one can to go down the road to Monaghan town for coffee and a bit of civilisation if that is needed.</p> <p>  I found the meal and the conversation in the evening very helpful.  I have spoken to many people who have spent time in the centre and they found it exhilarating to get that opportunity.  Being a curator or an artist can be a very lonely place because most of the time is spent on one's own so to have the opportunity to produce one's work during the day and have those conversations in the evening was hugely important.  The witnesses are doing fabulous work and long may it continue.</p> <p>  I have to say I have never attended the Galway Arts Festival for the simple reason that I was always correcting the leaving certificate art papers at that time.  However, I was in Galway at the weekend, saw the signs for the festival and decided to make it my business to get to some of the events.</p><p> Mr. Downes answered Senator O'Donnell's question about letting us know as Oireachtas Members know what is happening because the witnesses wrote out and we all got their very articulate and colourful brochure yesterday about what is happening with the Kilkenny Arts Festival.  I thank Mr. Downes and Ms Barry for the invitation to the launch in Dublin and Kilkenny.  I certainly intend to attend some of the events down there.  I apologise for not having made it down to Listowel Writers' Week yet but perhaps I will get the opportunity to do that this summer.</p><p> Any town, city or rural area is so lucky to have the witnesses who are creating festivals and providing visitors with an opportunity to come to an area.  My questions are similar to those of Senator O'Donnell.  Mr. Downes gave us an idea of the small number of staff.  I put the same question to Mr. Crumlish and Mr. Fahy.  Will they tell us about the Galway International Arts Festival's staffing and numbers?  What engagement have the witnesses had with Creative Ireland so far?  Creative Ireland has been in existence for two or three years.  Have they received funding from Creative Ireland for their festivals and, if so, under what guise, scheme or umbrella?</p><p> In their professional capacity as directors and curators, will the witnesses tell me about Creative Ireland and its relationship with the Arts Council?  Are we doing things right?  Could we do things better?  Is there duplication?  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinion on that.</p><p> Will the witnesses keep us informed about what they are doing?  That is very important.  I do not think we are in a bubble.  It is just that we have so much going on and it is very helpful to get the brochures like the one we received from Mr. Downes and invitations to launches.  I ask that the witnesses keep us posted because we want to know what is happening throughout the country.  I asked three very specific questions.  Will each organisation answer them because we could learn a lot from that?</p></speech>

It is more about conviction and bringing us in because one can be informed every day.  I am talking about going further than that.  It is a bigger influence like we have here today.  It should be far more definite and everyday.  We are not getting it.  We are getting it from all other angles but we are not getting the brilliance of the artistic end of this country and what it does for us as people both individually and collectively.  We should be thinking of cleverer ways to get in on that.</p></speech>

We employ six people full-time and more than 90 people part-time.  The part-time contracts would go from nine months of the year down to two months of the year.  This year, it will cost just under &euro;4 million.  A total of 27% of what it takes to put the festival on is provided by the State.  A total of 17% comes from the Arts Council, 7% comes from F&aacute;ilte Ireland and 2% comes from local government.  The remainder is made up of a mixture of box office - over 40% - and the remainder is sponsorship and small donations.</p></speech>

Being a not-for-profit body, it goes back in again.  Much like the ad says, shares might go up or down.  There are so many moving parts within it, including the weather.  We are probably the only people in the country apart from farmers who do not particularly like bright sunshine.  It is not good for selling tickets.</p></speech>

Festivals tend to communicate more and would be very supportive of each other.  In terms of our festival changing and becoming a producing-led model, to do that, we effectively started with the same funds and pot of money we had as just a presenting festival.  To be able to produce, create and support our artists who were making ambitious work, we needed to have core producers so we have a small core group of theatre companies and individual artists with whom we work on an ongoing basis and with whom we have created a lot of our work.</p> <p>  Senator O'Donnell discussed static theatre being dead and whether festivals are places to look to in terms of exciting work.  Festivals are always great places to look to in terms of exciting work.  One of our greatest collaborators is Enda Walsh, who is probably Ireland's leading playwright.  We work a lot with Landmark Productions in terms of making all these shows happen.  They all originate in Galway and tour extensively around the world.  In terms of their wizardry, they have been hugely admired by many commentators.</p> <p>  In terms of other ambitious works, when the Galway International Arts Festival was founded 41 years ago - the first festival took place in 1978 - the two key venues back then were an old farmer's shop that had been converted into a gallery space and a very small tent.  Here we are 41 years later in 2018 and our biggest venue is a big plastic tent that holds 3,500 people in a field with no electricity while the second one is an imagined space that becomes a big gallery.  While Galway has improved hugely in terms of other cultural infrastructure, we still face huge challenges in how we create leading international work in those kinds of spaces that can go on to tour the world and how we present work that coming from state-of-the-art buildings around the world.</p> <p>  We are working towards an amazing project in 2020 with the visual artist John Gerrard in building these three pavilions, one of which will be positioned across Galway's River Corrib and powered by the water and another one that will be on the bogs of Connemara.  They are two very challenging projects.  One of them will be in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's jurisdiction.  They are very ambitious.  We have an endless number of projects in the can that we are constantly developing and working on.</p> <p>  In terms of our model, we are funded year to year and plan three, four or five years ahead.  We need to do that to keep pace with the international scene but also in terms of the way artists work and the way their careers progress.  We need to be able to plan, develop and nurture over that period, so trying to plan financially for all of that is challenging when we are funded from year to year.  What else did I want to mention?</p></speech>

One of our defining characteristics has always been helping people to reimagine the world and the way they live in it.  That is one of our biggest ways of communicating in terms of the work we produce and present and the way we engage with our audience.  We bring audiences and artists together to experience the world through a different kind of lens.  The one thing we always like in Galway, and I know that we might be blessed because of the shape of the city, is the fact that someone could be blindfolded and pop down to Shop Street, High Street or Quay Street at any time during the two weeks in July never having heard of what we do, take the blindfold off and know that a big cultural expression is happening on the streets of Galway that is penetrating through to all areas of the community.  That is a key expression of how we like to connect with our people.</p></speech>

It is also with the people of Galway.  It has been our stage and, thankfully, the people of Galway have given us permission to play on that stage for an awfully long time and, we hope, for a lot longer.</p> <p>  We received a small amount of money from Creative Ireland last year that went to fund the discussion platform entitled First Thought, which we mentioned earlier.  That has been our interaction with Creative Ireland to date.  I understand that it is coming back on stream and we hope to engage with it, mainly under its international pillar.</p></speech>

In respect of our connections with Creative Ireland, perhaps we are Creative Ireland <i>avant la lettre</i>.  We have been at this for a long time.  The job of the Tyrone Guthrie Centre is quite specific.  It is to be a place where people do the core creative work.  The question of how that plays out in terms of opportunities on the national stage is one for other people.  We will always be open to the conversations and discussions with policymakers or any agency that is trying to improve the quality of arts life in Ireland.</p><p>Before Mr. McDonald talks about staff numbers, I wish to say that the people who work at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, those who maintain the grounds and make the beds, are absolutely key to the support of the creative artists.  As the chairman, time and again the artists tell me the staff members at the centre are wonderful.  These staff members are local men and women who live down the road in Annaghmakerrig, Newbliss or Cootehill and are in the centre every day making the beds and putting the food on the table.  It is absolutely quintessential to the experience.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert McDonald" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018070400002#H00200"><p>With regard to Creative Ireland, we have noted a lot more artists coming to the Tyrone Guthrie Centre with projects.  Siobhan McDonald from Monaghan is currently working on a piece about the Black Pig's Dyke, for example, and this is funded through the Monaghan-Cavan Creative Ireland project.  There is a lot more work coming to artists and then they arrive to us to work on the project.  Creative Ireland has given the centre a lift by giving the artists a lift through giving them some finance to prepare their work.  Creative Ireland is very positively received in rural areas, especially in Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan, where I work with a lot of artists.  The arts officers in particular seem to find the whole process very engaging and supportive for current practices.  We have had a number of artists knocking on the centre's door looking for a week in which they can get a project ready and we try to facilitate this as best we can.</p> <p>  Reference was made to whether or not we assist festivals.  Bryan Delaney is currently with us and he is heading to the Galway Film Fleadh to showcase his new film.  Little John Nee has just finished a new show, which will be at the Earagail Arts Festival and perhaps at the Galway festival also.  There are many people making the work, which sometimes is showcased very early and sometimes it is two or three years down the line before the work is ready to be staged at a festival or venue.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth for her complimentary comments about the estate.  For the record, the Office of Public Works looks after the grounds at Annaghmakerrig.  They have maintained the house and the grounds very effectively for the last 15 years.  We are very fortunate to have the OPW.  The house belongs to the State and the OPW maintains it.  This is why it looks so well.  I must give credit to the OPW on that front.</p> <p>  We employ ten people locally.  We are open for 50 weeks of the year and we have to cover every night and every weekend.  Dinner is served every evening at 7 p.m. and we are very lucky to have two wonderful chefs living within ten minutes of the centre as otherwise, the artists would not come back to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olga Barry" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018070400002#H00300"><p>I will address the staffing and some of the synergies, and then Mr. Downes will come in.  The Kilkenny Arts Festival currently has three full-time staff members and one part-time staff member.  We increase this by another five on a seasonal basis, which is more than one month but less than two months.  Depending on the programming in any given year we also have another 20 to 25 staff that are with us for one month or less.  Crucially, supporting all of this is - literally - an army of some 350 volunteers.  For the first time two years ago a grandchild of an original volunteer from the first festival in 1974 started in our junior volunteer programme.  This is an extraordinary commitment.  It is easy to talk in soft-focus terms about volunteerism and about them being the backbone of the festival but in Kilkenny's case, the festival would crash and burn without them.  They are incredibly knowledgeable, they are conformable talking to artists and engaging in participatory projects and they speak to the heart and soul of the festival and what it means.  When one drops people into a city the size of Kilkenny the idea of festivalisation - as referred to by Mr. Fahy - is ripe for nurturing in this State.  Because of the size of the towns and cities regionally in which we operate one can festivalise the energy of the city for this length of time.  It can be about the arts, creativity, the public space and civic engagement.</p> <p>  Synergy is not just within the festival itself.  It is important for our public representatives to see that there are synergies between production companies, Dublin-based companies and Irish artists who work internationally.  Most of the work of Cartoon Saloon, for example, is now seen abroad.  Synergy is about practitioners, venues, composers, writers, poets and arts managers.  A country the size of Ireland has to have those synergies.  I believe that most people would agree there is incredible synergy within the arts sector itself.  It is because we need one another and depend on one another.  You can pick up the phone to Paul Fahy or to Cian O'Brien and they would dig you out if you needed.  This approach is very front and centre in the arts community in Ireland and is to be celebrated.</p></speech>

Hardly a week would go by that we would not be on the phone back and forward with John Crumlish, Paul Fahy or other colleagues, constantly comparing practical challenges, audience trends and artistic opportunities.  This is absolutely critical when one is making constant judgment calls, be they about marketing strategy, an artistic issue or a practical funding issue.  The informal lines of communication within the sector are really alive and vital.</p> <p>  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell asked about communications with the political sphere.  I will take this query in the context of advocacy and lobbying.  This leads into the core public policy issue of funding needs and, for example, Creative Ireland and education.  Many arts organisations are active in different ways of broader advocacy and lobbying.  At the Kilkenny Arts Festival, for example, we have a lot of direct contact locally with our elected members and with the key officials in Kilkenny County Council and with local Deputies and Senators.  There are lots of direct contacts within the county.  In our national lobbying and advocacy and in our engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government, we generally channel that effort through our participation in the National Campaign for the Arts.  I am on the steering group for the National Campaign for the Arts and a significant amount of our time and energy is involved in crafting a position on behalf of the sector and then seeking to engage with key decision makers in the political sphere, be they elected Members, Ministers or key officials on that key conversation.</p> <p>  This leads into the issue of funding and a number of members have asked what those needs and issues.  Over the past year we have been heavily engaged on the question of a political commitment from the Government and the Taoiseach to double arts funding. </p></speech>

The budget outcome last year was not on track to achieve the ambition to double arts funding over seven years.  Over recent months the engagement has been to seek from the Government a roadmap with staging posts through which a commitment to double arts funding could be delivered in a clear and planned way that would give confidence to the sector and which would enable our planning to respond to it.  When Project Ireland 2040 was launched, the cultural infrastructure plan, we noted that it represents a doubling of capital spending over a seven-year period.  All of the arguments the Government made at that launch as to the importance of multi-annual planning to be able to unlock the value of that public investment on the capital side means that one has to set out a seven or ten-year plan and then the entire sector can respond, as well as public bodies.  Our argument has been regarding the current spending.  All of the human infrastructure and activity, and equally the multi-annual road map or perspective from the Government and Oireachtas side and from the sector, enables work to be done, the planning to be made and the value to be unlocked in the current spend and investment.</p></speech>

The very people who are doing this are the festivals and the arts organisations, including the Tyrone Guthrie Centre, Listowel Writers' Week, the Galway Film Fleadh and the Earagail Arts Festival and so on.  These are the very people who are doing this, starting with the volunteers right to the artistic expression of who and what we are.  This is why Mr. Downes's comments are extremely important.</p><p>It is no use having wonderful window dressing.  We know it is happening.  There must be a punch to what the witnesses are saying.

However, in the Global Ireland document of, I think, three weeks ago, on page 42, I believe, the Government made a written commitment specifically to double current spending on the arts over seven years.  This is the first time, as we understand it, there has been a specific commitment to double current spending.  We have had those conversations directly with the Minister for Finance.  I know he is very resistant to multi-annual current funding commitments but we would make the case that that is key to be able to plan.  Justin Trudeau, when he made the commitment to double arts spending in Canada, set out a five to seven-year staged roadmap and one can see the benefit of it.</p></speech>

I ask them to comment on that.  I see duplication in some respects.  I worry about that.  Perhaps they will disagree with me and say they are on the right track.  As people at the coalface of this, I would like to hear their opinion on it.</p></speech>

We sent in a written proposal, again relating to a talks programme and some other events for children in respect of the first, fourth and fifth pillars, and we received a &euro;15,000 grant.  This is all in the public domain.  This year, Creative Ireland has issued a specific funding scheme that went public a number of weeks ago.  We have engaged with that.  It is a public process.  There is no outcome from that it yet.</p> <p>  As for the larger question the Deputy asked about Creative Ireland and its relationship to the Arts Council and other funding bodies, I will make two points.  As a cross-governmental co-ordinating mechanism, that is a key need.  Whether one calls it Creative Ireland or something else I note, having worked in this area in and out of government over the past 25 years, one of the key things we lacked in being able to drive through effective public policy in culture was a cross-governmental mechanism that could drive it through - for example, arts in education.  The Department of arts or culture or whatever it has been called over the past 25 years never had the weight in government to be able to drive through a really effective arts in education programme with the Department of Education and Skills.  The Department of the Taoiseach, co-ordinating Creative Ireland and chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, is in a position to drive this through.  With the creative schools programme, we have seen an example of the benefit that an effective cross-governmental co-ordinating mechanism can have.  This is a key part of Creative Ireland's existence.  Tania Banotti, someone for whom I have the highest respect, has been appointed director.  It is a very exciting appointment because it comes at a pivotal moment.  There is a great opportunity for Creative Ireland to play that co-ordinating role in a way that does not duplicate the work of other public bodies.  The risk of duplication, obviously, is to be avoided.  How that pivot between now and how Tania Banotti's leadership moves forward will be key and the outcome in this regard remains to be seen.</p></speech>

Listowel Writers' Week has one full-time member of staff who works year-round.  We have two part-time members of staff and a community employment worker.  That is how our office works.  We have no consultants; we do everything in-house, including all our marketing and PR.  Regarding public funding, our annual budget is between &euro;250,000 and &euro;280,000, with &euro;280,000 being the highest target.  We received Arts Council funding this year of &euro;75,000, which comprised a very minor increase.  Obviously, we are grateful for everything we receive.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland gave us &euro;30,000, which is part of a three-year plan we have with the body.  Kerry County Council gave us &euro;10,500, and Foras na Gaeilge and the Irish Prison Service gave us &euro;4,000.  We must therefore find and secure &euro;170,000 ourselves.  We do this through sponsorship, patronage and our ticket sales.  That is our current position.  It is very straightforward.  We are the same not-for-profit.  Two years ago, we did not make a profit; we ran at a loss.  Therefore, we must build the festival up again.  Last year was an excellent year, and this year has been very good, so we are okay this year.</p> <p>  Our only involvement with Creative Ireland has been through Kerry County Council in attending information meetings and so on.  We did not receive any funding from Creative Ireland.  We have worked with the Seancha&iacute; history museum in Listowel in putting together its Fighting Words programme.  That has been our only connection with Creative Ireland.  Our main connection is with the Arts Council.  For us, as a small core team, applications and administration of this is-----</p></speech>

It is kind of soul-destroying, but we must do it because we must get the income.  That is where we are regarding Creative Ireland.</p> <p>  Regarding what Deputy Brassil said about volunteers and Garda vetting, everyone involved in our children's festival and our young adults' festival must be Garda vetted.  Not only must they be Garda vetted, but authors in Dublin, who will have been Garda vetted in Dublin, must be Garda vetted again if they come to Kerry.  This is where there is absolutely no co-ordination, and it makes programming for festivals and so on really difficult.  Administration can be really difficult and laborious and take up a lot of time.  I really appreciate the Deputy's positive statements about being in contact with the Government and with Members far more.  We are probably not in contact more often perhaps because of time constraints, the way in which we do it and whether we cover-----</p></speech>

Members know what I mean.  We do appreciate that.</p> <p>  We absolutely have synergies with other festivals.  Book festivals in Ireland are very small.  We work with Cill Rialaig to offer a residency for seven emerging writers every year for a week.  As members know, festivals are dependent.  The Ennis Book Club Festival had to be absolutely cancelled and was decimated this year because of one of the storms.  We picked up the pieces, contacted them and said we were really sorry that had happened to them and asked them to come to Listowel and have some of their events there.  We had to do that because there for the grace of God goes our festival.  On the way here I had a call from Mountains to Sea.  We work with that festival.  It is all about authors.  Kerry County Council has been in and out, and we have always been in contact with C&uacute;irt.  It is a very small family of festivals.  There was a time, perhaps, when this was not the case and we saw one another as competition.  We must do what we can.</p></speech>

The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, dealing with the baptism barrier and other initiatives, is being debated in the Seanad, so I apologise for running in and out.</p> <p>  I lived in Galway for three years.  Mr. Crumlish and Mr. Fahy are to be commended on the festival.  I see on the discussion platform the issue of gender equality.  Do all the festivals represented here have policies of gender equality to ensure we do not sleepwalk into something similar to what we have seen in the media recently on discussion platforms and so on?</p> <p>  I was also looking at the arts spend for Galway city versus Galway county per head of population.  Mr. Fahy talked about 25% of programmes being free of charge and participation in them being a vital element of festivals.  I think the spend per head in Galway city is &euro;73 versus approximately &euro;4 per head in Galway county.  Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will clarify that.  Is there a role for the festival in addressing this and people's participation across the county?</p> <p>  I support Mr. Crumlish's recommendation concerning supports for festivals to produce new work while also facilitating national pieces that perhaps have been produced by the Abbey Theatre.  I saw "Loch na hEala", the Irish production of "Swan Lake".  The only place I saw it was at Clonmel Junction Festival.</p><p>To come back to what Ms Barry said, the event took place in a gym hall. </p></speech>

I might not have time to ask the witnesses about capital expenditure versus current expenditure.  From what I hear, the organisation has asked for more capital expenditure.  Conversely, we have often heard representatives of the arts sphere beg for current expenditure rather than capital expenditure.</p> <p>  Listowel Writers' Week is Ireland's longest running literary festival.  It receives a very small amount of funding from the local county council in the context of its overall funding.  The witnesses are under no obligation to answer the following question but how does it make them feel when a local authority, like Dublin City Council, requests that a literary festival withdraws or cancels an event due to its content, be it political or otherwise?</p></speech>

At the time it was on, which was two years ago, an author was due to arrive from Israel or wherever, which created a huge issue for us.  The festival's programme is fully inclusive.  We have never been asked not to programme something for political reasons or by our board of directors.  That situation has not arisen and I hope it never will.  Our work ethos is fully inclusive and the festival programme is of the nature where this situation has never occurred.  We are extremely lucky.</p></speech>

I would like the witnesses to comment on funding.</p> <p>  Earlier somebody mentioned the duplication of Garda vetting.  The one thing, if nothing else, that we should take from the briefing made by the witnesses is that we take cognisance of the duplication of Garda vetting and resolve the matter.  I know that when one has volunteers, but one can only afford to pay a few of them, that the duplication of Garda vetting is the most frustrating aspect.  Sometimes one can correct the most simple of things that does not incur a cost but which makes life a bit better for everybody.  The committee should resolve the vetting issue.</p> <p>  I would like to discuss the Galway International Arts Festival.  As I hail from northern Galway, I wish to return to the point made by Senator Warfield about the amount of money spent in the city of Galway as opposed to the county and make the following observation.  We need to spread the good feeling generated by the arts into the county.  Unfortunately, Galway is a big county and the distance from Clifden to Ballinasloe is half the distance to Dublin yet one still has not left the county.  Therefore, we need to take into account that there are great distances involved.</p> <p>  The county is home to a number of huge festivals such as Clifden Arts Festival.  Unfortunately, the other festivals in the county suffer due to the great success enjoyed by the Galway Arts Festival.  I mean that they do not get the same profile.  Tuam had an arts festival for many years but, sadly, it died because it was effectively seen as being in competition with the Galway Arts Festival.  The Tuam festival did not compete with the Galway Arts Festival but it was unsustainable due to being 30 km away from Galway.  We must spread the success generated by the Galway Arts Festival into the region.  We will have an opportunity to include the regions in the Galway Arts Festival in 2020.  Sometimes areas in the region do not want to be included because they view the Galway Arts Festival as a city event.  It is important to get people to come forward and promote the arts in the region.  Much work is being done to promote the arts in the region but we need to prioritise such activity in order to get a better spread around the county.</p> <p>  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I am delighted to hear that the Office of Public Works takes care of the Tyrone Guthrie Centre.  That fact is something that goes amiss.  People are unaware that many State agencies ensure that facilities exist.  I compliment the people who work in the Office of Public Works on their work.  I will tell Commissioner John McMahon and Mr. Frank Shalvey that this is happening and that the initiative has been spoken about in a positive nature.</p> <p>  The Galway Arts Festival needs more space and we should take this opportunity to focus on doing something now.  We have plenty of places, so it is question of making a decision.  The local authorities and all of the stakeholders should prepare a good master plan in order to get this work done, which is well overdue.  We can achieve that if we work together.  I compliment everybody here on their work.</p> <p>  I wish the Galway hurling team good luck when they play Kilkenny next Sunday and I wish the Galway senior men's Gaelic football team good luck when they play Kerry the following Sunday.</p></speech>

Both of their names are synonymous with Listowel and they have done great work for Listowel and Kerry, of which we are very proud.</p> <p>  I heard the witnesses mention Garda vetting.  I know about the situation because I own a school bus.  If my driver takes a day off I cannot borrow a bus driver from another local contractor, for example, without him or her being Garda vetted even though he is-----</p></speech>

One may have someone who works in a nursing home in Kenmare but he or she cannot work in a nursing home in Kilgarvan without being Garda vetted again.  That proves that it is not just volunteers for arts festivals that are affected.  I have raised the issue of Garda vetting with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il Chamber because the current situation is ridiculous.  We will continue to see if we can undo the blockage.  It seems that such vetting takes up a lot of the time of the people who administer the system of Garda vetting just as much as it hurts local people and volunteers.  The issue must be resolved.</p> <p>  Festivals receive paltry sums of money and must operate on a shoestring.</p><p>For the great work that they do, they deserve a whole lot more.  The witnesses are very welcome here.

It is the last two weeks of the term.  One of the challenges of the arts in the modern world is that they are seen in a compartment.  We live in a very compartmentalised world and the arts are seen as being there for certain people.  One thing that we have to recognise is that for social and mental well-being, arts and culture have been part of human existence since the beginning of time and all societies had arts and culture.  It is very interesting when societies that might not be as developed as ours in our perception are looked at to find how central cultural issues are to people.  Therefore, the arts, which tend to be a bit of an add-on in government, are central to human existence.</p> <p>  The other thing that used to amuse me a little bit was that I would be sent abroad by the Government on various missions on St. Patrick's Day and so on, and as part of those I was always asked to do events for Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Authority, IDA.  It was interesting to see how, on all of those fronts, the arts and culture were the way we identified ourselves.  They were our unique identifier for very much more mundane economic reasons.  Similarly, when I travelled abroad as the Minister accompanying the President, I saw again how we used our arts and culture to identify ourselves as a separate people and who we are.  We should recognise the arts, and it is important for us in the Oireachtas not to see arts and culture as an add-on but as something central to human well-being, not only economic well-being but well-being in and of itself.  They also have a huge economic impact for this country.</p> <p>  This has been a long session so I will cut to the chase.  I used to be a co-op manager and I would get a lot of praise in that job, but it was money I was looking for.  I would come back to the office and we always had the bank manager roaring at us.  We were trying to jiggle the cheques around and I would say to my assistant that it was an awful pity that praise was not bankable.  The bank manager would not recognise that currency, however, and he kept looking for the actual notes.  If we can be a little bit mundane, would I be right in thinking that the witnesses' shopping list would be for more funding, multi-annual funding to be able to plan three to five years ahead, and that some of the red tape would be dealt with?  Red tape is part of the modern world, we all know that.  It is not going to disappear but some simple things could be done.  We could do a lot more by making simple programmes on computers to get rid of some of the record-keeping that goes on.  I understand that we will all be paying our PAYE and PRSI on the computer every week so there will be no more P35s, which will be a great relief for any of the witnesses who have a wage to pay and have to do all of those mundane jobs.  I know that as artists they find those tiring, but at the end of the day, the manager part of them has to do all of those things.</p> <p>  One thing about the Garda vetting I can never get my head around is that if somebody works for three arts organisations and drives two school busses, they need five Garda clearances in the one year.  One would think that with modern bureaucracy, a number would be assigned to somebody's clearance, and if there was any doubt or if something happened between the day the clearance was given on 1 January 2018 and the day that the witnesses wanted to hire the person, the witnesses would be able to give the Garda the number, they would have the same number in the computer, and down the line that person would have clearance and would remain cleared, end of story.  With tax clearance and everything else, people get it, they have it and it is given in.</p> <p>  Garda clearance is one thing that really causes delays.  There are logjams throughout the year and people get held up with something with which there is no problem in 99% of the cases and it would be fairly well known there was no problem because the person would have had clearance with the previous employer.  It is an issue we should face up to in this House and not accept the arguments that we have been given for years that there is some reason, because that reason has never been made rationally to me as to why it cannot be done and why there cannot be a simpler system.  When it is looked at logically, if Garda clearance is applied for somebody and within the same year Garda clearance is needed again for the same person, if something is known, surely it should affect the first Garda clearance anyway and it should be rescinded.</p> <p>  Over the years I have sometimes thought I had a great idea and somebody explained to me why it could not be that way, but no one has ever given me an explanation as to why we cannot deal with that one issue that holds up so many activities that depend on human input, particularly those where people work with vulnerable people and children.  We need to deal with that.  It would be interesting to find out from the witnesses, because I know they are down as working with artists and so on, what other bureaucratic nightmares they face that take an inordinate amount of time when what it is being sought for has a positive benefit.  I know this is very mundane stuff but the idea of focusing on that is to get them away from unnecessary mundane stuff and allow them get back to the real business of running the shows and festivals and all of the other things they want to run.  I would say that all of us feel that burden of reportage every year.</p> <p>  The other thing we have to do is deal with reports.  There has to be accountability but we have to decide whether we are sending in a lot of reports that nobody ever reads and just filling files and covering backs, with these files getting thicker and thicker, running to 500 or 1,000 pages and we are just filling up the word count.  I have always had the view that if something was never going to be read, such as strategic plans for the Department that we used to write, there was not much point in having them.</p> <p>  There is a funny side to that.  People used to give out about the Official Languages Act 2003 and the need to translate, even though the translation was the cheap part.  All of the personal hours involved in thinking about writing a document, going around the houses 15 times and getting everybody's sign off costs a lot of money, whereas a translation just takes one person with a machine, and if it has been done before and it is fairly similar the machine will translate 90% of it.  One thing we noticed and one of the real upsides I found was that when they had to translate them, people, especially in Departments, started cutting unnecessary verbiage out of the documents and the documents became much more user-friendly and effective because they had to look at what they had written.  I would be interested in finding out what we could do to simplify the witnesses' lives to get them away from unnecessary bureaucracy and back to what they should be doing, namely, running festivals, developing the arts and so on.</p> <p>  As Senator Warfield is back I will explain why Galway city gets a lot more than Galway county, which I think was his question.</p></speech>

The city council only has responsibility for the city and Galway city is small.  It stretches from Knocknacarra, from the wood in Barna over to Doughiska, whereas Galway County Council has to stretch from Ballinasloe to Bofin and Dunmore to Gort.  The city is now part of its functional area, whether that is good, bad or indifferent.  Even though Galway city, relative to other cities, is not particularly wealthy, specifically with regard to the city council, it is a hell of a lot richer than Galway County Council for a reason that is now being addressed at central government level.  Galway County Council is probably one of the worst-funded local authorities in the country even though it is a massive geographic area.  I would not like anybody to think that the people in Galway County Council, whether elected members or staff, are philistines, but one will find that they do not have resources and they have a huge area in which to try to keep the arts going.  There is the Inishbofin Arts Festival, the Aran Islands and so on, and there is the huge county.  It is a very historic county, with such places as Portumna Castle.  That is the challenge.  In the end, if the money is not going in, it cannot come out, and that is a challenge for local authorities.  It seems that we are still critically short of venues.  Galway is very short of good venues.  I have heard criticism of the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema in Galway.</p></speech>

I say on the record of the D&aacute;il that time will vindicate the investment but we need more venues.  It is great at the moment that, although one might not be able to sell tickets, one can at least have outdoor events if there is weather like this.  It can be very successful.  We live in a wet climate, however, and we need indoor venues.  There will never be enough venues for big festivals.  Most venues find that they do not have problems getting people to use them if they are well maintained and well run.  There are schemes such as the community services programme.  I can never understand in this country why everybody who is willing and able and on unemployment assistance is not allowed to do all the things that need to be done in venues, such as working on the door as ushers and so on.  Why pay people not to work when people much prefer, for their own human dignity, to be paid to work?  We could use many of the schemes to supplement some of the practical work, not the artistic work, that needs to be done.  A huge talent base is available.</p></speech>

I do not think so.  If one looks at the Arts Council's ten-year strategy and puts it side by side with the five pillar strategy of Creative Ireland, there is not much crossover.  With regard to Creative Ireland, we support the aspiration to put culture at the centre of Irish life.  We have to move from culture being an optional activity to being a right for everybody.  A Government has to say that.  It is key.</p> <p>  With regard to the question about Galway city and county, the Deputy has nailed it.  It is a big challenge.  We have a couple of challenges round that.  Those bigger market towns in Galway county are struggling.  People are leaving.  It does not suit any of us for that to happen in our home county.  The year 2020 is the biggest opportunity to address that.  We can get outside the city.  The atmosphere during 2020 will be very much "can do", and we will look to establish what we would call tent poles around different parts of the county that would allow us to address that.</p> <p>  With regard to volunteerism, we usually have more than 600 volunteers.  Anything that decreases the bureaucracy would be well intentioned.  Mr. Paul Fahy and I were both volunteers.  That is how we came to be involved in the festival.  On my first job, I was told to mind the gate for three hours.  Nobody came through the gate but that was my first job.</p> <p>  With regard to the bureaucracy, if some application forms just asked us directly what they want to know as opposed to more than 30 questions asking what they think they want to know, we would gladly tell them, because most of us have the statistics to do that.  If there were very direct questions, if we knew exactly what they wanted to know, we would have to find out about it and measure it, and we would be glad to do that.  With regard to bureaucracy, if they asked what they really want to know, that would be a big plus.</p></speech>

I came to the conclusion that many people who were making the forms would not know how to fill them if they were not in that section in the Department.  A challenge I put was that if one was drawing up a form, one should give it to somebody in the Department who was a professional administrator and see if he or she could fill it in.  If he or she could not, the public should not be expected to do so.  We have a major problem with forms asking unnecessary essay questions and the best essay writer rather than the best project gets the most money.  We need to look at this.  It is very mundane but it would make a huge difference to most people.</p></speech>

We could not agree with him more.  Arts and culture are our greatest calling card internationally.  It has been proven time and again any time a representation leaves our shores.  I am sure Mr. Eugene Downes will be able to echo that with his former position as director of Culture Ireland.</p> <p>  A practical thing that would help us with planning a year or two or three ahead would be multi-annual funding.  We spoke a little about that before the Deputy joined the meeting.  We are crying out for a contemporary visual arts space in Galway.  We have made many calls for that over many years.  We reimagined spaces this year, in an old newspaper printing house, warehouses and dockside sheds.  That is no place for the visual arts.  We need a proper centre for visual arts.  With regard to our commitment to County Galway, we are a Galway city-based organisation.  We do programmes in the county.  Last year, we successfully toured our national theatre, the Abbey Theatre, to both the Aran Islands and County Galway as well as Galway city.</p> <p>  On Senator Warfield's question about gender equality policy, in 2017 we had more women involved in the festival than man.  This year, we have a few more men involved than women, but over the course of three or four years, which is how we average it out, it is pretty much 50:50.</p></speech>

An organisation such as ours is wholly dedicated to the support of creative artists.  We want to draw people from as many fields of artistic performance as possible, from circus performance to symphonic music and everything in between.  We want to enable them to stay with us at the minimum possible cost.  There is a real question about the extent to which organisations such as the Tyrone Guthrie Centre should be expected to become revenue generating.  We could make much more money but the price would be much higher fees for artists, public bursaries would not go as far, and ultimately there would be further strain on public financing.  There is a vicious circle which we really need to stay out of.</p></speech>

I have a couple of thoughts on that.  Many of the venues throughout the country are not fully fit for purpose.</p><p>That is because in some cases the original designs may not have worked out as intended and needed to be revisited and changed in some way or the buildings needed some love, attention and evolution ten to 30 years after they had been built.  The learning after operating any cultural venue for several decades is huge, not just in terms of ways to unlock more potential but also because the nature of the art made there or the changing nature of audiences or the local community will require the venue to change.  Ensuring venues nationally are renewed in the way they should be, sometimes even in quite a minimal way, in terms of changing health and safety or other essential maintenance requirements, is not always done.  That local part of the Project Ireland 2040 capital infrastructure plan will be vital.  On new venues, the challenge is for particular places or art forms or types of work to have a strong case.  It depends on the spatial dimensions and the demographics.  The individual business case for a new venue must be robust and carefully tested for viability.  For many venues, it is not just about capital but also a very realistic appraisal of the continuing operational overhead needs.  There has to be a sustainable business model to do this in terms of the mix of income.</p><p> On funding and the role Members of the Oireachtas will play in the weeks ahead pre-budget, only a few years ago the challenge the sector often faced was trying to convince the different political parties and Independent Members of the benefits of the arts, be it the core public benefits, the intrinsic benefits to the individual citizen and collectively, the collateral benefits, socio-economic and otherwise, or the reputational benefits at home and abroad.  For a long time that case was not necessarily accepted or only partially accepted in different ways by different parties or those in government.  What is most unusual this year is that apparently both parties in government and others seem to share a genuine conviction that this case is accepted and bought into, not just on collateral socio-economic grounds but also in terms of the core role the arts and culture play in our society.  If that is the case, we are on the edge of our seats in the sector to see the collective view of the Government in putting forward a budget, as well as the view of the Oireachtas in debating and voting on it and how that shared commitment in principle can be converted into a budgetary outcome next year.  If there is no multi-annual commitment, even more will rest on the outcome in October for the year to come as it will be only a 12 month settlement.  In the coming months the sector at constituency level, that is, a ground campaign, as well as an air campaign, will go individually to Members to see what we can do to help the Oireachtas to come to an outcome on the budget in October.</p></speech>

In Kilkenny, not unlike what Mr. Paul Fahy has just described, last year we presented a folk opera in a cattle mart, premiered a new aerial dance piece of physical theatre in a disused brewhouse and mounted an arts exhibition of the work of the fine artist Mick O'Dea in a disused meat factory.  I am not proposing that we build all of this infrastructure, but I am trying to persuade the elected representatives that in current spending there might be some way to recognise what we must build in terms of regional infrastructure in order to mount work.  If one can find the money and the partners and thinks one can deliver an audience for a great piece of work, on top of this one must build the stage, the seating, the lighting and so forth.  We are presenting Shakespeare in a stunning open air theatre this year, the Castle Yard.  We must build the seats, the stage and the lighting.  I am not proposing that we build a new theatre, but there must be a more realistic approach to what is required in current spending to mount what we can with top quality professional production values.</p> <p>  Second - this might also respond to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question, one of the things that constantly strikes me about funding and reporting is the competing mandates of our funders.  The things on which one has to report to the Arts Council and which will now have to be reported to Creative Ireland will be very distinct from and possibly in conflict with what we have to report to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We are being pulled in perhaps too broad a spectrum of direction.  While our core is artistic integrity, we must also satisfy funders who want bed nights.  Sometimes there are inherent conflicts and competing demands within that structure also.</p> <p>  For the record, I am from Cork; therefore, I am agnostic about what happens in Galway and Kilkenny.  Once they get to Cork, I will make my opinion known.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-04a.784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms M&aacute;ire Logue" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018070400002#N00400"><p>I will be brief.  On funding, applications and so forth, much of the funding is for programming or marketing.  That is where it is targeted.  There is very little funding for administration costs.  We are trying to pay staff, but we are paying them badly.  No public funding is made available for administration costs and if something could be done about that matter, it would be great.</p> <p>  One the things we discussed this year for Listowel Writers Week in the context of Garda vetting was whether the public services card, for example, could be utilised in the future and contain information on whether someone had been vetted by the Garda.  Certainly, something needs to be done centrally to make it easier for us when it comes to Garda vetting.</p> <p>  Another issue related to funding, post-event reports and so forth is that each of these organisations, like ours, is audited every year.  We supply our accounts which are taken away, examined and audited.  We are transparent on every penny we spend.  The festival is not for profit and everything is put back into it.  We are plain people and, as Mr. John Crumlish said, the application forms should be in plain English.  Ask us the question and we will answer it.  There is no need to have page after page of questions; we will just give the answer.  We would welcome that because it would be great.  It would be preferable to art forms and having to spend days trying to decipher the form with a dictionary.</p> <p>  With regard to the OPW, as Ms Catherine Moylan said, we have fantastic beautiful spaces in Listowel such as Listowel Castle.  There is a beautiful band stand in front of it that we use every year for some of our outdoor events, similar to what Ms Olga Barry mentioned in the case of Kilkenny.  However, this year the OPW preferred us not to use it, which is a shame.  It is a public space and we hold fantastic events there that attract 100 to 150 people who sit outside in the open air enjoying the sunshine listening to some poetry and music.  We would like to work better with the OPW next year in order that it will allow us to use these facilities for events.</p></speech>

Buna&iacute;odh Gaeltacht R&aacute;th Chairn in 1935 nuair a d&rsquo;aistrigh 27 teaghlach as Conamara go Contae na M&iacute;.  Th&aacute;inig 11 teaghlach eile ina ndiaidh sin in 1937.  T&aacute; R&aacute;th Chairn suite in aice Abhainn &Aacute;tha Bu&iacute; idir Baile &Aacute;tha Bu&iacute; agus Baile &Aacute;tha Troim, agus is ar an d&aacute; bhaile seo is m&oacute; a bh&iacute;onn pobal R&aacute;th Chairn ag tarraingt le rochtain a fh&aacute;il ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute;, ar shiopa&iacute; agus, i gc&aacute;sanna &aacute;irithe, ar scoileanna.

Rinne an coiste sin an-chuid plean&aacute;il, staid&eacute;ar ind&eacute;antachta san &aacute;ireamh, agus lorg s&eacute; maoini&uacute; leis an ionad a bhun&uacute;.  Chuir an Roinn Leana&iacute; agus Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; &Oacute;ige maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il don choiste agus oscla&iacute;odh Ionad C&uacute;raim Leana&iacute; Rath Chairn in 2011.  D&rsquo;aistrigh an na&iacute;onra isteach san ionad agus cuireadh na&iacute;olann, seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; r&eacute;amhscoile agus seribh&iacute;s&iacute; iarscoile ar f&aacute;il ann.</p>  <p>  I l&aacute;thair na huaire t&aacute; deichni&uacute;r fostaithe san ionad, ceathrar acu si&uacute;d go l&aacute;naimseartha.  Don scoilbhlian 2017 go 2018, d&rsquo;fhreastal 24 ar an nao&iacute;lann, 40 ar an na&iacute;onra, 12 ar an gclub bricfeasta agus 28 ar an gcuram iarscoile.

Mar is eol don choiste, t&aacute; s&eacute; deacair ag fostaitheoir&iacute; timpeall na t&iacute;re fostaithe le caighde&aacute;n ard Gaeilge a fh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; s&eacute; n&iacute;os deacra ar&iacute;s againne daoine le hardchaighde&aacute;n Gaeilge a bhfuil na c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; FETAC leibh&eacute;al 5 suas a earc&uacute;.  Is sna hionaid c&uacute;raim a thosna&iacute;onn b&oacute;thar oideachais na ngas&uacute;r, agus mar gheall ar sin ba cheart go mbeadh caighde&aacute;n an-ard Ghaeilge ag na fostaithe.  T&aacute; s&eacute; deacair daoine as an gceantar agus daoine nach as an gceantar a mhealladh le teacht ag obair san ionad.  N&iacute;l ach 18 uair in aghaidh an lae le f&aacute;il sna seomra&iacute; ECCE.  N&iacute; poist l&aacute;naimseartha iad agus mheallann ionaid eile a bhfuil uaireanta breise acu agus at&aacute; lonnaithe in &aacute;iteanna nach bhfuil chomh iarg&uacute;lta le R&aacute;th Chairn na hiarrth&oacute;ir&iacute; ionchasach a bheadh againn.  N&iacute;l p&aacute; le f&aacute;il i rith an tsamhraidh agus n&iacute;l sc&eacute;im pinsin ann d&oacute;ibh.  Mar sin n&iacute;l an spreagadh ceart ann le hiad a mhealladh isteach n&oacute; iad a choinne&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; daonra an-bheag sa cheantar - thart ar 600 duine.  T&eacute;ann formh&oacute;r de dhalta&iacute; R&aacute;th Chairn ar aghaidh go tri&uacute; leibh&eacute;al ag ollscoileanna i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, M&aacute; Nuad agus cathair na Gaillimhe agus n&iacute;l suim acu si&uacute;d sna postanna at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il san ionad ach an oiread.  Is ag bunmh&uacute;inteoireacht agus m&uacute;inteoireacht me&aacute;nscoile a th&eacute;ann daoine &oacute;ige R&aacute;th Chairn a bhfuil suim acu i ngairm bheatha a bhaint amach sa r&eacute;imse oideachais.</p>  <p>  Cuireann Comhar na Na&iacute;onra Gaeltachta c&uacute;rsa&iacute; traen&aacute;la ar f&aacute;il do na fostaithe maidir le c&eacute;ad chabhair, l&aacute;imhsi&uacute; s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte agus araile.  T&aacute; muid an-bhu&iacute;och d&oacute; as sin.  N&iacute;l c&uacute;rsa oili&uacute;na curtha ar f&aacute;il d&oacute; &aacute;fach a chabhr&oacute;dh le fostaithe leibh&eacute;al n&iacute;os airde FETAC a bhaint amach chun chur le caighde&aacute;n an ionaid.  N&iacute; bheadh s&eacute; d&rsquo;acmhainn ag coiste an ionaid iad a chur ar f&aacute;il ach an oiread.  M&aacute; t&aacute; suim ag fostaithe dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh agus a gcuid scileanna a fhorbairt, n&iacute;l maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh agus caithfidh siad &iacute;oc as iad f&eacute;in, rud at&aacute; deacair do dhaoine ar ph&aacute; &iacute;seal agus uaireanta p&aacute;irtaimseartha.  Ba bhre&aacute; leis an gcoiste a bheith in ann caighde&aacute;n a ard&uacute; go lean&uacute;nach agus, d&aacute; bharr sin, tuilleadh tuismitheoir&iacute; a mhealladh lena bp&aacute;ist&iacute; a chur chuig an ionad.</p>  <p>  Toisc gur p&oacute;ca beag Gaeltachta &iacute; R&aacute;th Chairn, t&aacute; tionchar an Bh&eacute;arla ann.  T&aacute; teaghlaigh sa cheantar go bhfuil Gaeilge ag tuismitheoir amh&aacute;in agus teanga eile ag an duine eile.  Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; daoine &oacute;n gceantar ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il clainne in &Aacute;tha Bu&iacute; agus Baile &Aacute;tha Troim a chuireann a ngas&uacute;ir chuig an ionad.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin go bhfuil caighde&aacute;n &eacute;ags&uacute;il Gaeilge ag na leana&iacute; agus is dushl&aacute;n &eacute; seo d'fhostaithe an ionaid caighde&aacute;n ard Gaeilge a chruth&uacute; agus a choinne&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; muid bu&iacute;och do Chomhar na Na&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeltachta as an taca&iacute;ocht a thugann s&eacute; d&uacute;inn i dtaobh aistri&uacute;chain agus araile.  T&aacute; obair bhreise, &aacute;fach, ag an ionad seachas ionad c&uacute;raim leana&iacute; B&eacute;arla mar gur tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla a fheidhm&iacute;onn na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; poibl&iacute; i gContae na M&iacute;, ar n&oacute;s seirbh&iacute;si sl&aacute;inte, Pobal agus Tusla, agus tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a fheidhm&iacute;onn an t-ionad.</p> <p>Crutha&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo breis oibre c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; agus comhfhreagras a aistri&uacute; go Gaeilge.  Nuair a thugann siad cuairt ar an ionad, is tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla a bh&iacute;onn na comhr&aacute;ite agus mar sin b&iacute;onn B&eacute;arla le cloiste&aacute;il ag na gas&uacute;ir, rud at&aacute; in aghaidh &aacute;r eitic.  Mar a d&uacute;irt muid cheana, t&aacute; daonra an-bheag i R&aacute;th Chairn.  Toisc gur pobal an-l&aacute;idir &iacute;, t&aacute; an-chuid eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; deonacha ar n&oacute;s eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; pobail, sp&oacute;irt, cult&uacute;ir, caitheamh aimsire agus araile ag feidhmi&uacute; sa cheantar.  T&aacute; na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; seo ar fad ag brath ar an tobar beag c&eacute;anna sin le hairgead a aimsi&uacute;.  Is d&uacute;shl&aacute;n bun&uacute;sach &eacute; don choiste airgead a chur le ch&eacute;ile chun an t-ionad a chothabh&aacute;il, trealamh a cheanach agus &aacute;bhar nu&aacute;lach a chuirfeadh le samhla&iacute;ocht agus le hoideachas na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; a athnuachan go rialta.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don choiste ar&iacute;s as ucht &eacute;isteacht linn trathn&oacute;na agus beimid an-s&aacute;sta ceisteanna a fhreagairt agus na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in a phl&eacute;.</p></speech>
