No apologies have been received.  If attending in the committee room or from the precincts of Leinster House, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. John Crean, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we will engage with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to examine, in the context of its 2021 financial statements, mental health-related expenditure in community health organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8.  We will meet the HSE at the same time next Thursday to examine its 2021 financial statements in detail, including expenditure on ambulance services.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the HSE: Mr. Paul Reid, chief executive officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. Damien McCallion, chief operations officer; Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer; and Mr. Maurice Farnan, assistant national director, community operations.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the HSE: Ms Anne Kennedy, acting chief officer and head of finance, CHO 8; Ms Dervila Eyres, head of mental health services, CHO 8; and Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer, CHO 4.  We are also joined in the committee room by the following officials from the Department of Health: Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, assistant secretary; and Mr. Kevin Colman, principal officer.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, three of today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  These witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022092900002#A00700"><p>The Health Service Executive's financial statements for 2021 reflect the continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the HSE's finances.  Total expenditure in 2021 was &euro;22.7 billion, an increase of approximately &euro;1.7 billion or 8% when compared with 2020 and an increase of almost 27% when compared with 2019.  Total operating expenditure in 2021 exceeded income by &euro;195 million and this deficit was carried forward to be met from the funding provided from the health Vote in 2022.</p> <p>  The revenue income and expenditure account analyses expenditure between pay and pensions - &euro;7 billion - and non-pay - &euro;14 billion.  The biggest components of non-pay are the primary care and medical card schemes, accounting for &euro;3.9 billion, and grants to section 38 and section 39 agencies of &euro;5.7 billion.  The section 38 bodies provide health and personal social services on behalf of the HSE, while the section 39 agencies provide services similar or ancillary to those provided by the HSE.</p> <p>  The bulk of the HSE's funding comes from the health Vote, amounting to a total of &euro;21.6 billion in 2021, and including just under &euro;1 billion in funding for capital projects.  Other, though much smaller, sources of income for the HSE were receipts of &euro;343 million in respect of patient charges for hospital treatment or for long-term residential care and retained employee pension contributions deducted from staff salaries, which amounted to approximately &euro;356 million in 2021.</p><p>The HSE has disclosed its estimates of the expenditure incurred in 2021 on items directly related to dealing with the pandemic in Note 1 (b) to the financial statements.  This includes an estimated &euro;719 million on testing and tracing and &euro;530 million on the vaccination programme.  </p><p> In my report on the audit for 2021 I draw attention to a number of matters disclosed by the HSE.  I will briefly outline the matters here but further detail is in the audit report and in the financial statements. </p><p> In 2020 and 2021, the HSE spent an estimated &euro;1.1 billion on the procurement, transport and storage of personal protective equipment, PPE, supplies.  Impairment charges of &euro;374 million were recognised in the 2020 financial statements, reflecting a loss of value due to falling market prices and expected obsolescence of goods purchased. </p><p> In 2021, the HSE incurred further impairment charges of &euro;109 million on PPE.  This comprised &euro;25.6 million in respect of hand sanitising gel that the HSE anticipates will pass its expiry date before it can be used, &euro;12.7 million on other PPE items that are unlikely to be used, and &euro;70.6 million in respect of the further write-down of stock values to replacement cost at year end 2021.  The 2020 impairment charge included a &euro;64 million provision for obsolescence in respect of protective suits that were unlikely to be used.  Due to the fact that the HSE had not decided how to dispose of the suits, it incurred additional costs of &euro;1.25 million to store them during 2021. </p><p> Once again, my audit report for 2021 draws attention to non-compliant procurement which remains a significant issue for the HSE.  A self-assessment exercise carried out by the HSE on individual invoices above &euro;20,000 estimated that non-compliant procurement in 2021 was around 9%, or 16% if Covid-related procurement was excluded.  However, I concluded that this estimated rate of non-compliance with procurement rules may not accurately represent the scale of the underlying problem because in 2021, 44% of the HSE&rsquo;s total procurement involved invoices under the &euro;20,000 threshold and were therefore outside the scope of the self-assessment exercise, and 13% of the expenditure within the scope of the exercise could not be assessed for various reasons. </p><p> Finally, my audit report also draws attention to the disclosures made about the HSE&rsquo;s actions in the aftermath of the cyberattack in May 2021.  Members may wish to be aware that, as part of my annual report tomorrow, I will be publishing a report on the costs incurred as a result of that incident. </p></speech>

The Chairman has already introduced my colleagues, so in the interests of time, I will not repeat the introductions.  A briefing paper was submitted to the committee in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting.  Accordingly, I will confine my remarks to a number of specific matters, the first of which is the annual financial statement for 2021 and the financial outturn.</p> <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s 2021 audited and published annual financial statements reported a revenue income and expenditure deficit of &euro;195 million, as advised to the committee in May 2022.  This deficit is due to the pressures arising from the ongoing Covid-19 response, resulting in an excess of Covid costs over available Covid funding.  This includes expenditure in relation to the vaccination programme as well as test and trace costs which were key to the HSE pandemic response.  In arriving at the net deficit of &euro;195 million, the Covid deficit was substantially offset by a surplus arising on core non-Covid activities which was due to the regrettable suppression of core activity and associated delays in progressing new developments, largely driven by the pandemic and our need to respond effectively to it.  Over the two years of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 the HSE will have recorded a combined revenue surplus of &euro;5 million, or a combined surplus of &euro;65 million over the three years 2019 to 2021. </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the HSE&rsquo;s 2021 annual financial statement has indicated that these financial statements are properly presented in line with the appropriate accounting standards.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has referenced a number of matters which I will focus on briefly today including losses related to procurement of PPE, non-compliant procurement and the cyberattack.  The statement of internal control which forms part of the financial statements and which is a requirement of the code of practice of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform details the management action that is under way within the HSE to respond to these matters.  As the committee has received briefings on these items previously, I am happy to respond to any questions during the course of today&rsquo;s meeting.</p> <p>  The draft revenue income and expenditure financial position at the end of July 2022 shows a year-to-date deficit of &euro;731.4 million or 6.26%.  Over 80% of this deficit or &euro;608.2 million is driven by the direct impact of Covid-19, with the remaining &euro;123.2 million driven by core non-Covid-related costs.  However, when account is take of Covid&ndash;19 related costs, acute income, bad debts and price per nursing unit, PNU, cost of care issues which are embedded in core services, this variance reduces to approximately &euro;50 million in the year to date.  This expected reduction in the core deficit excludes costs such as State Claims Agency and the impact of the restoration of pre-Haddington Road working hours.  The HSE has developed a financial management plan for the second half of 2022 to co-ordinate a set of required actions to achieve a break-even position on core activities by the end of 2022, notwithstanding the issues I have just referenced..</p> <p>  It is estimated that the total cost of Covid-19 expenditure in 2022 will be in the order of &euro;2 billion which will result in a very significant Covid-19 deficit when compared to the allocated budget in the national service plan for 2022.  There has been extensive engagement between the HSE and its funders in relation to the likely Covid-19 deficit and discussions are continuing with regard to supplementary funding.</p> <p>  In 2021 total mental health funding amounted to &euro;1,099 million, representing an increased budget of &euro;68 million or 6.5% on the previous year.  Expenditure on mental health services in Community Healthcare Organisation, CHO, 4 was approximately &euro;143 million, representing 12.5% of the overall mental health allocation in 2021.  Total 2021 expenditure on mental health services in CHO 8 was &euro;115 million, which is 10.5% of overall mental health funding last year.  A detailed briefing has been provided to the committee regarding mental health expenditure in CHO 4 and CHO 8, and I am happy to respond to any questions arising in the course of today&rsquo;s meeting.</p> <p>  The overall allocation of funding to mental health in 2022 is &euro;1,159 million which is a further increase of &euro;60 million or 5.4% over 2021.  Since 2012 mental health funding has increased by &euro;452 million or 64% overall, with &euro;325 million of this relating to priority service enhancements.  These targeted investments have been directed by national mental health policy as outlined in a Vision for Change, 2007, Connecting for Life, 2015, Sharing the Vision, 2020, and are also in line with the broader Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.  The continued development of mental health services is aimed at modernising mental health services by building our workforce and investing in fit-for-purpose infrastructure; promoting positive mental health for everyone; providing accessible, comprehensive and community-based services where needed; and taking a person-centered approach supporting the recovery journey of each individual based on clinical advice and best practice as well as lived experience.  The three-year implementation plan for Sharing the Vision launched earlier this year provides a clear road map for the continued enhancement of mental health services in Ireland.  Implementation will be driven by a strong outcomes focus and a shared commitment to report on progress in an open and transparent manner.</p> <p>  That concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

It has been a very challenging time over the last two and a half years in dealing with Covid.  Today my focus is on mental health services and in particular, on services in my own area which is the Cork-Kerry region.  I have been looking at data on population changes in that area over the last six years.</p><p>The population is now 736,500, which means that it has gone up by 45,000.  In relation to workforce planning for mental health services, is that now being looked at to address the need for getting additional staff?  I understand from people working in the mental health area that there has been a huge increase in demand for services, which may or may not be related to Covid-19.  What plans are being put in place now to try to deal with this new increase and with the pressures that are on staff?  What plans are there to look at having a comparable number of employees, compared to the increase in population of the area?  </p></speech>

We have a focused recruitment plan which is both geographically based and service based.  In total this year, we will have recruited approximately 5,000 extra staff.  Since January 2020, we are up approximately 15,000 staff in the HSE.</p></speech>

I say this because they are no longer deemed suitable for the number of people in them.  We have had to reduce the number of people in many of those facilities.</p></speech>

I will let my colleague, Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, comment on the area that the Deputy referenced.  However, we have had a real challenge with getting some of the specialists we require for mental health, as well as with retaining staff overall.  It is a challenging service area.  We have a significant budget and we have had some success throughout the year.  I will let my colleague comment specifically on the CHO area that the Deputy has referenced.</p></speech>

The Mental Health Commission report of 2021 stated that Bantry was rated in the top three in CHO 4, at 87%.  I understand the Mental Health Commission has now deemed that the number of inpatients or residents there must be reduced.  Why has that change occurred in such a short time?</p></speech>

Bantry is one of those centres.  The Deputy will know that in recent weeks, an appeal has been made by the HSE on a particular issue regarding the occupancy of bedrooms in Bantry.  That matter will be before the District Court over the coming period.  We will continue, of course, in the interim to work very closely with the regulator on any and all of those concerns.  To broaden my response a little and in relation to the Deputy's first question, as the CEO said it has certainly been a challenge to attract and retain workforce and we are aware of the increase in demand and in population.  I can assure the Deputy that we are working very closely on the ground to ensure that we are taking account of that.  In particular, we are working on the Sharing the Vision policy and the three-year implementation plan, which is all part of providing a service that will be in the community and will support people to stay at home as much as possible.</p></speech>

It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Management of risk is an integral part of good governance.  The HSE has developed an Integrated Risk Management policy which has been guided by the principles of risk management outlined in ISO 31000 (ISO 31000 is an internationally recognised standard informed by experts in risk management). </blockquote> <p>On risk management, we have had a problem in CHO 4 in relation to a CAMHS area where we did not have a suitably qualified person in charge and now we are in ending up with a serious difficulty.  I have raised the issue about increased population and increased demand but are we satisfied that we now have adequate risk management in place for all of our mental health services in the CHO 4 area?</p></speech>

In general, in our risk management focus, we have placed a huge focus on this over the past three years with the appointment of our board and dedicated audit and risk committee, which was quite right.  Separate to that, we have appointed a chief risk officer.  We have reassessed the old risk management process within the HSE, have put further resources into it and have developed a new corporate risk register.  That is informed by top-down risks from our strategy.  Also, it is informed by bottom-up risks from CHOs, acute hospitals, mental health services and disabilities.  It is quite a comprehensive approach and is much better strengthened than it has ever been.  I might ask Mr. Fitzgerald to comment on the identification of local risks but I want to reassure the committee that we have a much-strengthened, enterprise risk management approach.</p></speech>

I do not have details to hand right now on that.  There is a process.  There are supports for claims.  We have put a national audit in place for the learnings from south Kerry CAMHS to look at prescribing methods and to look at compliance with the 2019 standards that are in place across the country.  That audit will be completed before the year-end.  We will have further learnings from that.  That is a piece of work that we are doing and there is a process for people to go through.</p></speech>

So, too, is how to prevent claims by making sure that we have adequate management in place.  Are we now satisfied, in view of the increased demand - and in fairness there is only so much every staff member can do - that there is an adequate number of people in place and, where there is a deficiency, that there is an adequate level of controls and cross-checks in place to make sure that we do not have a repeat of what happened in CHO 4?</p></speech>

We have real challenges in recruiting in the area.  I am confident that we have put in all the potential recruitment processes that we can, including doing so overseas to recruit specialists into the area.  We are also looking at the pipeline of what is coming through from colleges to see how that can be strengthened.  While there are real risks in terms of resourcing in mental health, I am satisfied, based on the case to which the Deputy referred of the junior doctor in south Kerry, that we have put in the processes to identify further risks across the country or any further controls that we have to put in place in CAMHS.  Equally, I want to assure the committee and the public all across the country today that people are getting good service in CAMHS and our mental health services and where we have identified issues, we are addressing them.</p></speech>

I understand that we have had to reduce numbers in some other facilities, for instance, in Millfield House.  We have moved people into Garnish House on Western Road.  That is not the ideal setting.  It is not a planned setting but it was put in place because we needed to reduce numbers in Millfield House.  Where are we now in relation to dealing with residents who were in Millfield House and likewise in other facilities where we have had to reduce numbers?  Where are we in respect of long-term planning, dealing with the increased demand and, at the same time, trying to deal with the people who already are availing of the facilities?</p></speech>

Briefly, on all our services, we have a capital plan and there are certain significant challenges in terms of infrastructure and mental health services that we want to invest in.  The CHO areas themselves will be bringing back a dedicated capital plan for the CHO area and to address some of the capacity issues.</p><p>We have a challenge throughout the country with regard to infrastructure and capital investment, but we have prioritised and put capital funding into mental health.  My colleague, Mr. Fitzgerald, will speak about Millfield.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Fitzgerald" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022092900002#D00200"><p>The Deputy will be aware that, initially, Millfield was a 14-bed high-support hospital on the north side of the city.  As we entered into planning for Covid at the start of the pandemic, from a risk-management perspective, Millfield was identified as residence where a high level of occupancy and certain environmental issues did not assist us to provide good infrastructure for infection prevention and control.  At that stage, an opportunity arose to take a bed and breakfast that had single rooms, which is Garnish House, and to utilise it for the purposes of providing accommodation.  At that very early stage of Covid, a wise and judicious decision was made to move people to Garnish House, where more space was available to them, and to a number of other centres where there were multi-occupancy rooms in some residential settings throughout the city also availed of it.  We are still in that setting, but just for another number of months.  In the meantime, we are doing some minor refurbishment in Millfield.  It will not be able to accommodate 14 people by the time we have finished with it but it will certainly accommodate eight to ten.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that, as the CEO said, we have some difficulties regarding accommodation.  It is very well known that we have specific concerns with regard to accommodation around the city.  We have purchased Glenwood House in Carrigaline, which is going through a planning permission process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  When that comes through, I am confident that it will provide us with additional space of very good quality.</p></speech>

I think we put in more than &euro;48 million into doing considerable work on public nursing homes.  Do we now need to prioritise funding of the infrastructure of mental health services, especially in CHO 4, to make sure we have an adequate number of places and that they are up to the required standard that we need?  How long will it take us to put in place a development plan to deal with that?  Our backs are to the wall with regard to the challenges facing staff and residents.</p></speech>

That goes for our acute hospitals, mental health facilities, disability services and many of our community services.  We have an available capital envelope that we utilise and prioritise on a multi-annual basis.  Mental health services have certainly had prioritisation on it, but we have to make calls with a limited capital envelope on a multi-annual basis.  The CHOs will prioritise based on the infrastructure that they have but the infrastructure in the health service is very dated.</p></speech>

If we do not have the facilities, we have difficulty in holding staff.  We could have a repeat of what happened in CHO 4 with regard to not having staff and running into a considerable claims problem.  Do we not need to prioritise capital expenditure in all of our facilities in order to prevent similar incidents occurring in the future?</p></speech>

As I understand it, in June 2021, residents received a communication from HSE management indicating that the centre was to be closed on the basis of a Mental Health Commission recommendation or standard.  Am I correct in saying that was the rationale for the decision?</p></speech>

Our feasibility report identified a range of very significant issues with the infrastructure, the investment required for it and its safety.  Such issues were also identified with the human aspect of it, especially with regard to the space that people had within the units and the fact that representatives from a day service literally had to walk through people's residences.  The whole infrastructure was completely unsuitable, and the investment profile for it would not have addressed that.  Our assessment of all of that, based on the Mental Health Commission recommendations, was to seek alternative accommodation and processes for the well-being of the service users and the investment required.</p></speech>

Does it strike the HSE as strange that some of those alternative accommodations - I refer to the ten residents who have already been moved - included placements in shared rooms and on long-stay wards?  I am told that alternative accommodations included St. Stephen's hospital in Glanmire and St. Finbarr's hospital in Cork.  The Mental Health Commission has raised the same concerns about both of those hospitals that were raised about the centre from which these residents were moved in the first place.</p></speech>

There were originally 21 residents.  That number is down to nine.  If I am not mistaken, it was 11 and it should be down to nine now.  We have worked very closely with the residents and their families on suitable and agreed accommodation.  In all instances, that is what has happened.  We are working with the remaining residents and, frankly, it is only right that we should be doing this and people should be moving to have a better life.  People in those residences and their families should have it.  I will let Mr. Fitzgerald comment about where people may have gone.</p></speech>

However, that is not the evidence that has been provided to this committee.</p></speech>

We have been working very closely with the families and the people involved, in the first instance, on the basis of their will and preference as well as their clinical needs.  One has to take all of those issues into account when considering what the best placement for people is.  Some of the people have moved to nursing-home care because that was the care required.  Others have been moved to mental health facilities.  The Deputy is right in that, as we have said earlier, some of those mental health facilities are certainly in need of refurbishment or replacement, but that is the care that the people may need.  I am not aware of any specific incidents of people saying they were dissatisfied or unhappy and I would certainly be very concerned if they were.</p> <p>  We have an aftercare plan very specifically to ensure that wherever people go, even if it is to a nursing home, they are still provided with a specialist service appropriate to their needs and that there is follow through to make sure that they settle well in their new environment.  Of course, it is not ideal that we would move people into any place other than a brand new facility.  We do not have such a new facility at this point in time.  At the same time, it would not be appropriate to leave people in circumstances in which a building is not fit for purpose in the context of being able to be refurbished in any kind of realistic manner.</p></speech>

Essentially, the rationale for taking very vulnerable people out of a residential setting was a deficiency that had been identified by the Mental Health Commission but they have now been moved to other locations which, in some instances, have had the exact same adjudications from the commission and, in all likelihood, they will have to be moved again.  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

I have spoken to elected representatives in the area who do not have a vested interest in the matter other than wanting what is in the best interests of their constituents.  I am asking these questions because this issue consistently comes back before the committee.  The question that has not been answered is why this centre was closed in June 2021.  Considering all the other centres that require upgrade or potential closure and all the other priorities and strategic plans that Mr. Fitzgerald and others have outlined, why was Owenacurra selected and prioritised?</p></speech>

We have submitted a number of papers outlining the clear rationale as to why the centre was not fit for purpose and not giving people the care they needed.  That clearly articulated why we did it.  I stand over it as CEO of the HSE.  This was the right thing to do by the CHO and the area.  The decision to do it was the right one.  I appreciate that members and their colleagues, as elected representatives, get representations on the matter but I assure members that our staff and local management want to give people the right care too.  That is what they come to work to do every day.  They, we and I believe the right decision was made in respect of Owenacurra.</p></speech>

I will not go through the list provided to me of other centres in that CHO region that, by any objective analysis, are more in need of updating than Owenacurra is.  There is no reference to any planned works in that regard.  Taking at face value that works were required or that Owenacurra, as it stood, was not to the standard to which we aspire, why it was prioritised above all else is a question that has not been answered to date.</p></speech>

To carry out the work to comply with the mental health recommendations was not the right approach in terms of putting the investment in there.  The best investment for people's care and the best use of capital investment was to relocate people to more suitable accommodation.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming in.  I am not sure if this will be his final appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, but I thank him for the information he provided and all the engagement we have had in the past couple of years, particularly during the pandemic.  At the time, he gave significant time to this committee and other Oireachtas committees, and that was appreciated.</p> <p>  I will turn to the issue of CHO 4 as it is specifically on the agenda and Mr. Fitzgerald is here to answer questions.  How many children have been involved in the review in CHO 4, particularly in respect of south Kerry, but also in north Kerry and the rest of the CHO area?  On the most recent occasion Mr. Reid was before the committee, I asked what actions had been taken to engage with the affected families, and the children in particular, some of whom are now adolescents, to review their medical needs and mental health needs.  Has that work been completed?</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that there has been engagement with the families.  I personally went down to meet with the families to get their sense of it.  The families' representative groups were quite satisfied with, and almost complimentary of, the engagement process that we have with them for their children in terms of the process to work through the issues that have been identified.  I will let Mr. Fitzgerald comment on the exact numbers but I reassure the Deputy that the engagement with the families is-----</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that I have been personally in communication with those families on an ongoing and regular basis, as has my team.  Very quickly after the report was launched, we set up a liaison team of five people who made contact directly with the families on an individual basis and worked with them around accessing services and identifying issues that were of concern to the families.  Through that engagement process, which was very much on an individual basis, and through the family support groups that were formed by the families, along with other supporting services in south Kerry such as the family resource centres and the counselling services that were provided, we have been endeavouring to ensure as much as possible that we are supporting the families in every way that we can.</p></speech>

There is some very good reading in it.  We had an extremely successful vaccination programme with the co-operation and support of the general public.  It is stated that 70% of the population received two doses.  Does Dr. Reid have an update on the second booster?  What is the uptake of this?  How is the roll-out going?</p></speech>

It continues to be slow and we have concerns about it.  From next Monday we will launch a campaign on the flu and getting the booster with the new vaccine that is available.  We are strengthening our communications on it.  We have seen a slower uptake.</p></speech>

It gets lower as we go down through age groups.  There is an eligibility factor as people have been prioritised.  Given the concerns that we do not know where Covid will take us during the winter we encourage people to get the flu and Covid vaccine.  This will form a very strong part of our winter campaign primarily to protect people and with regard to the impact on the healthcare system based on our experience over the past two years.  While it has been slightly slower we are also working with GPs and pharmacies.  We have also maintained some of the vaccination centres infrastructure to give people the maximum opportunity through the winter.</p></speech>

We do not know what the winter will hold.  Is there a possibility of engaging outreach services for larger employers where employees will be based?  I know it was not possible during the pandemic for obvious reasons but is this being considered?  Will the advertising campaign be used to try to encourage people to go to vaccination centres and other healthcare centres?</p></speech>

There is the broader communication to the public and a very targeted set of communications for particular groups, such as the medically vulnerable through their doctors.  We also found that older people have responded much better to talking through their anxieties with their GPs and pharmacists and discussing whether they need the booster.  We are trying to encourage it based on public health advice.  Separately, one of the reasons the vaccine programme was successful was because our communications group worked closely with all sorts of interest groups, including employers in sectors that were deemed to be at risk, for example, in the meat and food industry.  We are looking to continue this through the winter where groups are identified as priorities.  For older people and medically vulnerable people, who are two of the key groups, the evidence is that people respond best through their GPs, pharmacies and trusted healthcare professionals.</p></speech>

One is the integrated financial management system.  This has a funding stream and it is progressing.  We have briefed the committee on it previously.  It is similar with some of our HR and people management systems.  With regard to the wider infrastructure we are looking at greater controls and integration.  This is a significant multiannual plan.</p></speech>

We had seven additional nursing staff but, as I understand it from the local services, five of them have elected to move abroad to seek opportunities.

Of that total of 15,200 staff from January 2020, some 2,700 were recruited in 2022 to date.  We are targeting between 4,500 and 5,000 staff this year.  Of that figure I referred to, and to give a simple, high-level breakdown, nursing and midwives account for 4,500 of the staff recruited to date.  They represent the highest proportion of our recruitment in recent years.  These are net increases in staffing, by the way.  There were 2,000 healthcare assistants recruited and 2,300 health and social care professionals.  Therefore, it is not just nurses and doctors we recruit.  We recruit across the board.</p></speech>

Why do we have the HSE sending the same letters?  I have only been elected for two and a half years, and this paragraph has not changed in all that time.  A recruitment crisis is mentioned.  The letter also refers to the case that, as with all other areas, CHO 5 has been experiencing significant recruitment challenges due to shortages of health and social care professionals.  The text has just not changed.  It is like a copy and paste exercise for two and a half years.  I have yet to see anybody.  Turning back to Mr. Farnan, I have dealt with healthcare professionals who have left, and they told me that they were not asked why they were leaving.  They were not asked why they were leaving in any way, shape or form, and that was across all the divides.  I have been told an exit interview has never been carried out with HSE professionals, in the context of those who have come to tell me what is wrong with the system.  They have said that no one in the administration in the HSE has asked.</p></speech>

We need a full-time dietician to deal with very ill, anorexic patients in CAMHS services in Wexford.  It took me a year and a half to get the Minister to appoint a full-time equivalent because the HSE was not able to recruit a half-time equivalent.  That happened in July 2022.  I now have the same letter telling me that the organisation's internal systems have been exhausted.  We are now back to it being said it is not possible for the HSE to find anyone.  What is the issue?  Other sectors are able to recruit on the basis of critical skills permits.  Is this not the position in the HSE?</p></speech>

First, when we talk about a recruitment crisis, there are challenges in recruiting.  Having said that, to just stand still every year means we must recruit 10,000 people.  That is just because of churn.  On top of that, we have recruited a net extra total of 15,500 people.  I do not know about the specific post in Wexford, but we will get the details regarding when that post will be filled for the Deputy.  To state the obvious, yes, there are challenges.  The Deputy might not like that, but we do not like it either.  There are, however, challenges.</p></speech>

I wish Mr. Reid the best of luck in his future endeavours and I thank him for his service in recent years.</p> <p>  Continuing on concerning Deputy Verona Murphy's topic of recruitment, I read this morning about the HSE offering relocation packages to the value of &euro;4,000 for health staff working abroad to encourage them to move back home.  Is the HSE planning any further incentives to try to entice people with required skills to come back into disability services, mental health, nursing, etc?</p><p>Can the CEO give a quick overview of the measures being taken by the HSE?</p></speech>

We recruit internationally as much as we can for nursing and other medical grades.  The Deputy mentioned a figure of &euro;4,000.  The figure can range between &euro;4,000 up to &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 depending on the relocation package.  We gave some of details yesterday at the Joint Committee on Health and I am happy to give a breakdown of the figures for expenses.  This year, we have recruited about 1,200 international nurses.  All graduates are offered placements through the colleges.  We are recruiting internationally from India, Pakistan and other countries and we offer good terms.</p></speech>

Obviously we have to recruit the posts so we can use the funding we have for the posts to help us get the posts in.  So within whatever the parameters the HR directive sets the funding is available to recruit these posts and to pay for the incentives to get them in.</p></speech>

Does the HSE employ agency staff, external recruitment or internal recruitment in its trying to fill posts?  What targets has the HSE set to look at whole-time equivalents or agency staff?  What staffing gap currently exists across all CHOs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.232" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022092900002#H00700"><p>The gap in numbers will, by the end of the year, be somewhere in the of 400 to 500 depending on success in terms of mental health services.</p> <p>  Mr. Reid has mentioned nursing and medical staff.  In addition to trying to increase the number of placements which takes time, that has been done over recent years.  We discussed this at the joint committee yesterday and we can share that information with the Committee of Public Accounts, across areas like psychology, medicine and nursing both within mental health services and in the wider context.</p> <p>  The other area where we have a lot of challenges is in the multidisciplinary teams, which were referred to.  That is occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapists, and so on.  Similar to nursing, we are trying to introduce an international campaign around that.  So that includes attendance at job fairs in other countries and working with agencies to attract people into Ireland in addition to trying to increase the number of people coming through the third level system for those qualifications but we recognise that will always take time to increase.  We are trying to address that now.  Those multidisciplinary resources are really important for mental health, disability and, indeed, our primary care teams, which we are trying to grow.  That is probably one of our most challenging areas at the moment.</p></speech>

In some cases educational psychologists, EPs, have been excluded from trainee funding.  In the context of where we have a skills shortage, can this be addressed in the future?</p></speech>

Typically, as we try to move services into the community we often recruit our own staff from some of the more challenging residential services but end up having to backfill those with agency staff and overtime.  In 2021, the cost of agency staff was &euro;73 million of which the biggest single chunk was medical and that equates to about 800 staff equivalents.  Approximately &euro;33 million was spent on overtime, which equates to about 400 staff equivalents.</p></speech>

Again, our preference is to recruit permanent staff and to keep the level of agency and overtime costs as low as possible.  We have to staff units and keep staffing levels up to particular standards so where we have to we will take in agency staff and pay overtime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022092900002#H01800"><p>Can I have an example of where the HSE deploys agency staff to work with permanent HSE staff?</p></speech>

In mental health, the greatest proportion, I would expect, are in those hard to recruit to and fill posts, which are often in the acute units or in the more residential care facilities as we rightly attract more and more staff into the community.  I am not saying they are easy jobs but that is where our bigger levels of investment are going because that is the policy and is what is right for people.  It means we find it increasingly hard to recruit and retain people to work in other units so, as a last resort, we will use agency staff.</p></speech>

We have invested &euro;9.1 million in the 13 Jigsaw sites and Jigsaw offered 23,750 appointments for young people in 2020.  Additionally, we have been investing in a range of digital mental health services which research tells us are more attractive to younger people.  Included in that are online cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, services that are being delivered in conjunction with an Irish company and 80% of these referrals come from GPs.  That service has been evaluated successfully.  We are in the procurement process to role that out.</p> <p>  I will mention two other services.  MyMind provides online counselling.  The Text 50808 service is a crisis intervention service for younger people.  Again, research is clear that that modality is attractive to a younger cohort of service users in crisis.</p></speech>

I think all of us, as elected members, agree they are two points of pressure we see at our clinics.  Sometimes, navigating the system is half of the issue among people who come to me.</p><p>The delay in accessing mental health and disability services and the resultant anxieties often compound the challenge a person might be facing.  Sometimes there are no clear communications to the effect that the person is being handled in a coherent way.  The correspondence is often a letter with a date or a letter stating that there will not be a date.  There is no feeling that there is a comprehensive, holistic approach to care.  That is something we have to think about because, as well as not providing the service, we are compounding the challenge because of poor communication.  I will come back to that in the second.</p><p> With regard to CAMHS, we have had many questions about CHO 4.  From what I understand, the waiting list for CAMHS right across the country is significant.  I have heard anecdotal evidence to the effect that it is significantly higher than last year.  Do the witnesses have any indication as to what the waiting lists will be given the referrals from last year?</p></speech>

I can confirm that we have six waiting list initiatives as part of the access-to-care programme across our CHOs to work on CAMHS waiting lists.  The CAMHS waiting lists are obviously connected to recruitment challenges, but I will come back to the Deputy with full information on this.</p></speech>

The target is to see 90% of these within three days to deal with them.  That has been achieved, but the Deputy is right that there are challenges.  There are challenges with the general waiting list in light of the gaps in staffing.  We can come back to the Deputy with the exact numbers.</p></speech>

On the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on communications, he is correct.  We have had to put a lot of work in across disability and mental health services in terms of communications.  There were some standard letters going out that just were not meaningful and that sometimes could be disrespectful.  That is certainly one of the findings we have brought through.</p></speech>

In 2020, we had 2,755, and in 2021 we had 3,556.  However, in terms of people with appointments who are seen, in 2019 the figure was 204,192.  In 2020, the figure was 224,171, and in 2021 the figure was 249,567.  While we are seeing more people, equally there is a significant increase in demand for the service.  I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

We have to match that.</p> <p>  On Mr. Reid&rsquo;s point about communications, I want to move on to the disability side because it is one of the areas I find so frustrating.  Let me outline my experience.  Young mothers and fathers regularly tell me they have had a chat with their child&rsquo;s school or preschool provider &ndash; it is often at school that this matter is highlighted &ndash; and were told there could be a red flag in that their child might be on the autism spectrum or have additional needs.  Regularly when these children get an assessment, nobody sits down with the family and explains to them what autism is.  Nobody explains to them what the additional needs might be.  They get a huge report with a lot of technical vocabulary.  People of all educational backgrounds genuinely do not know what it means for their child for the rest of their life.  They are put into a genuine state of panic because it is as if they have been presented with a problem although nobody has presented them with the solutions.  An initial intervention or meeting linked substantially to the assessment needs to be considered, if only from a service-delivery perspective, to explain what the process ahead is.  People often come to me and say they want an intervention because they do not know what the roadmap is.  That is not to say we have all the interventions available.  I would be interested in hearing the delegates&rsquo; comments on the roadmap relating to the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, PDS, programme and where this is going.  Many parents are very concerned that we are shifting service delivery on to them.  I know the HSE would actually say we are actually giving them the tools to make interventions, but we have to be very careful that we do not have a patronising tone that gives the parents the impression they are being taught how to parent their children.  Many parents have said they have experienced this.</p> <p>  It has been reported, in the context of the rapid assessment of needs that many experienced earlier this year, that the hours have eaten up the allocation for this year, meaning there is no allocation to make an intervention this year for a child in this category.  This seems like a preposterous suggestion.</p> <p>  On the school inclusion model, whose aim is to have more treatments and therapies available in and to schools, is there ongoing co-operation between the Department of Education and the HSE?  This has to be the way forward given the pressures on the community teams in the HSE.  There is a commitment to retain the therapists in special schools, which are different from the mainstream schools, but there are many children in mainstream schools that I believe would benefit from the same type of school inclusion model.  I appreciate that there is a lot in that.</p></speech>

The strategy is to continue with the PDS model, bringing the number of resource teams to 91.  We spoke earlier about some of the gaps.  Particularly in some, the gaps are significant.  The Deputy will be aware that the assessment-of-need process was subject to a court finding, so the process we had in place has to be changed.  I kicked off recently an engagement process with families, service users and NGOs, which provide some of the services with us, on a redefined assessment-of-need process.  It is a challenge, with the volume we have, and it is a challenge to give the right timing.  The revised assessment-of-need process will be finalised soon and rolled out through the PDS teams.</p> <p>  My colleague Mr. McCallion is doing some work on the schools model.  There were inequities in the schools model in that some schools had expertise and others did not.  We are trying to address that in a fair way through the PDS model, and we are engaging with both the Minister for Health and the Minister of State responsible for disabilities on this.</p></speech>

It is an important one in trying to take a wider, holistic approach.  There is a danger that the system will be seen as trying to offload or, as the Deputy said, patronise.  We will take that sentiment back because I presume it is something that the Deputy is picking up as a concern.  That is clearly not the intention.  It is not what we want to do.  Given the variety of people involved in delivering the services &ndash; voluntary providers, section 38 bodies and section 39 bodies &ndash; it is really important that that message does not get out through the system.</p> <p>  On the schools side, there was agreement.  We had a number of meetings with officials from the Department of Education to look at reinstating some of the therapists in the schools.  I refer to some of the new schools.  We agreed to a model based on thirds.  The aim was to try to restore one third very quickly, recruit a third very quickly from existing panels to fill them and get the final third from a process kicked off internationally to try to expand the pool of therapists available, not just for disability services but also mental health services, which comprise one of our biggest challenges, and the wider primary care side.  Again, I must flag that only some of the special schools had the service previously.  It was historical, as the Deputy alluded to, so it is not necessarily equitable.  The point of the community teams is that they are based on a population-in-need model so they can in some way start to balance.  We are well short at the moment in terms of the numbers we need, and hence we have to look at all possible ways in which to expedite getting more therapists into the community teams.  Broadly speaking, notwithstanding the discussions on the schools, people are behind, as a principle, in trying to provide services, but we are-----</p></speech>

We have done a lot of work in getting new ASD classes in mainstream schools.  The Taoiseach has indicated that we are going to go further and put an obligation on all education providers to include people with disabilities.  Many of those teachers are realising the problems parents have.  We can open these classes but if we do not have treatments and therapies, we are not doing right by those children.  Whatever about parents advocating against something, and they are very strong advocates, we will have the teachers and principals coming after us soon as well because we are just pushing the problem down the road.  We will open the classes but we will not have the treatments or therapies.</p></speech>

As this is the final time he will be with us - I am sure he really regrets that - I thank Mr. Reid for his public service over the last number of years.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions on different areas.  Garnish House on Western Road in Cork has been used by the HSE as a facility for mental health services for a while.  This is costing &euro;43,000 per month and it could have cost more.  It is a significant amount of money.  Why is it being used?  Is it of a standard to be used?  Why is it costing so much?  Most of all, if the HSE had the option to purchase it a year or two ago, why did it not do so? </p></speech>

Garnish House is former bed and breakfast accommodation on Western Road in Cork.  At the beginning of the pandemic, we did an assessment of the requirements and needs of all our service users, particularly people in residential settings who might be vulnerable to Covid-19.  We were not quite sure what that would mean, like everything else at that particular point in time back then in March and April.  The opportunity came up for Garnish House to be used as an alternative to Millfield House.  Millfield House had particular constraints for the residents of that particular centre because of the level of multi-occupancy of bedrooms and a lack of environmental circulatory space.  The view was taken that the risk was sufficient that we would move out of Millfield House on a temporary basis until we saw what happened with regard to Covid-19.  That was the initial reasoning for moving into Garnish House.</p> <p>  As bed and breakfast accommodation of its day, Garnish House is a large building.  The reason we did not go about purchasing it, even though that was considered, was that there were a number of issues.  First, the number of floors means there is a lot of access issues within the building.  It is on  a flood plain and Western Road experienced quite significant flooding back in 2009.  It was felt that due to the cost of refurbishments and for all of those particular reasons, we would not proceed towards the purchasing of the centre.</p> <p>  The cost is high in the context of the ongoing costs associated with Millfield House but we intend to be gone from the facility early next year, certainly no later than the end of quarter 1.  We are considering at the moment what we will do with regards to Millfield House and other facilities in the area so that we can find alternative accommodation.  We will not be going back to Millfield with the same numbers of people but we will certainly go back there in the short term.</p></speech>

I have a couple of other questions specifically on capital appraisal and the process by which it is done.  In previous correspondence to the committee, No. R1364, document 33, dated May 2022, the process by which capital appraisal is done was outlined to us in great detail.  This level of detail was very helpful because I have asked a number of questions on this in the past.  These related to specific projects throughout the country and in my constituency where there was no political intervention, which to me is a good thing.  As regards the actual appraisal process, my questions are for Mr. Reid.  There is no need for him to go through it all as members have it in front of them.  Obviously there is conversation with the Department.  At the end of the day, I take it that the appraisal process is as outlined.  It goes through the various processes, which appear strenuous and I welcome that, and is then approved by the HSE board and presented to the Minster.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We have a funding envelope that we work to and build up on a multiannual basis.  There is an approval process within the HSE and ultimate approval from our board.  Obviously there is dialogue with the Department in terms of some priorities.</p><p>Those are priorities as regards policy rather than picking one project over another.</p></speech>

I have asked numerous questions about this.  It is very important for us as a committee, as well as the wider body politic, to understand what that means.  I have a few questions about nursing homes, funding and recruitment.  Regarding the recruitment of staff for home care packages, I always adopt the escalator approach.  The longer we can keep people in their homes, the better for them.  It is financially the best option by far.  Then they may have to go to a nursing home and then if they are in an acute bed it is more expensive.  It is an escalator approach.  The longer we keep people at home the better.  We have a national crisis in home care, home care packages and staff.  I know about this personally outside of my own politics and work.  I believe it is necessary that we have some form of registered employment agreement to set hours and set pay for people who work in this sector.  The idea that people working for agencies are getting a fraction of the total pay is ridiculous.  People are having to go off privately, if they can, to get care.  Do the witnesses agree that we need some form of employment agreement process to standardise wages and make it enticing for people who want to do that work?</p> <p>  I do not expect the witnesses to have these figures but I ask them to provide them to the committee.  Over the last five years, are there any areas in the country where nursing homes, either private ones or ones owned by various religious institutions, have been bought or taken over by the HSE?  They could have been bought and taken over or just taken over.  I do not expect the witnesses to have those figures now.  I know there are examples but we need to find out where they are because some nursing homes are falling over and I believe more are going to fall over.</p> <p>  My last question is on a Tipperary issue.  We have a specific case in Roscrea where the nursing home there will not meet HIQA requirements and is about to be closed.  The witnesses are well aware of this because I have raised it with the HSE numerous times.  I am referring to the Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Home.  We are in a process across politics of trying to get a solution to this.  Meetings took place a couple of months ago.  Where are we at as regards how we can ensure long-stay beds remain there?  Is there an overarching view of how we are going to have nursing home care in one of the biggest towns in Tipperary in the future, considering that the sole public nursing home there is about to be closed because of the HIQA situation?</p></speech>

That is also an issue with our own staff but we feel we have a stronger base within the HSE of directly employed staff.  It is a concern.  I know from the Minister and the Department that it is an area to be looked at from a policy perspective because it is a major tenet of the shift of care to keeping people at home.  That is not just from a cost perspective but because of people's standard of living and quality of life at a time when they need it.  It is a constraining factor.  We always try to be careful that we are not cannibalising the sector by recruiting in but inevitably we do and people come to work with us.  It is a sector that needs to be looked at.  The pay issues are a concern and retaining staff is a concern.</p> <p>  We will get the Deputy a note on the nursing homes.  It is a very small number.  In some cases the regulator would ask us to go in and take a home over and we would do so.  However, it is a smaller number.  Our concern in the sector now, although it is a smaller number again, is that nursing homes are deciding not to continue to practise or be a nursing home for older persons.  That is a concern for us.  While bed capacity has increased over the last few years, we would have a concern about that in some parts of the country.</p> <p>  Regarding the Dean Maxwell home, the Deputy has escalated this directly to me on many occasions.  We are working locally both in terms of long-stay and day care services that can be integrated in appropriate accommodation.  There is a dialogue going on.  There is a private nursing home close by.  We are looking to see how we can integrate the services it provides and those we will provide and how to make best use of all resources, as I would encourage the CHO to do.  The CHO manager Maria Bridgeman is working on a strategy down there locally and politically.  We have a bit more to do on it but we are anxious to come to a resolution.</p></speech>

I sit on a number of committees, one of which is the Joint Committee on Autism.  Last week we had the privilege of having a number of parents of autistic children before us to outline the different things that were going on in their children's lives and the difficulties they were facing.  Specifically, a number of parents highlighted difficulties with the CAMHS service for their autistic children.  The timing is excellent.  This happened last week in the committee room next door.  Karen O'Mahony is the CEO of the Rainbow Centre in Cork, which is a truly excellent centre for autistic children.  It does a lot of private fundraising and genuinely helps parents through a load of a different issues.  Ms O'Mahony has a son who is 16 and 6 ft 2 in.  When he was five or six years old, he was put on psychiatric medication.  For the first four or five years of that treatment, Ms O'Mahony told the committee, he was seen every three months and the doctor monitored his height, weight, his general well-being and his reaction to the medication, as is appropriate for psychiatric medication for a child.  Then when he was 11, the doctor changed.  He was seen once and then the doctor said he was signed off.  I asked Ms O'Mahony what "signed off" means.  She said she did not know.  He has not seen a doctor or had any supervision since.  He is 16 and he is 6 ft 2 in.  He has had significant physical development, emotional development and personal development, as all adolescents do.  He is an autistic child who has been prescribed mind-altering medication by the State and he has not been seen for five years.  I understand from the briefing notes provided that there are close to 9,000 whole-time equivalents in CHO 4, some 1,578 of whom work within the mental health service.  Whose job is it, of those 1,578, to check this child?  Whose job is it to check that the check has been done?</p></speech>

I am not sure what "signed off" means.  I presume it meant the child was discharged, although it may not mean that.  If a child was discharged he or she would not be with CAMHS.  I can follow it up for the Deputy.  That is my understanding of what would be meant.</p></speech>

Any child on medication, whether it is psychiatric medication, medication for epilepsy, or any other medication, is monitored and weighed for their reactions, height and weight.  Is this not obvious?  Is this not a thing that happens?</p></speech>

I am not raising it as an individual representation to be followed up, although I would like it followed up.  I am raising it because it highlights that it is possible, within CHO 4, for a child going through adolescence not to have been seen for that length of time.  We also have the State Claims Agency in here from time to time.  I have concerns not just about the well-being of the child and the pure frustration for the mother trying to provide care for the child but about the obvious failure of management by somebody in that child not having been seen and what the systemic response to that is.</p><p>I am also concerned about what the Comptroller and Auditor General's concerns may be in respect of liability to the State for that, notwithstanding all of the personal issues.</p></speech>

In respect of the issues that arose in south Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, which we touched on earlier, we are looking at all processes in respect of CAMHS all across the country.  We are looking at whether they are compliant with regard to prescription and oversight and the revised standards put in place in 2019.  That is an audit we have put in place.  I have no doubt it will address some of the issues the Deputy has raised right across country and determine how to do this, what the proper escalation measures should be and how people can have the experience the Deputy has just relayed, which should not happen.  I am not trying to reference that case but we will follow it up with the Deputy.</p></speech>

Her son had the first part of an ADHD assessment in May.  She has rung every single week since then but has not had a response.  Ms Caroline Poole has two children in CAMHS, one of whom is diagnosed with anorexia and social anxiety.  Both children have been put on medication but neither of their cases has been followed up on.  The parents are trying to contact the service.  Ms Poole outlined to the committee that she has had to guess when to give her son the next medication.  She just has a prescription and has guessed about the timing.  I relay this to Mr. Reid in this way because this is what we heard directly from parents in the Oireachtas last week.  This is their actual experience as relayed to these committees last week.  I cannot think of any other way of doing it.  We represent these people and interrogate the systems on their behalf.  I cannot think of any more direct or descriptive way to show how difficult it is for Irish citizens trying to protect their children and do the right thing to have those children diagnosed by a system but receive absolutely no follow-up.  It would not happen in a hospital.  How can it possibly happen with psychiatric medication?</p></speech>

There is no doubt but that many children are getting really good care in the CAMHS system.  The Deputy has highlighted areas in which there are weaknesses.  I believe we will surface these.  The whole purpose of the national audit of the CAMHS system is to identify those issues that result in people in the CAMHS system not getting the treatment they should.  With the then Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, I co-chaired the young mental health task force which addressed many of these issues with regard to both people progressing through CAMHS and people progressing to adult services and the handover process associated with that, which is not appropriate.  I believe we will surface many of the issues the Deputy has raised.  They should not exist.</p></speech>

There would normally be engagement between the GP and the CAMHS consultants.  Those consultants are and should be available to provide advice to the GP.  If that has not happened in this case, we will follow up in that regard.  Similarly, I note the cases the Deputy has identified in Dublin 12.  I will undertake to follow up on those with the chief officer for community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Farnan.  Last week, literally all of the parents had a difficulty.  Not only that, but many other parents have difficulties.  Perhaps we could do exactly that and follow up.  I can get a list of names from the parents who are working with different support groups and Rainbow Centre services.  That would be absolutely marvellous because, when they go to their GPs, they can do nothing because it involves psychiatric medication rather than other medications.  It is like trying to go to one's GP for neurological medication such as epilepsy medication.  You just cannot do it.  You have to be seen by a consultant.  We have a long list and it would be wonderful for these parents to get an answer to a phone call and some follow-up.  I thank Mr. Farnan very much.  I feel like I am done.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to wish Mr. Reid well.  We have met on numerous occasions at meetings of this Committee of Public Accounts and the previous one.  If there was an organisation we could have in every week, it would be the HSE because it is so complex.  This is part of the reason we chose this particular area and a couple of CHO areas.  We wanted to try to get under the bonnet on a couple of things.  There is a definition of value for money, which we have talked about here before.  It is not just about the balance sheet but about the output and the quality of service.  That is part of the reason the Cork mental health service in CHO, 4 was among those picked.  What brought it to our attention was issues at Garnish House and Owenacurra.  Will the witnesses clarify one question in respect of Garnish House?  Were any of the renovations that have been talked about actually carried out in advance of people occupying that building?  I am just looking for a "Yes" or "No".</p></speech>

I do not know what the current valuation is but that is the amount of money the HSE has expended in rents.  One of the things that has come up in this regard is that what is happening here seems very chaotic and inconsistent, including for the service users.  How many of the people who have received services in either Owenacurra or Garnish House have now gone to nursing homes?  How many of them have been located in other facilities where they are in shared rooms?  I understand there are about 20.  What is the profile there?</p></speech>

With regard to Owenacurra, many of those who moved went to nursing homes and were placed in either single rooms or shared rooms.  Having taken account of their needs and everything else, some were placed in shared rooms in mental health services.</p></speech>

The locations at highest risk, from very early on, were nursing homes.  The HSE moved people out having assessed that there was a Covid-related risk but moved them to adverse environments.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

If Mr. Farnan cannot tell me now, will he let me know the number of those 20 people who went into nursing homes and the number who went into facilities in which they shared accommodation?  If he cannot give me that information now, will he pass it on to the committee after the meeting for us to consider afterwards?  More generally, the witnesses have talked about recruitment presenting a challenge.  We know that because we have talked about this before.  It is a recurring theme.</p><p>I understand there is a national panel for counselling for primary care and the HSE then offers contracts out of that.  The HSE will have done some assessment of what is needed.  There was one CHO area where, after having been on the panel, two candidates were offered a job, but after a service financial review, the offers were withdrawn.  The HSE has a problem recruiting and then this kind of thing happens.  How would that happen?  I got this reply to a parliamentary question on 5 September.  I cannot understand how that would happen if there is a panel and the HSE knows what the needs are.  Why would the HSE offer positions and then withdraw them?  It seems incredible.</p></speech>

I am trying to imagine a scenario where it may have been a service that is not funded on a recurring basis, so there would be multi-annual funding for it.  That is one possible scenario.  I would be surprised if those two people were not taken up in another part of the service because, as I mentioned earlier, we are recruiting across the board and, as indicated, they are the skills we need.</p></speech>

It is one in particular I would be watching.  I might take that up with the HSE separately as to how this came about, given it had decided there was a need and offered jobs, and then there was not a need.</p></speech>

I want to raise a more local issue that relates to a couple of funded palliative care positions in St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospice.  I think the hospice is an outlier in that there is no place for families to be referred for life management.  For example, let us say a parent is dying, there are young children, and management of that is required.  We can understand how sensitive that is.  If it is not dealt with well, it will be dealt with as a mental health issue later.  It is very important that is in place.  Although I am not religious myself, I can understand somebody requiring chaplaincy services.  This is another position that was funded for 2022 and it has not been recruited yet.  St. Brigid's Hospice seems to be entirely an outlier.  I would have thought these were basic services and they seem to be basic services everywhere else.  Why would services that are funded not be delivered?  The HSE might come back to me with reasons it has found it so difficult to fund those particular areas in a growing part of the country where many healthcare professionals live.  I have serious concerns about the way it is being handled.</p></speech>

On another point, I do not understand the thought process in regard to purchase as opposed to rent in regard to the one in Cork.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on a point made by Deputy Carroll MacNeill about the audit of CAMHS services.  Does that audit include the service users and their parents?  They are sometimes the ones who are capable of telling us where the shortcomings are.  Does it include an input from people who use the service?  If it is just an audit from the inside, it is only a half-audit.</p></speech>

I tabled a parliamentary question in March of this year about community psychologists at Crosslanes psychiatric unit and Singleton House in Drogheda, in the CHO 8 area.  I was told there were five posts and that one of them was filled and there were four vacancies.  I was again told in June that those vacancies had not been filled.  There were 89 people awaiting psychological assessment in April and that number was the same in June.  Has that situation changed?  Have they recruited more staff or is there still just one psychologist and four posts vacant?</p></speech>

I am going to give examples of cases I have been made aware of, and this can be replicated throughout the country.  These relate to the Crosslanes psychiatric unit, where people presented themselves at the unit, were turned away, and subsequently went on to take their own lives.  There were several such cases.  One young man, who was 24, presented there in a very distressed state.  He was told to go home and take his medication, and he took his life two days later.  There were other cases where people attempted to be admitted when their lives were in imminent danger.  Some had referrals from GPs.  They did not get the help they needed, they were not admitted and, subsequently, they took their own lives.  There were people who were turned away because they were told they either had drink or drugs taken and, obviously, their mental health in such a desperate state was the reason they had done that.  They were turned away and subsequently went on to take their lives, in one case actually in a field across the road from the centre.</p> <p>  Another case was brought to my attention.  A man had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had been engaged in abusive behaviour.  His father took him to the unit and begged for him to be admitted.  He was in such a distressed state that he was threatening suicide.  He had been sleeping rough and was highly distressed.  His arms were ripped to shreds through cutting himself up.  They refused to admit him and they said it was because he was not psychotic.  This is just one unit.  There are other cases where people were left seven hours.  They were told to wait outside in their car for seven hours through the night and nobody made contact with them throughout those seven hours.  The duty psychologist came out at 7.30 that morning.</p><p>The parent said to me that person looked absolutely exhausted from working through the night.  It is not only a total systems failure.  At what stage are management held to account for this?  As I said, that is one unit about which I can give horrific stories of people desperate for help who are turned away and take their own lives.  What sort of a system is that?  How can that be called a proper system when it is failing people on a daily basis?  There are still four vacancies there.  Can somebody please tell me who is held to account?  Who is held accountable when situations like this arise every other day of the week?</p></speech>

Obviously, I cannot comment on any of those individual cases.  They all sound like awful tragedies.  The Deputy has the information on them; I do not.  In many cases, where some people have been failed by the service, it is raised with us.  The coroner or others might do so.  I cannot comment on those cases but across our services throughout the country, many of our staff and service users are delivering good care in mental health services and they are highly committed.

That is a stand-alone unit and it does not do medical detox.  Unfortunately, when people turn up who are in an intoxicated state, they have to go to a medical facility for detox before they can be admitted to our unit.

As Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned, we are holding this session so we can do a deep dive into particular CHOs.  I would like to direct my questions to the senior national management present and to the Department because we have done a little work on the CHOs across a number of committees.</p> <p>  In the past decade, the HSE invested only &euro;428,000 in upgrades to the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton.  The centre accommodated 20 residents until 2021 in a community-based town centre location.  It was considered an excellent service.  I talked to the residents myself.  They were exceptionally happy there and many had been living in the centre for more than a decade.  By contrast, the HSE invested far more money in institutional dormitory-style, out-of-town wards in the same ten-year period, which I have also visited in the past year.  For instance, the HSE spent &euro;1.9 million on St. Catherine's ward and &euro;2.9 million on wards and a day centre in St. Stephen's Hospital.</p> <p>  We also learned recently through freedom of information, FOI, records released to me, almost a year late, that out of the eight mental health facilities in CHO 4 discussed by management in 2019, the Owenacurra Centre was the only one mentioned as possible for sale.  I will add that having talked about this issue a number of times at committees, that is directly in contrast to what we were told during committee meetings, which is that it had never been discussed that the site might be for sale.  The FOI records indicate that the HSE advised limiting capital expenditure on the excellent service at Owenacurra, the replacement of premises, such as Mount Alvernia in Mallow and unit 1 in St Stephen's at a cost of millions was mentioned but there was not one mention, in any of the FOIs or parliamentary questions, of replacing Owenacurra, or replacing that service, or making it so that that service could continue.  All of this suggests that there was an agenda over a significant amount of time during the past decade to close Owenacurra long before the closure was actually announced last year and, when it was announced, many of those residents were given around three months to get out of their home of more than a decade.</p> <p>  We are way past a discussion around the quality of the building at Owenacurra and whether it was in good nick.  It is perfectly clear from the FOIs I have received that there was tacit agreement by CHO management in Cork, and by estates, that they were going to run that service into the ground and sell off the site.  That is the reality of the decision-making.  The HSE was going to move residents to substandard premises, to shared accommodation and shared rooms in places very far away from Midleton, their families and even a local shop or community group.  They were going to be cut off from their communities and put into shared rooms.  I want to ask senior HSE management about this.  Mr. Reid is moving on soon and I would particularly like to hear from him because this concerns estates and capital funding.  I would like to hear from the CFO and the CEO.  Do they stand by that decision-making?</p></speech>

There are different needs for each of the residents.  We have done that over recent months.  It is down to eight residents now with whom we are still working.  To answer the Deputy's question substantively, I stand over the decision in relation to the Owenacurra centre-----</p></speech>

In July and August this year, after an intervention from the Information Commissioner, I eventually received a large volume of freedom of information, FOI, records which, by the way, I was told at first did not exist.  Within the records we found evidence of two senior clinicians from different disciplines voicing serious concerns about the possible closure of Owenacurra and the impact on residents and, of course, the impact on the wider day service for people in the east Cork area.  Now, we are left with almost no services and certainly no 24-hour residential services in the whole of east Cork.</p> <p>  We found records on the possible sale of Owenacurra being discussed by senior management.  We found records on one key decision-maker who was complaining last July that there are only seven placements available in St. Stephen's Hospital for Owenacurra residents, again in a ward setting, which is absolutely contrary to national policy.</p> <p>  What is actually most striking is the complete absence of records.  I would have assumed this is of great concern to the national running of the HSE.  For example, there is no record of any clinical decision-making process that led up to the Owenacurra centre closure.  There is no serious available and transparent decision-making process there that actually talks about the patients' welfare.</p> <p>  This is about estates.  This is, and we talked about this at many committees, like moving people around on a chessboard or playing Monopoly and saying I am going to buy a building over here.  We have building reports issued by HSE estates in June 2021.  Then, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Scully and their colleague, Mr. Morrison, held a completely unminuted meeting on 22 June and decided to close that service.  We have no minutes and we have no clinical intervention.  I am sorry, but just to be clear, the HSE is fine with that.</p></speech>

That is a fair answer.  I would like to now turn to the Department.  The HSE very clearly said just now that it is prioritising settings for 24-hour mental health placements that are directly in contrast to our national policies and what we know is best practice for patient care.  At what point does the Department step in here when it is very obvious the HSE is not doing its job in this regard?</p></speech>

As Mr. Reid has outlined, there is a prioritisation that takes place.  That is not about one competing with the other, however.  It is about the timeliness of ensuring we can deliver against those plans.  For instance, in the Cork area and in the south, there is a commitment around the replacement of residential services where they fall below certain standards-----</p></speech>

Some of the clinical specialists in the area voiced concerns.  It was inspected three times by the Mental Health Commission in December 2021 and March 2022.  The lead inspector, Dr. Susan Finnerty, said:</p> <blockquote> 	I was particularly concerned to note that the culture in one unit was reminiscent of a model of mental health care that might have been provided decades ago.  There was a general attitude of negativity about the possibility of improvement in the lives of the residents.  There was an emphasis on what they could not do, their potential for aggression, and the fact that they would always require this type of care. </blockquote> <p>This is before we are talking about the fact that people are sharing rooms and they are not in a community setting.  They are basically off in a field in the middle of nowhere.  I went and had a look.  It really is something from the 1950s, and Ireland obviously has a very grim legacy in that regard.</p><p>I am sorry, Chairman, because I want to put my hand up to come back in on Garnish House in the next round of questioning, but is Ms McArdle telling me that when the HSE made a decision to underinvest in a building that provided an excellent service, which was right in the middle of a town where people were living in their own rooms, the Department at no point intervened in estates management in the HSE to ask whether the cost-benefit analysis is in line with national policy?</p></speech>

We have a ten-year national policy called Sharing the Vision.  It is very important that any investment in our capital infrastructure aligns with that.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  It is a move towards community infrastructure but it has to be balanced against the need to ensure the services and infrastructure we have are-----</p></speech>

It has been brought to my attention by people in the local community that the Office of Public Works was in that area viewing the building in Owenacurra.

First, the decision was postponed.  Then we heard of plans for decongregated settings potentially to be set up in Midleton.  Now, plans are being touted for the establishment of a new centre.</p> <p>  How long will that take?  What is the plan?  Is there an envisaged opening date for a new ten-bed centre that has been promised?  Can Mr. Fitzgerald rule out today that the site where the Owenacurra centre is currently located will not be sold, as was promised that day at the forum?  Deputy Stanton and I were the only Cork East Deputies in attendance that day when we were told that site was going to be retained for mental healthcare services.  Can Mr. Reid and Mr. Fitzgerald rule that out for me here and now?</p></speech>

Importantly, from a Midleton perspective and an east Cork perspective, we are committed to the development of a ten-bed rehabilitation residential-type facility in the town.</p><p>We said we will undertake an analysis and an options appraisal with regard to what is the most appropriate location - whether it is the current site in Owenacurra or a nearby site across the road from it in Midleton hospital or a new site in the area.  On another important issue, we said we would seek the purchase of a community residential-type of house because we have to bear in mind the type of services for east Cork.</p></speech>

I asked two questions and neither has been answered.  To be fair I asked the questions of Mr. Reid as well.  I will be very clear and ask them one at a time.

It will be dependent on sufficient funding being available in the capital plan for the development of the site, no more than any other development we put forward.  It will take a number of years for it to be built, unquestionably.  We are talking about four to five years until we have a ten-bed facility.  There are two other important issues locally from the Deputy's perspective.  The four-bed house that we sought is now at "Sale agreed" and we also intend that the developers will be on-site for the community hospital across the road in Midleton by the end of the year.  They are important developments in Midleton in the broader sense of health services.  It actually also affords the opportunity for the use of Midleton sites.  It serves the Midleton Community Hospital complex inside for future purposes on that site.</p></speech>

What is the immediate plan for those residents in the coming years?  Mr. Reid has stated he will not ask anybody to get out.

That process has brought us to a situation where ten of the residents have moved from the Owenacurra Centre at this point.  I was asked earlier how many of the ten were in single rooms in whatever residential centre they were.  Nine out of the ten are in single rooms at this point in time.  I am confident we can keep working with the families.  It is a balance of the people's will and preference as well as their clinical needs and working through the remaining number of people with regard to that.</p></speech>

That is not acceptable in the short or medium term.  There is an urgent need to increase that.  The service plan in the immediate future has been covered in depth by Deputy Hourigan.  I cannot stomach the idea that people in Midleton are going to be asked to move to St. Stephen's Hospital and other HSE locations despite the Mental Health Commission reports clearly outlining that there are serious problems.  So much about this decision does not make sense.  It has been hard as a Government representative trying to seek the answers that families need when the HSE changed its story on so many different occasions.  I want to outline my disappointment and frustration with that.  It is the second time I have told Mr. Reid.  I said it to him the last time he was before the committee.  I also ask about the day care service and it is critical that Mr. Fitzgerald gives some explanation for this.  Emergency respite care was deeply valued by people in the community.  People working in the Owenacurra Centre who provided that care to the community had a good deal of discretion.  Will he indicate what is being done on the respite care front and on the day care front please?</p></speech>

Once the development is completed across the road in Midleton Community Hospital, it will afford an ability to provide it on a permanent basis on that particular site.</p> <p>  With regard to respite care, it is important for members and for Deputy O'Connor, we are trying to establish a community-based service because that is the need of the people and that is the challenge for us in the context of delivering on the policy for mental health services.</p></speech>

The service that was there was outstanding.  It was the heart of the community.  It was a few minutes' walk from the main street in Midleton, next door to the biggest supermarket in east Cork.  Everything was there for the service users' needs, and it has been taken away.  Irrespective of individual's views on the state of the building, that could have been rebuilt.  It is appalling how it has been handled.</p></speech>

Certainly, the report had noted three things in relation to the premises in Erkina House.  These were that all residents needed to have access to single-room accommodation and they needed to have access to kitchen facilities, which were not available within that facility, and other adaptations to the house to bring it to a standard would be required.</p><p> When the Covid pandemic hit in 2019-2020, we moved to provide single-room accommodation, which was done, and also, I suppose, tried to look at the policy direction in terms of Sharing the Vision in 2020 which recommended that residents be supported to have secure meaningful employment opportunities that fostered hope, participation and a sense of a better and brighter future.  In order for that to happen, we were looking to see where plans for replacements for some of our older stock could be found.  Certainly, it was in consideration at that point.</p></speech>

The HSE in Laois-Offaly, as I understand it, the Laois-Offaly part of CHO, 8, has said, and the management team have told me and others at meetings, that the plan is to provide four ten-bed units.  Is it correct that there were 12 patients in Erkina House during the pandemic who had single-room accommodation, that there is only one large room that could be described not even as dormer, but as multi-occupancy where one could have two or three, and that they were all accommodated?</p></speech>

There was &euro;4 million spend on it, according to previous discussions that we have had with the HSE on this and with Mr. Des O'Flynn, the chief officer.  This has been ongoing now for a few years.  It has capacity for 28 beds.  Today, I understand, there are still only seven beds open.  I have raised this at every opportunity.  Every time I have been in contact with Ms Kennedy throughout the year and at meetings that we have had, I have raised with her the fact that there are only seven beds in use in it.</p> <p>  The capital works were carried out to a very high standard.  The staff are there to staff it.  The day care centre remains closed despite the fact that there have been several dates given for it reopening and 21 beds are not in use.  Some of those beds will be sacrificed to facilitate the day care unit but one is still talking about 22 or 23 beds.  This is an intolerable situation that we have such a crying need for nursing home beds in the county and we have these closed.</p> <p>  I will run through quickly one of the reasons for it.  When it was ready to be reopened or near the date, it was discovered that the shower heads had still to be fitted or changed.  That held up progress for a number of months.  When that was sorted, it was discovered that fire doors needed to be changed.  Six doors needed to be upgraded.  When the HSE was getting the solution to that, there was a ramp needed for the day care centre.</p> <p>  I am saying to the HSE senior management team here today that this is a problem that one has come across in the HSE over the years in trying to get a decision made.  In my view, an engineer, a clerk of works or, for that matter, a carpenter, or a foreman on a building site would go in and snag that out and state the four things that need to be done.  This drags on and delays the process of reopening for the best part of a year.  That is not a tolerable situation.  Where works are being carried out, we should be able to ascertain what is on the snag list and whether there are other works that need to be carried out fairly quickly to get the place open.  We cannot run public services like that.  It is ludicrous.  Will Ms Kennedy tell me when the day care centre will finally be open and when those 21 or 22 beds will be brought into use?</p></speech>

At that stage, the certificates of compliance will be undertaken and they will be sent to HIQA.  HIQA needs to re-register side A of the hospital in advance of moving patients back in.  That will give us the ten single en suite rooms on side A.  Side B is then being vacated.  There will be the opening up of the 11 intermediate care beds and also the opening up of the day care facility on the site.  The day care facility is a temporary facility.  Once that is reopened, the development control plan will be reviewed to see how a day care facility can be accommodated on the site.  Once day care is in its permanent home, the additional seven beds in the intermediate care part of the hospital will be opened.  That is the sequence of events as it needs to happen.</p> <p>  Snagging will be complete tomorrow followed by certification followed by registration.  Those are the key next steps.</p></speech>

The HSE went through a process of going around other towns in the area and seeing what was available, in terms of houses or premises.  The location is there because it has the services onsite.  There is a four-acre site there.  The HSE has loads of space on it.  It is right in the middle of the geographical area in south Laois where the HSE needs a day care centre.  Any attempt to move it out would be resisted.  Also, it does not make financial or management sense to move it out of there.  I would ask Ms Kennedy, and I have said this to Mr. Des O'Flynn as well, that the HSE keep an eye on that.</p> <p>  Lastly, how much has been spent to date on the car park facility at St. Fintan's campus, the mental health facility, in Portlaoise?</p></speech>

Funding was provided for a social worker role three years ago, but the governance and the advertisement, as I understand it, has not happened.  Funding was also provided in 2022 for a chaplaincy role, but there was no advertisement for that role either.  What happens to the funding for roles that are not filled?</p> <p>  Before we finish the meeting I would like to invite Mr. Reid to tell us the main message or advice he would give to his successor, based on his experience.  It has been a pretty unusual few years, thanks to the intervention of Covid and its impact on the role he expected to be undertaking.</p></speech>

The normal practice is that the funding stays until the post is recruited unless the service decides the post cannot be recruited and there may be some alternative way to deliver the same benefit.  If none of that works, there has to be some sort of reparation.  Normally, the money stays until the post is recruited.</p></speech>

It is rare for the money not to be put to some purpose.  That is not a challenge I have faced so far, as chief financial officer.</p></speech>

The SouthDoc service is very important to the people of Cork East, Kerry and County Cork in general, but it is at enormous risk because of the potential reshuffling of existing centres.  Will the HSE to commit to meeting a delegation of public representatives from the area to discuss this problem?

Second, on the delivery of primary care in east Cork, it is impossible to get a doctor at the moment if one moves into places like Youghal and other areas of my constituency.  The delivery of a primary care centre in Youghal is one of the largest capital projects the HSE will undertake in County Cork over the next few years.  Will the HSE give me some indication of the status of that project, which is critically important in the provision of healthcare services in east Cork, including additional acute services?  I ask for an outline of where that centre stands.</p></speech>

Our assessments, including of safety risk, the asbestos, the mechanical and electrical equipment, the investment that was needed there but also, more importantly, of the conditions and the space in which people were living and the fact that day care services were being mixed with services for people in residential care, concluded the centre was highly inappropriate.  The right decision was made, in line with the strategy and policy of moving people into residential care.</p></speech>

The decision to close Owenacurra was appalling and it is even more appalling to hear the HSE doubling down on what was a wrong decision.  What we have heard about today is a decision with no clinical oversight and one that was probably put in train in 2012 in terms of deciding to run that building into the ground.  It is really shocking that the HSE at a national level would defend that.</p> <p>  Our guests have taken exception to my characterisation of the decision-making in Cork as moving people around like chess pieces on a chessboard but I would like to move to the issue of Garnish House.</p><p>The HSE rental agreement with Garnish House started in April 2020, during the Covid emergency.  A family member of a resident told the <i>Irish Examiner</i>earlier this year that their relative was moved with a few hours&rsquo; notice.  As of April this year, according to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, the HSE has failed to communicate with the families of residents in County Cork mental health facilities in the last two years since their relatives were suddenly moved to this new accommodation.  We have covered the impact of prolonged uncertainty for people in mental health services around where they will be living.  My questions are on: the impact that has; the fact that it seems there is no clinical oversight to those decisions; or that they are not recorded in any way; and that the HSE and Department of Health are fine with that.<br/><br/>The <i>Irish Examiner</i>article in April this year said there had been consultation with those Garnish House residents and families about their ultimate placements.  Could the witnesses outline what that consultation was?  The HSE has informed me, through a parliamentary question response, that it will not be renting Garnish House again beyond quarter 1 of 2023.  Has it informed the residents or did they find out through that parliamentary question response?  When did they first hear about it?  The HSE has been telling people from Owenacurra, up until recently, that they will be moving to Garnish House.  Is the HSE informing those residents and their families that if they move to Garnish House they will have to move again in early 2023?</p></speech>

At all times it was understood that Garnish House was not a place where people would be resident for the long term because it was always a leased building.  It was done at short notice at the time because we were preparing fast for what we did not know with regards to Covid.  That is a hugely important issue with regard to the decision to move from Millfield House to Garnish House, which is at issue.  Importantly, though Garnish House is not an ideal location from a residential perspective in terms of the consequences around the building itself, as I outlined earlier, it afforded more space and more single spaces, especially at that first stage and at the early stages of Covid when we did not fully understand what the implications might be for residential settings in mental health, such as they were.</p></speech>

What consultation has the HSE had with Garnish House residents about their ultimate placements?  Had the HSE informed residents of these plans before the details were released in a parliamentary question response to me?  How has the HSE been dealing with the Owenacurra residents who it has been telling for the last year and a half are going to go to Garnish House?  Has the HSE informed them that will not be long-term and that it will be a matter of months before they are moved on yet again?</p></speech>

The vacancies in CHO 8 were as follow: speech and language therapy had 32% vacancies; occupational therapy had 36% vacancies; psychology had 41% vacancies; physiotherapy had 26% vacancies; and social work had 37% vacancies.  We get constant complaints from parents that they cannot get assessments or access therapy for their children.  Unfortunately time does not allow us to go into this matter in depth, and we could devote a session to it.  What is being done to fill these positions?  Is there workforce planning?  Are the third level institutions being contacted about this?  Are people being encouraged to take up study for these positions?  What is the current situation?  I am just giving the example of CHO 8 but if you look at it up to 40% of positions are empty across some of these therapy positions.  Services cannot be provided and there is a constant problem.  What is being done about it?</p></speech>

There are a couple of things and we discussed this in the Joint Committee on Health yesterday with the Department as well.

I also ask for a written reply from Ms Kennedy to the following question as I do not expect her to have the details with her, nor do we have the time to go into it.  In 2019 there was &euro;138.6 million for dental health, with &euro;62.3 million for public dental health services, which I presume is the PRSI scheme.  For orthodontics there was &euro;20.3 million and there was &euro;56 million for the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, in 2019.  I presume it is a similar figure or maybe there has been an increase.  Could Ms Kennedy send the committee a note on the dental health budget across those three areas, including public treatment, orthodontic treatment and the DTSS in CHO 8 and specifically in Laois-Offaly?  I ask her to send us a breakdown of that and of what the situation is with dental health services because I want to try to understand what has happened.  I think I have discussed this before with Ms Kennedy and with Des O'Flynn.  We do not have a service in some of the counties so I want to try to understand what is happening in between.  I ask Ms Kennedy to send me that information as a starting point.</p></speech>

We spend a lot of time researching for these meetings and we do not always have the individual answers for specific areas but we spend a lot of time paying due respect for the roles members play in Oireachtas committees.  The Deputy's question was what would my passing comment be to, in this case Stephen, who will take up the acting role.  It would be that it is all about the services.  We cannot ever forget everything we do every day, no matter what roles we are in.  We have to ask if we are adding value to the people who use the services.  If we are not adding value then we are not doing our jobs.</p></speech>

I thought it was longer since Tony O'Brien went but it is not, although it seemed like it.  I acknowledge that and that Mr. Reid was there during a difficult period.  Covid was a wartime case and it was very difficult.</p><p>There were many needs that had to be met very quickly.</p><p> Major reforms of the health service are necessary, but there is something that I find frustrating.  I am sure other public representatives and people in the HSE do as well.  We have a substantial budget, one that is rightly increasing again this year, and it will be voted through by the Oireachtas, but the services at the far end of that process are what count.  When we meet HSE management, we get long-winded answers.  While I understand it is a complex process, we must try to move to a situation where the public can see that we are actually providing a budget, given that, although it is larger than other European countries' health budgets, some services at the other end of the process are very weak.  Good work is being done within the HSE, but there is room for improvement.  The health service will never be perfect.  I acknowledge the work that Mr. Reid has done.  I hope that, if we pursue Sl&aacute;intecare, we will move towards a better and fairer system of healthcare delivery over the coming years.</p><p> I wish Mr. Reid well in whatever position he takes up.

I do not doubt the veracity of what the Deputy said, but we must be careful, even when information is sometimes less than 100% accurate.  Sometimes it is 100% inaccurate.  I ask Deputy Hourigan to use the opportunity of next week's meeting to raise the issue directly with HSE senior management.  I heard that she was told specifically this morning that there was consultation with the families.  The Deputy might clarify what was involved in the consultation.</p></speech>

If it was not true, it is not entirely fair to the member to have her time taken up.  We should not accept from anybody that witnesses are not candid with us.</p></speech>

That is why I think we should put it to the HSE.  We will notify it of the fact that Deputy Hourigan's information is different from what was stated.  We will put it to the HSE and let it come back with its position.</p></speech>

We can decide on the approach to take.  Deputy Hourigan can do it within her ten minutes, but I am in favour of letting her do it outside of that given the fact that she feels she has grounds for doing so, based on the fact that she information she received was not correct.  Deputy Hourigan has raised it now.  She will not want the entire meeting taken up with it, as that would be unfair to other members, but we will allow her to clarify the matter.</p></speech>

The issue is that there was not consultation with some families.  I thank Deputy Hourigan for that.</p> <p>  The first item of business is the minutes of our meeting of 22 September, which has been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters in relation to the minutes?  Okay.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's webpage.</p> <p>  Two sets of financial statements were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas between 19 and 23 September 2022.  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, to address them before opening the floor to members.</p></speech>

The college of education has been incorporated into Dublin City University, DCU, but there are some residual assets and liabilities that remain with the entity called St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra.  The turnover was very small in the year 2019-2020.  It got a clear audit opinion.  I understand that the college is moving towards finalisation of the assets and liabilities and the dissolution of the college in due course.</p> <p>  The second set of financial statements is the motor tax account, which is a sizeable departmental fund account.  A total of &euro;907 million was collected in 2021.  That received a clear audit opinion.  For the information of the committee, I will have a chapter in my annual report tomorrow relating to the collection of motor tax.</p></speech>

Effectively, the receipts go to the Exchequer and then funding, more or less equivalent - with some variances from year to year - is distributed back through the Vote for transport.  It is not going into the transport Vote as an appropriation-in-aid.  It is a longer route to coming back to the Department.</p></speech>

Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The third item of business is correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee's meetings and published on the committee's webpage.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is: B - correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.  We have one item held over from last week's meeting.  It is No. 1426 B from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 31 August 2022 providing information requested by the committee regarding the status of the business case for the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital.  We agreed to note and publish this item.  Deputy Munster had flagged an interest in this but I do not think she is present.  Does any other member wish to come in on it?</p></speech>

This is a case in point.  There are all sorts of figures about what it will cost to build the hospital before there has been any tender process.  That is leaving aside the appalling decision on the land on which the hospital will be located, and its ownership.  What year did the project preparation change?  The decision on gate 2 is referred to.  Did that happen after the national paediatric hospital-----</p></speech>

It would be useful if we could find out when the decision-making process commenced?  I do not think we learn lessons.  We talk about lessons learned but there is plenty of evidence to show that we do not learn.</p></speech>

We have had the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in several times.  One of the issues that appears to have been hugely problematic is where there is inadequate preparation.  This refers to inadequate preparation in advance of a project.</p><p>There are then amendments and claims.  We really need to keep a close eye on this process if we are to ensure that with any further major project like this, we do not end up having constant conversations about it here.</p></speech>

Apparently, this is just given as a factual statement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and not something it is concerned about.  I would go back to both Departments to see when a business case is expected to be presented.  I do not know who we write to in respect of how the Cabinet came to the decision to make a political decision about it without having that business case to hand.  Do we write to the Department of the Taoiseach in that regard?  We need to get clarification from somebody.</p></speech>

The committee has signalled that the Department is coming before it in respect of these kinds of issues so that might form part of that discussion as well.</p></speech>

I knew it had gone ahead with no formal business case in place.  Could we ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform if it is standard operating procedure to make a major decision in terms of signing off on contracts with no business case?

We will request that information from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Hopefully, it will shed some light on that.  We will note and publish that item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1459 is correspondence from Mr. John Hogan, Secretary General, Department of Finance, dated 15 September 2022, providing information requested by the committee arising from the meeting with the Department on 5 May 2022.  It concerns annual reports on the State's transactions with the EU for 2019 and 2020.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?

I flagged it simply because this committee has an obligation to be aware of the type of figures.  We discussed this previously in respect of the oversight of the moneys involved because we are talking about Irish contributions to the EU budget moving towards the &euro;3 billion mark.  That is a significant proportion of Exchequer funding.  There is no other element of funding allocated by this House that has as little oversight in terms of how it is distributed. I think the latest figures we have are for 2019, which show that we are paying in the region of &euro;500 million more than we are receiving.  That is almost beside the point because this covers a multiple of programmes.  There are audit processes at a European level but they have been challenged as being ineffective at that level.  At the end of the day, this is still Irish taxpayers' money that is being provided through our contributions to the EU.  That money should be accounted for in the same way as all other expenditure.  As I have said before, I am not sure precisely how we do that.  There are audit provisions at an EU level but they have been roundly criticised as being ineffectual.  We just need to keep it on the agenda and be mindful of it.  Taxpayers and the Irish people have a right to know precisely on an annual basis that we are paying more in and, therefore, there is an increasing obligation every year to ensure the money is being spent effectively.</p></speech>

The previous committee examined a special report of mine where we suggested that an annual report like this would be published.  The committee agreed and it became a recommendation of the committee.  This is in response to work of the Committee of Public Accounts and is very useful for the reasons outlined by Deputy Carthy.  Perhaps the committee might like to know that recently an Irish man, Tony Murphy, was appointed as president of the Court of Auditors.  He visits Dublin from time to time and I am sure he would be happy to come before the committee and talk about the work of the Court of Auditors.</p></speech>

It is claimed that they did not have a relationship but they did.  It states payment was provided for services.  That is, to me, pretty much the same thing.  On the third page of the reply, there is reference to the fact that the high-level purpose of the exercise is to explore options for a platform that would reduce the administrative burden on grantees and funders, as well as providing a single source of truth and source analysis on a State-funded community and voluntary grantees, and the investment being made into these organisations.  That does not address the use.  We received a letter from the CSO last week which allowed us to see the amount of money it is going to have to spend to replicate this.  The Department of Rural and Community Development will be constructing something new that is less than the service that was provided by Benefacts.  We are going around in circles.  Benefacts feels to me like the spinning blue ring on a computer.  I cannot allow this pass without comment.</p></speech>

Any of us who were on local authorities know this is a residual issue.  The landfill site in Kildare was big and growing to become a mountain before it went on fire.  It then cost a fortune to carry out remediation works.  These situations can be problematic.  A total of &euro;191 million has been spent on a programme to identify sites.  That was a requirement of the EU.  There was an infringement case, <font color="#242424">ECJ C494/01</font>, broughton the grounds of non-compliance with the waste framework directive.  That &euro;191 million is that amount that will be spent by the Exchequer.  These dumps were run by private entities and those entities need to be chased to ensure additional money is brought in.  This problem does not lie exclusively on the State side.  We should be writing back to the Department and asking it to get us the total list of the sites that have been identified by local authorities.  The Department states there are 494 sites.  Where are they?  What are the outstanding issues?  Is the Department chasing the people who caused the problem in the first place?  Just because there is finance there for remediation, the foot should not be taken off the pedal in going after people who have brought destruction.  Very often, there are repeat offenders in that regard.</p><p>I remember a high-profile case in Priorswood, somewhere near Coolock or Darndale.  It was nearly in the middle of a housing estate.  We might specifically ask about that.  Dublin City Council had to launch a planning application.  Deputy Hourigan might know about this.  The council had to launch a planning process to remediate it.  As I say, these things do not happen by accident.  There must be a penalty for the people who caused the problem in the first place and who have benefited from it.</p></speech>

In the response received from the Secretary General, he sets out that it should be noted that in July, the D&aacute;il passed a Supplementary Estimate for the Department to allocate &euro;200 million to a new subhead, B13, in the energy transformation programme area to fund the purchase by EirGrid of additional temporary generation capacity, which included a reallocation of &euro;40 million from subhead B4, the residential and community retrofit programme.  The next paragraph explains the breakdown of that.  We should write back to Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department, to find out what the situation is with that generation capacity.  Has it been secured?  Is it on stand-by?  What is the cost of it?  What is it fuelled by?  What type of fuel is being used in the generators?  These are temporary emergency generators that are being imported.  What is the current update on that?  What is being spent on it?  What are the generators being fuelled by?</p><p>Is it agreed that we write to Mr. Griffin?  Agreed.</p></speech>

It provides information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 14 July.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I flagged this item.  There is an issue in it regarding analysis of the cost of the judicial reviews of a housing development, including whether additional cost is built in in anticipation of a judicial review.  The correspondence states that the committee may wish to be aware that the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland has estimated that the overall construction cost impact of a judicial review could range from &euro;8,000 to &euro;12,000 per unit - per house or apartment - for every year the development is delayed.  I am just highlighting this.  While we do not want to close off the judicial review process, it is in some cases adding a huge price to the already rapidly escalating price of houses and apartments.  Of interest to the committee, from our point of view, is that when An Bord Plean&aacute;la challenges these judicial reviews, there is a cost there as well.  This system would seem to me to be broken.</p></speech>

First of all, there is the very dynamic nature of the construction sector at the moment.  I am presuming that the society's calculation of those costs is based on the huge level of inflation we are seeing in the construction industry.  Second of all, ultimately, this is a function of our move away from local authorities in 2015.  There was a much faster, much clearer, much cheaper way of appealing planning permissions we thought were inappropriate, which was to use our statutory planning authority, which is our local councils.  The move since 2015 to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Therefore, while I accepts the society's numbers, it is not contextualising them in the correct way.</p></speech>

The reality here is that the judicial review process is about the only thing keeping our so-called professional planners, everyone from the regulator right down to the town planner, in line.  The more successful judicial reviews we have should highlight to the Department the lack of understanding of the law.  It is as simple as that.  We should be doing continuous professional development for these individuals.  That should be brought in by means of legislation.  That is where our money is going, and it is not money well spent.  If we were to turn what we are paying out in legal fees, not just for An Bord Plean&aacute;la but in every Department, to planning and housing, we would actually have a competent set of planners.  However, given the amount of legislation that goes through a planning department, be it Irish, EU or whatever else, there is no suggestion that they have to actually upgrade and upskill at any stage, and that is why we have continuous judicial reviews.</p></speech>

We have completely bypassed, for example, local area plans, whereby the likes of An Bord Plean&aacute;la only had to have regard to them without it being in compliance with the plans that the public went through and that were properly considered.  Then that was breached.  That was an entirely political decision.</p></speech>

Ultimately, however, when they are decided, they are decided on the basis of the law.  Judicial review is exactly that, the legal process.  When they are decided in favour of the complainant, it means that somebody has broken the law.  That is the issue for me.  It is continual professional practice.  I will qualify my comments by saying that that is my experience at the level of my county.</p></speech>

That is No. R1465, as members will see.  Although it was not flagged, there are a number of issues members might wish to consider proposing that the committee follow up on.</p> <p>  In that context, No. R1465 is correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage dated 15 September.  It provides a progress update on the implementation of recommendations in our previous report on the examination of the Department's accounts.  Members will recall this.  There are a few areas which, with members' agreement, we might follow up on.  Recommendation 2 in the report notes the impact that the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme will have on the Exchequer and recommends the creation of an independent building standards regulator and the re-establishment of the Building Regulations Advisory Body.  Progress appears to be slow, and we might request confirmation that it remains the intention to establish a building standards regulator as well as a detailed note on the work involved in re-establishing the advisory board and the reason for the delay.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Recommendation 3 in the report concerned HomeBond.  It requested a timeline and quarterly progress updates on recouping the full amount due to HomeBond.  I propose that we request confirmation that the proposed agreement with HomeBond will ensure the payment of the full liability due from the insurer and that we follow up with the Housing Agency if we do not receive a further update by November.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.640" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022092900002#FF02700"><p>Finally, regarding recommendation 4, there are a number of issues with the information provided, all of which relates to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  Three specific actions were recommended by the committee, which were as follows.</p> <p>  The first one was to create a reference number for each property reported to the RTB as unregistered in order that the individual or individuals making a referral have a record of same.  While the RTB stated in the relevant minute of the Minister that it "does not disclose detailed information in relation to the specifics of cases", the board confirmed that it will "examine the creation and implementation of a system of reference numbers and a related database for all referrals".  However, in this latest item of correspondence, the RTB appears to contradict this commitment.  The board confirms that each referral is given a unique internal number; however, it "does not provide updates on referrals and does not comment on the compliance of individual landlords, on investigation cases or on potential prosecutions".  The committee's recommendation was that the person contacting the RTB would be given a reference number for his or her referrals.  I propose that we express the committee's disappointment at the lack of progress in implementing a system whereby those who contact the RTB are given a reference number for their referral, and I request that the Department clarify this response in light of the minute of the Minister.</p> <p>  The second part of our recommendation was that the RTB establish a target timeframe for resolving each reported case.  The RTB has given a timeframe for its response to members of the public upon making a referral, rather than the timeline for resolving each referral.</p><p>At best the recommendation has been misunderstood.  I suggest we request clarity as to whether the RTB intends to develop a target timeframe for resolving referrals to the board, or any form of performance metric.  </p><p> The third part of our recommendation was that the RTB should publish a register of tenancies for student-specific accommodation as a matter of priority.  While it is welcome that the proposed register of tenancies for student accommodation has been published online, it appears to have been last updated in June 2022.  I propose that we ask the RTB to clarify its protocols for updating the register.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p> I thank members for allowing the time to set that out.  It is important that we follow up on recommendations we have made and hold bodies to the commitments made in the minute, which is the key bit, of the Minister, which provides the Government's response to this committee's recommendations.</p></speech>

We saw in the concrete levy applied in this week's budget, that there is a price to pay for not having a regulator.  It seems to be very foggy as to when that will happen and how it will be funded.  I would like us to get more detail on that.</p></speech>

There is a notion that something will cost something, but problems are avoided problems by having the proper regulation to begin with.  Australia completely re-regulated its construction sector.  People do not get a licence to build if they have not been in compliance and, therefore, there is a penalty for not doing it and problems have been avoided in the future.  We keep saying we will learn lessons but when it comes to putting in place the solution that will prevent it happening again, we are slow to do it.  When we do put these measures in place, we often do not fund them to the extent required to make sure we do not end up with big bills and torture for people living in the accommodation.</p> <p>  Regarding recommendation No. 4, it would be useful to find out whether most landlords are in compliance and will register with the RTB.  The ones who do not are the problem.  How do we get to those who do not, so that we have satisfactory standards?  Are there databases that should be shared with the RTB?  For example, Revenue has a database.  It may not be sufficient because it may not identify if something is leased or rented but it might be there.  Has the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the RTB been in contact with the data regulator regarding an impact assessment on any database that might be useful to them in their work?  Databases may exist that get to the point we are looking for without duplication.</p></speech>

We could request the RTB to clarify whether it has full access to Revenue.  The Department of Social Protection still pays rent supplement.  Has it full access to the list of properties - obviously not all the information in the database -  for the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and HAP?  The obvious ones would appear to be RAS, HAP, the Department of Social Protection and Revenue.  We could ask for that to be clarified.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the rest of the committee has had time to look at and read this or if they have not and want to deal with it in a few minutes.  It is about e-gaming and online gaming.  There is quite a lot of correspondence in it.  It is based on responses I have received to parliamentary questions.  Well in excess of &euro;50 million has been spent on e-gaming most years for the past three years.  There is no legislation dealing with e-gaming and we are exposing those taking part in it.  Revenue is collecting VAT from outside entities on the basis of moneys that it is not entitled to collect.  It is an illegal activity and a certificate is being granted by the Department of Justice, which is required to obtain a betting licence, a fitness to practice certificate and then the gambling or betting licence, as we would call it, is being granted.  Nobody is policing this.  It is not a remote bookmaker's licence and does not fit the criteria.  E-Gaming is an illegal activity.  I know a regulator has been appointed but she would have nothing to do with this because we have not seen the Bill being brought forward.  We should invite the Revenue and the Department of Justice in to explain themselves.</p></speech>

Maynooth University in my constituency levied students to construct some student buildings.  A levy of &euro;150 is a large imposition when someone is already paying a registration fee of &euro;3,000.  Yesterday, the university decided that it would have to cease building because it did not comply with the public spending code, being over 50% more expensive than the original tender.  I believe it is at that point that building must stop.  Perhaps we could seek some guidance on this matter.  Is it something that the Comptroller and Auditor General has encountered previously?</p></speech>

I do not have particular details on this specific project, but it sounds like a tender process was under way and, when the offers came in, the project turned out to be much more expensive than the university estimated it would be.  That is one of the points of doing a business case, in that you project what the costs will be and you weigh those against the benefits that the project is going to deliver.  If the costs outweigh the benefits, that must be considered.  There may also be a question of whether the university has the funding to go ahead with the project.  It could not commit to a project without having the funding in place.</p></speech>

Accessibility is at the core of the work of both of our committees.  In our first public meeting, my committee called for Leinster House to be made autism friendly, as is the case in the Northern Ireland Assembly's parliament buildings at Stormont, Belfast.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission welcomed our request to make Leinster House autism friendly and I hope to see developments this autumn.  We look forward to such initiatives as suitable lighting, noise reduction, a sensory room and, most importantly, staff training.  This will ensure that there are fewer barriers to access for autistic people attending Leinster House.  I hope that we will set a good example for all to follow.</p> <p>  Our committee's work in public session thus far has focused primarily on education.  This is just one area where considerable improvements are needed if we are to make accessibility a core principle.  Greater accessibility measures have been implemented in some schools but not others.  We need to see such measures being implemented in every school, be it a specialist school or a mainstream one.  The same must apply to publish buildings across the board.</p> <p>  I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses about how we can make our buildings and society more accessible for autistic and disabled people.  One of our powers is to draft recommendations for legislative change and examine statutory instruments.  We would welcome any idea that the witnesses may have in that regard.</p></speech>

On behalf of both committees, I welcome Mr. Adam Harris, CEO of AsIAm.  From Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, I welcome Mr. Desmond Kenny, chairperson, Ms Catherine Gallagher and Mr. James Crawley.  Also with us from the National Disability Authority, NDA, are Dr. Aideen Hartney, director, Dr. Gerald Craddock, chief officer at its Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, CEUD, and Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick, senior design adviser of ICT within the CEUD.</p> <p>  Before beginning, I wish to read out a note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise, comment on or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not make charges against a person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members and witnesses have the option of being present in the committee room or joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  If members are partaking, will they confirm before speaking whether they are on the grounds of Leinster House?</p> <p>  Without further ado, I call on Mr. Harris to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#B00100"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it today on this important subject matter.  AsIAm is Ireland&rsquo;s national autism charity.  Our vision is an Ireland where all autistic persons are accepted as they are  &ndash; equal, valued and respected.  Our purpose is to advocate for an inclusive society for autistic people that is accessible, accepting and affirming.  We work to support the autistic community and our families to fully engage in Irish life and build the capacity of society to facilitate true inclusion.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, autism is a unique neurotype.  Autistic people communicate, interact and experience the environment in different way from those who are not autistic.  While Ireland does not have a census question on autism, we know that increased awareness and understanding have led to more people being identified as being autistic in recent years.  While 2016 data from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, indicated that one in 65 students in school in Ireland is autistic, it is notable that the Department of Education has recently indicated that number is likely to be closer to 3.3% of the school-going population.  It is reasonable to assume that prevalence is represented across Irish society when adults without a formal diagnosis are also considered.</p> <p>  Autistic people are neurodivergent and therefore share many experiences with people who have other neurotypes and diagnoses, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, dyslexia and dyspraxia.  In the context of any discussion around accessibility and universal design, this is an important consideration, as many of the adjustments or reasonable accommodations that may support an autistic person will support many others too.  For example, visual information improves accessibility for those with dementia, those who may be functionally illiterate or those for whom English is not their first language.  Reductions in background noise would improve accessibility for those who use hearing aids or suffer from migraine.  This is before we even consider the reality that when an autistic person is excluded by the environment, it often has a much broader implication.  As a child, there were many places I found to be overwhelming, from restaurants to busy shopping centres.  The reality was that if I could not go somewhere, very often our whole family simple did not go.  This leads to many people missing out on important day-to-day activities and represents a lost opportunity for many services and businesses.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to participate in today&rsquo;s discussion, as too often the invisible accessibility barriers that autistic people encounter are not widely understood or even considered as accessibility requirements, despite being a legal requirement.  There can be a tendency to focus on how the person responds to an inaccessible experience instead of asking why that person is feeling overwhelmed in the first place.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, calls us to recognise that disability is experienced by the interaction between the impairments an individual may have with the attitudinal and environmental barriers within society.  Creating universally accessible environments and services is critical to this.</p> <p>  In AsIAm, we address autism primarily as an accessibility issue.  Autistic people experience barriers in society that others do not and, as a result, are often deprived of the same chance to access critical public services, engage in leisure activities or even do mundane tasks such as going to the supermarket or visiting a doctor.  Small changes can truly make a big difference.  In AsIAm, we explore accessibility through four key lenses: communication; predictability and control; sensory processing; and judgment and attitude.  How others respond to a person who is experiencing the world in a different way is, as the community consistently tells us, the single biggest barrier autistic people encounter within the community.  Public education and engagement must be seen as a critical component of accessibility and, in our experience, the creation of accessibility supports not only improves the experiences members of our community have, but also serves to demystify and destigmatise autistic experiences.</p> <p>  When we talk about accessibility and autism, it is important to recognise that, just like the general population, every autistic person is different and the sorts of accommodations and adjustments a person may need can vary greatly.  Indeed, at times they can even conflict.  For example, one autistic person may be hypersensitive to the environment, while another may be hyposensitive.  As a result, accessibility in autism cannot be codified in the way, for example, some physical accessibility adjustments can be.  However, we can create lenses or frameworks in which we can think about autism accessibility.  One such example is the ASPECTSS framework developed by the Egyptian architect, Dr. Magda Mostafa.  ASPECTSS stands for acoustics, spatial sequencing, escape space, compartmentalisation, transitions, sensory zoning and safety.  AsIAm was proud to work with Dr. Mostafa to develop design guidelines for university buildings based on our partnership with Dublin City University, DCU.  This framework will now inform all future building projects in DCU and has a much wider applicability also.  I will be delighted to share it with members if it is of interest.</p> <p>  In AsIAm, we run a wide range of training and accreditation programmes to support organisations to consider the accessibility requirements that autistic people may have and to put in place the appropriate adjustments.  This includes the autism-friendly university award, which I referenced, alongside our autism-friendly towns award, which this year will work with 20 communities across Ireland, and our autism-friendly schools programme, which was recently successfully evaluated by a team of researchers in Mary Immaculate College.</p> <p>  While each accreditation process is different, there are a range of common considerations across all our work in this area, many of which we would like to see adopted more formally by the State as a means of enabling the participation of autistic people in society.  Central to the consideration of accessibility must be autistic voices and experience.  Autistic people should be involved in the development of guidelines and accommodations and our lived experience should inform every aspect of how accommodations or adjustments are provided and made.</p> <p>  There is a distinct lack of understanding of the sensory differences experienced by autistic people.  The rise of multipurpose space and open plan have made many day-to-day environments, including new school buildings, very overwhelming for many members of our community.  We believe all buildings should undertake a sensory audit to consider the experiences of autistic people and make adjustments accordingly.</p> <p>  For autistic people going new places or trying new things, especially in stressful situations such as healthcare settings, can be extremely stressful and challenging.  We live in an information age and the appropriate use of websites, video and photography can go a long way towards easing this burden.  Showing a person what to expect prior to visiting somewhere can empower an individual to make informed decisions.</p> <p>  Autistic people and neurotypical people can encounter a double empathy problem when interacting.  Both communities need to learn to respect and understand the differences in communication, from the use of body language to the use of words.  There are insufficient means by which a non-speaking autistic person can access public services independently and how communication is provided is too often imprecise and confusing.  The most important accessibility change in this area would be universal training on autism for all public services, coupled with improvement in the ranges of modes of communication.  For example, many autistic people find the telephone overwhelming, but too often this is the only way to access vital services, such as a GP when people are sick.</p> <p>  When we consider the accessibility requirements from a universal design perspective, there is much to consider.  Moving forward, we should be ensuring all services and businesses are fully accessible by design.  What about existing infrastructure?  What about settings and services, for example, a busy health centre, which by its nature will pose some accessibility barriers for autistic people?  We must remember that not every autistic person is diagnosed or aware that they are autistic and many people do not feel comfortable sharing their diagnosis.  As a result, it is vital that as many accessibility measures as possible are applied universally and open to all.  This not only destigmatises but, in many cases, makes for a better experience for everyone.</p> <p>  There may then be other accommodations that, to protect their integrity, it is important to have as a means of a person identifying why they need this support.  An example is priority queueing.  AsIAm issues an autism ID card to support this sort of access and we welcome the developments surrounding an EU disability card.</p> <p>  Finally, there may be some accommodations and adjustments that are unique to the individual, for example, avoiding a very particular sensory trigger.  Where this is the case, it is vital that organisations provide neuro-affirmative information in advance, which supports and gives confidence to an individual to request these supports.</p> <p>  Autistic people adapt every day to a world that is not built with autistic people in mind.  It is essential that society meets us halfway and we create more accessible environments, communication systems and information that empower and support everyone.</p></speech>

I believe the Chair asked that we would indicate that.  I hope I will not make any defamatory statements in the course of this presentation.</p> <p>  I am pleased to have been invited by the committee and to share the platform with AsIAm.  It was interesting to hear Mr. Harris's presentation, which we will talk more about later on.  It is important that our mutual complementarity and potentially conflicting approaches do not in any way conflict with the generality of improving the environment and making it accessible for all.</p> <p>  ILMI is an organisation comprised of disabled people.</p><p>We see ourselves as a disabled person's organisation, DPO, working on the lived experiences of disabled people.  We are not associated or affiliated with any service provider.  We recognise the great work they do but we are here to talk as individuals who consult with individuals and we are bringing the committee that lived experience.  I will talk to the committee about one element of accessibility and Ms Gallagher will amplify that.  On hand we have Mr. James Cawley, our policy officer, who can answer questions on the accessible environment.</p><p> I want to talk to the committee in the context of accessibility in a visual world.  As a blind person, I rely on my ears, hands and feet - yes, my feet - to give me clues to and replacements for what might usually be regarded as visual.  At the edges of steps you will notice dimpled surfaces; this is to tell me that I am confronting steps going up or going down.  You will see the same dimpled surfaces at pedestrian crossings and along the edge of platforms in stations to demark the line beyond which it is not safe for me to venture.  Audio crossings are present in all of our cities and most of our towns, telling me when it is safe to cross the road, provided no cyclist is coming that is.  They have been growing in numbers since the mid-1970s and it is a tremendous assistance to the number of people who are blind or with low vision.  It is reckoned that there are 200,000 people in Ireland with low vision.  When you take into account the elderly, going up to the age of 85 and 90, there are 240,000 people with low vision, while there may only be 17,000 people like me who are totally blind.  The number of those audio crossings has grown over the years.</p><p> Announcements on our public transport fleets, buses and trains help identify where I might be at any given time, that is when the announcements are working, which cannot always be guaranteed.  New audio supports moving into use are audio description, AD, on film and TV.  Some 10% of our home-produced programmes on RT&Eacute; are targeted to be produced with AD built-in.  AD tells me what the scene is composed and comprised of and what the people are doing when action is not happening in a clear sense.  It tells me what people are doing by way of crying, frowning or looking into the distance.  I can anticipate what members might be wondering about.  For example, an audio clip from "Pretty Woman" announces to me that the couple are gone to bed and the blankets are moving.  Much of the movie stock on Sky Digital contains audio description which can be switched on and off as required.  Even the remote controls can be told where to navigate the channel selections to, with the selections talking back to me.</p><p> The following is an important point for the committee.  An EU regulation now requires that all new electric vehicles, EVs, from the summer of this year should emit an electronic sound when they are travelling below 20 km/h, telling me they are present.  Travelling in excess of 20 km/h the tyres are reckoned to emit enough noise for it to be clear that there is an EV present.  That regulation is not yet being enforced in Ireland and the same expectation might be applied to ebikes and escooters for the same reason.</p><p> Another directive from the EU relates to web accessibility, which was touched on in part by Mr. Harris.  This directive relates to the content on Government and local authority websites being accessible to screen readers for someone like me who is blind, and is capable of magnification for somebody with low vision.  The directive is being monitored and encouraged by the National Disability Authority, NDA, and it is good to see the officials from the NDA here to give more guidance on that.  It is an important directive.</p><p> In terms of touch, how many members of the committee will have picked up a pack of Panadol for their headaches or Gaviscon for their indigestion in the supermarket and noticed strange dots on medicine packs?  These will not be present on the drugs in your local pharmacy.  Those dots, which are Braille, also come from a European directive on medicines, obliging pharmaceutical companies to print in Braille the name of the medicine and its dose.  All that I have described in brief, not unlike what Mr. Harris was talking about and in a similar context, is a web of assistance that exists to support me to know or to interrogate my environment or, in the case of medicines, to tell me what tablets I hold in my hand.</p><p> Publishers of books are obliged nowadays to have available digital copies of their publications which can be shared throughout the world to countries signed up to share print material and make it available to people who are blind or who may be suffering from dyslexia.  Ireland has been signed up to this book share protocol since 2016.  When I first started my college education in the 1970s, textbooks were not available as such.  I had to have my books read onto cassette and I relied only on that and on lectures being spoken.  There was no other means of having that available to me.  Since then, in advancing my education in later years, I was able to do my course content and further education in digital form because of the availability of digital formats, which were available to me from the Open University.  That format could be read by my computer, again using screen reader software.</p><p> I will move towards a conclusion.  As the world evolves into more digital channels, I am told who is at my front door, how my thermostat is set and I can have Alexa or Google assistant at hand to tell me how I might need to spell something or to look it up.  I can have it looked up and spoken back to me from Google.  These are all part of the evolving new technologies of communication and contact.  The committee can monitor these things passively as watchers of the evolution of it all or from time to time, as we are doing this morning, it can look at the failures of our planners to think about access when designing the environments which make up our interface with the world as an inclusive society where all disabled people, as Mr. Harris said, want to be and live in.</p><p> I call my colleague Ms. Catherine Gallagher to continue this presentation and to present how she finds the information gaps.</p></speech>

In case it is necessary to say, like Mr. Kenny I am not physically on the premises and I am tuning in remotely.</p> <p>  I would like committee members to think about every milestone in their lives: starting primary school, secondary school, sitting the junior or leaving certificate, going to college, employment, or further training, moving out of the family home, and so on.  Did they face significant barriers in getting information to hand to see through all of those milestones?</p> <p>  Every decision disabled people make can span across multiple Departments.  Further to this, Departments and public bodies may attempt to redirect us around in circles.  These queries can turn into fully fledged information-seeking expeditions.  The burden of bureaucracy can be overwhelming, and we are no different from our non-disabled peers in that we have the same number of hours in the day.  There are also issues in relation to physical access and the built environment, specifically Part M of the building regulations which my colleague Mr. James Cawley can address.</p> <p>  I have not had the privilege of always living with privacy, dignity and discretion.  For every thing I turn my hand to, multiple Departments in several separate administrative offices need to be notified.  One of the most recent examples of this was my debacle on being offered a scholarship to study to a PhD level in Dublin City University in early 2021.  The modest stipend was a bone of contention regarding my disability allowance.  I was going to lose everything.  I instigated both a public and behind-the-scenes political communications campaign.  While it is rather a long story of how Catherine&rsquo;s Law came to be, the crux of what I want to highlight today was the lengths to which I had to go to establish the lay of the land.  When I received the first letter - in written format by the way, on paper - from the Department stating I was to lose everything, I was not given a reason.  I set about establishing the who, what, when, where, why and how of the matter.  I received incorrect information on several occasions, including the leading statutory body that supports the provision of information.</p> <p>  I eventually managed to piece together a case and, to be fair, when I presented it, I came across little resistance.  There were organisations and politicians who may not even have been aware it was an issue.  It was described in the D&aacute;il by one of the Government party leaders as a "mistake".  It certainly was not, but everyone got a fast education.</p> <p>  The physical toll this pressure put on me, even before it went public, is indescribable.  There was nothing private, nothing dignifying and nothing discrete about those couple of months.</p> <p>  When we think of coalition-building, we often think of it as being external to us, or forming governments.  Internal and cross-coalition building is just as important in how we talk and work with each other.  We need to acknowledge that there are Departments and State bodies that would benefit from an overhaul of the ways they provide information to target groups so that individuals can make informed decisions about their own lives.  There are disabled people who have the expertise to aid with this.  Consult us or, better yet, hire us.</p> <p>  As it happens, I am in the middle of preparing an application regarding my research.  I am asked to outline, in detail, how I will disseminate my knowledge, what impact it will have, who and where it will be useful for, and how it will add to the state of the art, as it were.  These are questions we also need to consider in light of accessible information and communication.</p></speech>

Our role is to provide evidence-informed advice to Government on disability and we incorporate the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, CEUD, which promotes universal design in the built environment, products, services and ICT.  It is the only statutory centre of its kind in the world.</p> <p>  Universal design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of age, size, ability, disability or type of disability.  Accessibility is encompassed within universal design.  If a universal design approach is applied from the outset, then accessibility can become universal.  This is reflected in Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the UN monitoring committee&rsquo;s general comment 2.  Universal design has the capacity to handle the variation and experiences referred to by Mr. Harris in his opening statement.</p> <p>  An accessible built environment is one in which the barriers to access by disabled people are removed or mitigated as far as possible.  A universal design approach at planning stage can reduce the need for costly renovations later.  The CEUD at the NDA has developed guidance for universally designed homes, places and facilities; early years learning and care settings; and the retrofit of long-term residential care settings among others.  However, to Senator Carrigy's point, we believe that incorporating a requirement for a universal design approach in relevant regulations is necessary in order for this guidance to be routinely adopted.  For example, we have called for a revision of Part M of the building regulations to include universal design and to ensure houses built are fully liveable for disabled people rather than just visitable as is currently the case.  We advise that all new housing projects progressed by the State should be universally designed and that 10% of any development should be designed to UD+ standards, so that any wheelchair user can live in them.  We also recommend the development of a national standard on housing that clearly sets out technical requirements for universally designed housing in order that a consistent approach can be applied in all local authority areas.</p> <p>  The Disability Act 2005 and the UNCRPD require all information and communications provided by a public body to be accessible to everyone.  The NDA has developed a code of practice for accessible public services and information that sets out the detail of these requirements.  We have recently revised the code to include provisions to meet the needs of those with autism and users of Irish Sign Language and to reflect the shift to digital services that was accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We look forward to this revised version being approved by the Minister in due course.  As has been referred to by Mr. Kenny and Mr. Harris, the EU web accessibility directive has brought additional obligations for public bodies to ensure their websites are accessible, and the NDA is pleased to be the national monitoring body for that directive.</p> <p>  The European accessibility Act is due to be transposed into Irish law in 2022 and aims to ensure there are more accessible products and services in the market at more competitive prices and with fewer barriers.  A universal design approach will be key to implementation of the directive in Ireland, and the NDA has advised that multiple parties will be involved to ensure implementation moves beyond the minimum required to avoid infringement to a proactive approach to ensure standardised accessibility across both public and private sectors.</p> <p>  A universal design approach requires the involvement of the widest possible range of users in the design phase and a co-production approach to projects.  This approach is also in keeping with UNCRPD and its requirement for the close involvement of disabled people and their representative organisations in matters relevant to their lives.  Consultation initiatives themselves should be universally designed to maximise the opportunities for engagement.  Our recently launched participation matters guidelines on consultation and engagement can offer support to all state actors in taking an inclusive approach to the projects in their remit.</p> <p>  To promote awareness and take-up of universal design, the NDA advises the importance of including it in curricula at all levels of the education system, in particular continuing professional development for specific groups such as architects, engineers and IT professionals.  A universal design approach should also be taken to promote learning for all, which includes provision of accommodations that anyone who needs to can avail of.  We welcome the recent developments in this regard in the further and higher education sectors.</p><p>The obligations and duties for public bodies are clear but the NDA&rsquo;s work to monitor progress across these areas shows there is still considerable work to be done to ensure accessibility is embedded as standard.  Our 2021 report on the web accessibility directive, which we submitted to the EU, showed that of the websites and mobile apps we monitored, none was fully compliant with the directive.  However, our report shows that the majority of issues identified were common and could be easily remedied if web providers gave greater focus to their obligations with regard to accessibility.  We are currently exploring structured mechanisms for monitoring compliance with Part 3 of the Disability Act and will be engaging with all Departments to remind them of their obligations and to guide on how to improve their performance where necessary as initial desk monitoring shows a number of basic steps that could be taken.  The ability to monitor progress and present data to public bodies is critical to encourage and track performance over time and the NDA hopes to enhance further our monitoring capacity to help embed accessibility as standard in all public organisations.</p><p> We advise that, while universal design is recognised in legislation and several national policies and strategies, a structured and systematic approach is now required to embed it in practice.  Making accessibility a consideration from design stage through to procurement and on to delivery should become part of the standard operating procedures for all State actors to ensure everyone can be included.  I thank the committee.  We would be delighted to answer any questions on this matter.</p></speech>

When we have talked about accessibility over the years, we have always thought more about the physical environment but it is about much more than that.  Mr. Harris in particular referred to the need to create awareness across all public bodies, employers and services.</p> <p>  I will address a couple of the issues.  Universal design and ensuring that housing projects were liveable for wheelchair users was mentioned.  A couple of the witnesses mentioned Part M of the building regulations.  They have asked for the regulations to be revised.  Is that happening?  Will they be revised to ensure that all buildings are liveable for wheelchair users?  Do we have any idea of the costs of building something to universal design+ standards as against the cost of having to adapt a house or building, because that is often thrown up?  Do we have a breakdown on that?  Mr. Harris said that we do not really know the number of people who are autistic and that it is not a question on the census.  Does he believe it should be?</p> <p>  Do planners and public bodies regularly consult with AsIAm, Independent Living Movement Ireland and their respective members with regard to accessibility issues?  Does the NDA employ many people who have disabilities?  To what extent does it consult with people who have disabilities?  I have talked to people who have been consulted about issues because the body had to do so to tick a box and ensure it was fulfilling its obligations but the advice they gave was just ignored.  I am particularly thinking about someone who was consulted on transport issues - I believe it was about cycling lanes or outdoor dining when that came in during the pandemic - but all of their suggestions were just ignored.  It must be ensured that consultation is done properly, for the right reasons and not just as a box-ticking exercise.  Will the witnesses speak about that?</p> <p>  The NDA has to oversee the directives that are being introduced.  Is it properly resourced to do so or is it being asked to climb a mountain with very few resources?  I am conscious of time.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

Just last summer, we saw the problems we have with regard to data on autism in the context of education.  At the minute, we have different data sets.  There are efforts under way to marry them but it is not a perfect science.  One very simple example of this is that, if you are an autistic adult accessing a diagnosis privately, as we know you must, you will not be in any HSE or Department of Education data set.  The census is the way to do it.  To be clear, it could be an autism-specific question or a reform of the disability question on the census.  At the moment, none of the fields within that question truly speaks to an autistic person's experience.  As a result, I fear that people are going unseen and that this is affecting national planning.</p> <p>  On consultation, the picture is very mixed.  There certainly is tokenistic consultation on many matters across the public sector and times when consultations are not accessible in and of themselves, which undermines the point.  If we step away from the policy area and think more about making services accessible, we have seen many public bodies coming to us seeking support and training in this area.  Key examples of this in recent years have involved libraries, public transport and universities.  Schools are a priority area because the State is going to be investing heavily in new school buildings over the coming decade.  In my view, the school buildings that are being built are, in many instances, less accessible for autistic people.  To give one example, very often you have to go through very busy areas to get to a quiet space.  Very vibrant and overwhelming colours are sometimes being used.  We sometimes even see that in the design of autism classes themselves.  More work needs to be done in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Desmond Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#E00600"><p>I will take the first part.  In a sense, it would be good to see what Mr. Harris has described regarding the expansion of the question on disability in the census.  It would be better if it were included in that general disability framework rather than being something outside of it.  We must see how the growth in the population of people who name themselves as disabled people will impact on the perception of our service delivery.</p> <p>  As for tokenistic consultation, most of the time - organisations will experience this as they grow older and their contacts expand - relationships are built with people like the Co-Chairman and Deputy Tully who know that we are there to provide our voice.  However, that voice is sometimes not called on often enough.  There is less of the tokenism than there used to be.  We are not there just because we must be to tick a box.  That does happen and Ms Gallagher can share her experiences of it but I am looking at the issue over decades.  I have looked at the origin of many things and sometimes nuance is lost and things do not happen correctly.  This can be seen in the enthusiasm to encourage cycling as a form of recreation and active mobility and the extent to which this is threatening the safety of elderly and vision-impaired people.  For example, planners are often told that lights should be in place to tell cyclists when to stop where there are bus islands and floating bus stops at which you have to cross a cycle lane physically to board or get off a bus, relying on those cyclists to stop.  However, it is all about the cyclists not stopping.  That is going to be a danger.  It has happened in other countries, and will probably happen here, that a human rights difficulty will arise that will have to be processed by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission because people are being exposed to a danger.  With regard to the physical built environment, Mr. Cawley is our policy officer and could enlighten the committee as to how we are consulted about the physical environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#E00700"><p>I will answer a number of Deputy Tully's question and then hand over to my colleague, Dr. Craddock, who will talk about built environment matters.  The Deputy asked whether the NDA employs people with disabilities.  Yes, we do.  In 2020, approximately 20% of our staff felt comfortable declaring that they have a disability.</p><p>That is something we are always keen to focus on.  As to whether we are resourced to do our job, what we have done very successfully, particularly Dr. Craddock's team, is built awareness of universal design over the last number of years and begun monitoring work on compliance with the various directives.  The challenge is the capacity to support the variety of public bodies we interact with on implementation.  We are not finding anyone who argues with universal design as a good idea but developing the guidance and toolkits they need to take it up is resource-intensive work.  That is where a little bit of extra resourcing would be very welcome.</p><p> We work hard on consulting with people with disabilities and their representative organisations in our work.  We take a varied approach to that.  Sometimes for specific projects, we might have an advisory group with membership from DPOs on it and sometimes we go out wide with public consultation on specific projects.  We take a varied approach but it is something we are working hard on improving over time.  Our "Participation Matters" guidelines, which launched last week, will offer a blueprint for us and for all public actors to improve in that space.</p><p> I will make a final point about data.  One of the challenges is getting accurate data from the census, not just about autism.  This also came up in another committee hearing around not having accurate numbers for wheelchair users.  The NDA would love to see a national disability survey carried out after the next census.  Anyone declaring they have a disability on the next census could be followed up with and asked a range of more detailed questions so we could capture specific conditions, barriers and challenges.  That was done back in 2006 but there has not been an opportunity to update that survey since then.  It is something we have had preliminary discussions with the CSO on.  We would welcome cross-Government support for a national disability survey after the next census.</p></speech>

Regarding Part M, at the present moment we are creating guidance to match the work being done by the Department on changing places and toilets.  Part M is being revised to included those.  However, we have been advocating and advising the Government, particularly the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that Part M needs to be revised specifically regarding domestic homes.  At present, Part M refers to "visitability", an unusual word in itself, whereas we talk about livability, meaning the homes need to be liveable in.  Visitability stipulates level access, an accessible toilet downstairs and access to one other room.  That is what it is within Part M, which is a bit short on what we are looking for.  ILMI is very exercised about this and is talking to the Department about getting Part M revised.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the cost of universal design.  Going back to Mr. Harris's point, if it is done at the very start universal design is invisible.  We go to the supermarket every weekend or whatever and walk through sliding doors.  We never even think about it but there is level access, car spaces right at the entrance to the shopping mall and accessible toilets within the shopping mall.  It is a negligible cost if designed at the start.  We are working on two projects at the moment - a cost-benefit analysis of universal design for homes and a cost assessment that breaks down the individual elements.  We have calculated that there are 659 different elements in the home that need to be designed or incorporated.  Of that, over 600 have no cost so we are down to around 50 elements where there is a cost element.  We are working through that at the moment.  We are working with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland SCSI and engaging with the Department.  The other project, the cost-benefit analysis, looks at the other long-term benefits of designing well from the start, such as cutting down on the cost of care and reducing the cost of medical supervision but also the issue of falls.  As we all know, particularly with the ageing population, people often fall in their own homes.  The reason for that is that they are designed poorly.  If we can get the design right at the start, there are huge savings.  That has been shown internationally.  We are in regular contact with the likes of the Norwegians, who are leaders in Europe on this.  The Japanese have been designing this in for 40 years, mainly because they are seen as the most aged population in the world.  We are making headway but, as everybody has said, we have some way yet to go.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for having me.  The questions Deputy Tully raised are valid.  ILMI has consulted its membership around accessibility in a number of areas, including the UNCRPD and Covid measures that were introduced into cities.  We also have a planning group and we have developed a document that covers principles of inclusive planning.  Before we look at Part M and the logistics of that, we need to look at planning issues.  There was talk of consultation.  In some cases, decisions are reached without any meaningful consultation with disabled people.  Consultation should be done directly through disabled persons' organisations at all levels - local, regional and national.  That is the simple answer to a very complex issue.  We know the built environment is not accessible but quite often disabled people find out too late about plans, so rather than inputting into the design at concept stage, disabled activists are reacting to planning decisions.  That is an issue as well.</p> <p>  In Ireland we seem to plan, design and build to minimum standards.  Often regulating creates barriers to more universal design ways of thinking.  Our members have highlighted that the Part M building regulations are weak and need to be reviewed.  We should be looking at minimum standards, not maximum standards.  They are simply not working for disabled people.  ILMI recommends that local authorities fully monitor the implementation of Part M when it is reviewed and we call strongly for it to be reviewed.  The other key element is that, as the representatives from the NDA have said, homes need to be wheelchair liveable.  We are in a housing crisis.  It is very difficult for disabled people to find houses that are accessible for us to actually live in.  It is one thing to give us the four walls but we need to be able to be genuinely included in our communities.  Accessibility plays a massive part in our lives.  It impacts on our spontaneity as disabled people.  That is important.  When we keep accessibility in mind at the design stage, we are actually designing for diversity, which reflects the society we live in and our intersectionality.</p></speech>

It is an honour to be here.  The autistic community is probably a lot further behind the blind community.  We take for granted all the advances with Braille, the beeping traffic lights and different advances in assistive technology.  Members of the blind community are therefore somewhat more able to go about their lives, have a meaningful life and participate properly.</p><p>For the autistic community, especially those who need a higher level of support, it is a lot more challenging.  Much of the time, people can tell a building is going to be challenging when they step into the foyer.  If they have a child, they will immediately know even from the acoustics coming back from inside that it is a no-go area.</p><p> It is great that we are having these discussions at this stage in terms of buildings being adapted.  I do not believe there has been enough research on what types of buildings are appropriate for people with autism, although I know a lot of research is going on at the moment.  Even the foyer of a building has to be a certain shape and size and has to have a certain acoustic standard for people to be comfortable enough to go into the building.  For example, if a child was brought to a pool, the pool echo can be heard from the front door and it is the most horrible building to go into, so they cannot even go there, and other public buildings such as busy train stations also have that type of environment.  As Mr. Harris said, there has to be a calm environment from the start and there has to be a channel to lead to another calm environment.  It is a real challenge for those with autism.</p><p> We can see how this works from the perspective of the blind community.  Who would have thought we would have braille, a system that people understand through a bump on a footpath that means something?  It is such an amazing system.  I can see Mr. Kenny is referring to his notes in braille.  It is amazing how it works and how people are able to read information from little packages.  It is also good how the EU has gotten behind the blind community and has supported them like this.  We are looking for the same support for the autistic community from the EU and from organisations like those represented here today.</p><p> It is great that we are having these discussions.  My colleague spoke about lack of consultation.  This is a great forum for consultation and we are delighted to hear from the witnesses and to have them come in.  I know Mr. Harris is probably sick of coming in here but it is great to have him.  The witnesses have such a wealth of knowledge.  Today, they are talking about something completely different from what they came in to talk to us about a few months ago, given we are talking today about building regulations.  They must have so many strings to their bows.  This is such an important conversation.</p><p> We are usually here talking about how, when people get into the building, the professional they are going to see has to have some sort of autism training.  Some organisations are doing great on that.  I have a friend who is a pilot and he said recently that all of his colleagues who work for Ryanair had to have autism training, which is great and would not have happened even five years ago.  They have to be super-aware of adults or individuals wearing lanyards.  He says that when he sees the lanyard, he is in a different mode and he is trained to be calmer and more facilitative of the person, which is great.</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Kenny.  Does RT&Eacute; have those audio description, AD, facilities which describe what is going on?  He can answer that at the end.</p><p> On a question for Dr. Hartney, as the Committee on Autism, we are very keen to have the Houses of the Oireachtas improved in terms of Leinster House being a building that is autism-friendly.  Has Dr. Hartney or, indeed, Mr. Harris, engaged with the Oireachtas or had any discussions with it?</p><p> We discussed a register.  Strong autism advocates would like to see an autism register.  They see how it worked for the cystic fibrosis, CF, community in that once there was a CF register, we were able to say there are X number of people with CF who need X amount of support.  Once the register was created, there was a big push to say that we need services or we need drugs.  I am not saying it is perfect for the CF community, as it is far from that, but it has given that community a lot more momentum by having a register.  It is a difficult discussion.  It is a hard question as to whether we should have an autism register or a general disability register, given they are very different.  Obviously, the adaptations that a person who is blind needs are different from those a person in a wheelchair or an autistic person needs.  That is a question that we need to answer.</p><p> I know the Co-Chairman's committee is doing a lot of work on the Changing Places toilets.  We are a total disgrace when it comes to Changing Places toilets.  We need to really up our game because it is so difficult for people with teenagers or young adults who need to be changed.  It is not fair.  It is just wrong.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is been great listening to all of the speakers.</p></speech>

I spoke to the Co-Chairman, Senator Carrigy, last week and we are awaiting contact from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission about that piece of work.  Some of that is about design.  It is important that the Committee on Autism hears directly from autistic people but, for many people, this could be quite an intimidating experience.  It is about giving people as much information as possible in advance so they know what to expect, such as having a calmer place to wait in or, for example, having a specific person to do the meet and greet when the person arrives.  We have a great template to work from.  The first building on this island or in the UK was Stormont, which was accredited by our colleagues in the National Autistic Society over ten years ago.  There is a very good template that we can bring here to ensure our Parliament building is autism-friendly.  That is obviously important for the work of the committee and I hope it will send an important message to other public services.</p> <p>  On the point in regard to the autism register, anything that enables us to have better statistics is worth exploring.  One of the concerns in the autism community around the concept of a register is, first, that it would need to be voluntary, but particularly the governance around any such register because, for most of the history of autism, it has been treated in a very medicalised way.  We want to ensure that the information on that register would not be used in such a way by researchers who want to do things to autistic people, who want to cure autistic people, as opposed to actually making the lives of autistic people better as they are.</p></speech>

The evolution of benefits for blind people over the decades has been slow.  It can be traced back to the Poor Law in 1840, when there were the blind, the deaf, the dumb and what were called the imbeciles.  We evolved from that charity model.  We have had decades of engagement with the community in the recent century to inculcate or have introduced systems and schemes that now look easy and seem to be easily achievable.</p> <p>  With regard to autism generally, I would say to Mr. Harris and the committee that we found, as a community of blind people, that for much of what we wanted to progress, we could better progress it through the European Blind Union, of which we were members, in the various consultative committees of the EU.  The regulations regarding web accessibility, medicines, procurement and issues relating to that all came out of those particular committees.  The autism community need to place themselves in the right place at the right time.  We all know it is good to say &ldquo;I spoke to the chairman&rdquo; and let people know we were talking in a higher place when telling somebody what is happening.  As they have spoken in Europe, and Europe is doing things, I believe we should use our MEPs more than we currently use them to prosecute potential legislation.</p> <p>  Blind people have advanced over the years and decades.  What I would like to do in some way is to share the piggybacking of our success with AsIAm and with the autism community so we can share some of that around our sensory needs.</p><p>I would be fearful that if we work in total isolation of our sensory requirements, I could go back some day and find the lift no longer talks to me, tells me what floor I am on or the doors are closing in order to meet a request that was made for a totally silent environment.  We can learn and pass on our learning to AsIAm and to Mr. Harris in all that.</p></speech>

It is more helpful to think about a collaborative and a shared approach than different groups pitting themselves against each other with their varying needs.  The beauty of a universal design approach is that it can accommodate the full range of experience.  On the question of a register, we would very much advocate that it should be for people to declare and decide whether they wished to declare they have a disability for themselves.  Many people wish to keep it private or do not consider they have a disability if the barriers in society have been successfully removed for them.  If we got to a universally designed world, we probably would not need these data-collection mechanisms.</p> <p>  We have not been approached to engage directly with the Oireachtas to make it an autism-friendly building, but we would be very open to doing so.  Dr. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Craddock might have some points to make regarding guidance we would have in that regard.  In our web accessibility directive monitoring nobody achieved compliance.  The Oireachtas website was one of the strongest performers we found in that first report and I congratulate it on that.  Does Dr. Fitzpatrick wish to make some points about acoustics?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.698" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#H00300"><p>Several speakers raised this interesting point.  Properly designed acoustics in a building very much benefit people with autism.  I am a totally blind person.  I navigate by using the cane.  Well-designed buildings with well-designed acoustics along with some tactile markings are also very beneficial.  Dr. Hartney made the point that what benefits one group of individuals often benefits a significant number of groups, which is why we go back to the whole notion of a universal design environment.  I will give one quick concrete example.  Airports can often be busy, especially over the summer.  The acoustics in many airports throughout the world actually make navigation problematic particularly when there is no tactile paving whatsoever.  As is clear from this morning's discussion, modifications to that space would clearly benefit me as a blind person and clearly benefit people with autism as well.  We need to look at this very much holistically taking into account the use needs of multiple groups of people.  Multiple different scenarios of use are very important.</p></speech>

There we will launch a CPD for architects.  One of the winners of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland universal design award was the Central Bank, just across the river from here.  We have been working very closely with it but also with many of its employees with different abilities.  We will launch an interactive e-learning module on 20 October, which could be very useful for the Oireachtas in addressing issues such as acoustics, which has been mentioned here several times, and navigation across the building from the car park right through to the various floors in the building.</p> <p>  The 2014 public procurement directive is now covered by a statutory instrument in Ireland, SI 284 of 2016.  All public procurement of parts and services that affect people need to include accessibility as mandatory.  We would highly recommend that that statutory instrument be implemented across government.  In America in 1991, President George Bush sr. signed the Americans with Disability Act into law.  That legislation was a turning point in making products and services accessible in America.  It is the reason many of the products developed by Microsoft, Google and others are much more accessible than any products designed in Europe.  The committee should advocate that SI 284 be implemented across government and local authorities.</p></speech>

As a person who has full faculties, I understand there are some issues but I do not have the lived experience of people.  I had the pleasure of knowing Dermot Walsh who was an advocate for independent living.  He worked full time with Dublin Bus advocating for disabled access for transport.  Is there somebody there who took his place?  Is there an advocate for disabled people in Dublin Bus and in the transport area?</p> <p>  I take on board the point that Mr. Kenny made about the structures that were put in place during the Covid pandemic, particularly for cycle lanes and traffic islands.  I have heard Gary Kearney frequently mention how dangerous they are for disabled people.  How important would it be that the ringing or noise levels would go up on buses as they slow down to 20 km/h and below?  From the point of view of cyclists, e-scooters are causing major problems.  They can put people with disabilities in a very difficult and potentially dangerous situation with the risk of getting seriously hurt.</p> <p>  Do local authorities consult with the National Disability Authority on planning regulations?  Part M seems to be very loosely based on visitation rather than liveable accommodation.  What does the National Disability Authority want us to do to get that revised to the extent that the NTA and other disability groups can have an impact?  </p> <p>  Regarding AsIAm, autism is a relatively new disability that is being grasped in communities and nationally.  Could AsIAm link in with the NDA?  Different disability groups, such as those who are blind or disabled, have autism or use a wheelchair, all have certain specific needs relating to their disability.  If everything is thrown in together, the voices of different groups can get lost.  Having strong groups like AsIAm and other groups is really important from the point of view of getting their experiences across to the NDA.</p> <p>  The NDA has referred to the implementation in public buildings and public areas.  Does it have the staffing levels to have an impact?  What levels of staffing would it need?  What experience and level of education would be needed for that sort of thing?  We need not just guidelines but statutory instruments in the planning process.</p><p>We know that builders will not adhere to many of the guidelines.  I will leave it at that and ask the witnesses for their feedback.  What do they want this committee to do and how can we work with them on these issues?</p></speech>

I want to compliment the Houses of the Oireachtas for moving quickly on representations made to it.  The ILMI made a presentation in the audiovisual room two weeks ago but we found it inaccessible for speakers who use wheelchairs.  This was brought to the attention of those in charge of the workings of the Oireachtas and it will be remedied immediately.  Inaccessibility is often not discovered because we have not been to a place but as we go to more places, people realise that something needs to be done.</p> <p>  On the NTA and our good colleagues at Dublin Bus, the former Minister for Transport, Shane Ross, made it a requirement that a disabled person be on the boards of Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the NTA and CI&Eacute;.  I am a member of the board of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII and at the moment we are looking improving the toilet facilities at all motorway service stations so that there are accessible changing rooms in those service stations.  </p> <p>  Being involved and engaged is the way forward.  One thing this committee could do is to encourage local councillors and local authorities to engage.  Members of this committee are committed to these issues but at local authority level, what one often sees is enthusiasm in pursuing things like cycling facilities, which is fair and right, but the enthusiasts want minimum regulation.  On a pedestrianised street like Grafton Street, for example, those who want to bring a bicycle or a scooter should walk.  There should be an insistence that what is pedestrianised is for pedestrians.  Not all cyclists adhere to the rules.  We would like to see the Oireachtas committee on transport, for example, give consideration to issues affecting people who are less mobile and that includes children.  A more collaborative approach is needed.  When we were working at European level, we looked at ease of mobility in the context of ramps for older people and people pushing prams and buggies.  The focus was not solely on providing facilities for people with disabilities but on universal design, as was mentioned by Dr. Hartney, Dr. Craddock and Dr. Fitzpatrick.  The aim is to include everybody.</p> <p>  Finally, on the Deputy's question about RT&Eacute;, that organisation is living up to its commitment to provide a number of programmes with audio description, mostly on RT&Eacute; Junior.  I was delighted recently to get a copy of "Kiva Can Do" as my grandson voices some of the character parts in it.  If the Deputy has 15 minutes to spare, she should look at "Kiva Can Do", which has audio description on it.  That is a good way to introduce audio description to a younger population who are not disabled.</p></speech>

On local authorities and guidance on how to improve performance in public buildings, one of the projects we have under way at the moment is the development of a code of practice for accessible public buildings.  In our process to develop that we are taking a very consultative approach, which speaks to some of the points the Deputy made about how to encompass the full range of experience without diminishing the needs of individual groups.  The code of practice will talk about how to maximise accessibility and then it will be broken down into what might be necessary for people with autism or for people with visual impairment, for example, on making sure Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpreters are available for those who are deaf and so on.  It will provide some guidance for the individual requirements but also talk about accessibility as a universal concept.  That is just one example of how we approach it.</p> <p>  Local authorities do not tend to come directly to us but what we do is make submissions to, and offer advice on, the local development plans when they come up for consultation.  We are always available to offer advice.  In terms of the staffing competencies we need to deliver on that advice, when the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design was established 17 years ago, it was established with Dr. Craddock as the chief officer, with three advisers underneath him.  It has not expanded since then.  The centre has done significant work in promoting an awareness of the concept of universal design and the fact that we are talking about it here today is testament to that.  What is needed to turn the concept into implementation is technical guidance on how to break that down in the various domain areas.  We would need technical competency in architecture and built environment skills as well as in areas such as ICT, such as what Dr. Fitzpatrick brings to the table, communications and product design.  The aim is to build that so we can work with more bodies to help them on their implementation journey.  That is what is required but we are not an enforcement body.  We are an advisory body and our key strength is offering guidance that is grounded in practical and evidence-based research.</p></speech>

We link quite regularly with the NDA through its various consultation processes.  I want to compliment the authority on the new consultation guidelines that were published last week.  A huge amount of time was spent engaging with our community, with autistic young people, around what those guidelines should look like.  That bodes well for the future and the ongoing conversations we will be having around some of these topics.</p></speech>

The big issue for me is that every single parent I know who has a child with autism seems to have to run an individual campaign to fight for his or her child's rights.  That is why I am a member of this committee but I want to listen to the people who have a lot more experience and hear from them what we need to do to help.  At the end of the day, I do not have any personal experience in this area.  I have friends who have children with autism but all of them seem to have to fight individual battles.  It is just insane.  We need to find a uniform way of helping and I am glad that we have this committee.  I must commend the Chairman on creating this committee so that we can focus on finding some sort of system to support the people who need it.  In that sense, I would rather listen to the experts we have here today.</p></speech>

In this committee we have tried to foreground the social model understanding of disability.  That is relevant to this discussion as we can see how poorly designed systems create barriers.  While many of the issues we deal with come down to a lack of public services or personal assistance, today we are examining matters that could be resolved through good and inclusive design.  I was struck by the numerous examples that Mr. Kenny gave of accessibility, which was very impactful.</p> <p>  My question is for the ILMI and AsIAm.  As disabled persons' organisations, DPOs, what is their level of engagement with Government Departments and public bodies in the development of policies, practices and laws that impact their members?  Article 4 of the UNCRPD requires engagement on legislation and policies relating to persons with disabilities, but from all I have heard, this is rarely adhered to.</p><p>When it came to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, the most alarming parts of the legislation arose from non-consultations with designated public officials, DPOs, and people directly affected.  I understand Article 4 should extend to all areas, such as transport infrastructure, involving Transport Infrastructure Ireland working with our guests in developing requirements for public transport vehicles, or for all State bodies to seek input in making websites fully accessible.  Are Departments and public bodies engaging with these groups?  In relation to that, what is their capacity as organisations to carry out that kind of work and what type of no-strings-attached funding and support should the Government be giving these organisations to allow them to operate independently and to fulfil all those roles?  So many of the issues discussed today could be avoided if the State complied with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#K00300"><p>I will focus on what Senator Garvey was saying on what we would call the human interest-framed stories.  This is something that ties in with my own academic background research.  While I am a disabled person, my background is in journalism and political communication, which I have been able to bring into my voluntary work.  To remind people, I am not a staff member.  I am a volunteer activist who has other commitments on top of what I do in my spare time.</p> <p>  On the human interest stories and how often disabled people or autistic people are framed in the media, there has been a trajectory of human interest stories and emotively framed stories.  As it happens, recently I published an open-source academic article.  While it is not particularly relevant to what Senator Garvey is asking about, it is entitled, "How 'cocooning' as a public health measure was reported during the Covid-19 crisis" in Ireland throughout 2020.  While I accept it is a niche study, I found some interesting trends, some of which were not surprising to me, in that cocooning, let us say, as a public health measure, was very much reported on as a human interest emotive feature.  Of the sample of coverage that I analysed, I found that there was four times the number of human interest-framed stories than reports that I deemed to be particularly informative.  Consequently, we have a trajectory of people feeling that they needed to share their private lives, as I did last year in relation PhD scholarships, to bring about some kind of awareness.  It is not a sustainable model of advocacy, both in my personal and academic opinion.</p> <p>  It is not that I want to vilify newsmakers either but there is also research which was conducted in Ireland recently that shows that newsmakers, a term which includes editors, journalists and news executives, know that interviewing an autistic person, a parent of an autistic child or a disabled person and constructing a story like that is the type of story that is low in cost.  Getting someone to tell his or her story is a low-resource form of reporting and typically gets engagement because it invokes a sense of emotion.  While personal stories are important, I would be curious, perhaps after my current research project, and interested in a subject I invite others to consider, namely, the effects of private citizens sharing their personal stories in the media.  Research shows that when people share their personal stories in the media, it contributes to action by Government.  In terms of the audiences who engage with those stories, research proves that it shifts attitudes from an individual issue to a wider social, political or cultural issue.  It can be effective but at what cost?</p> <p>  Bringing it back to my opening statement on people having the right to live with privacy, dignity and discretion, for disabled people, and possibly for autistic people - I might ask Mr. Harris to chip in on that - that is a privilege I have not enjoyed, even before the PhD issue that I had.</p> <p>  Lastly, while joint committees obviously cannot influence how journalists and section editors do their jobs, the media is so important because we get mediated messages through the media.  That is how we know what was happening in the budget this week.  It is where we got our information on anything to do with Covid over the past couple of years.  While the sample of coverage in my research was not deemed to be particular informative in terms of information-rich reporting on cocooning, I would welcome people taking a read of that article.  It is publicly available.</p> <p>  It is worth considering Government communication strategies because journalists and media people such as me can only work on what is available.  If certain Departments or Ministers are not prioritised behind the scenes in the Government communications strategy on any given issue, they will not have the platform to be able to come out to speak on these platforms.  That is why political communication is important.  It includes the media sphere, the political sphere and also us as a public.</p> <p>  Sorry, I meant to keep it briefer than that but it is something I am particularly interested in.  We need to consider the harm caused by private people, who have other things to do in their days and weeks, and lives, coming out.  I do not believe it is sustainable, although I understand why it happens.  I understand why people feel they need to come out because I myself have had to do it.  I understand why it happens, but maybe another committee meeting might consider how we raise issues, particularly, maybe, for people who are not involved in, aware of or a member of DPOs.</p></speech>

In other instances, we see less engagement.  What that partially comes to is that ongoing dance between the desire to centralise and have a strong centralised disability policy on the one hand and every Department realising this is still for everybody as well on the other .  We need space to strategically think about disability but it is a job for every Department as well under the UNCRPD.  That is very much a culture piece that still needs to be worked on.</p> <p>  The other concern I have is that often consultations are not accessible.  That is why these new NDA guidelines are important.  I have been at round-table discussions on autism in loud rooms with no quiet space with minimal information in advance and that does not get the best out of everyone.  Not only that, it does not show respect for the people who are coming to offer their expertise.</p> <p>  What we have to think about is that disabled people are very often called on to be consulted frequently.  Not everybody within the disability community is interested in getting or has the capacity to get involved in these issues.  It is often a small cohort of volunteer advocates who are being invited to a huge amount of meetings.</p><p>We need to think more about how we can resource and support people to do that.  The reality is that many people within our community are still living on a disability allowance that, even after the increase in the budget, is offensive.  It is not possible to live a decent life on it.  When people are being asked to travel long distances, there is an expense aspect to that that needs to be considered as well.</p><p> In respect of our own organisation and where we struggle a little, we have one policy officer and we get approximately half of that person's salary contributed.  That is the sole resourcing we have for our policy work.  Every year we have our own work plan.  For example, this year we are preparing a report on access to education in autism, looking specifically at suspension, expulsion and reduced timetables.  One of the challenges is that we also have to respond to whatever pops up on the news, such as the issues with schools and CAMHS that arose during the summer.  We also get sudden surprises from an Oireachtas committee or a Department wanting to consult with us.  All of those opportunities are very welcome, but with one person they are very hard to manage.  That is a challenge.</p><p> On the point that Ms Gallagher asked me to chip in on, I very much agree with everything that she said.  I will definitely read the paper.  For us, the depiction of autistic people in the media is an ongoing challenge.  Sometimes it can be really positive, and we even see positive shifts in popular culture.  I can even point to the fact that the Thomas the Tank Engine "Thomas &amp;amp; Friends" series will soon feature an autistic train called Bruno the Brake Car, actually voiced by a nine-year-old autistic boy in the UK.  These sorts of initiatives are important.  However, when we look at the media every week we are told that there is a new cause for autism or read some sensational headline.  Very negative language can be used about autism at times, which does stigmatise and damage.  There is a need to have more media education.  I think that is most important.</p></speech>

It is an opportunity to actually talk about the UNCRPD implementation plan.  We have all heard about the UNCRPD, but in respect of its implementation, any implementation plan needs to be in line with the SMART policy framework, whereby our policies need to be strategic, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.  It is a policy framework that a lot of the DPOs, through the DPO network, work together on.  That SMART framework allows us to look at how the policies should be strategic and measurable.  The NDIS, for example, is a very broad policy with lots of actions and themes.  It is really important that we go back to looking at how our policies can be SMART in their implementation.  The framework can align really well with the articles of the UNCRPD, and thematically be sorted to fit in with all our intersectionalities as well.  It is important that Deputy Cairns raised the issue, because our policies need to align with the articles of the UNCRPD.  We must be SMART in our approach.</p></speech>

We participate in consultative processes, and as Mr. Harris said, some of us travel distances, at some expense, to do so.  Meetings are also held during working hours, and if you are fortunate enough to have a job as a disabled person, your employer does not take too lightly to you taking time off.  I know we have to look for an answer to the Deputy's question.  The resourcing of DPOs has to be seen as an integral part of the way forward.  We spend nearly &euro;2 billion on service provision that has been analysed to the nth degree in terms of value for money in different reports over the decades.  It does not change.  The language around separation changes.  I may get into some trouble for saying this, but we have what I would call an industry around disability that continues, by accident, to create a dependency on it, rather than liberating us through they type of things we have been talking about today.  It can happen by accident that somehow or other the liberation that has been won gets accidentally sidetracked into other areas by campaigning parents who rightly cry out loud because of neglect.  It is appalling that the media should be used, because of the ineptitude of people responding or people who are deliberately deaf to what is going on, to shift the dial to a point where there could be perception that segregated education is best for all disabled people, and not specifically one set of disabled people.  It took decades to get the Department of Education to agree that children with disabilities should be educated in their local schools, rather than in St. Mary's, Baldoyle, the Central Remedial Clinic or St. Joseph's School for the Blind.  There is a danger that somehow, in the rightful arguing for a special place for children who might have autism, that could be swept up by planners who are not thinking or consulting, into a generality that segregated education is where people should go.  Support for segregated education shifts could also mean that in the case of my grandson, for example, who has Down's syndrome, the speech therapy services he has access to in going to an inclusive school will be taken away, and his family will have to find the funds to pay for the therapy.  The rightful response to the neglect and huge policy deficits has swept everything away along with it.  There is an accidental shift behind it.</p></speech>

My question comes from personal lived experience.  I went on a personal journey as a parent and a carer.  Due to the fact that my son had an unusual medical condition, we, as a family, did not belong to any grouping, as it were, for example, Down's syndrome or cerebral palsy.  I only have knowledge of our own journey and the challenges that confronted my son.  It is only since I was elected that I have become more aware of the broader concerns within our community.  I have met a number of DPOs thus far.  It is becoming clearer to me that those who lead and drive the DPOs, including the spokespersons and the people who are most visible, need to be from the disability community.  How do we support the DPOs as a committee?  How do we ensure that we get to the point - and this is something that I feel very passionate about - where these issues are not led by service providers?  A representative of one of the DPOs told me that having the service providers represent the interests of disabled persons is like having employers' groups, such as IBEC, representing workers at the Labour Court.  Workers do not want to be represented by employers' groups; they want to be represented by trade unions and have their own voices.  That is my interpretation, by way of a clumsy analogy, insofar as I can read myself into the situation.  How can we support DPOs to be front and centre?  I know from some of my meetings that funding seems to be a core issue.  There needs to be a great deal of financial support provided.  I imagine that will be part of the response.</p><p>I congratulate Des Kenny on a great article in <i>The Irish Times </i>this week.  I am just sorry that it was in the health section.  It should have been in the main part of the newspaper.  I also congratulate Catherine Gallagher and thank her for her contribution this morning.</p></speech>

We are conscious that there many people who do not wish to belong to a DPO or who do not have a DPO for the particular disability with which they are concerned.  Our advice and practice is to try to cast the net as widely as possible, in addition to consulting with DPOs, because it is important to capture as many perspectives as possible in order that they can inform the advice we give to Government or the guidance we develop.  We agree that the funding model needs to be examined.  I understand that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is looking at that now as part of a development of a longer-term UNCRPD implementation strategy.</p></speech>

In some way, Aideen Hartney touched on it.  There are go-to organisations for the blind and the deaf and the wheelchair user.  This committee, going forward, could insist that all of those organisations - a bit like the two Houses of the Oireachtas - create their own senate of people with disabilities within those organisations to whom they can commit time and State resources, which they receive in copious amounts, to creating that voice for a disability and then we can look to sweep that disability classification up into a generality of the DPOs.  Separate organisations would ultimately amalgamate into DPOs.  The Independent Living Movement Ireland is a cross-disability DPO.  That is the way it has to go forward.  There is a commonality of need and remedy that we could be wastefully dissipating if we do not, first of all, look for the segregation of organisations into creating a voice for their disabled service users and then amalgamating that into DPOs.   That is frightfully important.</p></speech>

Covid is always on my brain, unfortunately, because of what I research.  Covid is still very much with us but there will come a time where we will enter a post-Covid society and country.  In times of crisis and after times of crisis, history tells us that it is an opportunity to lay down a new foundation of how we want to live, treat people and work.  Even the fact that I am here tuning in remotely might not have been possible before.</p> <p>  We hear terms such as work-life balance.  Disabled people have been calling for remote working for a very long time.  It was only when everyone, overnight, was in a collective global crisis that accessibility was granted to everybody.  I know there were challenges in an online world and it does not work for everybody but accessibility can benefit everyone and it is all our interest.</p> <p>  Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, is an example of a cross-impairment DPO.  I have known people in ILMI and other DPOs I am involved in for the past two or three years and I have no clue of what those friends' conditions are, because we talk of the collective experience of being disabled.  I am physically disabled but I am not a wheelchair user.  However, I often have concerns that would be similar to those a wheelchair user would experience.  Similar points were made about acoustics and sound.  As my impairment affects my balance, I find it harder to concentrate going through crowds when it is very loud or if it is too bright or too dark.  With regard to supporting DPOs, it is important to have us involved at every stage of every process and mot just in the middle and not just at the end.  We should be front and centre and, as Senator Clonan was saying, told from the beginning and involved from the brainstorming sessions.</p> <p>  There is a point that I make when it comes to engagement.  A dialogic form of communication should be used whereby DPOs and ordinary private citizens in who might not be attached to an organisation are brought in to communicate and a safe, accessible and close environment is created where people feel that they can contribute.  Disabled people are part of a community we can see has had a history of belonging, unfortunately, to the spiral of silence.  This idea comes up in the social sciences of this idea there are multiple examples in that people identify with belonging to a community that has been oppressed and discriminated against and has not been listened to.  There is a history there with disabled and autistic people.  It is a history that hurts.</p> <p>  If I was to sit and think about it for long enough and how, unfortunately, parts of history are still with us, it would be incredibly upsetting.  Disabled people and DPOs should be front and centre at every stage.  It is not just about just.  Disabled people should be hired.  The members' should hire disabled people in their parties and areas of work.  We should be hired.</p> <p>  I do not want to single out or vilify anyone or go on a witch-hunt but I see a considerable amount of information online published by political parties and politicians without captions or screenshots of budget information without alt text.  Maybe if they had a disabled person on their team who had a qualification in communications, that person would be more than able to point that out and capable of pointing that out, without having to think about it for too long.</p> <p>  We are very much here.  Of course there are difficulties with us entering the work force and that is a conversation for another day but we are very much here.  Whether it is DPOs as organisations or disabled people as potential workers or collaborators, there is a talent pool.  I always say is that if one has an organisation - not necessarily one that looks at disabled issues - or decides to create a communications or engineering organisation or business, having disabled people with qualifications in roles in communications, business, finance, education, sustainability and management in that organisation would put many people out of a job.</p><p>It involves being able to think outside the box.  Unfortunately, based on my experience as an early career academic, I feel people do not see me as competition - not that I am a particularly combative personality.  It is important to bear in mind that disabled people are part of the talent pool and if you are not tapping into disabled people, you are not tapping into the full complement of the talent pool.</p></speech>

We all know that DPOs are led by and are for disabled people.  There are specifics there around 4.3.29B and general comment 7 of the UNCRPD.  It is really important to state that our communities can amplify the work of DPOs.  If we look at the personal assistant service, we can see it is still not a legal right in Ireland for disabled people.  Sometimes there is a misconception that this is just an issue for disabled people.  It is not.  It is a human rights and equality issue.  We need to make sure we can mobilise our communities to ensure that they are bringing issues like personal assistant services and inaccessible housing and transport to our Deputies and councillors all the way from the grassroots up to national level and back down again.  This is how we will see movement in rights and services that allow disabled people to have choice and control over their lives.  Regarding when we see allies coming along to amplify those issues, for example, if Deputies and Senators could go back to the Minister and say the personal assistant service is one that allows disabled people to have choice and control over their lives from a human rights perspective.  It is really important that we state that people can amplify the work of DPOs while we are doing that led by lived experience as well.  We would be happy to engage with allies who would love to work to progress this and other issues as a human rights and equality issue.  It is a great question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#N00300"><p>I probably touched on some of the challenges around funding a moment ago.  I will focus on capacity building, which is particularly important.  The reality for autistic people is that they must advocate on two dimensions all the time.  They are all constantly engaged in battles just for own lives, services and supports.  At the same time, there is the broader, more collective effort concerning shifting policy and consultation.  There are many autistic young people.  One of the realities is that from a young age, autistic people are not being given the tools to articulate what their needs are and to understand their needs not as a nuisance or difficulty but a need they have a right to have met.  A lot of work must be done starting with very young people around giving them a positive self-identity.  This in turn will lead them to feel more confident and assertive around their rights and set them up better around the engagement with DPOs.  As people grow up, more needs to be done to train and support autistic people around engaging in self-advocacy.  When people and DPOs are engaged in consultations, part of how we make sure it is not tokenistic is by making sure there is support there that can support and facilitate people's participation through the process.</p></speech>

I was speaking in the D&aacute;il so I had to chase out so if I ask a question that has already been asked, please let me know.  We are told the obligations and duties of public bodies are clear.  They are fairly simple and straightforward.  There are common things that people get wrong.  How easy would it be to deal with some of the more common and straightforward ones?  In that context, how can the witnesses be both proactive and reactive?  Perhaps somebody needs a certain amount of assistance or guidance.  Not everybody knows about Web design.  I would put myself at the top of that list.  What is the witnesses' role in being proactive as well as reactive?  What sanctions are there, if any, particularly for repeat offenders?</p> <p>  My next question is for the witnesses from Independent Living Movement Ireland.  I support what Senator Clonan said about DPOs 100%.  He said it - I do not need to repeat it - but that is a crucial point.  They must be independent.  "Nothing about us without us" is a phrase that trips off all our tongues but that is the reality of having DPOs.  That is their job.  That is what they do.  My specific question concerns cycling and the promotion of cycling, which was mentioned.  Many people like to cycle.  It is good for their health, etc., but it does present a challenge for visually impaired, blind and older people who are no longer as nimble on their feet as they once were.  Have there been any talks taken place between Independent Living Movement Ireland and organisations that promote cycling?  Is there any way we can begin to find solutions before the problem just blows up?  We have already seen it between car drivers and cyclists.  We all share a common space and must find ways to make it work.  Is anything happening in this space?  </p> <p>  I will address my next question to Mr. Cawley.  In other countries, people are taking a human rights approach to this.  Could he briefly outline some of that.  My next question is addressed to Mr. Harris.  I was impressed by his candour when he spoke about the fact that accommodation and adjustment for people with autism cannot be codified in the same way as physical adjustments, etc., and that needs can vary and sometimes even conflict.  That is just the reality.  Can Mr. Harris elaborate on that?  Am I asking too much when I ask whether there are common denominators?  Are there things that can be put in place that might not work for everybody all the time but begin that journey?</p></speech>

Dr. Fitzpatrick will then speak about the European Accessibility Act, sanctions and penalties.</p> <p>  The NDA monitors compliance but at the same time, we engage extensively with public bodies to guide and offer suggestions as to how their performance can be improved.  That is where our practical guidance and technical know how come in.  We are not just naming and shaming.  We are engaging to bring people along on a journey of constant quality improvement.  Dr. Craddock will talk about the specifics of the web accessibility directive and the common errors there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.727" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gerald Craddock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#N00600"><p>I thank Deputy Harkin for her questions.  We took over the role of national monitoring centre for the web accessibility directive in January 2021.  Last year, we monitored over 300 websites on a weekly basis.  In-depth monitoring of 56 websites, including mobile applications, showed that common errors include colour contrast.  It is a significant issue.</p><p>We found that on more than 70% of the websites we monitor, or in the region of 150,000 to 200,000 pages weekly, colour contrast is a significant issue.  PDFs are the bane of many people's lives, particularly those with disabilities, for whom they are a significant problem.  Online forms and form-filling are also a significant barrier for many people, not only in terms of the language used but also their accessibility and usability.</p><p> As part of the proactive approach, we work closely with the Irish Computer Society.  Last year, we ran ten online training programmes.  We can send members a link to those if they would like to try them out.  They are approximately one hour long and kind of lunch-and-learn sessions.  We had more than 1,000 public officials engaged on the training last year.  We are being proactive on that.</p><p> On cycling, we have made progress as a nation.  We started off by having spaces that were shared between pedestrians and cyclists.  Since then, we have learned, particularly from looking at Denmark in recent years, that cyclists need to be segregated from pedestrians and a physical barrier between them created.  The physical space we have in cities is very restricted for what we are trying to implement in terms of having preference for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.  We have been working closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Gary Kearney has been mentioned several times at the committee.  He is very much the eyes and ears in terms of what is happening in Dublin, anyone who has engaged with him will now.  Probably the best practice we have seen is out of San Francisco.  We have engaged with the NTA on looking at some of the designs.  In particular, the issue of getting to the kerb, which came up earlier, is significant not only for people with disabilities, but also for older people and children.  I traverse a very crowded area every morning to get to public transport and I see the major difficulties in that regard.  There is work to be done.  We are looking at best practice internationally on that and engaging on it regularly not only with the NTA but also with other key stakeholders.  Cyclists are very much part of those discussions because it is pointless talking about the pedestrian space unless you are talking to cyclists. </p><p> I will hand over to Dr. Fitzpatrick to discuss sanctions, particularly under the European Accessibility Act which is upon us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#O00200"><p>I thank Dr. Craddock.  The European Accessibility Act is currently undergoing transposition activities.  It is a European directive that aims to provide a much more homogenised approach, or to resolve diversification and divergent accessibility standards across nation states and bring everything into one market with the objective of creating more widely available accessible products and services for people with disabilities and also affording businesses and organisations the facility to sell their products and services into a larger market.  As noted, there are sanctions as part of the Act.  They are not seen as the only solution but very much as an aid to inform and penalise under-performing organisations.  The Act is clear that the sanctions need to be proportionate, and designed in such a way that they are not seen as an alternative by companies that decide they do not want to make a product or service accessible and will just pay the fine or take the hit.  It is important to realise that, in any kind of accessible design, mindset is the key to making something accessible.  If one can get across to the organisations that are providing services, designing services or products or manufacturing products that if they make the product or service accessible, that will greatly increase their market share, in addition to them having the moral obligation to do so, it plays to the strengths of organisations.  The sanctions are in place and play a part but it is equally important to get that mindset right.  There is a lot of cross-government and cross-departmental work, led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, on this topic to identify appropriate sanctions and penalties and also to give appropriate guidance to organisations on how to make their products and services accessible and how to conform with the requirements of the Act, which will start to come into force in June 2025.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.730" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Desmond Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#O00300"><p>We are a light-touch society when it comes to regulations and sanctions.  Dr. Craddock mentioned the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, in America.  It has sanctions such that if one does not do as obliged under the Act, one can end up in court.  The committee should seek to have introduced the protocol to the UNCRPD that was not included in Ireland's ratification of it.  If that protocol were in place, we would be talking about actions that people can take as individuals for infringement of their rights rather than having to go and have them mitigated through charities or your good selves on the committee or the NDA.  We have to work on the basis that what has come forward through the UNCRPD are individual rights that have to be delivered to each individual, and each individual has a right of recourse including having sanctions imposed on those who do not adhere to their obligations.  It should not be a light touch or do it when you get around to it approach.  It should be done because that is what you have to do and if you do not, there will be sanctions.</p> <p>  It is very difficult to engage with the cyclist lobby because the cyclist, at present, is an enthusiast.  They are like ourselves.  Cyclists are advocates of something that has been denied to them.  They are a lost population of people who felt victimised by motorists or whoever else in the past.  The freedom they are now trying to win for the bicycle as a means of transport is all-important to them.  Nobody wants to listen to the difficulties.  The NDA can talk to the NTA about a cycling code and point out that shared space is difficult, but planners in the various local authorities will then decide that they cannot stop cyclists at bus stops because that would be too dangerous, so they will let the cyclists go through the bus stop, as it were.  Those getting off the bus then have to rely on the goodwill and learning of individual cyclists.  Let us not forget that this is a new discipline for people, particularly young people, in terms of knowing when to give way to a pedestrian.  The Minister is in no way interested in sanctions for cyclists.  He will not penalise them in any way, no matter what representations are made to him on those who are invading pedestrianised spaces.  Whatever about moving cars off the streets, moving pedestrians off the streets is a totally different matter.  Many people turn a blind eye to it and do not consider it to be something that should be sanctioned.  It can be sanctioned.  If one does it in other countries, one's bicycle will be confiscated and one will have to go to a police station to reclaim it.  That is how they identify those cycling in areas reserved for pedestrians.  We may have to do something like that in this country.  </p> <p>  May I make a final comment regarding the employment of disabled people?  The NDA gave a good example of practice in the context of the number of people with disabilities who are employed.  There are 40,000 people employed in the sector looking after disabled people.  As all of those organisations see each of their coterie of clients as specific to themselves, their employment ratio of disabled people is phenomenally low.  In the context of their employment of disabled people, a 6% quota should be imposed on organisations that are receiving statutory funding.</p><p>Such organisations should look beyond their disability coterie, where somebody working in the area of residential intellectual disability would employ somebody with autism or whatever to carry out the jobs that can be done by other disabled people.  Somebody with an intellectual disability can do less arduous jobs in an organisation such as the Irish Wheelchair Association.  We have got to open that up as an employment opportunity for disabled people.  We cannot look to others all the time to do things for us.  We have the answer to many of the questions ourselves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#P00200"><p>The point around codification, and even contradiction or conflict, is very interesting.  It is important to say that while the needs of every autistic person will be different, the domains we need to consider from a design point of view will very often be common or shared.  There are some instances where the needs will contradict but not necessarily conflict, which is an important point to make.  We are trying to create an environment that is as supportive a canvas as possible for an autistic person whatever his or her needs might be.</p> <p>  It is also about empowering the individual to make choices.  If people know what an environment is like, they then have the ability to apply additional tools in order to make that environment more manageable for them.  For example, if a very calm environment is created, an autistic person who needs additional stimulation can then, if that individual knows in advance, choose to bring headphones that have music playing to help them to navigate that environment.  People will have heard of personal protective equipment, PPE, during the pandemic.  Very often, people have sensory PPE that they need to use on a day-to-day basis.  If they know about the environment and are empowered to use that sensory PPE in advance, that can go a long way.</p> <p>  We should think about some of the domains within the aspects framework I mentioned, for example, escape space.  The reality is that if an escape space is created within the environment, one autistic person might use it because lighting has become overwhelming for that individual.  Another autistic person might use it because of certain smells in the environment and another because they have spent too much time talking to an individual.  If we think about safety, certain safety considerations can be important for an autistic person.  By putting them generally in place, a person who does not have that safety concern will not be disadvantaged in any way.  To respond to Dr. Craddock's point, it is more about putting in place a mindset around how we think about design as opposed to it having to be a one-size-fits-all model.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.734" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#P00400"><p>I thank the witnesses.  I was struck by what Mr. Harris said in his introduction about being equal, valued and accepted, and the use of the words "accessible" and "inclusive".  That applies across all disabilities and it is what we have to strive for.  Both committees have to make sure the Government puts the funding in place and makes changes to ensure we have a society like that.  There was a significant increase in the disability budget to &euro;2.4 million yesterday, which I welcome, but it is still not enough.  For parents on waiting lists for assessments of needs, in particular, an extra &euro;39 million has been set aside to try to clear the backlog of thousands of children throughout the country who are still waiting for such an assessment.</p> <p>  There have been changes.  Supermarkets now have a two-hour slot where the light is dimmed and the audio is down.  A lot of changes have been made but one issue I have found, and I have written to every local authority about it, is the fact we do not have any hidden disability car parking places.  We have disability car parking places, for which there must be a badge on the car, but there is none for hidden disability.  Something that I would like to push on is that every local authority, when putting in new parking places, would place them adjacent to a disability space for parents, beside a supermarket or whatever.  That is something that needs to be put in place.  We have made moves on this with regard to Leinster House.  I spoke to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il in the past week.  Sometimes, things can move very slowly within the Government so we want to speed that up and implement it over the next number of weeks.  When witnesses come to our committee and to Leinster House, some of whom are autistic persons, it is important that it should be in place.  We are ten years behind Stormont.  That is not acceptable.</p> <p>  I welcome the DCU project.  I look forward to seeing that rolled out throughout the country and across all third level institutions.  Many advances have been made and funding has been put in place by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science as regards putting in sensory rooms and making our third level colleges more accessible for young autistic persons.  Work on 20 autism-friendly towns was mentioned.  We should put funding in place to make sure that every town in the country is an autism- and disability-friendly town.  That is a minimum.</p> <p>  I have a couple of points and questions.  I apologise if I am going on too long.  Mr. Kenny mentioned EVs.  I am a father of young children and the sound of EVs and, in particular, not being able to hear them, is an issue.  I ask for a comment on that.  On the census, I firmly believe we need to change the form so we can future-proof our need for services.  We have an issue at present regarding our children's disability network teams, where we do not have a significant number of professionals, such as occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, coming through our system.  That is the fault of the HSE.  It is not future-proofing the supply of professionals we need across those teams to provide services for children.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that the NDA is the only organisation of its kind in the world.  In the NDA's interaction with the Government and implementation of what it proposes, where are the blockages for it not being implemented?</p> <p>  I have a question on housing for Mr. Cawley, my fellow proud Longfordian, who I have known for a long number of years and who is a very strong advocate.  We spoke about local authorities building houses.  Are we building houses that are accessible?  Do they have level-access showers downstairs and so on?  It is not happening enough.  We have to put significant funding in place to adapt houses at a later date.  If level-access showers were put into every single house, we would not have to adapt houses at a later stage.  I ask for comments on those points.</p></speech>

The regulation regarding sound - the acoustic vehicle alerting system, AVAS - was explored through a combined study in America and the EU involving the big motoring manufacturers in order to come up with a sound that did not sound like something from outer space, but had the right type of pitch and sound.  It was hoped that it would not be something that people with autism would find difficult but would be such that it would alert them to the movement of the car when the car was travelling below 20 km per hour.  This was on the basis that if it was faster, they would hear the tyres of the car.  In addition, that system was to be designed in such a way that it could not be turned off.  It was to be an inherent part of the car that the sound could not be switched off at any stage.  Otherwise, the danger would be that it would stay switched off.  There are commitments from the Department of Transport, and from the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Minister in that Department, that this will be adhered to in Ireland but, again, it falls between the stools so it is not done at present.  That is where it came from and it has been explored and agreed to by the manufacturers.  As far as I know, it is fitted to all EVs now coming into the country.</p></speech>

I have never heard the word, "Longfordian", before.  Does Mr. Cawley want to make a comment to his fellow Longfordian?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Cawley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022092900002#P00900"><p>Of course.  I would love to.  I thank Senator Carrigy for the question.</p><p>The key thing we must remember is the same people are being hit with a crisis in housing, the energy crisis and the cost-of-living crisis.  The question was asked as to whether housing is always accessible.  The answer is that it is not.  The question was also asked as to whether housing is always affordable for disabled people.  Again the answer is that it is not.  We welcomed the national housing strategy for disabled people launched at the start of the year.  It covers the period from 2022 to 2027.  It looks at having strategic plans in all local authority areas.  We welcome that disabled people and disabled person organisations are getting on the local authority housing disability steering groups that are tasked with the local strategic plans.  We need to see the implementation of these plans.  We need to make sure more houses are accessible and built to an accessible universal design standard to enable disabled people to live in them.  We often say that one issue is to have the four walls of a house but another issue is the system.  We have raised this in many of our reports, which we can circulate to the members.  It seem to be the systems, policies and structures that exclude disabled people from living true independent lives.  An example is that people applying for houses quite often cannot get independent living supports to match it.</p><p> Another issue is the misconception held by many people that disabled people occupy only social housing.  There are disabled people who are trying to access private rental accommodation and trying to buy privately.  We are locked out of the market.  Affordability is not tied to what we are.  It is tied to the market value.  We could spend the whole meeting speaking about the housing issues that disabled people face.  These are some of the high-level issues.  It would be great to get more interagency collaboration on them so that disabled people can live independently.</p></speech>

I will hand over to Dr. Fitzpatrick, who has something to say about the census and Dr. Craddock, who has something to say about the sounds of electric vehicles and scooters.  The Centre for Excellence in Universal Design is the only statutory centre of its type in the world.  Even the National Disability Authority is unique.  There is no comparable organisation in other European countries.  Often disability advice and guidance is encompassed in a governmental department.  We are very pleased to be able to be a resource to the Government in this respect.</p> <p>  The Co-Chairman, Senator Carrigy, asked where some of the sticking points are.  There has a lot of progress recently in the take-up of advice and guidance and a willingness to implement and realise the rights of people with disabilities.  Where we see most of the challenges arise is where there is a need for cross-departmental collaboration.  These hurdles are still very difficult to overcome.  Often these issues are tied to budget lines being siloed and no mechanisms in place to share budgets and share ways of working to overcome some of the disability challenges that can cross the entire span of life.</p> <p>  On the request to have autism friendly or disability friendly towns, we have worked on a tool with the NTA and other stakeholders.  This is the walkability audit tool we have developed.  We piloted it in Kilrush and the local authority was able to use the findings of the audit to secure funding to make a large number of improvements in the town.  It is now very much more disability friendly.  This is something that could assist the Co-Chairman, Senator Carrigy, in this quest.</p></speech>

I will correct the record on this if necessary but to the very best of my knowledge it was not possible to complete the most recent census in any form other than paper.  As members can imagine, this excluded a significant number of visually-impaired people from being able to complete it independently.  I have several anecdotal pieces of evidence from myself, friends and acquaintances.  We very much welcome that the census will move online.  It highlights a very interesting point which Mr. Harris mentioned earlier.  It is very important that various modalities can be used by people to acquire information or to complete forms.  I will give a quick example.  We have specific requirements regarding the forthcoming European accessibility act to make answering the 112 emergency services number accessible to include real-time text or real-time video.  This is a great example of what can be done by working at European level and the importance of a multimodal approach.  People may still like to complete the census form on paper.  There may be people with low technical literacy or who simply do not want to do it online and find it more comfortable to write.  Having only this modality available excludes a significant number of individuals.  This is why the NDA very much welcomes the fact that various modalities will be available.</p></speech>

I echo Mr. Kenny's comment on electric vehicles, particularly on having a sound system built in.  Deputy Harkin made a point on cyclists.  We have a big issue with e-scooters taking over the same space.  We have made representations and submissions on e-scooters particularly on their speed.  It was amazing to hear on a "Prime Time" programme that e-scooters could clock up speeds of 120 km/h.  I am not sure where they could be used.  Another issue is where they are stored.  Anybody who has been to any other European country has seen that they are just left on the sidewalk or in the middle of the road.  There should be the same set-up in cities as for the standard bicycles.  There should be a designated place where they are parked.  We have made submissions to the NTA regarding this.</p> <p>  With regard to housing, as already been mentioned we are pushing for Part M to be revised.  It needs to be updated.  Mr. Cawley mentioned that much of our housing stock must be retrofitted.  This is a huge cost.  To go back to the human rights issue, housing is a key requirement under Article 28 of the UNCRPD on independent living.</p> <p>  The world ageing report in 2015 outlined that government support, resources and capacity building are required to support and advance universal design.  Mr. Harris and Mr. Kenny have raised these issues.  The three ingredients, according to the world ageing report, are resources, capacity building and government support.  The report had us in the same sentence as Norway and Singapore with regard to advancing universal design.  We have a bit to go but it was nice to see it in the report.</p></speech>

The idea was put forward to have a disabled person on the team.  This is a good idea.  I suggest, in light of the web accessibility legislation, that this is a real business opportunity.  Such a business could be established.  An individual Deputy or a small company might not be in a position to employ somebody on the team but if they could access expertise many people would be very interested in doing so.  I apologise because I must leave the meeting to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

I worked with active travel and people with disabilities for more than 15 years in my previous job dealing with children with disabilities in active schools.  We must be very careful when we talk about cars and cyclists.  The bigger issue as I see it is that we do not even design for able-bodied people.  We have been designing for cars only.  I wish any mother who is fully able bodied and trying to cross the road with her child good luck.  I normally cycle, but as I have a foot injury I have been trying to walk around Dublin for the past few weeks and I cannot even cross the road without the light going to orange.  It is super stressful.</p> <p>  That is not to mention cyclists perhaps frightening some people.  There is a much bigger issue here.  We have best practice, which is known as universal access, and that is the one we need to talk about.  There is only one place in the entire country where one can park a disability bike.  It is in Trinity College.  We also have people with disabilities who cannot walk, but they can cycle and they use hand cycles.  We must be very careful in this discussion in how we talk about universal access and design.  There should be so much space for walking and cycling and for people with disabilities and the visually impaired.  The bigger question is how we have given so much space to metal boxes.  Have we become totally reliant on them so that we are literally not thinking outside the metal box?  We have all the different groups fighting against each other for space.  We must be very careful.</p> <p>  I know people with autism who get stressed out just trying to cross the road because of the lack of time - approximately ten seconds - that we give to the green man.  I am not disabled but I have a crutch and a big boot on my foot at the moment and I cannot cross the road in Dublin without getting stressed out.  I am not an elderly person, a person trying to cross the road with a two-year-old kid or a person with a full disability.  We have a major issue here.  We could have a whole committee just about design.  I do not think cyclists are the beginning or end of our problems because we also have people with disabilities who cannot walk who use hand cycles.  Space and how we prioritise it is a significant issue.  The question is whether it is for people, no matter what their ability or disability, or if it is for cars.  I had to say that because we must be very careful with the debate.</p></speech>

I saw her hand up but I thought it was from her earlier contribution.  Universal access is a major issue.  We must seek to incorporate everybody into society to make sure we accommodate them.</p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Autism is doing significant work and must report by the end of March 2023.  I wish the committee well.  Autism is a significant issue that must be properly addressed.  Some great work is being done in that regard.  On behalf of both committees, I thank Mr. Adam Harris, CEO of AsIAm; from the Independent Living Movement Ireland, Mr. Desmond Kenny, Ms Catherine Gallagher and Mr. James Cawley; and from the National Disability Authority, Dr. Aideen Hartney, Dr. Gerald Craddock and Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick.</p> <p>  Every Thursday we have evidence and questions from members of the joint committee.  Today's sitting is of the two committees.  People are genuinely looking for guidance as to how we can tackle inclusivity in society and deal with the existing challenges.  All public representatives come across families, and they have their own families, and they see the challenges and barriers that exist.  A number of witnesses spoke this morning about the barriers and the challenges that exist and how we get beyond them.  We come across this daily.  Sometimes we tear our hair out trying to see how we can rectify an issue for a very genuine case.  It is only because of the work the witnesses do, the evidence they have given and their willingness to come before us and give us their honest appraisal of where things are at that we can then go on and try to do something proper for the challenges of the people we are duty-bound to represent in the autism committee and in the disability matters committee.  It is most important the witnesses keep up their work.</p> <p>  Dr. Craddock referred to a submission he made to the National Transport Authority.  I would appreciate it if he could provide a copy to the committee as I would like to follow up on it.  I urge the witnesses to keep up the good work and to keep in contact with us.  If there are things we are not doing properly, that we should be doing better or that we should be better at challenging, they should please not be afraid to come back to us and tell us.  We will come back to the witnesses for further evidence and information.  The press officer for the autism committee is also in the Gallery.</p> <p>  I thank our team and the autism committee's team.  A significant amount of work goes on behind the scenes.  It is the research and evidence the team puts together that make the committees work properly.  I urge them to keep up the good work.  We will try as best we can to make society better for people with disabilities, their families and their lived experience.</p></speech>

Accessibility is at the core of the work of both of our committees.  In our first public meeting, my committee called for Leinster House to be made autism friendly, as is the case in the Northern Ireland Assembly's parliament buildings at Stormont, Belfast.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission welcomed our request to make Leinster House autism friendly and I hope to see developments this autumn.  We look forward to such initiatives as suitable lighting, noise reduction, a sensory room and, most importantly, staff training.  This will ensure that there are fewer barriers to access for autistic people attending Leinster House.  I hope that we will set a good example for all to follow.</p> <p>  Our committee's work in public session thus far has focused primarily on education.  This is just one area where considerable improvements are needed if we are to make accessibility a core principle.  Greater accessibility measures have been implemented in some schools but not others.  We need to see such measures being implemented in every school, be it a specialist school or a mainstream one.  The same must apply to publish buildings across the board.</p> <p>  I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses about how we can make our buildings and society more accessible for autistic and disabled people.  One of our powers is to draft recommendations for legislative change and examine statutory instruments.  We would welcome any idea that the witnesses may have in that regard.</p></speech>

On behalf of both committees, I welcome Mr. Adam Harris, CEO of AsIAm.  From Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, I welcome Mr. Desmond Kenny, chairperson, Ms Catherine Gallagher and Mr. James Crawley.  Also with us from the National Disability Authority, NDA, are Dr. Aideen Hartney, director, Dr. Gerald Craddock, chief officer at its Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, CEUD, and Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick, senior design adviser of ICT within the CEUD.</p> <p>  Before beginning, I wish to read out a note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise, comment on or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not make charges against a person or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members and witnesses have the option of being present in the committee room or joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  If members are partaking, will they confirm before speaking whether they are on the grounds of Leinster House?</p> <p>  Without further ado, I call on Mr. Harris to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.759" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#B00100"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it today on this important subject matter.  AsIAm is Ireland&rsquo;s national autism charity.  Our vision is an Ireland where all autistic persons are accepted as they are  &ndash; equal, valued and respected.  Our purpose is to advocate for an inclusive society for autistic people that is accessible, accepting and affirming.  We work to support the autistic community and our families to fully engage in Irish life and build the capacity of society to facilitate true inclusion.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, autism is a unique neurotype.  Autistic people communicate, interact and experience the environment in different way from those who are not autistic.  While Ireland does not have a census question on autism, we know that increased awareness and understanding have led to more people being identified as being autistic in recent years.  While 2016 data from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, indicated that one in 65 students in school in Ireland is autistic, it is notable that the Department of Education has recently indicated that number is likely to be closer to 3.3% of the school-going population.  It is reasonable to assume that prevalence is represented across Irish society when adults without a formal diagnosis are also considered.</p> <p>  Autistic people are neurodivergent and therefore share many experiences with people who have other neurotypes and diagnoses, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, dyslexia and dyspraxia.  In the context of any discussion around accessibility and universal design, this is an important consideration, as many of the adjustments or reasonable accommodations that may support an autistic person will support many others too.  For example, visual information improves accessibility for those with dementia, those who may be functionally illiterate or those for whom English is not their first language.  Reductions in background noise would improve accessibility for those who use hearing aids or suffer from migraine.  This is before we even consider the reality that when an autistic person is excluded by the environment, it often has a much broader implication.  As a child, there were many places I found to be overwhelming, from restaurants to busy shopping centres.  The reality was that if I could not go somewhere, very often our whole family simple did not go.  This leads to many people missing out on important day-to-day activities and represents a lost opportunity for many services and businesses.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to participate in today&rsquo;s discussion, as too often the invisible accessibility barriers that autistic people encounter are not widely understood or even considered as accessibility requirements, despite being a legal requirement.  There can be a tendency to focus on how the person responds to an inaccessible experience instead of asking why that person is feeling overwhelmed in the first place.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, calls us to recognise that disability is experienced by the interaction between the impairments an individual may have with the attitudinal and environmental barriers within society.  Creating universally accessible environments and services is critical to this.</p> <p>  In AsIAm, we address autism primarily as an accessibility issue.  Autistic people experience barriers in society that others do not and, as a result, are often deprived of the same chance to access critical public services, engage in leisure activities or even do mundane tasks such as going to the supermarket or visiting a doctor.  Small changes can truly make a big difference.  In AsIAm, we explore accessibility through four key lenses: communication; predictability and control; sensory processing; and judgment and attitude.  How others respond to a person who is experiencing the world in a different way is, as the community consistently tells us, the single biggest barrier autistic people encounter within the community.  Public education and engagement must be seen as a critical component of accessibility and, in our experience, the creation of accessibility supports not only improves the experiences members of our community have, but also serves to demystify and destigmatise autistic experiences.</p> <p>  When we talk about accessibility and autism, it is important to recognise that, just like the general population, every autistic person is different and the sorts of accommodations and adjustments a person may need can vary greatly.  Indeed, at times they can even conflict.  For example, one autistic person may be hypersensitive to the environment, while another may be hyposensitive.  As a result, accessibility in autism cannot be codified in the way, for example, some physical accessibility adjustments can be.  However, we can create lenses or frameworks in which we can think about autism accessibility.  One such example is the ASPECTSS framework developed by the Egyptian architect, Dr. Magda Mostafa.  ASPECTSS stands for acoustics, spatial sequencing, escape space, compartmentalisation, transitions, sensory zoning and safety.  AsIAm was proud to work with Dr. Mostafa to develop design guidelines for university buildings based on our partnership with Dublin City University, DCU.  This framework will now inform all future building projects in DCU and has a much wider applicability also.  I will be delighted to share it with members if it is of interest.</p> <p>  In AsIAm, we run a wide range of training and accreditation programmes to support organisations to consider the accessibility requirements that autistic people may have and to put in place the appropriate adjustments.  This includes the autism-friendly university award, which I referenced, alongside our autism-friendly towns award, which this year will work with 20 communities across Ireland, and our autism-friendly schools programme, which was recently successfully evaluated by a team of researchers in Mary Immaculate College.</p> <p>  While each accreditation process is different, there are a range of common considerations across all our work in this area, many of which we would like to see adopted more formally by the State as a means of enabling the participation of autistic people in society.  Central to the consideration of accessibility must be autistic voices and experience.  Autistic people should be involved in the development of guidelines and accommodations and our lived experience should inform every aspect of how accommodations or adjustments are provided and made.</p> <p>  There is a distinct lack of understanding of the sensory differences experienced by autistic people.  The rise of multipurpose space and open plan have made many day-to-day environments, including new school buildings, very overwhelming for many members of our community.  We believe all buildings should undertake a sensory audit to consider the experiences of autistic people and make adjustments accordingly.</p> <p>  For autistic people going new places or trying new things, especially in stressful situations such as healthcare settings, can be extremely stressful and challenging.  We live in an information age and the appropriate use of websites, video and photography can go a long way towards easing this burden.  Showing a person what to expect prior to visiting somewhere can empower an individual to make informed decisions.</p> <p>  Autistic people and neurotypical people can encounter a double empathy problem when interacting.  Both communities need to learn to respect and understand the differences in communication, from the use of body language to the use of words.  There are insufficient means by which a non-speaking autistic person can access public services independently and how communication is provided is too often imprecise and confusing.  The most important accessibility change in this area would be universal training on autism for all public services, coupled with improvement in the ranges of modes of communication.  For example, many autistic people find the telephone overwhelming, but too often this is the only way to access vital services, such as a GP when people are sick.</p> <p>  When we consider the accessibility requirements from a universal design perspective, there is much to consider.  Moving forward, we should be ensuring all services and businesses are fully accessible by design.  What about existing infrastructure?  What about settings and services, for example, a busy health centre, which by its nature will pose some accessibility barriers for autistic people?  We must remember that not every autistic person is diagnosed or aware that they are autistic and many people do not feel comfortable sharing their diagnosis.  As a result, it is vital that as many accessibility measures as possible are applied universally and open to all.  This not only destigmatises but, in many cases, makes for a better experience for everyone.</p> <p>  There may then be other accommodations that, to protect their integrity, it is important to have as a means of a person identifying why they need this support.  An example is priority queueing.  AsIAm issues an autism ID card to support this sort of access and we welcome the developments surrounding an EU disability card.</p> <p>  Finally, there may be some accommodations and adjustments that are unique to the individual, for example, avoiding a very particular sensory trigger.  Where this is the case, it is vital that organisations provide neuro-affirmative information in advance, which supports and gives confidence to an individual to request these supports.</p> <p>  Autistic people adapt every day to a world that is not built with autistic people in mind.  It is essential that society meets us halfway and we create more accessible environments, communication systems and information that empower and support everyone.</p></speech>

I believe the Chair asked that we would indicate that.  I hope I will not make any defamatory statements in the course of this presentation.</p> <p>  I am pleased to have been invited by the committee and to share the platform with AsIAm.  It was interesting to hear Mr. Harris's presentation, which we will talk more about later on.  It is important that our mutual complementarity and potentially conflicting approaches do not in any way conflict with the generality of improving the environment and making it accessible for all.</p> <p>  ILMI is an organisation comprised of disabled people.</p><p>We see ourselves as a disabled person's organisation, DPO, working on the lived experiences of disabled people.  We are not associated or affiliated with any service provider.  We recognise the great work they do but we are here to talk as individuals who consult with individuals and we are bringing the committee that lived experience.  I will talk to the committee about one element of accessibility and Ms Gallagher will amplify that.  On hand we have Mr. James Cawley, our policy officer, who can answer questions on the accessible environment.</p><p> I want to talk to the committee in the context of accessibility in a visual world.  As a blind person, I rely on my ears, hands and feet - yes, my feet - to give me clues to and replacements for what might usually be regarded as visual.  At the edges of steps you will notice dimpled surfaces; this is to tell me that I am confronting steps going up or going down.  You will see the same dimpled surfaces at pedestrian crossings and along the edge of platforms in stations to demark the line beyond which it is not safe for me to venture.  Audio crossings are present in all of our cities and most of our towns, telling me when it is safe to cross the road, provided no cyclist is coming that is.  They have been growing in numbers since the mid-1970s and it is a tremendous assistance to the number of people who are blind or with low vision.  It is reckoned that there are 200,000 people in Ireland with low vision.  When you take into account the elderly, going up to the age of 85 and 90, there are 240,000 people with low vision, while there may only be 17,000 people like me who are totally blind.  The number of those audio crossings has grown over the years.</p><p> Announcements on our public transport fleets, buses and trains help identify where I might be at any given time, that is when the announcements are working, which cannot always be guaranteed.  New audio supports moving into use are audio description, AD, on film and TV.  Some 10% of our home-produced programmes on RT&Eacute; are targeted to be produced with AD built-in.  AD tells me what the scene is composed and comprised of and what the people are doing when action is not happening in a clear sense.  It tells me what people are doing by way of crying, frowning or looking into the distance.  I can anticipate what members might be wondering about.  For example, an audio clip from "Pretty Woman" announces to me that the couple are gone to bed and the blankets are moving.  Much of the movie stock on Sky Digital contains audio description which can be switched on and off as required.  Even the remote controls can be told where to navigate the channel selections to, with the selections talking back to me.</p><p> The following is an important point for the committee.  An EU regulation now requires that all new electric vehicles, EVs, from the summer of this year should emit an electronic sound when they are travelling below 20 km/h, telling me they are present.  Travelling in excess of 20 km/h the tyres are reckoned to emit enough noise for it to be clear that there is an EV present.  That regulation is not yet being enforced in Ireland and the same expectation might be applied to ebikes and escooters for the same reason.</p><p> Another directive from the EU relates to web accessibility, which was touched on in part by Mr. Harris.  This directive relates to the content on Government and local authority websites being accessible to screen readers for someone like me who is blind, and is capable of magnification for somebody with low vision.  The directive is being monitored and encouraged by the National Disability Authority, NDA, and it is good to see the officials from the NDA here to give more guidance on that.  It is an important directive.</p><p> In terms of touch, how many members of the committee will have picked up a pack of Panadol for their headaches or Gaviscon for their indigestion in the supermarket and noticed strange dots on medicine packs?  These will not be present on the drugs in your local pharmacy.  Those dots, which are Braille, also come from a European directive on medicines, obliging pharmaceutical companies to print in Braille the name of the medicine and its dose.  All that I have described in brief, not unlike what Mr. Harris was talking about and in a similar context, is a web of assistance that exists to support me to know or to interrogate my environment or, in the case of medicines, to tell me what tablets I hold in my hand.</p><p> Publishers of books are obliged nowadays to have available digital copies of their publications which can be shared throughout the world to countries signed up to share print material and make it available to people who are blind or who may be suffering from dyslexia.  Ireland has been signed up to this book share protocol since 2016.  When I first started my college education in the 1970s, textbooks were not available as such.  I had to have my books read onto cassette and I relied only on that and on lectures being spoken.  There was no other means of having that available to me.  Since then, in advancing my education in later years, I was able to do my course content and further education in digital form because of the availability of digital formats, which were available to me from the Open University.  That format could be read by my computer, again using screen reader software.</p><p> I will move towards a conclusion.  As the world evolves into more digital channels, I am told who is at my front door, how my thermostat is set and I can have Alexa or Google assistant at hand to tell me how I might need to spell something or to look it up.  I can have it looked up and spoken back to me from Google.  These are all part of the evolving new technologies of communication and contact.  The committee can monitor these things passively as watchers of the evolution of it all or from time to time, as we are doing this morning, it can look at the failures of our planners to think about access when designing the environments which make up our interface with the world as an inclusive society where all disabled people, as Mr. Harris said, want to be and live in.</p><p> I call my colleague Ms. Catherine Gallagher to continue this presentation and to present how she finds the information gaps.</p></speech>

In case it is necessary to say, like Mr. Kenny I am not physically on the premises and I am tuning in remotely.</p> <p>  I would like committee members to think about every milestone in their lives: starting primary school, secondary school, sitting the junior or leaving certificate, going to college, employment, or further training, moving out of the family home, and so on.  Did they face significant barriers in getting information to hand to see through all of those milestones?</p> <p>  Every decision disabled people make can span across multiple Departments.  Further to this, Departments and public bodies may attempt to redirect us around in circles.  These queries can turn into fully fledged information-seeking expeditions.  The burden of bureaucracy can be overwhelming, and we are no different from our non-disabled peers in that we have the same number of hours in the day.  There are also issues in relation to physical access and the built environment, specifically Part M of the building regulations which my colleague Mr. James Cawley can address.</p> <p>  I have not had the privilege of always living with privacy, dignity and discretion.  For every thing I turn my hand to, multiple Departments in several separate administrative offices need to be notified.  One of the most recent examples of this was my debacle on being offered a scholarship to study to a PhD level in Dublin City University in early 2021.  The modest stipend was a bone of contention regarding my disability allowance.  I was going to lose everything.  I instigated both a public and behind-the-scenes political communications campaign.  While it is rather a long story of how Catherine&rsquo;s Law came to be, the crux of what I want to highlight today was the lengths to which I had to go to establish the lay of the land.  When I received the first letter - in written format by the way, on paper - from the Department stating I was to lose everything, I was not given a reason.  I set about establishing the who, what, when, where, why and how of the matter.  I received incorrect information on several occasions, including the leading statutory body that supports the provision of information.</p> <p>  I eventually managed to piece together a case and, to be fair, when I presented it, I came across little resistance.  There were organisations and politicians who may not even have been aware it was an issue.  It was described in the D&aacute;il by one of the Government party leaders as a "mistake".  It certainly was not, but everyone got a fast education.</p> <p>  The physical toll this pressure put on me, even before it went public, is indescribable.  There was nothing private, nothing dignifying and nothing discrete about those couple of months.</p> <p>  When we think of coalition-building, we often think of it as being external to us, or forming governments.  Internal and cross-coalition building is just as important in how we talk and work with each other.  We need to acknowledge that there are Departments and State bodies that would benefit from an overhaul of the ways they provide information to target groups so that individuals can make informed decisions about their own lives.  There are disabled people who have the expertise to aid with this.  Consult us or, better yet, hire us.</p> <p>  As it happens, I am in the middle of preparing an application regarding my research.  I am asked to outline, in detail, how I will disseminate my knowledge, what impact it will have, who and where it will be useful for, and how it will add to the state of the art, as it were.  These are questions we also need to consider in light of accessible information and communication.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.767" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#D00500"><p>The National Disability Authority, NDA, is delighted to be here to address both committees on this very important topic.  Our role is to provide evidence-informed advice to Government on disability and we incorporate the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, CEUD, which promotes universal design in the built environment, products, services and ICT.  It is the only statutory centre of its kind in the world.</p> <p>  Universal design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of age, size, ability, disability or type of disability.  Accessibility is encompassed within universal design.  If a universal design approach is applied from the outset, then accessibility can become universal.  This is reflected in Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the UN monitoring committee&rsquo;s general comment 2.  Universal design has the capacity to handle the variation and experiences referred to by Mr. Harris in his opening statement.</p> <p>  An accessible built environment is one in which the barriers to access by disabled people are removed or mitigated as far as possible.  A universal design approach at planning stage can reduce the need for costly renovations later.  The CEUD at the NDA has developed guidance for universally designed homes, places and facilities; early years learning and care settings; and the retrofit of long-term residential care settings among others.  However, to Senator Carrigy's point, we believe that incorporating a requirement for a universal design approach in relevant regulations is necessary in order for this guidance to be routinely adopted.  For example, we have called for a revision of Part M of the building regulations to include universal design and to ensure houses built are fully liveable for disabled people rather than just visitable as is currently the case.  We advise that all new housing projects progressed by the State should be universally designed and that 10% of any development should be designed to UD+ standards, so that any wheelchair user can live in them.  We also recommend the development of a national standard on housing that clearly sets out technical requirements for universally designed housing in order that a consistent approach can be applied in all local authority areas.</p> <p>  The Disability Act 2005 and the UNCRPD require all information and communications provided by a public body to be accessible to everyone.  The NDA has developed a code of practice for accessible public services and information that sets out the detail of these requirements.  We have recently revised the code to include provisions to meet the needs of those with autism and users of Irish Sign Language and to reflect the shift to digital services that was accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We look forward to this revised version being approved by the Minister in due course.  As has been referred to by Mr. Kenny and Mr. Harris, the EU web accessibility directive has brought additional obligations for public bodies to ensure their websites are accessible, and the NDA is pleased to be the national monitoring body for that directive.</p> <p>  The European accessibility Act is due to be transposed into Irish law in 2022 and aims to ensure there are more accessible products and services in the market at more competitive prices and with fewer barriers.  A universal design approach will be key to implementation of the directive in Ireland, and the NDA has advised that multiple parties will be involved to ensure implementation moves beyond the minimum required to avoid infringement to a proactive approach to ensure standardised accessibility across both public and private sectors.</p> <p>  A universal design approach requires the involvement of the widest possible range of users in the design phase and a co-production approach to projects.  This approach is also in keeping with UNCRPD and its requirement for the close involvement of disabled people and their representative organisations in matters relevant to their lives.  Consultation initiatives themselves should be universally designed to maximise the opportunities for engagement.  Our recently launched participation matters guidelines on consultation and engagement can offer support to all state actors in taking an inclusive approach to the projects in their remit.</p> <p>  To promote awareness and take-up of universal design, the NDA advises the importance of including it in curricula at all levels of the education system, in particular continuing professional development for specific groups such as architects, engineers and IT professionals.  A universal design approach should also be taken to promote learning for all, which includes provision of accommodations that anyone who needs to can avail of.  We welcome the recent developments in this regard in the further and higher education sectors.</p><p>The obligations and duties for public bodies are clear but the NDA&rsquo;s work to monitor progress across these areas shows there is still considerable work to be done to ensure accessibility is embedded as standard.  Our 2021 report on the web accessibility directive, which we submitted to the EU, showed that of the websites and mobile apps we monitored, none was fully compliant with the directive.  However, our report shows that the majority of issues identified were common and could be easily remedied if web providers gave greater focus to their obligations with regard to accessibility.  We are currently exploring structured mechanisms for monitoring compliance with Part 3 of the Disability Act and will be engaging with all Departments to remind them of their obligations and to guide on how to improve their performance where necessary as initial desk monitoring shows a number of basic steps that could be taken.  The ability to monitor progress and present data to public bodies is critical to encourage and track performance over time and the NDA hopes to enhance further our monitoring capacity to help embed accessibility as standard in all public organisations.</p><p> We advise that, while universal design is recognised in legislation and several national policies and strategies, a structured and systematic approach is now required to embed it in practice.  Making accessibility a consideration from design stage through to procurement and on to delivery should become part of the standard operating procedures for all State actors to ensure everyone can be included.  I thank the committee.  We would be delighted to answer any questions on this matter.</p></speech>

We will now go to the members.  It should be borne to mind that this is a joint meeting of two committees.  We will try to get everybody in.  Our first speaker is the Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, Deputy Tully.</p></speech>

When we have talked about accessibility over the years, we have always thought more about the physical environment but it is about much more than that.  Mr. Harris in particular referred to the need to create awareness across all public bodies, employers and services.</p> <p>  I will address a couple of the issues.  Universal design and ensuring that housing projects were liveable for wheelchair users was mentioned.  A couple of the witnesses mentioned Part M of the building regulations.  They have asked for the regulations to be revised.  Is that happening?  Will they be revised to ensure that all buildings are liveable for wheelchair users?  Do we have any idea of the costs of building something to universal design+ standards as against the cost of having to adapt a house or building, because that is often thrown up?  Do we have a breakdown on that?  Mr. Harris said that we do not really know the number of people who are autistic and that it is not a question on the census.  Does he believe it should be?</p> <p>  Do planners and public bodies regularly consult with AsIAm, Independent Living Movement Ireland and their respective members with regard to accessibility issues?  Does the NDA employ many people who have disabilities?  To what extent does it consult with people who have disabilities?  I have talked to people who have been consulted about issues because the body had to do so to tick a box and ensure it was fulfilling its obligations but the advice they gave was just ignored.  I am particularly thinking about someone who was consulted on transport issues - I believe it was about cycling lanes or outdoor dining when that came in during the pandemic - but all of their suggestions were just ignored.  It must be ensured that consultation is done properly, for the right reasons and not just as a box-ticking exercise.  Will the witnesses speak about that?</p> <p>  The NDA has to oversee the directives that are being introduced.  Is it properly resourced to do so or is it being asked to climb a mountain with very few resources?  I am conscious of time.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#E00500"><p>The census question is absolutely critical.  Just last summer, we saw the problems we have with regard to data on autism in the context of education.  At the minute, we have different data sets.  There are efforts under way to marry them but it is not a perfect science.  One very simple example of this is that, if you are an autistic adult accessing a diagnosis privately, as we know you must, you will not be in any HSE or Department of Education data set.  The census is the way to do it.  To be clear, it could be an autism-specific question or a reform of the disability question on the census.  At the moment, none of the fields within that question truly speaks to an autistic person's experience.  As a result, I fear that people are going unseen and that this is affecting national planning.</p> <p>  On consultation, the picture is very mixed.  There certainly is tokenistic consultation on many matters across the public sector and times when consultations are not accessible in and of themselves, which undermines the point.  If we step away from the policy area and think more about making services accessible, we have seen many public bodies coming to us seeking support and training in this area.  Key examples of this in recent years have involved libraries, public transport and universities.  Schools are a priority area because the State is going to be investing heavily in new school buildings over the coming decade.  In my view, the school buildings that are being built are, in many instances, less accessible for autistic people.  To give one example, very often you have to go through very busy areas to get to a quiet space.  Very vibrant and overwhelming colours are sometimes being used.  We sometimes even see that in the design of autism classes themselves.  More work needs to be done in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Desmond Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#E00600"><p>I will take the first part.  In a sense, it would be good to see what Mr. Harris has described regarding the expansion of the question on disability in the census.  It would be better if it were included in that general disability framework rather than being something outside of it.  We must see how the growth in the population of people who name themselves as disabled people will impact on the perception of our service delivery.</p> <p>  As for tokenistic consultation, most of the time - organisations will experience this as they grow older and their contacts expand - relationships are built with people like the Co-Chairman and Deputy Tully who know that we are there to provide our voice.  However, that voice is sometimes not called on often enough.  There is less of the tokenism than there used to be.  We are not there just because we must be to tick a box.  That does happen and Ms Gallagher can share her experiences of it but I am looking at the issue over decades.  I have looked at the origin of many things and sometimes nuance is lost and things do not happen correctly.  This can be seen in the enthusiasm to encourage cycling as a form of recreation and active mobility and the extent to which this is threatening the safety of elderly and vision-impaired people.  For example, planners are often told that lights should be in place to tell cyclists when to stop where there are bus islands and floating bus stops at which you have to cross a cycle lane physically to board or get off a bus, relying on those cyclists to stop.  However, it is all about the cyclists not stopping.  That is going to be a danger.  It has happened in other countries, and will probably happen here, that a human rights difficulty will arise that will have to be processed by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission because people are being exposed to a danger.  With regard to the physical built environment, Mr. Cawley is our policy officer and could enlighten the committee as to how we are consulted about the physical environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#E00700"><p>I will answer a number of Deputy Tully's question and then hand over to my colleague, Dr. Craddock, who will talk about built environment matters.  The Deputy asked whether the NDA employs people with disabilities.  Yes, we do.  In 2020, approximately 20% of our staff felt comfortable declaring that they have a disability.</p><p>That is something we are always keen to focus on.  As to whether we are resourced to do our job, what we have done very successfully, particularly Dr. Craddock's team, is built awareness of universal design over the last number of years and begun monitoring work on compliance with the various directives.  The challenge is the capacity to support the variety of public bodies we interact with on implementation.  We are not finding anyone who argues with universal design as a good idea but developing the guidance and toolkits they need to take it up is resource-intensive work.  That is where a little bit of extra resourcing would be very welcome.</p><p> We work hard on consulting with people with disabilities and their representative organisations in our work.  We take a varied approach to that.  Sometimes for specific projects, we might have an advisory group with membership from DPOs on it and sometimes we go out wide with public consultation on specific projects.  We take a varied approach but it is something we are working hard on improving over time.  Our "Participation Matters" guidelines, which launched last week, will offer a blueprint for us and for all public actors to improve in that space.</p><p> I will make a final point about data.  One of the challenges is getting accurate data from the census, not just about autism.  This also came up in another committee hearing around not having accurate numbers for wheelchair users.  The NDA would love to see a national disability survey carried out after the next census.  Anyone declaring they have a disability on the next census could be followed up with and asked a range of more detailed questions so we could capture specific conditions, barriers and challenges.  That was done back in 2006 but there has not been an opportunity to update that survey since then.  It is something we have had preliminary discussions with the CSO on.  We would welcome cross-Government support for a national disability survey after the next census.</p></speech>

Regarding Part M, at the present moment we are creating guidance to match the work being done by the Department on changing places and toilets.  Part M is being revised to included those.  However, we have been advocating and advising the Government, particularly the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that Part M needs to be revised specifically regarding domestic homes.  At present, Part M refers to "visitability", an unusual word in itself, whereas we talk about livability, meaning the homes need to be liveable in.  Visitability stipulates level access, an accessible toilet downstairs and access to one other room.  That is what it is within Part M, which is a bit short on what we are looking for.  ILMI is very exercised about this and is talking to the Department about getting Part M revised.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the cost of universal design.  Going back to Mr. Harris's point, if it is done at the very start universal design is invisible.  We go to the supermarket every weekend or whatever and walk through sliding doors.  We never even think about it but there is level access, car spaces right at the entrance to the shopping mall and accessible toilets within the shopping mall.  It is a negligible cost if designed at the start.  We are working on two projects at the moment - a cost-benefit analysis of universal design for homes and a cost assessment that breaks down the individual elements.  We have calculated that there are 659 different elements in the home that need to be designed or incorporated.  Of that, over 600 have no cost so we are down to around 50 elements where there is a cost element.  We are working through that at the moment.  We are working with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland SCSI and engaging with the Department.  The other project, the cost-benefit analysis, looks at the other long-term benefits of designing well from the start, such as cutting down on the cost of care and reducing the cost of medical supervision but also the issue of falls.  As we all know, particularly with the ageing population, people often fall in their own homes.  The reason for that is that they are designed poorly.  If we can get the design right at the start, there are huge savings.  That has been shown internationally.  We are in regular contact with the likes of the Norwegians, who are leaders in Europe on this.  The Japanese have been designing this in for 40 years, mainly because they are seen as the most aged population in the world.  We are making headway but, as everybody has said, we have some way yet to go.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for having me.  The questions Deputy Tully raised are valid.  ILMI has consulted its membership around accessibility in a number of areas, including the UNCRPD and Covid measures that were introduced into cities.  We also have a planning group and we have developed a document that covers principles of inclusive planning.  Before we look at Part M and the logistics of that, we need to look at planning issues.  There was talk of consultation.  In some cases, decisions are reached without any meaningful consultation with disabled people.  Consultation should be done directly through disabled persons' organisations at all levels - local, regional and national.  That is the simple answer to a very complex issue.  We know the built environment is not accessible but quite often disabled people find out too late about plans, so rather than inputting into the design at concept stage, disabled activists are reacting to planning decisions.  That is an issue as well.</p> <p>  In Ireland we seem to plan, design and build to minimum standards.  Often regulating creates barriers to more universal design ways of thinking.  Our members have highlighted that the Part M building regulations are weak and need to be reviewed.  We should be looking at minimum standards, not maximum standards.  They are simply not working for disabled people.  ILMI recommends that local authorities fully monitor the implementation of Part M when it is reviewed and we call strongly for it to be reviewed.  The other key element is that, as the representatives from the NDA have said, homes need to be wheelchair liveable.  We are in a housing crisis.  It is very difficult for disabled people to find houses that are accessible for us to actually live in.  It is one thing to give us the four walls but we need to be able to be genuinely included in our communities.  Accessibility plays a massive part in our lives.  It impacts on our spontaneity as disabled people.  That is important.  When we keep accessibility in mind at the design stage, we are actually designing for diversity, which reflects the society we live in and our intersectionality.</p></speech>

It is an honour to be here.  The autistic community is probably a lot further behind the blind community.  We take for granted all the advances with Braille, the beeping traffic lights and different advances in assistive technology.  Members of the blind community are therefore somewhat more able to go about their lives, have a meaningful life and participate properly.</p><p>For the autistic community, especially those who need a higher level of support, it is a lot more challenging.  Much of the time, people can tell a building is going to be challenging when they step into the foyer.  If they have a child, they will immediately know even from the acoustics coming back from inside that it is a no-go area.</p><p> It is great that we are having these discussions at this stage in terms of buildings being adapted.  I do not believe there has been enough research on what types of buildings are appropriate for people with autism, although I know a lot of research is going on at the moment.  Even the foyer of a building has to be a certain shape and size and has to have a certain acoustic standard for people to be comfortable enough to go into the building.  For example, if a child was brought to a pool, the pool echo can be heard from the front door and it is the most horrible building to go into, so they cannot even go there, and other public buildings such as busy train stations also have that type of environment.  As Mr. Harris said, there has to be a calm environment from the start and there has to be a channel to lead to another calm environment.  It is a real challenge for those with autism.</p><p> We can see how this works from the perspective of the blind community.  Who would have thought we would have braille, a system that people understand through a bump on a footpath that means something?  It is such an amazing system.  I can see Mr. Kenny is referring to his notes in braille.  It is amazing how it works and how people are able to read information from little packages.  It is also good how the EU has gotten behind the blind community and has supported them like this.  We are looking for the same support for the autistic community from the EU and from organisations like those represented here today.</p><p> It is great that we are having these discussions.  My colleague spoke about lack of consultation.  This is a great forum for consultation and we are delighted to hear from the witnesses and to have them come in.  I know Mr. Harris is probably sick of coming in here but it is great to have him.  The witnesses have such a wealth of knowledge.  Today, they are talking about something completely different from what they came in to talk to us about a few months ago, given we are talking today about building regulations.  They must have so many strings to their bows.  This is such an important conversation.</p><p> We are usually here talking about how, when people get into the building, the professional they are going to see has to have some sort of autism training.  Some organisations are doing great on that.  I have a friend who is a pilot and he said recently that all of his colleagues who work for Ryanair had to have autism training, which is great and would not have happened even five years ago.  They have to be super-aware of adults or individuals wearing lanyards.  He says that when he sees the lanyard, he is in a different mode and he is trained to be calmer and more facilitative of the person, which is great.</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Kenny.  Does RT&Eacute; have those audio description, AD, facilities which describe what is going on?  He can answer that at the end.</p><p> On a question for Dr. Hartney, as the Committee on Autism, we are very keen to have the Houses of the Oireachtas improved in terms of Leinster House being a building that is autism-friendly.  Has Dr. Hartney or, indeed, Mr. Harris, engaged with the Oireachtas or had any discussions with it?</p><p> We discussed a register.  Strong autism advocates would like to see an autism register.  They see how it worked for the cystic fibrosis, CF, community in that once there was a CF register, we were able to say there are X number of people with CF who need X amount of support.  Once the register was created, there was a big push to say that we need services or we need drugs.  I am not saying it is perfect for the CF community, as it is far from that, but it has given that community a lot more momentum by having a register.  It is a difficult discussion.  It is a hard question as to whether we should have an autism register or a general disability register, given they are very different.  Obviously, the adaptations that a person who is blind needs are different from those a person in a wheelchair or an autistic person needs.  That is a question that we need to answer.</p><p> I know the Co-Chairman's committee is doing a lot of work on the Changing Places toilets.  We are a total disgrace when it comes to Changing Places toilets.  We need to really up our game because it is so difficult for people with teenagers or young adults who need to be changed.  It is not fair.  It is just wrong.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for attending.  It is been great listening to all of the speakers.</p></speech>

I spoke to the Co-Chairman, Senator Carrigy, last week and we are awaiting contact from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission about that piece of work.  Some of that is about design.  It is important that the Committee on Autism hears directly from autistic people but, for many people, this could be quite an intimidating experience.  It is about giving people as much information as possible in advance so they know what to expect, such as having a calmer place to wait in or, for example, having a specific person to do the meet and greet when the person arrives.  We have a great template to work from.  The first building on this island or in the UK was Stormont, which was accredited by our colleagues in the National Autistic Society over ten years ago.  There is a very good template that we can bring here to ensure our Parliament building is autism-friendly.  That is obviously important for the work of the committee and I hope it will send an important message to other public services.</p> <p>  On the point in regard to the autism register, anything that enables us to have better statistics is worth exploring.  One of the concerns in the autism community around the concept of a register is, first, that it would need to be voluntary, but particularly the governance around any such register because, for most of the history of autism, it has been treated in a very medicalised way.  We want to ensure that the information on that register would not be used in such a way by researchers who want to do things to autistic people, who want to cure autistic people, as opposed to actually making the lives of autistic people better as they are.</p></speech>

The evolution of benefits for blind people over the decades has been slow.  It can be traced back to the Poor Law in 1840, when there were the blind, the deaf, the dumb and what were called the imbeciles.  We evolved from that charity model.  We have had decades of engagement with the community in the recent century to inculcate or have introduced systems and schemes that now look easy and seem to be easily achievable.</p> <p>  With regard to autism generally, I would say to Mr. Harris and the committee that we found, as a community of blind people, that for much of what we wanted to progress, we could better progress it through the European Blind Union, of which we were members, in the various consultative committees of the EU.  The regulations regarding web accessibility, medicines, procurement and issues relating to that all came out of those particular committees.  The autism community need to place themselves in the right place at the right time.  We all know it is good to say &ldquo;I spoke to the chairman&rdquo; and let people know we were talking in a higher place when telling somebody what is happening.  As they have spoken in Europe, and Europe is doing things, I believe we should use our MEPs more than we currently use them to prosecute potential legislation.</p> <p>  Blind people have advanced over the years and decades.  What I would like to do in some way is to share the piggybacking of our success with AsIAm and with the autism community so we can share some of that around our sensory needs.</p><p>I would be fearful that if we work in total isolation of our sensory requirements, I could go back some day and find the lift no longer talks to me, tells me what floor I am on or the doors are closing in order to meet a request that was made for a totally silent environment.  We can learn and pass on our learning to AsIAm and to Mr. Harris in all that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.785" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aideen Hartney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#H00200"><p>I echo what Mr. Kenny said.  It is more helpful to think about a collaborative and a shared approach than different groups pitting themselves against each other with their varying needs.  The beauty of a universal design approach is that it can accommodate the full range of experience.  On the question of a register, we would very much advocate that it should be for people to declare and decide whether they wished to declare they have a disability for themselves.  Many people wish to keep it private or do not consider they have a disability if the barriers in society have been successfully removed for them.  If we got to a universally designed world, we probably would not need these data-collection mechanisms.</p> <p>  We have not been approached to engage directly with the Oireachtas to make it an autism-friendly building, but we would be very open to doing so.  Dr. Fitzpatrick and Dr. Craddock might have some points to make regarding guidance we would have in that regard.  In our web accessibility directive monitoring nobody achieved compliance.  The Oireachtas website was one of the strongest performers we found in that first report and I congratulate it on that.  Does Dr. Fitzpatrick wish to make some points about acoustics?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#H00300"><p>Several speakers raised this interesting point.  Properly designed acoustics in a building very much benefit people with autism.  I am a totally blind person.  I navigate by using the cane.  Well-designed buildings with well-designed acoustics along with some tactile markings are also very beneficial.  Dr. Hartney made the point that what benefits one group of individuals often benefits a significant number of groups, which is why we go back to the whole notion of a universal design environment.  I will give one quick concrete example.  Airports can often be busy, especially over the summer.  The acoustics in many airports throughout the world actually make navigation problematic particularly when there is no tactile paving whatsoever.  As is clear from this morning's discussion, modifications to that space would clearly benefit me as a blind person and clearly benefit people with autism as well.  We need to look at this very much holistically taking into account the use needs of multiple groups of people.  Multiple different scenarios of use are very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.787" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gerald Craddock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#H00400"><p>Our conference will take place in Croke Park on 20 October to which all the committee members are invited.  There we will launch a CPD for architects.  One of the winners of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland universal design award was the Central Bank, just across the river from here.  We have been working very closely with it but also with many of its employees with different abilities.  We will launch an interactive e-learning module on 20 October, which could be very useful for the Oireachtas in addressing issues such as acoustics, which has been mentioned here several times, and navigation across the building from the car park right through to the various floors in the building.</p> <p>  The 2014 public procurement directive is now covered by a statutory instrument in Ireland, SI 284 of 2016.  All public procurement of parts and services that affect people need to include accessibility as mandatory.  We would highly recommend that that statutory instrument be implemented across government.  In America in 1991, President George Bush sr. signed the Americans with Disability Act into law.  That legislation was a turning point in making products and services accessible in America.  It is the reason many of the products developed by Microsoft, Google and others are much more accessible than any products designed in Europe.  The committee should advocate that SI 284 be implemented across government and local authorities.</p></speech>

As a person who has full faculties, I understand there are some issues but I do not have the lived experience of people.  I had the pleasure of knowing Dermot Walsh who was an advocate for independent living.  He worked full time with Dublin Bus advocating for disabled access for transport.  Is there somebody there who took his place?  Is there an advocate for disabled people in Dublin Bus and in the transport area?</p> <p>  I take on board the point that Mr. Kenny made about the structures that were put in place during the Covid pandemic, particularly for cycle lanes and traffic islands.  I have heard Gary Kearney frequently mention how dangerous they are for disabled people.  How important would it be that the ringing or noise levels would go up on buses as they slow down to 20 km/h and below?  From the point of view of cyclists, e-scooters are causing major problems.  They can put people with disabilities in a very difficult and potentially dangerous situation with the risk of getting seriously hurt.</p> <p>  Do local authorities consult with the National Disability Authority on planning regulations?  Part M seems to be very loosely based on visitation rather than liveable accommodation.  What does the National Disability Authority want us to do to get that revised to the extent that the NTA and other disability groups can have an impact?  </p> <p>  Regarding AsIAm, autism is a relatively new disability that is being grasped in communities and nationally.  Could AsIAm link in with the NDA?  Different disability groups, such as those who are blind or disabled, have autism or use a wheelchair, all have certain specific needs relating to their disability.  If everything is thrown in together, the voices of different groups can get lost.  Having strong groups like AsIAm and other groups is really important from the point of view of getting their experiences across to the NDA.</p> <p>  The NDA has referred to the implementation in public buildings and public areas.  Does it have the staffing levels to have an impact?  What levels of staffing would it need?  What experience and level of education would be needed for that sort of thing?  We need not just guidelines but statutory instruments in the planning process.</p><p>We know that builders will not adhere to many of the guidelines.  I will leave it at that and ask the witnesses for their feedback.  What do they want this committee to do and how can we work with them on these issues?</p></speech>

I want to compliment the Houses of the Oireachtas for moving quickly on representations made to it.  The ILMI made a presentation in the audiovisual room two weeks ago but we found it inaccessible for speakers who use wheelchairs.  This was brought to the attention of those in charge of the workings of the Oireachtas and it will be remedied immediately.  Inaccessibility is often not discovered because we have not been to a place but as we go to more places, people realise that something needs to be done.</p> <p>  On the NTA and our good colleagues at Dublin Bus, the former Minister for Transport, Shane Ross, made it a requirement that a disabled person be on the boards of Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, the NTA and CI&Eacute;.  I am a member of the board of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII and at the moment we are looking improving the toilet facilities at all motorway service stations so that there are accessible changing rooms in those service stations.  </p> <p>  Being involved and engaged is the way forward.  One thing this committee could do is to encourage local councillors and local authorities to engage.  Members of this committee are committed to these issues but at local authority level, what one often sees is enthusiasm in pursuing things like cycling facilities, which is fair and right, but the enthusiasts want minimum regulation.  On a pedestrianised street like Grafton Street, for example, those who want to bring a bicycle or a scooter should walk.  There should be an insistence that what is pedestrianised is for pedestrians.  Not all cyclists adhere to the rules.  We would like to see the Oireachtas committee on transport, for example, give consideration to issues affecting people who are less mobile and that includes children.  A more collaborative approach is needed.  When we were working at European level, we looked at ease of mobility in the context of ramps for older people and people pushing prams and buggies.  The focus was not solely on providing facilities for people with disabilities but on universal design, as was mentioned by Dr. Hartney, Dr. Craddock and Dr. Fitzpatrick.  The aim is to include everybody.</p> <p>  Finally, on the Deputy's question about RT&Eacute;, that organisation is living up to its commitment to provide a number of programmes with audio description, mostly on RT&Eacute; Junior.  I was delighted recently to get a copy of "Kiva Can Do" as my grandson voices some of the character parts in it.  If the Deputy has 15 minutes to spare, she should look at "Kiva Can Do", which has audio description on it.  That is a good way to introduce audio description to a younger population who are not disabled.</p></speech>

On local authorities and guidance on how to improve performance in public buildings, one of the projects we have under way at the moment is the development of a code of practice for accessible public buildings.  In our process to develop that we are taking a very consultative approach, which speaks to some of the points the Deputy made about how to encompass the full range of experience without diminishing the needs of individual groups.  The code of practice will talk about how to maximise accessibility and then it will be broken down into what might be necessary for people with autism or for people with visual impairment, for example, on making sure Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpreters are available for those who are deaf and so on.  It will provide some guidance for the individual requirements but also talk about accessibility as a universal concept.  That is just one example of how we approach it.</p> <p>  Local authorities do not tend to come directly to us but what we do is make submissions to, and offer advice on, the local development plans when they come up for consultation.  We are always available to offer advice.  In terms of the staffing competencies we need to deliver on that advice, when the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design was established 17 years ago, it was established with Dr. Craddock as the chief officer, with three advisers underneath him.  It has not expanded since then.  The centre has done significant work in promoting an awareness of the concept of universal design and the fact that we are talking about it here today is testament to that.  What is needed to turn the concept into implementation is technical guidance on how to break that down in the various domain areas.  We would need technical competency in architecture and built environment skills as well as in areas such as ICT, such as what Dr. Fitzpatrick brings to the table, communications and product design.  The aim is to build that so we can work with more bodies to help them on their implementation journey.  That is what is required but we are not an enforcement body.  We are an advisory body and our key strength is offering guidance that is grounded in practical and evidence-based research.</p></speech>

We link quite regularly with the NDA through its various consultation processes.  I want to compliment the authority on the new consultation guidelines that were published last week.  A huge amount of time was spent engaging with our community, with autistic young people, around what those guidelines should look like.  That bodes well for the future and the ongoing conversations we will be having around some of these topics.</p></speech>

The big issue for me is that every single parent I know who has a child with autism seems to have to run an individual campaign to fight for his or her child's rights.  That is why I am a member of this committee but I want to listen to the people who have a lot more experience and hear from them what we need to do to help.  At the end of the day, I do not have any personal experience in this area.  I have friends who have children with autism but all of them seem to have to fight individual battles.  It is just insane.  We need to find a uniform way of helping and I am glad that we have this committee.  I must commend the Chairman on creating this committee so that we can focus on finding some sort of system to support the people who need it.

In this committee we have tried to foreground the social model understanding of disability.  That is relevant to this discussion as we can see how poorly designed systems create barriers.  While many of the issues we deal with come down to a lack of public services or personal assistance, today we are examining matters that could be resolved through good and inclusive design.  I was struck by the numerous examples that Mr. Kenny gave of accessibility, which was very impactful.</p> <p>  My question is for the ILMI and AsIAm.  As disabled persons' organisations, DPOs, what is their level of engagement with Government Departments and public bodies in the development of policies, practices and laws that impact their members?  Article 4 of the UNCRPD requires engagement on legislation and policies relating to persons with disabilities, but from all I have heard, this is rarely adhered to.</p><p>When it came to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, the most alarming parts of the legislation arose from non-consultations with designated public officials, DPOs, and people directly affected.  I understand Article 4 should extend to all areas, such as transport infrastructure, involving Transport Infrastructure Ireland working with our guests in developing requirements for public transport vehicles, or for all State bodies to seek input in making websites fully accessible.  Are Departments and public bodies engaging with these groups?  In relation to that, what is their capacity as organisations to carry out that kind of work and what type of no-strings-attached funding and support should the Government be giving these organisations to allow them to operate independently and to fulfil all those roles?  So many of the issues discussed today could be avoided if the State complied with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#K00300"><p>I will focus on what Senator Garvey was saying on what we would call the human interest-framed stories.  This is something that ties in with my own academic background research.  While I am a disabled person, my background is in journalism and political communication, which I have been able to bring into my voluntary work.  To remind people, I am not a staff member.  I am a volunteer activist who has other commitments on top of what I do in my spare time.</p> <p>  On the human interest stories and how often disabled people or autistic people are framed in the media, there has been a trajectory of human interest stories and emotively framed stories.  As it happens, recently I published an open-source academic article.  While it is not particularly relevant to what Senator Garvey is asking about, it is entitled, "How 'cocooning' as a public health measure was reported during the Covid-19 crisis" in Ireland throughout 2020.  While I accept it is a niche study, I found some interesting trends, some of which were not surprising to me, in that cocooning, let us say, as a public health measure, was very much reported on as a human interest emotive feature.  Of the sample of coverage that I analysed, I found that there was four times the number of human interest-framed stories than reports that I deemed to be particularly informative.  Consequently, we have a trajectory of people feeling that they needed to share their private lives, as I did last year in relation PhD scholarships, to bring about some kind of awareness.  It is not a sustainable model of advocacy, both in my personal and academic opinion.</p> <p>  It is not that I want to vilify newsmakers either but there is also research which was conducted in Ireland recently that shows that newsmakers, a term which includes editors, journalists and news executives, know that interviewing an autistic person, a parent of an autistic child or a disabled person and constructing a story like that is the type of story that is low in cost.  Getting someone to tell his or her story is a low-resource form of reporting and typically gets engagement because it invokes a sense of emotion.  While personal stories are important, I would be curious, perhaps after my current research project, and interested in a subject I invite others to consider, namely, the effects of private citizens sharing their personal stories in the media.  Research shows that when people share their personal stories in the media, it contributes to action by Government.  In terms of the audiences who engage with those stories, research proves that it shifts attitudes from an individual issue to a wider social, political or cultural issue.  It can be effective but at what cost?</p> <p>  Bringing it back to my opening statement on people having the right to live with privacy, dignity and discretion, for disabled people, and possibly for autistic people - I might ask Mr. Harris to chip in on that - that is a privilege I have not enjoyed, even before the PhD issue that I had.</p> <p>  Lastly, while joint committees obviously cannot influence how journalists and section editors do their jobs, the media is so important because we get mediated messages through the media.  That is how we know what was happening in the budget this week.  It is where we got our information on anything to do with Covid over the past couple of years.  While the sample of coverage in my research was not deemed to be particular informative in terms of information-rich reporting on cocooning, I would welcome people taking a read of that article.  It is publicly available.</p> <p>  It is worth considering Government communication strategies because journalists and media people such as me can only work on what is available.  If certain Departments or Ministers are not prioritised behind the scenes in the Government communications strategy on any given issue, they will not have the platform to be able to come out to speak on these platforms.  That is why political communication is important.  It includes the media sphere, the political sphere and also us as a public.</p> <p>  Sorry, I meant to keep it briefer than that but it is something I am particularly interested in.  We need to consider the harm caused by private people, who have other things to do in their days and weeks, and lives, coming out.  I do not believe it is sustainable, although I understand why it happens.  I understand why people feel they need to come out because I myself have had to do it.  I understand why it happens, but maybe another committee meeting might consider how we raise issues, particularly, maybe, for people who are not involved in, aware of or a member of DPOs.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.801" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#K00500"><p>In terms of the level of engagement we see from Departments, as I alluded to earlier, we see some really good engagement in some places, and it is proactive and is very much an ongoing engagement.  In other instances, we see less engagement.  What that partially comes to is that ongoing dance between the desire to centralise and have a strong centralised disability policy on the one hand and every Department realising this is still for everybody as well on the other .  We need space to strategically think about disability but it is a job for every Department as well under the UNCRPD.  That is very much a culture piece that still needs to be worked on.</p> <p>  The other concern I have is that often consultations are not accessible.  That is why these new NDA guidelines are important.  I have been at round-table discussions on autism in loud rooms with no quiet space with minimal information in advance and that does not get the best out of everyone.  Not only that, it does not show respect for the people who are coming to offer their expertise.</p> <p>  What we have to think about is that disabled people are very often called on to be consulted frequently.  Not everybody within the disability community is interested in getting or has the capacity to get involved in these issues.  It is often a small cohort of volunteer advocates who are being invited to a huge amount of meetings.</p><p>We need to think more about how we can resource and support people to do that.  The reality is that many people within our community are still living on a disability allowance that, even after the increase in the budget, is offensive.  It is not possible to live a decent life on it.  When people are being asked to travel long distances, there is an expense aspect to that that needs to be considered as well.</p><p> In respect of our own organisation and where we struggle a little, we have one policy officer and we get approximately half of that person's salary contributed.  That is the sole resourcing we have for our policy work.  Every year we have our own work plan.  For example, this year we are preparing a report on access to education in autism, looking specifically at suspension, expulsion and reduced timetables.  One of the challenges is that we also have to respond to whatever pops up on the news, such as the issues with schools and CAMHS that arose during the summer.  We also get sudden surprises from an Oireachtas committee or a Department wanting to consult with us.  All of those opportunities are very welcome, but with one person they are very hard to manage.  That is a challenge.</p><p> On the point that Ms Gallagher asked me to chip in on, I very much agree with everything that she said.  I will definitely read the paper.  For us, the depiction of autistic people in the media is an ongoing challenge.  Sometimes it can be really positive, and we even see positive shifts in popular culture.  I can even point to the fact that the Thomas the Tank Engine "Thomas &amp;amp; Friends" series will soon feature an autistic train called Bruno the Brake Car, actually voiced by a nine-year-old autistic boy in the UK.  These sorts of initiatives are important.  However, when we look at the media every week we are told that there is a new cause for autism or read some sensational headline.  Very negative language can be used about autism at times, which does stigmatise and damage.  There is a need to have more media education.  I think that is most important.</p></speech>

It is an opportunity to actually talk about the UNCRPD implementation plan.  We have all heard about the UNCRPD, but in respect of its implementation, any implementation plan needs to be in line with the SMART policy framework, whereby our policies need to be strategic, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.  It is a policy framework that a lot of the DPOs, through the DPO network, work together on.  That SMART framework allows us to look at how the policies should be strategic and measurable.  The NDIS, for example, is a very broad policy with lots of actions and themes.  It is really important that we go back to looking at how our policies can be SMART in their implementation.  The framework can align really well with the articles of the UNCRPD, and thematically be sorted to fit in with all our intersectionalities as well.  It is important that Deputy Cairns raised the issue, because our policies need to align with the articles of the UNCRPD.  We must be SMART in our approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.804" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Desmond Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#L00300"><p>I want to amplify what Mr. Cawley said in response to Deputy Cairns, which has also been touched on by Mr. Harris.  We participate in consultative processes, and as Mr. Harris said, some of us travel distances, at some expense, to do so.  Meetings are also held during working hours, and if you are fortunate enough to have a job as a disabled person, your employer does not take too lightly to you taking time off.  I know we have to look for an answer to the Deputy's question.  The resourcing of DPOs has to be seen as an integral part of the way forward.  We spend nearly &euro;2 billion on service provision that has been analysed to the nth degree in terms of value for money in different reports over the decades.  It does not change.  The language around separation changes.  I may get into some trouble for saying this, but we have what I would call an industry around disability that continues, by accident, to create a dependency on it, rather than liberating us through they type of things we have been talking about today.  It can happen by accident that somehow or other the liberation that has been won gets accidentally sidetracked into other areas by campaigning parents who rightly cry out loud because of neglect.  It is appalling that the media should be used, because of the ineptitude of people responding or people who are deliberately deaf to what is going on, to shift the dial to a point where there could be perception that segregated education is best for all disabled people, and not specifically one set of disabled people.  It took decades to get the Department of Education to agree that children with disabilities should be educated in their local schools, rather than in St. Mary's, Baldoyle, the Central Remedial Clinic or St. Joseph's School for the Blind.  There is a danger that somehow, in the rightful arguing for a special place for children who might have autism, that could be swept up by planners who are not thinking or consulting, into a generality that segregated education is where people should go.  Support for segregated education shifts could also mean that in the case of my grandson, for example, who has Down's syndrome, the speech therapy services he has access to in going to an inclusive school will be taken away, and his family will have to find the funds to pay for the therapy.  The rightful response to the neglect and huge policy deficits has swept everything away along with it.  There is an accidental shift behind it.</p></speech>

My question comes from personal lived experience.  I went on a personal journey as a parent and a carer.  Due to the fact that my son had an unusual medical condition, we, as a family, did not belong to any grouping, as it were, for example, Down's syndrome or cerebral palsy.  I only have knowledge of our own journey and the challenges that confronted my son.  It is only since I was elected that I have become more aware of the broader concerns within our community.  I have met a number of DPOs thus far.  It is becoming clearer to me that those who lead and drive the DPOs, including the spokespersons and the people who are most visible, need to be from the disability community.  How do we support the DPOs as a committee?  How do we ensure that we get to the point - and this is something that I feel very passionate about - where these issues are not led by service providers?  A representative of one of the DPOs told me that having the service providers represent the interests of disabled persons is like having employers' groups, such as IBEC, representing workers at the Labour Court.  Workers do not want to be represented by employers' groups; they want to be represented by trade unions and have their own voices.  That is my interpretation, by way of a clumsy analogy, insofar as I can read myself into the situation.  How can we support DPOs to be front and centre?  I know from some of my meetings that funding seems to be a core issue.  There needs to be a great deal of financial support provided.  I imagine that will be part of the response.</p><p>I congratulate Des Kenny on a great article in <i>The Irish Times </i>this week.  I am just sorry that it was in the health section.  It should have been in the main part of the newspaper.  I also congratulate Catherine Gallagher and thank her for her contribution this morning.</p></speech>

We are conscious that there many people who do not wish to belong to a DPO or who do not have a DPO for the particular disability with which they are concerned.  Our advice and practice is to try to cast the net as widely as possible, in addition to consulting with DPOs, because it is important to capture as many perspectives as possible in order that they can inform the advice we give to Government or the guidance we develop.  We agree that the funding model needs to be examined.  I understand that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is looking at that now as part of a development of a longer-term UNCRPD implementation strategy.</p></speech>

In some way, Aideen Hartney touched on it.  There are go-to organisations for the blind and the deaf and the wheelchair user.  This committee, going forward, could insist that all of those organisations - a bit like the two Houses of the Oireachtas - create their own senate of people with disabilities within those organisations to whom they can commit time and State resources, which they receive in copious amounts, to creating that voice for a disability and then we can look to sweep that disability classification up into a generality of the DPOs.  Separate organisations would ultimately amalgamate into DPOs.  The Independent Living Movement Ireland is a cross-disability DPO.  That is the way it has to go forward.  There is a commonality of need and remedy that we could be wastefully dissipating if we do not, first of all, look for the segregation of organisations into creating a voice for their disabled service users and then amalgamating that into DPOs.   That is frightfully important.</p></speech>

Covid is always on my brain, unfortunately, because of what I research.  Covid is still very much with us but there will come a time where we will enter a post-Covid society and country.  In times of crisis and after times of crisis, history tells us that it is an opportunity to lay down a new foundation of how we want to live, treat people and work.  Even the fact that I am here tuning in remotely might not have been possible before.</p> <p>  We hear terms such as work-life balance.  Disabled people have been calling for remote working for a very long time.  It was only when everyone, overnight, was in a collective global crisis that accessibility was granted to everybody.  I know there were challenges in an online world and it does not work for everybody but accessibility can benefit everyone and it is all our interest.</p> <p>  Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, is an example of a cross-impairment DPO.  I have known people in ILMI and other DPOs I am involved in for the past two or three years and I have no clue of what those friends' conditions are, because we talk of the collective experience of being disabled.  I am physically disabled but I am not a wheelchair user.  However, I often have concerns that would be similar to those a wheelchair user would experience.  Similar points were made about acoustics and sound.  As my impairment affects my balance, I find it harder to concentrate going through crowds when it is very loud or if it is too bright or too dark.  With regard to supporting DPOs, it is important to have us involved at every stage of every process and mot just in the middle and not just at the end.  We should be front and centre and, as Senator Clonan was saying, told from the beginning and involved from the brainstorming sessions.</p> <p>  There is a point that I make when it comes to engagement.  A dialogic form of communication should be used whereby DPOs and ordinary private citizens in who might not be attached to an organisation are brought in to communicate and a safe, accessible and close environment is created where people feel that they can contribute.  Disabled people are part of a community we can see has had a history of belonging, unfortunately, to the spiral of silence.  This idea comes up in the social sciences of this idea there are multiple examples in that people identify with belonging to a community that has been oppressed and discriminated against and has not been listened to.  There is a history there with disabled and autistic people.  It is a history that hurts.</p> <p>  If I was to sit and think about it for long enough and how, unfortunately, parts of history are still with us, it would be incredibly upsetting.  Disabled people and DPOs should be front and centre at every stage.  It is not just about just.  Disabled people should be hired.  The members' should hire disabled people in their parties and areas of work.  We should be hired.</p> <p>  I do not want to single out or vilify anyone or go on a witch-hunt but I see a considerable amount of information online published by political parties and politicians without captions or screenshots of budget information without alt text.  Maybe if they had a disabled person on their team who had a qualification in communications, that person would be more than able to point that out and capable of pointing that out, without having to think about it for too long.</p> <p>  We are very much here.  Of course there are difficulties with us entering the work force and that is a conversation for another day but we are very much here.  Whether it is DPOs as organisations or disabled people as potential workers or collaborators, there is a talent pool.  I always say is that if one has an organisation - not necessarily one that looks at disabled issues - or decides to create a communications or engineering organisation or business, having disabled people with qualifications in roles in communications, business, finance, education, sustainability and management in that organisation would put many people out of a job.</p><p>It involves being able to think outside the box.  Unfortunately, based on my experience as an early career academic, I feel people do not see me as competition - not that I am a particularly combative personality.  It is important to bear in mind that disabled people are part of the talent pool and if you are not tapping into disabled people, you are not tapping into the full complement of the talent pool.</p></speech>

We all know that DPOs are led by and are for disabled people.  There are specifics there around 4.3.29B and general comment 7 of the UNCRPD.  It is really important to state that our communities can amplify the work of DPOs.  If we look at the personal assistant service, we can see it is still not a legal right in Ireland for disabled people.  Sometimes there is a misconception that this is just an issue for disabled people.  It is not.  It is a human rights and equality issue.  We need to make sure we can mobilise our communities to ensure that they are bringing issues like personal assistant services and inaccessible housing and transport to our Deputies and councillors all the way from the grassroots up to national level and back down again.  This is how we will see movement in rights and services that allow disabled people to have choice and control over their lives.  Regarding when we see allies coming along to amplify those issues, for example, if Deputies and Senators could go back to the Minister and say the personal assistant service is one that allows disabled people to have choice and control over their lives from a human rights perspective.  It is really important that we state that people can amplify the work of DPOs while we are doing that led by lived experience as well.  We would be happy to engage with allies who would love to work to progress this and other issues as a human rights and equality issue.  It is a great question.</p></speech>

I will focus on capacity building, which is particularly important.  The reality for autistic people is that they must advocate on two dimensions all the time.  They are all constantly engaged in battles just for own lives, services and supports.  At the same time, there is the broader, more collective effort concerning shifting policy and consultation.  There are many autistic young people.  One of the realities is that from a young age, autistic people are not being given the tools to articulate what their needs are and to understand their needs not as a nuisance or difficulty but a need they have a right to have met.  A lot of work must be done starting with very young people around giving them a positive self-identity.  This in turn will lead them to feel more confident and assertive around their rights and set them up better around the engagement with DPOs.  As people grow up, more needs to be done to train and support autistic people around engaging in self-advocacy.  When people and DPOs are engaged in consultations, part of how we make sure it is not tokenistic is by making sure there is support there that can support and facilitate people's participation through the process.</p></speech>

I was speaking in the D&aacute;il so I had to chase out so if I ask a question that has already been asked, please let me know.  We are told the obligations and duties of public bodies are clear.  They are fairly simple and straightforward.  There are common things that people get wrong.  How easy would it be to deal with some of the more common and straightforward ones?  In that context, how can the witnesses be both proactive and reactive?  Perhaps somebody needs a certain amount of assistance or guidance.  Not everybody knows about Web design.  I would put myself at the top of that list.  What is the witnesses' role in being proactive as well as reactive?  What sanctions are there, if any, particularly for repeat offenders?</p> <p>  My next question is for the witnesses from Independent Living Movement Ireland.  I support what Senator Clonan said about DPOs 100%.  He said it - I do not need to repeat it - but that is a crucial point.  They must be independent.  "Nothing about us without us" is a phrase that trips off all our tongues but that is the reality of having DPOs.  That is their job.  That is what they do.  My specific question concerns cycling and the promotion of cycling, which was mentioned.  Many people like to cycle.  It is good for their health, etc., but it does present a challenge for visually impaired, blind and older people who are no longer as nimble on their feet as they once were.  Have there been any talks taken place between Independent Living Movement Ireland and organisations that promote cycling?  Is there any way we can begin to find solutions before the problem just blows up?  We have already seen it between car drivers and cyclists.  We all share a common space and must find ways to make it work.  Is anything happening in this space?  </p> <p>  I will address my next question to Mr. Cawley.  In other countries, people are taking a human rights approach to this.  Could he briefly outline some of that.  My next question is addressed to Mr. Harris.  I was impressed by his candour when he spoke about the fact that accommodation and adjustment for people with autism cannot be codified in the same way as physical adjustments, etc., and that needs can vary and sometimes even conflict.  That is just the reality.  Can Mr. Harris elaborate on that?  Am I asking too much when I ask whether there are common denominators?  Are there things that can be put in place that might not work for everybody all the time but begin that journey?</p></speech>

We took over the role of national monitoring centre for the web accessibility directive in January 2021.  Last year, we monitored over 300 websites on a weekly basis.  In-depth monitoring of 56 websites, including mobile applications, showed that common errors include colour contrast.  It is a significant issue.</p><p>We found that on more than 70% of the websites we monitor, or in the region of 150,000 to 200,000 pages weekly, colour contrast is a significant issue.  PDFs are the bane of many people's lives, particularly those with disabilities, for whom they are a significant problem.  Online forms and form-filling are also a significant barrier for many people, not only in terms of the language used but also their accessibility and usability.</p><p> As part of the proactive approach, we work closely with the Irish Computer Society.  Last year, we ran ten online training programmes.  We can send members a link to those if they would like to try them out.  They are approximately one hour long and kind of lunch-and-learn sessions.  We had more than 1,000 public officials engaged on the training last year.  We are being proactive on that.</p><p> On cycling, we have made progress as a nation.  We started off by having spaces that were shared between pedestrians and cyclists.  Since then, we have learned, particularly from looking at Denmark in recent years, that cyclists need to be segregated from pedestrians and a physical barrier between them created.  The physical space we have in cities is very restricted for what we are trying to implement in terms of having preference for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.  We have been working closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Gary Kearney has been mentioned several times at the committee.  He is very much the eyes and ears in terms of what is happening in Dublin, anyone who has engaged with him will now.  Probably the best practice we have seen is out of San Francisco.  We have engaged with the NTA on looking at some of the designs.  In particular, the issue of getting to the kerb, which came up earlier, is significant not only for people with disabilities, but also for older people and children.  I traverse a very crowded area every morning to get to public transport and I see the major difficulties in that regard.  There is work to be done.  We are looking at best practice internationally on that and engaging on it regularly not only with the NTA but also with other key stakeholders.  Cyclists are very much part of those discussions because it is pointless talking about the pedestrian space unless you are talking to cyclists. </p><p> I will hand over to Dr. Fitzpatrick to discuss sanctions, particularly under the European Accessibility Act which is upon us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.817" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#O00200"><p>I thank Dr. Craddock.  The European Accessibility Act is currently undergoing transposition activities.  It is a European directive that aims to provide a much more homogenised approach, or to resolve diversification and divergent accessibility standards across nation states and bring everything into one market with the objective of creating more widely available accessible products and services for people with disabilities and also affording businesses and organisations the facility to sell their products and services into a larger market.  As noted, there are sanctions as part of the Act.  They are not seen as the only solution but very much as an aid to inform and penalise under-performing organisations.  The Act is clear that the sanctions need to be proportionate, and designed in such a way that they are not seen as an alternative by companies that decide they do not want to make a product or service accessible and will just pay the fine or take the hit.  It is important to realise that, in any kind of accessible design, mindset is the key to making something accessible.  If one can get across to the organisations that are providing services, designing services or products or manufacturing products that if they make the product or service accessible, that will greatly increase their market share, in addition to them having the moral obligation to do so, it plays to the strengths of organisations.  The sanctions are in place and play a part but it is equally important to get that mindset right.  There is a lot of cross-government and cross-departmental work, led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, on this topic to identify appropriate sanctions and penalties and also to give appropriate guidance to organisations on how to make their products and services accessible and how to conform with the requirements of the Act, which will start to come into force in June 2025.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.818" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Desmond Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#O00300"><p>We are a light-touch society when it comes to regulations and sanctions.  Dr. Craddock mentioned the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, in America.  It has sanctions such that if one does not do as obliged under the Act, one can end up in court.  The committee should seek to have introduced the protocol to the UNCRPD that was not included in Ireland's ratification of it.  If that protocol were in place, we would be talking about actions that people can take as individuals for infringement of their rights rather than having to go and have them mitigated through charities or your good selves on the committee or the NDA.  We have to work on the basis that what has come forward through the UNCRPD are individual rights that have to be delivered to each individual, and each individual has a right of recourse including having sanctions imposed on those who do not adhere to their obligations.  It should not be a light touch or do it when you get around to it approach.  It should be done because that is what you have to do and if you do not, there will be sanctions.</p> <p>  It is very difficult to engage with the cyclist lobby because the cyclist, at present, is an enthusiast.  They are like ourselves.  Cyclists are advocates of something that has been denied to them.  They are a lost population of people who felt victimised by motorists or whoever else in the past.  The freedom they are now trying to win for the bicycle as a means of transport is all-important to them.  Nobody wants to listen to the difficulties.  The NDA can talk to the NTA about a cycling code and point out that shared space is difficult, but planners in the various local authorities will then decide that they cannot stop cyclists at bus stops because that would be too dangerous, so they will let the cyclists go through the bus stop, as it were.  Those getting off the bus then have to rely on the goodwill and learning of individual cyclists.  Let us not forget that this is a new discipline for people, particularly young people, in terms of knowing when to give way to a pedestrian.  The Minister is in no way interested in sanctions for cyclists.  He will not penalise them in any way, no matter what representations are made to him on those who are invading pedestrianised spaces.  Whatever about moving cars off the streets, moving pedestrians off the streets is a totally different matter.  Many people turn a blind eye to it and do not consider it to be something that should be sanctioned.  It can be sanctioned.  If one does it in other countries, one's bicycle will be confiscated and one will have to go to a police station to reclaim it.  That is how they identify those cycling in areas reserved for pedestrians.  We may have to do something like that in this country.  </p> <p>  May I make a final comment regarding the employment of disabled people?  The NDA gave a good example of practice in the context of the number of people with disabilities who are employed.  There are 40,000 people employed in the sector looking after disabled people.  As all of those organisations see each of their coterie of clients as specific to themselves, their employment ratio of disabled people is phenomenally low.  In the context of their employment of disabled people, a 6% quota should be imposed on organisations that are receiving statutory funding.</p><p>Such organisations should look beyond their disability coterie, where somebody working in the area of residential intellectual disability would employ somebody with autism or whatever to carry out the jobs that can be done by other disabled people.  Somebody with an intellectual disability can do less arduous jobs in an organisation such as the Irish Wheelchair Association.  We have got to open that up as an employment opportunity for disabled people.  We cannot look to others all the time to do things for us.  We have the answer to many of the questions ourselves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.820" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#P00200"><p>The point around codification, and even contradiction or conflict, is very interesting.  It is important to say that while the needs of every autistic person will be different, the domains we need to consider from a design point of view will very often be common or shared.  There are some instances where the needs will contradict but not necessarily conflict, which is an important point to make.  We are trying to create an environment that is as supportive a canvas as possible for an autistic person whatever his or her needs might be.</p> <p>  It is also about empowering the individual to make choices.  If people know what an environment is like, they then have the ability to apply additional tools in order to make that environment more manageable for them.  For example, if a very calm environment is created, an autistic person who needs additional stimulation can then, if that individual knows in advance, choose to bring headphones that have music playing to help them to navigate that environment.  People will have heard of personal protective equipment, PPE, during the pandemic.  Very often, people have sensory PPE that they need to use on a day-to-day basis.  If they know about the environment and are empowered to use that sensory PPE in advance, that can go a long way.</p> <p>  We should think about some of the domains within the aspects framework I mentioned, for example, escape space.  The reality is that if an escape space is created within the environment, one autistic person might use it because lighting has become overwhelming for that individual.  Another autistic person might use it because of certain smells in the environment and another because they have spent too much time talking to an individual.  If we think about safety, certain safety considerations can be important for an autistic person.  By putting them generally in place, a person who does not have that safety concern will not be disadvantaged in any way.  To respond to Dr. Craddock's point, it is more about putting in place a mindset around how we think about design as opposed to it having to be a one-size-fits-all model.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.822" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#P00400"><p>I thank the witnesses.  I was struck by what Mr. Harris said in his introduction about being equal, valued and accepted, and the use of the words "accessible" and "inclusive".  That applies across all disabilities and it is what we have to strive for.  Both committees have to make sure the Government puts the funding in place and makes changes to ensure we have a society like that.  There was a significant increase in the disability budget to &euro;2.4 million yesterday, which I welcome, but it is still not enough.  For parents on waiting lists for assessments of needs, in particular, an extra &euro;39 million has been set aside to try to clear the backlog of thousands of children throughout the country who are still waiting for such an assessment.</p> <p>  There have been changes.  Supermarkets now have a two-hour slot where the light is dimmed and the audio is down.  A lot of changes have been made but one issue I have found, and I have written to every local authority about it, is the fact we do not have any hidden disability car parking places.  We have disability car parking places, for which there must be a badge on the car, but there is none for hidden disability.  Something that I would like to push on is that every local authority, when putting in new parking places, would place them adjacent to a disability space for parents, beside a supermarket or whatever.  That is something that needs to be put in place.  We have made moves on this with regard to Leinster House.  I spoke to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il in the past week.  Sometimes, things can move very slowly within the Government so we want to speed that up and implement it over the next number of weeks.  When witnesses come to our committee and to Leinster House, some of whom are autistic persons, it is important that it should be in place.  We are ten years behind Stormont.  That is not acceptable.</p> <p>  I welcome the DCU project.  I look forward to seeing that rolled out throughout the country and across all third level institutions.  Many advances have been made and funding has been put in place by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science as regards putting in sensory rooms and making our third level colleges more accessible for young autistic persons.  Work on 20 autism-friendly towns was mentioned.  We should put funding in place to make sure that every town in the country is an autism- and disability-friendly town.  That is a minimum.</p> <p>  I have a couple of points and questions.  I apologise if I am going on too long.  Mr. Kenny mentioned EVs.  I am a father of young children and the sound of EVs and, in particular, not being able to hear them, is an issue.  I ask for a comment on that.  On the census, I firmly believe we need to change the form so we can future-proof our need for services.  We have an issue at present regarding our children's disability network teams, where we do not have a significant number of professionals, such as occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, coming through our system.  That is the fault of the HSE.  It is not future-proofing the supply of professionals we need across those teams to provide services for children.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that the NDA is the only organisation of its kind in the world.  In the NDA's interaction with the Government and implementation of what it proposes, where are the blockages for it not being implemented?</p> <p>  I have a question on housing for Mr. Cawley, my fellow proud Longfordian, who I have known for a long number of years and who is a very strong advocate.  We spoke about local authorities building houses.  Are we building houses that are accessible?  Do they have level-access showers downstairs and so on?  It is not happening enough.  We have to put significant funding in place to adapt houses at a later date.  If level-access showers were put into every single house, we would not have to adapt houses at a later stage.  I ask for comments on those points.</p></speech>

The regulation regarding sound - the acoustic vehicle alerting system, AVAS - was explored through a combined study in America and the EU involving the big motoring manufacturers in order to come up with a sound that did not sound like something from outer space, but had the right type of pitch and sound.  It was hoped that it would not be something that people with autism would find difficult but would be such that it would alert them to the movement of the car when the car was travelling below 20 km per hour.  This was on the basis that if it was faster, they would hear the tyres of the car.  In addition, that system was to be designed in such a way that it could not be turned off.  It was to be an inherent part of the car that the sound could not be switched off at any stage.  Otherwise, the danger would be that it would stay switched off.  There are commitments from the Department of Transport, and from the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Minister in that Department, that this will be adhered to in Ireland but, again, it falls between the stools so it is not done at present.  That is where it came from and it has been explored and agreed to by the manufacturers.  As far as I know, it is fitted to all EVs now coming into the country.</p></speech>

I have never heard the word, "Longfordian", before.  Does Mr. Cawley want to make a comment to his fellow Longfordian?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.827" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Cawley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022092900002#P00900"><p>Of course.  I would love to.  I thank Senator Carrigy for the question.</p><p>The key thing we must remember is the same people are being hit with a crisis in housing, the energy crisis and the cost-of-living crisis.  The question was asked as to whether housing is always accessible.  The answer is that it is not.  The question was also asked as to whether housing is always affordable for disabled people.  Again the answer is that it is not.  We welcomed the national housing strategy for disabled people launched at the start of the year.  It covers the period from 2022 to 2027.  It looks at having strategic plans in all local authority areas.  We welcome that disabled people and disabled person organisations are getting on the local authority housing disability steering groups that are tasked with the local strategic plans.  We need to see the implementation of these plans.  We need to make sure more houses are accessible and built to an accessible universal design standard to enable disabled people to live in them.  We often say that one issue is to have the four walls of a house but another issue is the system.  We have raised this in many of our reports, which we can circulate to the members.  It seem to be the systems, policies and structures that exclude disabled people from living true independent lives.  An example is that people applying for houses quite often cannot get independent living supports to match it.</p><p> Another issue is the misconception held by many people that disabled people occupy only social housing.  There are disabled people who are trying to access private rental accommodation and trying to buy privately.  We are locked out of the market.  Affordability is not tied to what we are.  It is tied to the market value.  We could spend the whole meeting speaking about the housing issues that disabled people face.  These are some of the high-level issues.  It would be great to get more interagency collaboration on them so that disabled people can live independently.</p></speech>

I will hand over to Dr. Fitzpatrick, who has something to say about the census and Dr. Craddock, who has something to say about the sounds of electric vehicles and scooters.  The Centre for Excellence in Universal Design is the only statutory centre of its type in the world.  Even the National Disability Authority is unique.  There is no comparable organisation in other European countries.  Often disability advice and guidance is encompassed in a governmental department.  We are very pleased to be able to be a resource to the Government in this respect.</p> <p>  The Co-Chairman, Senator Carrigy, asked where some of the sticking points are.  There has a lot of progress recently in the take-up of advice and guidance and a willingness to implement and realise the rights of people with disabilities.  Where we see most of the challenges arise is where there is a need for cross-departmental collaboration.  These hurdles are still very difficult to overcome.  Often these issues are tied to budget lines being siloed and no mechanisms in place to share budgets and share ways of working to overcome some of the disability challenges that can cross the entire span of life.</p> <p>  On the request to have autism friendly or disability friendly towns, we have worked on a tool with the NTA and other stakeholders.  This is the walkability audit tool we have developed.  We piloted it in Kilrush and the local authority was able to use the findings of the audit to secure funding to make a large number of improvements in the town.  It is now very much more disability friendly.  This is something that could assist the Co-Chairman, Senator Carrigy, in this quest.</p></speech>

I will correct the record on this if necessary but to the very best of my knowledge it was not possible to complete the most recent census in any form other than paper.  As members can imagine, this excluded a significant number of visually-impaired people from being able to complete it independently.  I have several anecdotal pieces of evidence from myself, friends and acquaintances.  We very much welcome that the census will move online.  It highlights a very interesting point which Mr. Harris mentioned earlier.  It is very important that various modalities can be used by people to acquire information or to complete forms.  I will give a quick example.  We have specific requirements regarding the forthcoming European accessibility act to make answering the 112 emergency services number accessible to include real-time text or real-time video.  This is a great example of what can be done by working at European level and the importance of a multimodal approach.  People may still like to complete the census form on paper.  There may be people with low technical literacy or who simply do not want to do it online and find it more comfortable to write.  Having only this modality available excludes a significant number of individuals.  This is why the NDA very much welcomes the fact that various modalities will be available.</p></speech>

I echo Mr. Kenny's comment on electric vehicles, particularly on having a sound system built in.  Deputy Harkin made a point on cyclists.  We have a big issue with e-scooters taking over the same space.  We have made representations and submissions on e-scooters particularly on their speed.  It was amazing to hear on a "Prime Time" programme that e-scooters could clock up speeds of 120 km/h.  I am not sure where they could be used.  Another issue is where they are stored.  Anybody who has been to any other European country has seen that they are just left on the sidewalk or in the middle of the road.  There should be the same set-up in cities as for the standard bicycles.  There should be a designated place where they are parked.  We have made submissions to the NTA regarding this.</p> <p>  With regard to housing, as already been mentioned we are pushing for Part M to be revised.  It needs to be updated.  Mr. Cawley mentioned that much of our housing stock must be retrofitted.  This is a huge cost.  To go back to the human rights issue, housing is a key requirement under Article 28 of the UNCRPD on independent living.</p> <p>  The world ageing report in 2015 outlined that government support, resources and capacity building are required to support and advance universal design.  Mr. Harris and Mr. Kenny have raised these issues.  The three ingredients, according to the world ageing report, are resources, capacity building and government support.  The report had us in the same sentence as Norway and Singapore with regard to advancing universal design.  We have a bit to go but it was nice to see it in the report.</p></speech>

The idea was put forward to have a disabled person on the team.  This is a good idea.  I suggest, in light of the web accessibility legislation, that this is a real business opportunity.  Such a business could be established.  An individual Deputy or a small company might not be in a position to employ somebody on the team but if they could access expertise many people would be very interested in doing so.  I apologise because I must leave the meeting to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

I worked with active travel and people with disabilities for more than 15 years in my previous job dealing with children with disabilities in active schools.  We must be very careful when we talk about cars and cyclists.  The bigger issue as I see it is that we do not even design for able-bodied people.  We have been designing for cars only.  I wish any mother who is fully able bodied and trying to cross the road with her child good luck.  I normally cycle, but as I have a foot injury I have been trying to walk around Dublin for the past few weeks and I cannot even cross the road without the light going to orange.  It is super stressful.</p> <p>  That is not to mention cyclists perhaps frightening some people.  There is a much bigger issue here.  We have best practice, which is known as universal access, and that is the one we need to talk about.  There is only one place in the entire country where one can park a disability bike.  It is in Trinity College.  We also have people with disabilities who cannot walk, but they can cycle and they use hand cycles.  We must be very careful in this discussion in how we talk about universal access and design.  There should be so much space for walking and cycling and for people with disabilities and the visually impaired.  The bigger question is how we have given so much space to metal boxes.  Have we become totally reliant on them so that we are literally not thinking outside the metal box?  We have all the different groups fighting against each other for space.  We must be very careful.</p> <p>  I know people with autism who get stressed out just trying to cross the road because of the lack of time - approximately ten seconds - that we give to the green man.  I am not disabled but I have a crutch and a big boot on my foot at the moment and I cannot cross the road in Dublin without getting stressed out.  I am not an elderly person, a person trying to cross the road with a two-year-old kid or a person with a full disability.  We have a major issue here.  We could have a whole committee just about design.  I do not think cyclists are the beginning or end of our problems because we also have people with disabilities who cannot walk who use hand cycles.  Space and how we prioritise it is a significant issue.  The question is whether it is for people, no matter what their ability or disability, or if it is for cars.  I had to say that because we must be very careful with the debate.</p></speech>

I saw her hand up but I thought it was from her earlier contribution.  Universal access is a major issue.  We must seek to incorporate everybody into society to make sure we accommodate them.</p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Autism is doing significant work and must report by the end of March 2023.  I wish the committee well.  Autism is a significant issue that must be properly addressed.  Some great work is being done in that regard.  On behalf of both committees, I thank Mr. Adam Harris, CEO of AsIAm; from the Independent Living Movement Ireland, Mr. Desmond Kenny, Ms Catherine Gallagher and Mr. James Cawley; and from the National Disability Authority, Dr. Aideen Hartney, Dr. Gerald Craddock and Dr. D&oacute;nal Fitzpatrick.</p> <p>  Every Thursday we have evidence and questions from members of the joint committee.  Today's sitting is of the two committees.  People are genuinely looking for guidance as to how we can tackle inclusivity in society and deal with the existing challenges.  All public representatives come across families, and they have their own families, and they see the challenges and barriers that exist.  A number of witnesses spoke this morning about the barriers and the challenges that exist and how we get beyond them.  We come across this daily.  Sometimes we tear our hair out trying to see how we can rectify an issue for a very genuine case.  It is only because of the work the witnesses do, the evidence they have given and their willingness to come before us and give us their honest appraisal of where things are at that we can then go on and try to do something proper for the challenges of the people we are duty-bound to represent in the autism committee and in the disability matters committee.  It is most important the witnesses keep up their work.</p> <p>  Dr. Craddock referred to a submission he made to the National Transport Authority.  I would appreciate it if he could provide a copy to the committee as I would like to follow up on it.  I urge the witnesses to keep up the good work and to keep in contact with us.  If there are things we are not doing properly, that we should be doing better or that we should be better at challenging, they should please not be afraid to come back to us and tell us.  We will come back to the witnesses for further evidence and information.  The press officer for the autism committee is also in the Gallery.</p> <p>  I thank our team and the autism committee's team.  A significant amount of work goes on behind the scenes.  It is the research and evidence the team puts together that make the committees work properly.  I urge them to keep up the good work.  We will try as best we can to make society better for people with disabilities, their families and their lived experience.</p></speech>

We welcome Senator Lynn Ruane who is substituting for Senator Alice-Mary Higgins.  Members have the option of being physically present in the committee room or joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams from their Leinster House offices but they may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members joining on Teams to mute their microphones when not making a contribution and to use the raised hand function to indicate.  All those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in respect of protection against the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar.  I also welcome from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ms Fiona O'Dea, principal officer in the company law review unit, and Ms Helena Quilty, assistant principal in the enterprise strategies unit.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must read out an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the T&aacute;naiste to make his opening statement, after which I will open the floor to members for questions and answers.  I am conscious that time is somewhat limited.  As we have only an hour, I am going to limit exchanges to six minutes per member to facilitate as many members as possible contributing in that time.</p></speech>

During the discussion I may defer to my officials on some of the issues and questions.  Both Ms O'Dea and Ms Quilty know much more about what my Department is doing on these matters than I do and it would be strange if the man did all the talking when the two women beside me know most of the answers.  I decided not to be the Wizard of Oz on this occasion so I may refer some of the questions to them.</p><p>As members know, the Citizens' Assembly was established on foot of an initiative by the previous Government in 2017, which I had the pleasure of leading.  Following the result of the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment from the Constitution, it was an attempt to examine what the next steps would be in regard to gender equality in our country.  The Citizens' Assembly has done some really good work and the members, chairperson and secretariat deserve our thanks for their deliberations, much of which was done during the pandemic.</p><p>As Deputies and Senators will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth<b>,</b>Deputy Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, is leading the Government&rsquo;s work on the equality agenda, which is very much a joined-up Government initiative.  This work includes the implementation of the new gender pay gap reporting legislation, which we are trying to get under way in workplaces, as well as legislation to enhance work-life balance, providing new and extended rights to parents and carers to seek flexibility in the workplace.</p><p>Also included is legislation to enhance work-life balance and to provide new and extended rights to parents and carers to seek flexibility in the workplace.  He is also co-ordinating Ireland&rsquo;s actions as part of the EU's Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025, including a new requirement that 40% of non-executive directors on corporate boards must be from the under-represented gender, whether it be male or female.  This was recently agreed as part of intensified negotiations on a long-standing proposal for an EU directive on gender balance on corporate boards and is very much in line with the objectives of Deputy Emer Higgins&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; Bill which also seeks to deal with this matter.  </p><p> From an enterprise perspective, it makes sense to have more women, and more diversity in general, on the boards and senior leadership teams of companies in Ireland.  This is not just because it is the right thing to do, but also because it makes economic and business sense.  Women represent half of the population, and therefore must represent half of the talent, so it matters to get gender equality right.  The benefits of more diverse leadership teams in business are well established.  There is evidence that companies with higher levels of gender diversity, and indeed diversity in general, on their boards and senior leadership teams achieve better economic performance.  This is also about the bottom line.</p><p> We need a pipeline of talent in companies so that more diverse leadership teams and boards are possible and that it is not just the same people cropping up all the time.  Young women and girls must be able to believe they can be the business leaders of tomorrow, and I believe they do.  It is our collective responsibility to ensure this is the case.  Since I established the Balance for Better Business initiative, there has been a steady and sizeable increase in the share of women on the largest listed company boards, rising from 18% in 2018, when we launched the initiative, to 32% in March this year.  This is a significant achievement in a short time, but clearly more needs to be done.  The objective is parity.</p><p> Change takes time, and I realise it may not be happening quickly enough, but the progress at board level in Ireland shows what can be achieved when companies focus on making a change.  It should also be remembered that one of the primary reasons for the lack of women in leadership positions in business is not simply a lack of opportunity at senior levels in companies, but barriers at lower levels that are unlikely to be resolved by mandatory board quotas.  Carefully monitored voluntary targets help to promote cultural and strategic change at the heart of companies.</p><p> The citizens' assembly identified that many women are working in precarious employment and are concerned about workplace conditions and employment security.  While Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation to protect all employees, in my time in this Department I have prioritised the enumeration of enhanced workers&rsquo; rights including a new public holiday, on St. Brigid&rsquo;s Day or Imbolc, and the first to be named for a woman, the introduction of statutory sick pay, which will come into effect from 1 January 2023, new rights around redundancy for people laid-off temporarily during the pandemic, the right to request remote working, which is proving a challenge, but we are still working on it, and also the protection of workplace tips, the legislation concerning which has been enacted.</p><p> These initiatives will further improve the workplace for women, who have traditionally shouldered more caring responsibilities or have exited and then, later in life, sought to re-enter the workforce.  Women are more likely to be receiving the national minimum wage and next year&rsquo;s increase will translate into a pay increase of approximately &euro;1,600 per annum, gross, or 7.6%, which is behind inflation but still well above average wage growth.</p><p> Turning to the recommendation regarding the establishment of a legal right to collective bargaining, my view is that collective bargaining is an important element of ensuring industrial relations stability and peace in Ireland.  This stability comes from a voluntarist system, where the State does not seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but will, where appropriate, assist them in arriving at a solution.  This approach has served us well for many years.  Employers can be required to meet representatives of a union, but no law can force both sides to come to an agreement.  The Government supports increasing collective bargaining coverage in Ireland.  In 2021, I established the independently-chaired, high-level group on collective bargaining, which has recently submitted its final report.  The group&rsquo;s recommendations will be given detailed consideration as we work on preparing an EU-mandated action plan to enhance collective bargaining coverage in Ireland.  My Department continues to work closely with the Workplace Relations Commission to ensure that it has the necessary resources to provide its services, including inspections of employment rights compliance and the provision of adjudication, mediation and conciliation services.  We allocated additional funding in 2022 to allow for more inspectors to be hired, and we have secured additional funding for 2023 in the budget that was just announced.  We are also progressing other initiatives that will improve gender equality in the workplace.</p><p> My Department plans to ratify an International Labour Organization, ILO, convention on eliminating violence and harassment in the workplace before the end of the year.  I had the pleasure of recently visiting the ILO's headquarters in Geneva.  As I mentioned earlier, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, is progressing the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 which, among other provisions, proposes to introduce paid domestic violence leave.  I know this has been an important issue for some members of this committee.  Ireland has also supported recent policy initiatives on trade and gender at EU level which seek to influence the European Commission to take steps to maximise the benefits of trade for women.  </p><p> I think it is fair to say that Ireland has made huge advances towards achieving gender equality in the past 20 years, and we continue to move in the right direction while others fall backwards, or at least some of them.  We have a long way to go, though, to achieve gender equality and we are a republic unfinished until we do.  I look forward to discussing these initiatives and any other relevant issues that the committee wishes to raise.</p></speech>

The reforms around workers' rights and changing the workers' agenda generally were detailed.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline what he thinks will be the impact on gender equality of some of those reforms and changes?  He also referred to "not simply a lack of opportunity at senior levels in companies, but barriers at lower levels that are unlikely to be resolved by mandatory board quotas".  It is also a difficulty at not just board but also executive level to get women into senior positions.  One thing we have discussed here before is the phenomenon of women in commercial organisations, in particular, taking flexible leave, perhaps after a second child is born, such as a three-day week, etc., while their partners remain on a five-day week.  I refer to the cultural effect of that being very different in commercial organisations.</p> <p>  The question in this regard is how we can get to a situation where it is normalised for a man to come into a commercial organisation and say he would like to do a four-day week for the next three years because a second baby had arrived and that becoming a cultural norm.  We have introduced legislation on the gender pay gap and reporting in that regard.  Is it possible we could go down a road where there would be reporting of information concerning those parents of young children taking flexible leave in various situations?  That is just one issue the committee has discussed.  I only have a short time, and I would love to hear the T&aacute;naiste's views on the other issues as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.847" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022092900002#B00400"><p>Regarding the impact of the reforms we are undertaking in the workers' rights area, including the move to a living wage, the introduction of sick pay and also the commencement of auto-enrolment and every worker having a pension fund to top up their State pension, and this will all be the reality by 2024, which is not that far away, this will help with the achievement of gender equality.  It is a generalisation and a broad statement, but generally women tend to be in lower-paid jobs and less likely to have their own pension funds.  These changes will help.  This process will be happening in the long term but certainly by the time we retire, and most of us here are on the younger side of 50.  These changes will mean that pretty much everyone, every worker anyway, will have an occupational pension in addition to a State pension.  It will be people's individual pension right.  There will not be a qualified adult or dependant in the way, as is the case with many retiring women now and that aspect will be important.</p> <p>  Turning to the barriers to women getting into leadership positions and onto company boards, I think this comes down to a degree of promotion bias.  If we look at many organisations, and the public service is one example, it is possible to see many women in positions up to a certain point.  When we get to the highest tiers, however, there are fewer.  There are many reasons for this, but it is a problem.  One thing I wish to avoid happening is putting in place a set of quotas but with the outcome that it is the same people who turn up all the time on boards.  By the way, this happens with men as well as women, but we do not want it to happen in general.  Therefore, we need a stream of people getting promoted.  I think there is promotion bias in business now, for many reasons, but this needs to change.  Equally, regarding returning to work, if someone takes time off as a mother to raise her family, and it is more likely to be a woman than a man in this situation, four or five years of experience and promotion will have been lost.  We must account for that in some way, especially because we want and need people to return to the workplace.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's question concerning whether we could oblige companies to collect more information and report it, the short answer is "Yes".</p><p> On the question on whether we could oblige companies to collect more information and report it, the short answer is "Yes".  However, we always need to have regard to the number of information obligations we impose on companies.  It is fine for a big company with a human resources department.  Fulfilling the obligations is just something that someone in a human resources department would do; however, for a small company, filling in all the reports on the regulations and submitting all the reports, where there is potential to be fined, prosecuted and shamed for not doing so, represents a real cost.  We have to bear that in mind when we impose obligations on small companies that do not have a dedicated HR function.</p></speech>

There are socio-economic barriers and barriers related to race and membership of minorities.  Therefore, we need to see things in the round.  As the Deputy knows, three of our seven Cabinet Ministers are female.  We have 66 female councillors, which is more than any other party.  We have more female MEPs than any other party but it is not the case that we are anywhere close to achieving parity, particularly in the Oireachtas.  A former Fine Gael Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, introduced the gender quota legislation, so I do not see it as an obligation so much as something we want to do.  We are going to achieve it for the next election and I hope we will see a significant increase in the number of female Deputies and Senators in the next Oireachtas.  As the Deputy knows, the Seanad is much more balanced than the D&aacute;il, for many different reasons.</p></speech>

I have a question on that.  Recently, officials from the ESRI attended a committee meeting and said there is a noticeable discrepancy between the number of men in Ireland taking parental leave, because of the &euro;250 per week, and the number of our European neighbours taking it.  In what way is this a factor?  How does the Minister intend to address the concerns raised in the Balance for Better Business report on parental leave within the existing limitations associated with the current system of paid paternity leave?</p> <p>  I wish to touch on the International Labour Organization's Violence and Harassment Convention, 2019, No. 190.  Recently, the Minister of State, Deputy English, stated that, further to his having received legal advice, supplementary legislation would not be necessary for the ratification of the convention.  He also stated the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is undertaking stakeholder consultation.</p> <p>  The third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence commits the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ratifying the convention by the end of the year.  Does the Minister believe this is a deadline he will meet?  The strategy also commits his Department to assisting employers and trade unions to create and develop work environments that are free from sexual harassment in all its forms and to work to eliminate male violence against women, supporting the creation of the White Ribbon organisations.  Could he give a brief outline of his Department's progress in this regard?</p></speech>

As she knows, the rates for paternity, maternity and parental benefits are the same for women and men.  The maximum is around &euro;250, which I believe is what she said.  I am a supporter of pay-related benefits.  We used to have them in Ireland but do not anymore.  They are actually recommended by the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, which has some very positive recommendations as well as some that I do not agree with.  I would like us to move to that.  That would better reflect the amount of money you are paying, so the more money you pay into the PRSI fund across your working life, the more benefits you get.  This was partly the case with the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  When we moved to the second phase of it, those who paid in more got more and those who earned more got more.  Therefore, you get a replacement rate figure of 66% or 50%, or something like that, up to a cap.  Some people do not like that and believe it perpetuates socio-economic inequality.  I believe it is actually fairness because those who contribute more benefit more.  Obviously, there will be different views on that.</p> <p>  With regard to international conventions, some countries sign a convention and then forget about it or implement it over ten or 20 years.  We try to do it the other way around.  It was the same with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Before we sign such a convention, we like to be ready to ratify and implement it in a meaningful way.  We have been doing the analysis and believe we can achieve this by the end of the year, hopefully by mid-December.  I would like to have it done before I depart this office.  That is the objective.</p> <p>  I am not entirely sure of the position on the White Ribbon campaign.  Ms O'Dea or Ms Quilty might comment on it.</p></speech>

Gender equality does not affect women alone; there is also the male aspect.  Gender inequality is affecting everybody across the State.

I might also send on some questions I might not get to ask.</p> <p>  On the method of calculation, what is the rationale for using 60% of the median hourly wage rather than using another model?  One such model that comes to mind concerns the minimum essential standard of living, which looks beyond pay and toward items that people need to live a life of decent quality.  If we opt for 60% of the median hourly wage, we will miss some of the lowest earners, which ends up with benefits going in the wrong direction.</p> <p>  With regard to pensions, while many colleagues will discuss equality in terms of pay, we know there already exists severe inequality and discrimination regarding women's pension entitlements.  The proposal of the Government to require 40 years of contributions to get a full contributory State pension seems regressive and discriminates against those who engage in care work, many of whom are women.  The Minister spoke about those who contribute the most, but contributions are made not only through PRSI but also through care.  Could the Minister discuss the decision and state whether it was subjected to gender and equality proofing before it was made?  How can the Government say it is serious about gender equality when taking a regressive step that would disproportionately affect women by way of the State pension?</p> <p>  Although the Minister is here as T&aacute;naiste, I wish to take a look forward to when he is Taoiseach.  It would be nice to have on record his support for the referendum on the Constitution and a statement to the effect that it is not only a question of care but also of who we recognise as families, such that families like mine will be recognised.  It would be good to have a few comments on that.</p> <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill mentioned promotional bias.</p><p>There is an opportunity within the Seanad in the coming months for the T&aacute;naiste to look to women within his party in regard to the position of Cathaoirleach.  I am just putting that on his radar for when he is making those decisions regarding promotional bias.  It would be nice to see a female Cathaoirleach in the Seanad for the rest of this term.</p></speech>

We will give the T&aacute;naiste a bit of leeway on time because there were a number of issues.  We produced an interim report on recommendations Nos. 1 to 3 related to the constitutional referendum, so Senator Ruane's question was pertinent to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.867" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022092900002#D00300"><p>I should say I had the privilege of being able to appoint four Members to the Seanad as Taoiseach's nominees in 2020 and all four were female.  I also had the privilege to nominate the Leader of the Seanad, who is female, so I do have to promote men the odd time as well.  Certainly, on the Seanad side at least, I think my record is okay in that regard.</p> <p>  On the referendum, we considered this under the previous Government and came to the view we would prefer to delete the entire section relating to the woman's place in the home, which belongs to a different time.  While I think it was well intentioned at the time, it is not 1937 anymore.  We made that decision as a Government when we consulted more widely and we decided not to proceed with that.  We came to the view, as the assembly did, that we should replace it with a new, more modern amendment that reflects what modern families in Ireland look like, which is not very different from what the process would have been in the 1930s.  That would include single-parent headed families, LGBT families and so on, and we decided also to recognise care in the Constitution.</p> <p>  When it comes to the Constitution, the devil is always in the detail, and once something is put into the Constitution, the power to determine what it means is given to the courts, not to the elected Members of the Oireachtas.  I am always a little nervous about that.  I believe that in a democracy, ultimately, the elected people in this House should make the decisions, ideally not the courts.  It is all very well to say we want an Article in the Constitution that says something with which we all agree, but we need to make sure we think through the implications of how that might be interpreted.  That has happened a bit too often in the past and we need to be careful about it.  It is about getting the wording right.</p> <p>  On the living wage question and the figure of 60% of the median wage, that is not a Government decision, at least not yet.  At the moment, it is just the unanimous recommendation of the Low Pay Commission.  The workers' representatives, the employers' representatives and the independents and academics all recommended we go for 60% of the median wage, rising to 66% of the median over time.  It is backed up with the detailed research paper conducted by Maynooth University, all of which has been published.  If I were to explain the thinking, which is just the commission&rsquo;s thinking and does not yet reflect a Government decision, when the minimum wage was introduced, it amounted to about 60% of the median wage.  While the minimum wage has increased ahead of inflation over the past 20 years - not every year but in the round - it has not kept up with median earnings, and we want to restore that and create a legal link between median earnings and people on the lowest pay in order that, as the tide rises, we will make sure it rises for those on the lowest pay as well.  That will help eliminate low pay in our society, which is defined as people earning less than 66% of the median wage.</p> <p>  There is an alternative approach, the minimum essential standards of living, MESL, which involves creating a basket of goods and services that anyone should be able to afford to have a dignified life.  That is an option but there are three difficulties with it, the first of which is that it is subjective.  People will have different views as to what should be in the basket.  The figure 66% of median is easily calculated and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, can produce that figure in a day, whereas there would be rows over what should and should not be in the basket.</p> <p>  Second, if we are successful over the coming years, as I think we will be, in dramatically reducing the costs of public transport, childcare and rent, that basket will actually shrink, meaning a living wage calculated in that way could be reduced as we get on top of some of the high costs that exist in Ireland, such as for childcare, healthcare, education and rent.  It would seem strange to me that median wages would increase while the basket would decrease, but that is one of the potential problems with that model.</p> <p>  The third issue is that in a recession, people could be laid off, as we saw 12 or 13 years ago, with the cost of living nonetheless rising, and we could become hamstrung by that model.  In order to save jobs, sometimes pay needs to fall, but that option would not be available if the basket kept increasing.  Employers, therefore, would have to cut hours and lay off more people to satisfy the basket.  They are three practical problems with that model and the research is available for people to read.</p> <p>  On the total contributions approach, that is being led by the Minister for Social Protection rather than me.  The thinking is that people can start work at 16, as many of us will have done with part-time jobs and so on, and they generally finish work at 66, a period of 50 years.  We are now going to allow people, if they so choose, to work until 70, a period of 54 years.  The idea is that of those 50 to 54 years, a person should contribute at least 40 years, which still leaves time for study, time out and so on.  The proposal is very much to recognise care; it will not recognise only PRSI credited contributions.  It provides for a certain number of years of care, either of a child or of a person in need of care.  That is recognised as part of the proposal.  I think there is a maximum number of years, although I cannot recall exactly what it is.  It is not just about paying cash contributions into the Social Insurance Fund; the contribution of care is recognised in the proposal as well.</p></speech>

That allows 14 years for time off or care, but for people with kids who have additional needs or no one to mind them or who cannot afford childcare, it will still be very difficult to get what seems like a reasonable period within that 14 years.</p></speech>

A number of members wish to come in.  We will send the T&aacute;naiste a copy of the interim report in which we recommended alternative wordings for the constitutional change.  We have sent it to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, but in light of Senator Ruane's question, we will also send it to the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>

To follow on from what Senator Ruane asked, the CSO has stated that the figure of 60% of the median wage still leaves people at risk of poverty, and the T&aacute;naiste seemed to agree that is the case.  On that basis, does he believe the Government's calculation is appropriate or is he hoping to change that?  A lot of people earning the minimum wage who are hopeful of a living wage are women, given it is generally in accommodation, food, wholesale and retail that the minimum wage is paid.  The programme for Government has a commitment to delivering a living wage in four years but the general consensus, after the increase in the minimum wage in the budget, is that it will take at least ten years to get to a living wage.  How does the T&aacute;naiste hope to resolve that?  These are the people who get up early in the morning.</p> <p>  On the Workplace Relations Commission, the budget seems to have acknowledged that not enough people work there.  I believe there are only 50 labour inspectors and that figure needs to increase to 90.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify the core funding budget for that and how the Government hopes to make up the shortfall?</p></speech>

Given they will not all be hired on 1 January, the figure is higher because those additional staff will be hired throughout the course of the year, but that will have to be divided among the Department and all our agencies, including the Health and Safety Authority, the Workplace Relations Commission, IDA, Enterprise Ireland and so on, and we will have to work out how that will be done.  It will definitely mean more staff in all those agencies but we will have to divide the cake over the coming weeks and work out how best to apportion that additional staffing complement.</p> <p>  On the 60% of median proposal, I reiterate this is the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission and there is no Government decision on it as yet.  It is out to public consultation at the moment, but the recommendation of the commission is unanimous.</p><p>All the worker representatives, business representatives, academics and independents signed up to the proposal, which is to achieve 60% of median earnings first and then move forward to 66% of median earnings thereafter.  It is intended for that to happen over four years, with 2023 being year one.  We would be done by 2027.  However, it could be done more quickly if economic conditions allow and it might take longer if they do not.  The reason they went for 60% first was that in the research - and this is not my personal opinion - there is some evidence that a move above 60% starts to impact on employment.  We in Ireland have been successful in increasing wages, and workers' rights and terms and conditions, for years now without any negative impact on employment.  There have never been more people at work in Ireland than there are now.</p></speech>

When the UK established a national living wage, one group established itself and determined what the real living wage should be.  Another business group said it should be something else.  That said, I absolutely agree that the Government and public bodies should have regard to the national living wage, which is proposed to be calculated at 60% of median earnings.</p></speech>

The Low Pay Commission has recommended four years, with 2023 being year one.  I know the Deputy feels, as many people might, that the increase in the minimum wage of 7.6% is inadequate.  I am hearing from many small employers that they are worried about their ability to pay it, particularly at a time of waning consumer confidence and rising energy prices.  I must have regard to that.  If we do see employment falling off and hours being cut as a consequence of higher wage costs, I cannot ignore it.  The most important workers' right is the right to work.  I hope we will see employment continue to rise in 2023.  That will give me the reassurance that we can increase the national minimum wage at a faster rate.  However, we cannot allow ideology to blind us from the facts if employment ends up going in the wrong direction.</p></speech>

One of my questions relates partly to the Minister's role as T&aacute;naiste and partly to his Department.  There was a commitment in the programme for Government to well-being budgeting.  The Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform have done a considerable amount of work on gender and equality budgeting.  However, there was not an enormous amount announced in the budget on Tuesday.  I was expecting to see metrics on gender budgeting and well-being budgeting.  The dashboard was launched in 2021.  There was an excellent paper from the Department of Finance.  However, that kind of measurement and evidence-based decision-making was not necessarily evident.  Are we going to see that in the coming weeks?  I welcome the switch analysis on our progress.  Are we going to see measures such as gender and well-being budgeting analyses of the 2023 budget in the coming weeks?  How is the Minister rolling our performance metrics in that regard in his Department?  Has gender budgeting changed those performance metrics?</p> <p>  I also wish to raise a matter I previously raised with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  The Gender Recognition Act was a step forward but we have recently come across some lacunas in it, mostly to do with non-binary recognition.  A number of people would have liked to have identified as non-binary in the census.  That might be work for the next round.  Is that something the Government is considering and to which it is open?</p></speech>

I do not want to give the Deputy an inaccurate answer.</p> <p>  In my Department, every time a significant decision is made that requires a decision or information, we bring a memorandum to Government on which a gender analysis is conducted as to the impact, if any, of the proposal.  I sometimes feel it is a bit of a box-ticking exercise, and maybe we need to be more thorough in how we do that.  The Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service, IGEES, could help us to better factor that into our decision-making.  It is something about which I need to talk to my Secretary General.</p> <p>  The Government is definitely open to the suggestion the Deputy made in her final question.  I cannot remember what options were available on the census.  Was it only male or female?  I note that it was.  There should be a third option.  I need advice from the statisticians in the Central Statistics Office, CSO, about how best to do that.  Perhaps we could provide a box labelled "other" and ask respondents to write in or we could provide a list of options.  I am not sure of the best way to do that.</p></speech>

He said in his opening statement that there had been a steady and sizeable increase in the share of women on the largest listed company boards.  I suppose that refers to the ISEQ 20.  Female representation has risen from 18% in 2018 to 32% in March this year.  The Minister said that was a significant achievement in a short time but, clearly, more needs to be done.  The Citizens' Assembly recommended enacting gender quota legislation to ensure at least 40% gender balance on the boards of private companies.  The current Government strategy obviously relies on voluntary action by businesses.  Based on CSO figures, it is likely to take 18 years to reach a 40% target.  That is hardly acceptable.  Does the Minister agree?  Taking into account the limited human resources that might exist in companies, surely there will be a need for a mandatory approach if that projection of 18 years does not change.  I would welcome the Minister's comment on that point.</p> <p>  The Minister also spoke about the Seanad and about Fine Gael's women representation at local level.  In light of the fact he will soon become Taoiseach, what is his view on the need for quotas at local level?  He also said he has a good record of appointing women nominees to the Seanad but Seanad reform is entirely absent from the programme for Government.  Reform would allow structural change in how we ensure a gender balance in Seanad representation, rather than just relying on the Taoiseach of the day to ensure the quota is met.</p></speech>

That includes State boards, which are reasonably gender balanced, and we have seen a lot of progress on those Irish Stock Exchange, ISEQ, big company boards.  Having gone from 18% to 34% in only a few years I imagine we could get to 50% in a few more years but we need accelerators and mandatory quotas are part of that.  There is an EU directive coming down the line and there is legislation from Deputy Higgins, which we support as a Government and Department.  The devil will be in the detail and we have to make sure we get that right but the principle that there should be no less than 40% of any one gender is a good one.  To pick up on Deputy Hourigan's comments earlier I have not yet worked out how we would fit non-binary or other gender identities into that.  When it is binary it is straightforward but where do we put things if we recognise other gender identities?  I would be interested to hear the views of members and to get advice on that.</p> <p>  I would have no objection to quotas in local elections.  The way they are done for the Oireachtas is linked to a party's funding.  If the quotas were to be applied at local level as well we would have to amend the way we fund parties to take account of how well they did in local elections; not just how well they did in the general election.  That is doable but it would require a bit of work to do it.  It might help in a way because it would smooth out the peaks and troughs that political parties experience.  Parties could have a good local election and a bad general election or the opposite and it might help to smooth that out so it might be a good idea in the round, even setting aside the gender issues.</p></speech>

Something along those lines was done before, either by the Minster of State, Deputy Peter Burke, or the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, when there was a kind of top-up.  Additional funding to reward parties that have gender-balanced tickets might be a good way to do it.  The reason I like it as an idea is the stream of councillors coming through that we need.  I know my party is doing well at finding female candidates in the greater Dublin area and the urban areas but in the rural areas we are finding it difficult.  That is a reflection on us as much as anything but it is a real struggle and any incentive or accelerator would be a positive thing.</p></speech>

I cannot remember which side the Senator was on in the referendum but I was in favour of abolition.  A small country could get by just fine with one Chamber but I accept that the people have spoken on that, it is a settled issue now and the Seanad is here to stay.  One of the views I had at the time was that I was sceptical as to whether we would get consensus on Seanad reform.  Seanad reform is a bit like the Australian republic; most people want it but when it gets put to referendum it is hard to get a majority for the model put in front of them and I am not sure what that model is.  A previous group tried to shoehorn a reformed Seanad into the existing constitutional provisions, which require the maintenance of the corporate 1930s panels and all sorts of various other things, and it was not a great proposal in the end.</p></speech>

I refer to the previous discussion about the difficulties in trying to get female candidates for the local elections.  We should start looking at the question of the right to maternity leave for councillors.  We have a councillor in Ballyfermot who has had two children since she was elected and during both tranches of leave she received no allowances from the council.  She does not have another job; she is not a solicitor, a publican or barrister who has other means to fall back on.  A basic start we should make is to examine how councillors are treated when they are on maternity leave because otherwise it will become less and less possible to attract working class women in particular.</p> <p>  I want to note one thing in the Minister's speech and then ask him a question about the budget.  He talks quite a bit about the need to get more women into business and leadership roles on boards, etc., in line with the objectives of the Bill introduced by Deputy Higgins.  All that is well and good but when it comes to talking about the right to free collective bargaining in the State I find that he has less to say.  The reason I bring that up is that a lot of women who want to be in trade unions are excluded from them because they do not have the right to free collective bargaining.  There is no legal compunction on employers to recognise trade unions in this country and there have been many campaigns to have that in various workplaces that were led by various trade unions.  However, there are also two Bills sitting in front of the Government, one from my party, which dates back to 2016 or 2017 and another from Sinn F&eacute;in, which try to bring the right to free collective bargaining onto the Statute Book.  They just stalled on Second Stage and have never been dealt with.  That shows a certain bias on behalf of the Government, which might be too strong a word or maybe it is the right one, towards getting business and leadership on same sorted.  However, when it comes to the right to join a trade union the Government and the previous Government have been a little bit lukewarm.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.  He said he established an independent high-level group that recently submitted its final report.  When will that be published and when can we see the right to join a trade union recognised as a statutory right if more than a certain percentage of the workforce wants that recognition?  That is an important issue for the women who have been mentioned earlier, those who do the low-paid minimum wage work in particular.</p> <p>  The last question I have is on the budget.  I am asking the following question on behalf of the Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, which is an advocacy group for lone parents.  It is worried that the childcare credit is not listed in all of the credits in the budget.  It is worried that because the living alone allowance has a qualifying threshold a lot of lone parents are locked out of it but it would provide them with an extra &euro;200 this winter.  I raise that because the vast majority of lone parents are women and that seems a bit discriminatory.  The Minister might not be able to answer the budgetary question but I ask him to send an answer back in an email.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has the legislation for that ready.  I am not sure whether it has been approved by Cabinet yet; it is hard to remember with the amount of things that come through Cabinet but I think it has been.  We would plan to have that done as soon as possible and to have it ready for the next local elections in 2024, which are rapidly approaching.  It is not just maternity leave; it also allows men to take time off because although it is not the norm, some men take time off to look after a young family and we need to facilitate that as well.  It covers both men and women.</p><p>I think it will help encourage more women, and parents in general, to run for election and hopefully stay on as councillors.  There is a high rate of attrition, with people resigning from the council because of other work or family commitments.  The real issue is not so much one of payment as of who is the replacement.  The idea is to have a system whereby an alternate or substitute who you nominate would replace you.  We will probably need something similar for the Oireachtas because any Minister or Deputy can take six months off and receive full pay.  The problem is there is nobody to step in for them.  We need a model that allows that to happen.</p></speech>

It is not like us.  We get a wage with deductions but councillors get an allowance.  It is not huge but is substantial enough to help a parent keep their head above water.  The payment is removed if you do not sign in for the meetings.  That should be in the legislation but is not.</p></speech>

The point I am making is the payment is not the hard problem to solve.  It is a relatively straightforward solution.  More complicated is the replacement issue.  Who fills in for you, whether you are a Deputy, Senator or councillor?  In countries with list systems, it is straightforward: the next person on the list fills in.  In the European Parliament, where a B-list is elected on the same day, it is straightforward.  We do not have that for local government or Deputies.  We need to come up with a solution.  I think it is easy to do at council level by allowing somebody to nominate a substitute.  It is trickier in the Oireachtas.  It would probably require constitutional change to allow a B-list, alternate list or something like that, given the way the Constitution is framed.</p> <p> On collective bargaining, in Ireland we have the freedom to associate and the freedom not to be associated.  One is free to join the union; there is no obligation on employers, at the moment anyway, to recognise a union.  The report which will be published in a few weeks' time - certainly within the month of October it is my intention to publish it - is interesting and makes a valid point which people may not always fully consider.  There is little point in creating Pyrrhic rights that do not mean things in practice.  You could force employers to recognise and meet with a union if that union represents more than half the staff.  I do not think it would require constitutional change.  You can force employers to recognise a union, meaning sit down and meet them.  In no world can you force people to negotiate in good faith or to come to an agreement.  In no world can you force workers to accept an agreement without a ballot or force employers to accept an agreement without a vote of its board or shareholders.  We need to think this through.  We could create a right that is meaningless.  Recognition, but what happens then?  You cannot force people to negotiate in good faith.</p></speech>

I am not against it but there is little point in securing a right that is meaningless.  We need to think through the whole pathway.

The general scheme of the Bill concerning maternity leave for councillors was with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last week and is welcome.  The important thing in that is when the guidelines come through, it is the councillor's ability to nominate the substitute, rather than the party having a role in it.  With a co-option, the party has to issue a certificate.  I do not think that would work for the substitute for maternity leave because of the close working relationship that would have to exist between the substitute and the person.</p> <p>  Second, Senator Warfield raised gender quotas at local level.  It is important that we consider that over more than one term.  On Dublin City Council, for example, some political parties have majority female or, in some cases, all female members for this term.  Due to the legislation, a male quota could have to be brought in by such a party to reach 40% because they have been so successful.  However, to embed knowledge and capacity, we need to do it over more than one term.  We all know in politics that sometimes it is only in one's second term that one has the experience.  At least, that is what I will tell voters at the next election.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  On the UBI pilot, we have had some success with the scheme for artists.  How far can we go with that?  Is the Minister considering that as the pilot that is mentioned in the programme for Government.  The second one was mentioned by Disabled Women Ireland.  It concerns remote working legislation and the issue of reasonable accommodation by the employer.  There was a suggestion that this legislation is weaker than what is currently in place in the provision of reasonable accommodation.  Has the Minister considered that?  Disabled Women Ireland has said the standard for reasonable accommodation for equipment at home is lower than that in the workplace.  There might be a discrepancy between the new legislation and existing legislation, resulting in a lower standard of accommodation which the employer has to provide.  I do not expect the Minister to respond here, but he might come back to me on it. </p></speech>

We will come back to the Deputy on that.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on local elections.  I had the pleasure to visit Chile in March as part of the St. Patrick's Day visits.  An interesting thing they had there was a constitutional convention.  The people decided to reject the new constitution but when they elected the assembly they had gender quotas.  More women got elected so they had to bring in more men.  It was nice to see that happen once anyway.  Interestingly enough, and this is one reason perhaps men should be more open to gender quotas, it can work both ways.  That is the point the Deputy is making.  That is the first time I heard of it happening.</p> <p>  My uncle in India who died before I was born was the mayor of a town.  I visited that town for the first time in 2019.  I met the local council and out came an equal number of men and women.  I thought that was great to see in this local government in this town in India.  Then I found out they had gender quotas in that town in Maharashtra.  I am not sure if it is across the state or across India.  They have first past the post because many people are innumerate.  They got around it by having each community electing one man and one woman.  That was interesting, great to see and progressive in a less developed country than Ireland.</p> <p>  The artists' basic income is a really good programme.  I am a big fan of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin's work in this area.  I was supportive of her in trying to get that programme over the line but I do not consider it a universal basic income pilot because it is not universal, by definition.  It is only for artists.  Universal has to mean everyone.  The difficulty in doing a genuine pilot, and there is some interesting research I will publish on this soon, is that most pilots were discontinued or were not continued because, by definition, to have a universal basic income there would have to be winners and losers.</p><p>We could not afford a universal basic income that made everyone better off.  There would have to be winners and losers.  The general thinking is that we could have a universal basic income that is very low.  That is affordable but would mean substantial cuts in income for a lot of people, particularly people who are currently on social welfare or we could have a universal basic income that is decent but then one would have to have very high taxes on all earned income.  It would also be hard to see who one would get to participate in a pilot scheme that would almost certainly make them worse off.  That is one of the difficulties.  There is a big piece of research, which I will publish soon, on all of the pilots that were done on this.</p></speech>

What I am going to do is publish the interesting research.  It is lays out the pros and cons not just of doing it as a policy, which no country has done, but also the problems with all of the pilot schemes that have been done around the world, which have largely failed for lots of different reasons.</p> <p>  Where the initiative can work is if a country has massive oil or mineral wealth so the government can take the money generated and give everyone a slice of it.  In a country like Ireland where our wealth is derived from labour ,we could only do this by having winners and losers.  It is very hard to see how a pilot scheme could be constructed where people, if randomly selected, agreed to participate in a pilot scheme that would definitely make them worse off but maybe they would.</p></speech>

The citizens' assembly was very clear that it wanted to see a statutory right to reasonable access to flexible working.  Last week, the committee heard ICTU criticise that the Government's legislation as insufficiently broad since it simply talks about remote working.  Can the legislation be expanded to cover more forms of flexible working?</p> <p>  I wish to ask another question concerning an issue raised by ICTU last week on the EU work-life balance directive has a narrow focus as the categories it describes are carers and parents of children up to the age of eight.  Again, ICTU requested that provision is expanded as part of the legislative approach to flexible working.  I ask the Minister to comment after Deputies Clarke and Cronin ask their questions.</p></speech>

Can the Minister clarify whether additional resources will be provided to the WRC following the funding announced in the budget earlier this week?  As his tenure is due to end and he will return to the post of Taoiseach, can he outline a reasonable timeframe for a referendum to take place on gender equality?</p></speech>

Under the EU directive, which we discussed last week with ICTU, member states that do not have enough collective bargaining are being obliged to ensure that there is.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned two Bills that are going through the Houses.  I would like the Minister to push them and to do so when he becomes Taoiseach.  We discuss gender issues in a privileged situation here whereas most women outside these walls are trying to make ends meet and we can see how public services are so essential to making a working woman's life work.  For example, during the bus scoile fiasco women have constantly told me that they would have to give up their work because they are getting in trouble with their bosses for being late to work because buses did not turn up and their children had not been collected.  Women have told me how such situations have an impact on their working lives.  The State, if it wants women working, must ensure that public services function in a satisfactory way.</p></speech>

As she will be aware, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is bringing through the legislation for flexible working that is just for parents and carers and derives from an EU directive.  I am trying to do legislation on remote working, which is a bit trickier as it is hard to get the balance right.  The joint committee has compiled a good report on the topic and that gives me some guidance as to how I can take things forward.</p> <p>  Flexible working for parents and carers could be made available more broadly.</p></speech>

Sometimes rights need to be given to parents and carers that do not need to be given to people who are not parents and carers.  We just need to bear that in mind too.</p> <p>  The WRC needs more staff.  It got more staff and it is going to get more.  There are 2.5 million people at work in Ireland, which is more than ever before, and, therefore, it is my logical view that we need more people working in the WRC and the Heath and Safety Authority.  I cannot tell how many more staff yet.  We do not have the Estimates agreed by the Oireachtas yet but when it is.</p></speech>

There is a number of potential referendums on the list.  As a Government we must decide which ones to do and how many we can do in any one day.  We can do a lot but there are risks in holding four or five referendums on the one day.  In my first speech after being elected Taoiseach in 2017, I said we would have a referendum on the eighth  amendment within a year.  I set the challenge for that to be done and it was done.  A year is a reasonable timeframe for a referendum but approximately a year is needed to prepare the ground, make sure we are ready for any disinformation and prepare for the campaign.</p> <p>  Finally, all I can say about collective bargaining is that a report will be published in October.  The high-level working group did a really good job and it has come up with a negotiated way forward that we could pursue.

However witnesses and participants who give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity following the proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  </p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person's or entity's good name.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of our normal parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Mr. Durkan will be familiar with such parliamentary procedures.  I now call on Mr. Durkan to make his opening statement.   </p></speech>

Its achievement rested on layers of understanding built up in disparate phases including the New Ireland Forum, the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Hume-Adams dialogue, the Brooke-Mayhew talks and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Some collective ambiguity was a necessary part of the coinage for the process in 1998 but this was supposed to be supplemented by a growing collective certainty which should have stemmed from the implementation of its provisions and faithful adherence to its precepts.</p><p>The suboptimal experience of subsequent vagaries should not be allowed to invalidate the broad balanced architecture of the agreement or the unique integrity of its resounding democratic endorsement by the people of Ireland, North and South.</p><p> The agreement secured a framework for the three sets of relationships and a platform of guaranteed rights.  Its three strands have seen varied episodes of performance; sometimes with evident good purpose, sometimes with recalcitrance and, for too long, confounded by the discoloration from Brexit.  Its rights promises have been serially neglected or frustrated, deliberately eroded in this Commons mandate and threatened with eradication if the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, is further relegated or even repudiated.</p><p> We have to be honest about such divergences and deficits in implementing the agreement.  These also include the gross misapplication of the agreement&rsquo;s clear intent on petitions of concern, the St. Andrews Agreement mistaken departure from the joint nomination and election by the Assembly of joint First Ministers, the abandonment of the Civic Forum in the North, which also aborted the complementary North-South civic consultation arrangements that had been agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, in June 2002, the underdevelopment of strand 2 and the underuse of strand 3.</p><p> There is no point in pretending that tyres are only flat at the bottom, but neither should we despair as though the wheels have come off.  The agreement has review provisions.  Such necessary facilities for respective strands or in overall terms should not be ignored as we celebrate and contemplate the 25th anniversary.  A spirit of renewal review would allow us to be honest about shortcomings in the agreement&rsquo;s outworkings and Brexit&rsquo;s disruptive fallout, while showing positive purpose about its under-tapped enabling potential.  The bandwidth of strands 2 and 3 allow for creative lateral thinking that could answer some of the problems created by the fact and form of Brexit.  Why deny such relevant exploration as we celebrate what we achieved in 1998 but have not fully advanced since?  Such constructive institutional explorations can take place at the same time as due consideration of how we can reflect the agreement&rsquo;s key precepts around constitutional status and consent in terms that respect the equal legitimacy of two aspirations, as affirmed by the agreement.</p><p> Democratic pro-agreement Ireland needs to engage in careful deliberation and respectful discourse on a basis that sees responsible curation of the spirit and letter of Article 3 of the Constitution as so finely worded in the agreement.  There is a real need to illuminate the serious issues that need to be factored sensitively so we might have healthy debate with honest differences about honest preferences as posited in the agreement, with its overarching commitments to reconciliation and rapprochement.  Such necessary, thoughtful and helpful light will not come from deferring duly deliberative discourse or from seeking dubious determinations from the current British Government.</p><p> Unpreparedness in the name of respect or reconciliation is not really a responsible approach.  The value of preparedness, that is, advance thinking, collective anticipation, building layers of understanding and showing responsibility, all in the spirit of respect and with the clear aim of reconciliation, is an important lesson from the long journey that John Hume piloted to the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

It is great to see him again.  There is no element of his opening remarks one could disagree with.  We could do another report on the intricacies of matters between ourselves and the British Government and what has not happened in relation to the agreement.  As a committee we have a job to do on the implementation of the agreement.  The idea of bringing in people like Mr. Durkan, namely, those who were at the helm in the lead-up to the agreement and were involved in bringing it together as we approach the 25th anniversary is to get an insight into the difficulties behind the scenes that existed in bringing this together.  It is about getting to the bottom of that and having an appreciation of what was necessary to get to that very historic occasion where all on this island came together as one.  That was a historic event we had thought would never be possible.</p> <p>  Mr. Durkan rightly ended his speech in the spirit of John Hume and the amount of work he did on this.  What was the reason behind somebody like David Trimble sticking his neck out the way he did when he unexpectedly signed up to the Good Friday Agreement at the last minute?  What are the moments that stick out in Mr. Durkan's mind as being significant during that process in the weeks beforehand and during those days of negotiations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.964" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022092900002#B00400"><p>I thank the Senator for his welcome and the question.  It is a salient one.  I am not sure what exactly made David Trimble decide, in the sense that most talks participants spent their casual conversational time asking each other how we read David Trimble and did we think he was going to be up for an agreement or not.  That was because sometimes in the talks he would disappear.  He would leave on a Monday and disappear to Westminster for a few days.  We would be negotiating with the Ulster Unionist Party team and we found each time the line-up changed the line changed.  That made it difficult and it would change again whenever David Trimble came back, so there were big doubts.  Officials and people in all the different parties would have been talking and asking that question.  John Hume had a glass-half-full approach in that he felt the fact David Trimble had split from other unionist parties to allow George Mitchell into the chair at the start of the talks, the fact he had agreed renegotiated ground rules in circumstances where other unionist parties were opposing them and more saliently the fact that he pivoted on a nuance to stay inside the talks when Sinn F&eacute;in was admitted in the summer and autumn of 1997.  John read into that that if David Trimble really wanted an excuse to abscond from the talks and possible agreement he would have used any of those opportunities to do so.  A point I recall from that time was David Trimble, in a meeting with John Hume, believed himself to be assured the SDLP's negotiating position and our likely proposals were not going to be altered by the fact of Sinn F&eacute;in being at the table as well and I think he sought similar assurances from the Irish Government.  In that sense, David Trimble kind of pre-assured himself he was not going to be facing a pan-nationalist front.  That makes one of the remarks by Baron Dean Godson, who gave a eulogy for David Trimble at his funeral, wrong when he talked about David Trimble having confounded a pan-nationalist front.  He certainly seemed to try to assure himself that was not what he was facing.</p> <p>  When it came to the substance of negotiations, everybody knows David Trimble had serious issues in the last week with what was in the strand 2 text.  That was called the "Mitchell text" but George Mitchell was making it clear to everybody that it was not his text and he had not drawn it up.  He was a wee bit critical of the two Governments for the fact there were no square brackets and no italics in the text.</p><p>With strand 1, where we had been negotiating and talking in circles for many months, it was only very late in the negotiations that David Trimble accepted the idea that there could be ministers in the North and it was later still that he accepted the idea that those ministers could sit collectively in an executive.  To my mind, the point on which that really turned was whenever we shared with him the idea of the joint office of fiirst ministers.  I had a list of roles and responsibilities or functions that the joint First Ministers might do.  That was because at that stage, only two weeks out from the agreement, the Ulster Unionist position was still to be opposed to an executive.  Even if people with executive authority in the North were possibly going to be called ministers, they did not want them in an executive.  We were saying that someone would have to manage issues between Departments and manage and co-ordinate budget oversight etc.  We had a list of roles and functions and David Trimble looked at Seamus Mallon and me and said that this was all written in the language of functions and roles, I would prefer to see it written in the language of power.  When we asked him what he meant by the language of power, the only example he gave was patronage.  I can remember Seamus and I taking that and going back to John with it, saying that we saw definitely that the Ulster Unionist position had moved with all of the issues that it was refusing to contemplate in strand 1.  Obviously that did not conclude the negotiations because different things were factored in there.  One of the reasons David Trimble and the UUP had argued against ministers, and particularly our proposals that ministers would be appointed by d'Hondt, was they said that if they have personal executive authority, they go off and do their own thing.  We heard a lot of talk about rogue ministers, solo runs and all that sort of stuff.  It is precisely because of those sorts of concerns coming up on the unionist side that some of the checks and balances are actually in the agreement.  Things like the petition of concern and all the rest were there as much to protect unionists against this bogey fear they had about rogue ministers, solo runs and all the rest of it.  The balance of checks and inclusive arrangements became enough for David Trimble to decide that institutionally he could go with things in strand 1.  Obviously, that, in turn, was only finally negotiated after the issues in strand 2 had been sorted.  There were a couple of days of serious sweating with the Ulster Unionists and Alliance demanding significant change in the strand 2 text and the Irish Government having to water down the language and whittle down the list there.  That obviously worried us in the SDLP and I know it worried Sinn F&eacute;in because, particularly, it looked as though at that stage the Ulster Unionists were trying to negotiate that strand 1 would happen and then when we got the assembly that we would then negotiate the details of strand 2.  There were tensions and difficulties there and things that had to be finely balanced.</p></speech>

We have lots of talk and articles these days about census results, constitutional change and so on.  What are the take-away lessons for us?  If we have an election in the UK at some point and there is a change of government and the environment happened to be right, what would we need to do?  What are the lessons from the Good Friday Agreement?  How do we close that gap with unionism if we ever have that opportunity again, keeping in mind the current status as a result of the Good Friday Agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.967" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022092900002#C00300"><p>There is a lesson in the process that gave us the agreement.  The inclusive nature of the process was important.  Having been involved in different talks processes, including the Brooke-Mayhew talks I found the more inclusive, bigger table for the Good Friday Agreement better in the sense that in a tighter situation, parties are very defensive about their own idiom or they are very careful about accepting language from other parties or whatever.  In the more open process, it was easier; language was able to be seasoned not least by people like the Women's Coalition; people were able to bring in a different perspective or maybe couch things in somewhat less political and what sounded like more academic terms.  That was able to neutralise the debate and open up discussion away from fixed positions.  That was important.  Then there was the role of the two Governments working together.  Remember, the work that the two Governments were doing in those talks was, as I said, based on other layers of understanding that had been built up over the years.  A lot of the language in the agreement was not actually new to 1998.  A lot of the language in the agreement is actually derived from the Downing Street Declaration for instance, or from the frameworks document which in turn was influenced by things such as the Brooke-Mayhew talks and things that had been discussed there.  It was building on those layers of understanding which, unfortunately, seem to be completely forgotten on the British Government side.  At times, I think that we have gone through an unlearning process since the agreement and the people who have most gone through the unlearning process, to my mind, is the British Government and particularly this British Government which might, in the context of Brexit, pay a lot of lip service to the Good Friday Agreement.  Collectively we have not done enough to ensure due adherence to the agreement.  I mentioned that the agreement provides for review which we have never really used as constructively as it might be.  I know people are sometimes fearful of reviews.  They say that if you do a review it will create a run on the agreement but the fact is that I do not think we could do any more damage to the agreement by a review now than, say, by some of the changes that were made at St. Andrews which we are currently paying a price for now because the changes at St. Andrews allowed a party to veto the formation of an executive which was never the case before.</p> <p>  We need to get back to that inclusive spirit when we are facing problems.  We also need to remember that we would not have reached the Good Friday Agreement if we had simply talked past each other and ignored where people were saying they had genuine problems or issues.  We had to address those issues.  We only got an agreement by mutual adjustment.  Mutual engagement on its own does not bring about an agreement.  It takes mutual adjustment were people are able to vary some of the language either of their proposals or their objections to reach more accommodation.  That seems to me to be missing at the minute in the context of all the stand-offs that there are around the protocol and everything else.  We need to remember the value of the institutions themselves.  The institutions were meant, themselves, to help solve problems and be a way of us facing and tackling problems together.  That should be true of the protocol itself.  I am not one of those who says to the DUP it should just go into the Executive because the issues of the protocol are clearly between the UK and the EU.  I believe that an executive would have good agency in putting forward ideas for improving the workings of the protocol.  Both the UK Government and the EU would find it hard to ignore proposals that were agreed by the executive. I do not think that it is impossible to envisage that there could be such proposals; after all, we did have the joint letter from Martin McGuinness and Arlene Foster in August 2016.  Just before Theresa May called the election in 2017 the all-party talks that were then taking place included discussions on tackling some of the Brexit issues.  Obviously then there were issues like the backstop in the air and all the rest of it.  The fact is that you could actually see positive prospects for parties working together, including through their different departmental responsibilities in government, to tackle some of these problems.  We just need to learn the lessons of what has worked in the past and what was pointing to a way of working and recover some of that.  Also in that context, I would mention paragraph 17 of strand 2 provides that North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC ,can discuss EU matters and that arrangements would be made to ensure that the views of the NSMC could be represented at relevant EU meetings.</p><p>That should not be ignored in this context because the Brexiteers tell us that not one letter of the agreement has been changed by Brexit, so that paragraph still stands.  We should look at how we can use that to answer many of the complaints about a democratic deficit with the protocol.  The NSMC would be a channel for ministers in the North to put forward their views on relevant EU matters.  That helps to address some of the problem with the democratic deficit.  Let us value what we agreed, appreciate what it took to agree it and maybe acknowledge that we have not been attentive enough in implementing it.</p></speech>

It is lovely to read.  He talked about rights promises.  I want to ask him about the legacy Bill, which is an attack on rights.  The Irish Government is, of course, completely opposed to the legacy Bill.  We had a cross-community group of victims here yesterday.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, met them and reiterated how the Bill is not acceptable.  It is important for politicians to continue to build momentum with victims and to support them.  The Bill is by perpetrators, for perpetrators.  How did we get here?  How did we get from the Stormont House Agreement to this?  In Mr. Durkan's experience, does the DNA of this Bill lie in the Hain legislation and those who crafted it?</p></speech>

I mentioned the rights provisions of the agreement in the opening statement.  They simply have not been fulfilled on so many counts.  I will not rehearse them all here.  Even when we had a Labour government, it was dilutory about the question of a bill of rights.  It introduced a false precondition that is not in the agreement that there would have to be all-party consensus before there could be legislation on a bill of rights.  The agreement was written to state that the bill of rights would be legislated for in the Westminster Parliament because we knew we could not get all-party agreement on the bill of rights in the Assembly or Executive.  It was outsourced to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to draw up proposals for what might be in a bill of rights, but there was a guarantee that the UK Government would legislate for a bill of rights, as the nearest thing one could get to entrenchment in those circumstances.</p> <p>  Various arguments were given whenever different parties and groups sought movement on the bill of rights.  Former secretaries of state made statements to indicate that nothing would really be added by a bill of rights that is not already covered in the EU charter on social and economic rights, or by the European Convention on Human Rights.  We know the EU charter no longer applies to the North.  We are looking at a situation where the ECHR applies less and less.  Various legislation has already ousted the ECHR as something people can use in the courts of Northern Ireland, such as the United Kingdom Internal Market Act.</p> <p>  The legacy issue is one of the areas in which the agreement itself is deficient.  I recall raising with Mo Mowlam on the night in question that the words had very little to do with victims or legacy.  She told me not to worry as the Women's Coalition had already contacted her about that, and she agreed.  I still do not think the words that were added were enough.  I can understand why people were diffident about putting in too much about legacy issues.  They were afraid that if we got into text that rehearsed things that happened in the past, it could become quite difficult.  The UK Government had previously appointed Kenneth Bloomfield to produce a report on legacy victims.  People used the point that they did not want to pre-empt that in some way or tilt at its independence.  Not all parties were necessarily happy with the prospect of what Kenneth Bloomfield might produce.  That created a situation where the agreement was more silent on legacy issues and victims than it should have been.  That is a point I have made whenever I have engaged with others from the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, trade unions and other groups.  When talking with people involved in the Colombian peace process, one point that I always made to them was to learn the lesson from our process that they need to address legacy issues up-front and face up and not to think they would take care of themselves or could be avoided afterwards.</p> <p>  I am glad that the Government and Opposition here are explicit in their opposition to the UK Government's Bill.  It basically vanquishes any prospect of serious rights to truth or justice for victims.  Nobody is necessarily trying to pretend that there would ever be a possibility of a huge number of prosecutions in unresolved cases, but the justice standard is the standard at which these matters need to be approached.  Most victims' groups are realistic about what the real prospect for truth translating into prosecution is, but they want to know that truth will be pursued and yielded.  They know that the approach of the British Government is to turn off that search for truth by pretending that it will somehow emancipate or invite all sorts of releases of truth from people who have, until now, hidden things and are determined to continue to hide things for their own reasons.  It has been criticised as being an amnesty and it is an amnesty in that sense.</p> <p>  Senator Currie mentioned the Hain legislation in 2005.  It, too, was for an amnesty.  It provided that anybody could go to a tribunal in secret and get a certificate that provided immunity to prosecution.  That certificate could be given an added seal of secrecy by the Secretary of State, so that the only people who might go to jail for any events of the past would be family members or media who might speculate that somebody got a certificate relating to a particular incident or crime.  It seems crazy that victims or survivors could end up being jailed and that journalists seeking truth could end up being prosecuted as a result of the Hain legislation, while perpetrators would not be prosecuted.  Perpetrators did not have to come forward themselves.  Anybody could do it on their behalf.</p> <p>  I remember challenging that legislation with a raft of amendments to try to expose just how pernicious it was and to challenge how one would prevent a situation where certificates would be issued in circumstances where people had not sought those certificates or were not admitting any involvement in those offences.  It was an amnesty that was agreed in 2005.  Thankfully, that Bill was withdrawn after enough victims' groups persuaded Sinn F&eacute;in to withdraw its support for the Bill, which it had supported on its introduction even though it clearly provided for an amnesty for anybody who wanted one.  That included loyalists, security forces and anybody accused on the republican side too.</p></speech>

The difference is that people were to go to a notional tribunal to claim this immunity.  The 2005 legislation in itself did not overtly say there would be no more prosecutions.  It did not provide a cut-off date or anything else but it would have made pursuit of prosecutions futile because people would have had these certificates issued by the tribunal.</p><p>It was giving a veneer of process and accountability.  I would not say that this Bill is exactly the same as what was proposed then.  It is different but the fact is that in effect, it means an amnesty.  It means the same thing to victims.  That is why victims were so unanimous in eventually opposing the Bill in 2005.  In 2005, it took a lot of victims some time to wake up to what the Bill was because of the media.  It was called the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, but the media kept dubbing it the "on the runs Bill", so people thought that it was just a Bill to deal with the anomalies that were there around "on the runs" and people who found their status questionable in terms of what might happen to them when they return to a given jurisdiction.  However, the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill was far more sweeping that.  Unfortunately, we have come back to amnesty again.  While we can and must criticise the British Government for that, this also comes back to the fact that the parties and the political process collectively have failed to agree a proper way forward and a legacy at different times.  Different parties have different reasons for trying to avoid different proposals or to resile from different proposals on legacy.  That has yielded a situation where a British Government has been able to do what it is doing and say that everything else that has been tried or that has been suggested has been turned down, and saying that this is all that we can do.  We should criticise the British Government but we need to reflect on our own possible agency in this as well.   </p></speech>

Although it is difficult within the confines of the agreement at the time, I want to better understand the mindset on the difference between achieving an agreement and knowing that you are achieving an agreement essentially on constitutional and political structures and having a sense that things were being left over, as it were, for example, legacy or the path towards mutual respect and reconciliation.  To what extent at the time were people aware of that or thinking about that?  Has Mr. Durkan been surprised or disappointed in terms of the operation of the agreement and how things have actually played since?</p></speech>

As she says, when we negotiated the agreement, we knew that we working on institutional frameworks and constitutional precepts to take account of the fact that there were two very different aspirations.  We wanted to make sure that those differences did not prevent agreed institutions from being established in the North, North-South and east-west.  We also knew that we could not write into the terms of all those institutions all the protections that people might feel that they needed, which is why so many of the rights provisions of the agreement appear separately from strand one, strand two or strand three.  There is therefore some read-across in strand one to some of the rights provisions but the rights provisions are there separately and distinctly.  In some cases, that was because some of the Ulster Unionists' negotiating team had a particular bugbear when it came to questions of rights and we knew that we were not going to get the rights language agreed in strand one itself.  It was going to have to be in separate sections.</p> <p>  It would be remiss not to point out that one of the people who had such a big hand in the rights provisions - and there are two sections of the agreement that are headed rights, equality and safeguards - was Mo Mowlam.  Mo stayed out of the weeds of the institutional negotiations; she did not want to get involved on the detail about executives, ministers and assembly committees and all the rest of it.  She was happy to leave that to Paul Murphy.  However, what Mo did concentrate on was making sure that whatever institutions were agreed, there would be strong rights provisions and that those rights provisions would also extend to citizens having the right, using the ECHR to go to court and even overturn Assembly legislation.  We wrote it into the agreement.  Here we were negotiating to create an assembly but we were actually giving citizens the right to go into the courts and overturn Assembly legislation if it was deemed to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Those provisions are there, as I said earlier, the dimmer switch has been applied to them really ever since the agreement.  Now it faces real difficulties.</p> <p>  From someone in the SDLP negotiating team, what I recall is that John Hume's two lenses for looking at everything was through rights and relationships.  The institutional arrangements were meant to be arrangements that could foster better relationships, both within the North and North-South, while also upholding rights.  That was the idea.  We may have presumed that getting the physics of the institutions right meant that the chemistry would happen by itself, but it has not and did not.  However, it has done at times.  The chemistry within the institutions even at times of difficulty has worked better.  It would be wrong to say that the whole thing has been a disappointment or that things have gone wrong.  It is just that something as good as the Good Friday Agreement, and as overwhelmingly endorsed as the Good Friday Agreement, needs better care, attention and respect, as far as adherence is concerned.  There is this idea that we can let different parts of agreement go.</p> <p>  It is not just parties that let parts of the agreement go.  Look how long the two Governments let the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference go without meeting.  Why?  There is no point in them calling themselves co-guarantors of the agreement if they are setting a pretty bad standard.  This was not meeting at times when there were not the difficulties between the British and Irish Governments that there are now.  It tended to be neglected.  It kind of frightens the unionist horses.  Unionists do not like the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference that much but that was not a good reason for not discharging the commitment and the agreement to meet every year to deal with non-devolved matters.  The text of the agreement says that relevant Ministers from the Executive can be invited to those meetings.  That is the way of assuring people that there is nothing wrong or that nothing untoward is going on.  I would like to correct what I just said there now, I have said that the text of the agreement says that Ministers could come in.  If we actually read the text of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference section of the agreement, paragraph seven does not actually use the term "Northern Ireland Ministers", because at the stage that it was written, there still was not agreement on Northern Ireland Ministers.  Instead, the clunky language refers to those with executive authority representing the Northern Ireland administration.  That was one of the clunky bits of language that was not caught in the final draft of the agreement.  </p></speech>

We got that squared.  We got the Ministers squared in strand one, and obviously the language of strand two was squared with that, but it was not ironed out in that paragraph, which is why that clunky language appears, but it is what it means now; it refers to Ministers.  We can all ask ourselves why we have let different bits go.  Is it for the sake of not stirring things up or of not creating problems?  We should just be doing it as due diligence.  When you have something like the Good Friday Agreement, the institutions should be the process after that.  The process should be the institutions.  By and large, that is not what happened.  We got into a situation whereby the two Governments created a sense that the process was different from the institutions and that the institutions were neither here nor there at times.  We had that with the Mandelson suspension originally and all those things.  That became a creeping attitude.  That has created a moral hazard that has put us into the circle that we got into from 2017 to 2020 and that we are in again now.</p></speech>

I will be sharing my time with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  It is good to see Mr. Durkan here today.  I listened with interest to what he has to say.  I want to thank him for his contribution to the Good Friday Agreement, because I think we sometimes forget how much it has achieved and how far we have come in a quarter of a century.  As we are the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we focus a lot on what has not been implemented as well.</p><p>These discussions are useful on that basis to look at how we may move those things forward.</p><p> Also, we need to be mindful of how much things have changed in the whole landscape, the political landscape and the landscape in the North, most recently on foot of the census.  There is no longer a unionist majority, and Michelle O'Neill is the First Minister designate.  All those things have changed.  The other day I listened with interest to Mr. Durkan on "Talkback" discuss the referendum and preparedness for it.  I think he referred to that in his statement in the context of the necessity to plan and to prepare for where we are at the moment.  Mr. Durkan will have heard this from the whole island and the diaspora, but there is an appetite for people looking to the future and the constitutional future of the island.</p><p> Therefore, we and many other politicians and civic society have been calling on the Irish Government to set up a citizens' assembly on Irish unity as an appropriate citizen-led initiative to discuss the constitutional future of the island.  I note that in Mr. Durkan's contribution, he talked about an open process of bringing in different perspectives and getting people away from fixed positions, and I completely agree with him.  I saw that, as late as Monday night, Donegal County Council passed a motion - it was a Sinn F&eacute;in motion but it passed with the support of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael - on writing to the Taoiseach to establish a citizens' assembly, so I think there is a real appetite for that.</p><p> I think Senator Black is present on Teams.  She will probably talk about Ireland's Future's Together We Can event on Saturday.  That is really significant.  I think all the political parties are involved in that, as well as all the different organisations and the diaspora.  There will also be speakers from the unionist tradition there.  The big ask from the event is that the Irish Government plan for the future and establish an all-island citizens' assembly.</p><p> As this would be one of the most fundamental changes in our country since partition, how important does Mr. Durkan think it is to provide such a forum for people to contribute their views, to discuss what a new and united Ireland would look like and to have an informed discussion, whether about health, education or any of the other issues that may be in people's minds, about what things may look like in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.981" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022092900002#F00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for those points and questions.  As I said in my statement, I think there is a really strong case for proper deliberative moves to curate Article 3 of the Constitution.  Article 3.1 states &quot;It is the firm will of the Irish nation, in harmony and friendship, to unite all the people who share the territory of the island of Ireland, in all the diversity of their identities and traditions, recognising that a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island.&quot;  I think the Irish Government could, for instance, move to revive the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation or something like it.  It may not need to meet in as big a format or on a public, weekly basis, but there certainly should be deliberative, well-framed, inter-party discussions.  I believe that something like that would be a helpful preliminary to the establishment of a citizens' assembly or anything else.  I think a citizens' assembly, when it is convened, will want to know if there is at least some established wavelength of thinking across political parties and the various parties likely to form governments here, in the North or whatever.  Like the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I think such an exercise can be open to all parties, North and South.  Not all parties may attend, but the terms of reference should not of themselves prevent any party attending because, after all, the language of the terms of Article 3 was accepted and agreed in the talks by unionist negotiators.  Part of the balance for accepting the institutions in strand 2 was that there was also acceptance of the terms of the constitutional change in Articles 2 and 3.  I know some unionists who will say that, as far as they are concerned, the people of Ireland can be united even under existing arrangements.  I have some unionists friends who say the people of Ireland united to vote for the agreement North and South so it does not have to mean a unitary state for the people to be united.  People can have different views as to what they hope Article 3 would lead to in respect of uniting the people.<br/><br/>Article 3 was also carefully worded in expressing the firm will of the Irish nation.  It was deliberately framed not to create a direct obligation on the State to be seen to be prosecuting or pushing for unity.  That was to balance the provisions that were there on the UK Government side about accepting that it is the right of the Irish people to self-determination without external impediment.  Just in the same way the British Government was saying it would have no agenda standing in the way of unity, the balance was that the Irish Government could not be seen to be saying that the State and every Irish Government had to be pushing for unity because, if that nuance was not there, unionists would say Article 3 was not really changing in the Good Friday Agreement.<br/><br/>Therefore, for all sorts of reasons there are live discussions about constitutional change, the prospect for constitutional change, what the necessary processes would be and just what are all the logical and logistical issues we would have to go through to even bring about a healthy, respectful debate.  The fact is that, in respect of the provisions in the agreement, and while there is some necessary collective ambiguity, or there was collective ambiguity at the time, around some of the precise terms on providing for a possible poll on the constitutional status of the North, that was not inserted into the agreement as a dead letter.  I wonder at times when I hear some people say that yes, the provision is there, but no, we should not do it because it would somehow subvert reconciliation or jeopardise the agreement if those things are even talked about.  It is framed such that there are two equally legitimate aspirations, so people cannot be told that one of those aspirations dare not speak its name or that they dare not try to frame an agenda or express that aspiration in any positive way.  In the long journey to the Good Friday Agreement, it took all sorts of deliberative stages for people to get our heads around language and concepts and to be able to arrive at language that could be more shared and more commonly understood.  It will be the same when it comes to the questions of constitutional status.  I do not think we should spend our time at the moment being fixated on asking the current British Government what the criteria would be for calling a poll.  I am glad we are not stuck with the Brandon Lewis test or the Brandon Lewis doctrine as to what the criteria would be because they would probably be criteria that Deputy Conway-Walsh and I would object to and have issue with.  I do not think, therefore, that we should be asking the British Government to lay down <i>ex cathedra</i>grounds on which a poll might be called.<br/><br/>We also have to be wise to the fact that the terms in the agreement that oblige a Secretary of State to call a poll may not be the only conditions on which a poll could be called.  A proof of that is that the first political leader to call for a constitutional status poll after the Good Friday Agreement was actually David Trimble.  In the spring of 2002 he advocated having a poll to coincide with the then scheduled Assembly elections for May 2003.  At that time he made the point that the obligation on the Secretary of State is conditional and circumstantial but it is not a general restriction that would prevent a poll being called and agreed on other grounds and other bases.</p><p>Similarly, I recall a speech given by Peter Robinson in Queen's University Belfast a few years ago in which he stated that unionists should possibly agree to a poll, that it should not be on the same basis as in the agreement but on a different basis and that, therefore, the seven-year itch would not be triggered, as it were, and it would be generational.  We already have evidence of people thinking beyond the choice that a British Secretary of State is obliged to take under the terms of the agreement.  It is healthy that the rest of us are thinking about those possibilities.  How can we create the prospect of having a debate where those who want to remain in the United Kingdom and those who want a united Ireland can put forward their proposals positively along with a clear prospectus for that?  We know from the whole Brexit nonsense that one does not want campaigns that are not evidence based, nor a situation where people vote for outcomes for which there is not a clear prospectus and people are free to write and argue their own version of things after that, with all the destructive effects.  There is a duty for us to try to frame that debate.  That is why I deliberately referred to curating Article 3.</p><p> In taking steps to ensure due diligence in deliberations, we should start with parties, extend it to citizens' assemblies and commission expert input.  I say citizens' assemblies because I do not expect it will be a one-off exercise.  A series of assemblies will be needed to focus on different issues.  Parties would then have to regroup and retune based on what comes back from those expert groups and citizens' assemblies.  It is a longer process and it needs to start now.  There is no virtue in not preparing or planning.</p><p> Some people have said we cannot talk about these things until reconciliation has taken place.  What is going to be the test for sufficient reconciliation before we can have this debate?  In addition, we should not suggest that those who want constitutional change are not as committed to reconciliation as those who do not want constitutional change, or that they do not see constitutional change as being the space in which reconciliation can be best fostered.</p></speech>

There is shared responsibility on that.  Mr. Durkan is welcome back.  I know he was a long-standing and engaged member of this committee and he is familiar with its work.  I thank him for his presentation.  I apologise for missing his contribution as I was in the Seanad Chamber, but I read his submission.</p> <p>  There are a couple of issues I wish to raise and I will be as brief as I can.  I agree with most of what Mr. Durkan said about the failure to implement a number of aspects of the agreement.  This failure lies primarily but not exclusively with the British Government.  Given where we are in the context of the work of this committee, it is important that we name failures on the part of the Irish Government.  I will go through my thinking behind that and seek Mr. Durkan's analysis given where he is coming from.</p> <p>  On the provision in the Good Friday Agreement on the right to identify and be accepted as Irish, British, or both, some people think in the context of the agreement that Articles 2 and 3 were done away with as opposed to replaced.  While Mr. Durkan has referred to Article 3 a number of times, and it is an important article, I want to talk a wee bit about Article 2, the right of everyone born on the island to be part of the Irish nation.</p> <p>  In the context of the provision in the Good Friday Agreement on the right to identify and be accepted as Irish and Article 2 of the Constitution on the right to be part of the Irish nation, there have been systematic issues and failures and, in a way, erosions over the past 25 years on the part of this State.  There has been a failure to give speaking rights to MPs in the D&aacute;il, which was spoken about for a long time.  There was the recent failure by the Opposition to allow MPs and MLAs sit on special Oireachtas committees, such as this, that would look at specific issues such as autism, which are dealt with under the agreement and other agreements as all-Ireland healthcare issues.  I refer to the whole campaign around voting rights and all of that.  Is there a need for the Irish Government to engage in some self-reflection on giving effect to Article 2 as well Article 3 and how it should best go about doing that in the context of the Good Friday Agreement?</p> <p>  A former Secretary of State in the North spoke online last week about how the UK Government's strategy on the union needed a radical shift.  Does that chime with rigorous impartiality?  What does Mr. Durkan think about the British Government's undertakings?  While I appreciate this was someone reflecting and providing their own opinion, does it chime with the responsibility to be rigorously impartial on this issue, or does that responsibility only come into effect if and when a referendum is announced?</p></speech>

I want Mr. Durkan to have the opportunity to answer those questions - we all do - but I want to make sure I am being fair to everybody.  The SDLP slot is next.  I do not think Alliance Party members can make it today, nor can Green Party members, as far as I am aware.  Following this reply, the speaking time will rotate to Sinn F&eacute;in's second slot, if that is okay.  That is fair as everyone would have a second opportunity.  On your marks again, Mark.</p></speech>

It is not conditional on a particular time.  The only condition that changes it is a change of sovereignty, which would mean the duty of rigorous impartiality would be on a different government.  That should be in force anyway.  The obligation of rigorous impartiality in and of itself does not prevent a political party in a government from having a view.  We must carefully distinguish between the outright machinery of government and the state and free political expression that is open to everybody.  For instance, a future British Labour minister should not be precluded from indicating that he or she is comfortable with a united Ireland.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Other people should not be precluded on a party basis, if they belong to a conservative and unionist party, from expressing a particular preference.</p> <p>  I refer to the point raised about looking at things in the context of the British Government.  When looking at the British political landscape, it is clear that we will probably see all sorts of people coming up with new visions for the union in the coming years.  There could be a new shared union.  Just as people may get confused about a new Ireland or shared island and get upset or worried about such terms, the fact is that such things will be canvassed in the context of the politics of Great Britain with respect to Scotland and the rest of it.  We should not be apologising for allowing such language to circulate and build up in common understanding in Ireland.  We should go ahead with that.</p> <p>  On the point about the Irish Government and speaking rights, that could be a fair enough proposal.  In the past, in the context of a united Ireland, I have proposed that one of the ways of accommodating people's continuing British identity and affinity with Britain would be to allow some Northern Ireland representation to continue in a reformed second chamber in Westminster.  I have never advocated that is should be in the primary chamber.  I would not want a situation in a united Ireland where people felt they could abstain from the Irish national Parliament and take speaking rights in the British national Parliament.  I want a united Ireland to be one in which unionists realise the benefits of taking up their full entitlement in an Irish national Parliament, while still giving them the right of access to a second chamber or whatever in Westminster.</p><p>You can take a long, rounded view on some of these things, which would mean the choices around speaking rights or whatever mean less.  In the Good Friday Agreement, people agreed that Westminster would be the Parliament to legislate for certain things, including the bill of rights, the agreement itself and all the rest.  That would terminate in the event of a vote for a united Ireland but I do not think it should end the relationship some people would still want to have with the British body politic.  That is one of the challenges we have to recognise in our conversations around possible constitutional status, how it would be calibrated, what it would mean and what accommodating a British identity is.  Accommodating a British identity has to mean more than just allowing people to have passports.  It will have to run much deeper than that for people, in the same way that many of us value when the North has representation in the Seanad.  We would just like that on a more structured, regular and deliberate basis.</p></speech>

That aspect of the Good Friday Agreement has to prevail in any post-unity scenario, that is, respecting people's right to identify, be accepted and give expression to that identity and that national identity, whatever it might be.  In the same way that it has to be more than giving people of a British tradition passports, surely in the context of the Good Friday Agreement provision and Article 2, it also has to be more than just giving people like Mr. Durkan and I passports and sin &eacute; - that is it.  That is not really being part of the Irish nation as such.  While I agree that we need to have those more nuanced conversations and get into the entrails of what it would mean post a unification outcome, we also have to look at it in the context of the here and now.  This is more the technical side of things but I know Mr. Durkan is into the technical side.  According to the GFA provision, people have the right to identify and be accepted as Irish.  Then there is Article 2 of the Constitution, which says people have a right to be part of the Irish nation.  How do we give greater effect to that than just giving people a passport so they can go and travel?  That is very important and I am not diminishing the important symbolism of that.  None of us derives our Irishness from the Good Friday Agreement or Article 2 of the Constitution.  It goes much deeper than that.  There has to be an expectation there, in the same way we would expect the British Government to implement the aspects around the bill of rights and everything else.  Surely there has to be an onus on the Irish Government to lean into giving effect, in a greater way, to what it has said, particularly in the context of increasing numbers of people from the unionist tradition wanting to avail of a passport.  Many more of them are also considering issues of representation and engagement.  I hope I am wording that right.  I know it is a bit-----</p></speech>

It has been very enlightening.  We have had some discussions around the review of the Good Friday Agreement, where we would like to go to and the dangers, opportunities and challenges of that.  One of those areas is North-South institutions.  For reasons Mr. Durkan might touch upon, the areas to be included in North-South arrangements were decided in 1998.  Where do we stand today?  We have to look at the biodiversity and nature crisis.  Is there scope to expand North-South institutions to look at that?  How do we make those institutions and functions more resilient?  They were one of the first things to go when there were troubled waters at Stormont.  As Mr. Durkan has alluded to already, the only function of the Good Friday Agreement that is currently working is the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which is due to meet shortly.  How would we make the North-South institutions more robust in the time ahead, if we had that ability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.1004" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022092900002#H01500"><p>The North-South provisions agreed in 1998 ended up being necessarily limited because of reactions to the text at the time.  People were on the defensive because they had objected to what had been envisaged in the framework document in 1995 and that, perhaps, shopsoiled some of the ideas for North-South arrangements.  While what was agreed in 1998 and regarding which implementation bodies and areas of co-operation would be legislated for, to happen on day one alongside devolution, they were all open to further development.  That could be development of their own remits, their remits being complemented by other areas of co-operation being agreed or by other implementation bodies and so on.  We have not really had that since unionist parties have taken a "keep it low, keep it slow" approach as far as North-South engagement is concerned.</p> <p>  When we negotiated the agreement, as well as the civic forum in the North, it was cast that there could be a North-South consultative forum as well.  The idea of that was to try to ensure that positive ideas for North-South co-operation, policy co-ordination and deepening or widening areas of co-operation would come not necessarily as party political demands but as very credible sectoral ambitions and initiatives.  The test unionists in particular have is whether something is a real issue and if it will be of mutual benefit and collective interest.  That test would almost be proven by who was coming forward with many of these ideas and proposals as they would be coming from the sectors themselves.  Unfortunately we do not have that.  I hope that in any renewal or review of the agreement, we could get back to those sorts of intents because not everything has to come from political parties or through political processes.  We see examples of that in a lot of the debate around the protocol and some of the options for moving there.</p> <p>  There was also meant to be a North-South parliamentary forum.  The engagement between the Assembly and these Houses is done in a very stilted way and it could be done much more organically.  In any renewal or review, rather than us just getting fixated on the feng shui of changing a bit of the furniture in the NSMC, we should look to that dimension as well because positive ideas and engagement can come from that.  A more intentional North-South parliamentary forum could provide the space for the sort of engagement Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile was talking about earlier, with MLAs, Senators and Deputies being able to sit down and talk about different issues or how to advance policies.  We need to come into this with lateral thinking.  We should also recognise that even on a vexed issue like the protocol, Article 14(b) of the protocol actually states that the North-South Ministerial Council and-or the implementation bodies could put forward proposals to the specialised committee.</p><p>InterTradeIreland's remit could easily be repointed so that, if the EU and UK Government are discussing a trusted trader scheme, there could be a role for it in overseeing and vouching for that scheme.  In terms of co-operation on agriculture and animal health, the food safety advisory body's bandwidth could be widened to deal with some of the issues that obtain post protocol, post Brexit or whatever the case may be.  We just have to come at this situation creatively.  We do not want to jeopardise what we agreed in 1998, but we should not be so defensive as to not build it up.  As has been mentioned, we are more than 24 years on and there are different policy issues pressing, some of which entail international obligations and standards.  We should be looking to how North-South and east-west arrangements can address some of those difficulties.</p></speech>

Before I do, I thank Mr. Durkan for sharing his considerable professional knowledge and for the openness of his ideas.  "Radical" might not be the right word to use, but what he is discussing are tangible steps that do not threaten anyone and that allow for communication, growth and an understanding and appreciation of what everyone on all sides is thinking.  If it is appropriate of me to say, I would welcome Mr. Durkan putting some of his tangible and constructive ideas down on paper for us, if he has not already done so.  I would be more than happy for our committee to use them to articulate that voice.  An issue for us is that this committee always hears the nationalist voice but never hears the unionist voice because unionists will not participate.  That presents a difficulty.  If we can take practical steps such as those that Mr. Durkan mentioned and point out new ways of communicating without threatening unionists' Britishness, it will be key, as will recognising that they have the same right as we do - I am a nationalist - to hold the opposite view.  We must engage.  I could say that it is like the tyres are flat on the Good Friday Agreement, but it has actually run out of breath and the race is over at this stage.  Everyone is losing out.  There are no North-South bodies, our east-west relations have never been worse and there is no Government in the North.  We are at a bad place.  I would welcome anything that could change that in a constructive way, such as the ideas that Mr. Durkan has proposed.</p> <p>  I apologise, but I must go to speak on the budget.  I ask Senator Blaney to take over.</p></speech>

I will take seven minutes and give Deputy Lawless the last eight.</p> <p>  Mr. Durkan referenced Mr. John Hume and relations.  From my perspective, the Irish Government is leading in this area through the work and research being done by the shared island unit.  What is Mr. Durkan's opinion on that?  It is investigating 62 relevant aspects.  One of the greatest arguments around constitutional change on this island, particularly from the Southern perspective, is about whether the Southern Government could afford it if we had unity tomorrow.  Could we get over hiccups like the disparities in healthcare and education?  The idea behind the shared island unit is to say once and for all what those disparities are.  That information will be vital in any future talks on how this island moves forward.</p> <p>  Through its work at community level, the shared island unit is currently the only vehicle that is getting the opportunity to go into unionist communities.  That is vital.  What is Mr. Durkan's opinion on this?  From my perspective, the unit's approach is non-confrontational.  Are there lessons to be learned from this?  We might all have the same aspirations, but we sometimes talk about them too much before people are even at the table.</p></speech>

As with other areas, some of the unionist parties have taken issue with it.  I can understand that in one sense because the phrase "shared island" was one of the phrases that we discussed during the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement in terms of what the name of the North-South arrangement would be.  They said "No" to "Council of Ireland", "No" to "Irish Council of Ministers", "No" to "Shared Island Council", etc.  Some of them may be going back to that.</p> <p>  It is not just the unit that is important, but also the fund.  The shared island fund has been able to cut through the drag factors that have kept back many worthy projects that people have agreed and endorsed down the years.  I am referring to projects that appeared in all sorts of planning documents but never happened.  The shared island fund has been a positive addition.  A number of years ago, I made the observation that the trick we missed with the Good Friday Agreement in setting up strand two - the ministerial council, defined areas of co-operation and implementation bodies, as if implementation bodies were going to be the highest form of North-South life - was in not creating an all-Ireland version of the European Structural Fund.  Unionists do not like structures and bodies, but they do not mind funds.  Who does?  This could be built into any review and we could draw lessons from the positive experience of the shared island fund and, at a lesser and sometimes more localised level, the experience of the peace and reconciliation fund.  The Department of Foreign Affairs's peace and reconciliation fund has very good cross-community reach in the North for the precise reasons that the Acting Chairperson has mentioned.  That helps to build assurance and acceptance by everyone of the relevance and benevolent interest of the Irish Government.  The shared island fund helps to enable activities.  I am conscious that, when the Taoiseach established the shared island unit, he stated that it would not be in the business of dealing with the unity debate.  As such, we must be careful about creating difficulties in that regard.  I can see why people want to keep those strands carefully delineated, but there are positive lessons to take from the shared island fund.</p> <p>  It would be good if, in a future review of the NSMC, we could agree longer term funding arrangements or structures, for example, a mini-version of the EU's funds.  At the final plenary session of the NSMC before the institutions were suspended in 2002, we agreed that capital investment and infrastructure plans North and South could come to it for joint consideration.  That is something that Mr. David Trimble agreed to and signed off on as a possible development of the NSMC's agenda.  He was interested in North-South projects like the Ulster Canal, which would have benefited from such funding.</p><p>It goes back to what I said earlier.  We need to recapture some of what we were trying to do before, but also learn from some of the good ideas that have developed since.</p></speech>

I listened with great interest to the witness talking through Article 3.  I always keep a copy of the blue book on my desk.  I had a quick flick through it as Mr. Durkan was talking through it.  It was interesting to hear his explanation of the thought process behind the text that was chosen, what went into that and how he saw it manifesting in due course.  One thing that caught my eye when I went to look at it again was that Article 3.2 refers to what we sometimes discuss as "the North-South institutions" or the executive bodies that have cross-Border reach.  That is the constitutional framework for those to give effect to their powers.  I will put two questions to Mr. Durkan and then he can come back with the others.  Does he think we have realised the potential of those institutions?  I know there are some, which tend to be in less contentious areas, such as Waterways Ireland and on the amenities, leisure and tourism side.  Can we go a lot further with that?  Are there other things we could and should be doing, or attempting to do or supporting, on this committee and elsewhere?  What sort of vision did Mr. Durkan have in mind at that time?  Casting his mind back, how can we realise the potential of that further?</p> <p>  The second question is slightly different.  I also asked other witnesses during this series of engagements with architects of the Agreement.  We have seen a lot of discussion in recent times that, following the Assembly elections, when members are elected and take up their seats, they are asked to designate.  I think it is a simple nationalist-unionist designation, but there is an increasing number of "other" members being elected and identifying as that.  Is it time to move on from a simplistic orange or green choice and look at a rainbow or different strands and move slightly away from that sort of demarcation?  Is it hindering things at this stage, even though it was important at the outset?</p></speech>

It was so judicious and nuanced.  Genius went into that wording.  I recall John Hume making the point at the time that some of it could perhaps appear on a passport.  I garnered from Bertie Ahern's response that that idea had occurred to him or was already afoot.  Of course, the wording in Article 2 is now part of the artwork on Irish passports.  I know new artwork commissioned; I hope the language of Article 2 remains in there and maybe some of the language of Article 3 as well.  I understand that the Irish Government at the time felt that if they put Article 3 into the artwork of the passport, that it might be misunderstood or misconstrued in some way.  It was a point of sensitivity that Article 2 featured on it.  I do think there is more we should be doing.</p> <p>  In terms of the potential of North-South institutions, we agreed limited areas in 1998.  There were negotiations after the Agreement and we got agreement in December 1998 on what the first areas of co-operation would be and the first implementation bodies.  Those were more limited than we wanted them to be.  For instance, we wanted the body that was set up as trade and business development to be trade, business development and inward investment.  The unionists did not want inward investment to be included.  As it happened, the veto on it came from the T&aacute;naiste in Dublin at the time, Ms Mary Harney.  She did not want inward investment in there.  The Industrial Development Authority Ireland, IDA, did not seem to have as many issues with this as the Industrial Development Board, IDB, did in the North.  We should be looking at those again.  Let us remember that the original terms included that the Commissioners of Irish Lights was meant to be in with the Foyle-Carlingford Commission.  That could not happen.  That was meant to be replaced; it never was.  We need to be looking at all of these things for the reasons the Deputy and others, including Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, have said.</p> <p>  I have to confess that I am the person who wrote that paragraph about designation.  It was written because the position in the talks was that parties wanted to have similar protections in the institutions coming out of the talks as were in the ground rules of the talks themselves.  One of the ground rules in the talks was the rule of sufficient consensus.  We borrowed this idea from all of the lessons the different parties and governments had learnt from the South African process.  The sufficient consensus rules said that a proposition would stand if it was supported by parties who were supported by a majority of the people, including majorities of unionists and nationalists, respectively.  When that protection was agreed in the talks, including by the DUP and the UK Unionist Party, when they were still in the talks, parties felt that it would be odd not to have such a safeguard in the institutions coming out of those talks.  As an example of examining how it would work, it could have been done on a party basis, but the feeling was it would have to be done it on an individual MLA basis to allow for different parties that might emerge in the future and to allow for independents, etc., so it would be done by MLA.  That is why it was written in those terms.  I said long ago and it was part of what I got into trouble for calling the "ugly scaffolding" of the Agreement.  I recall at the time, when we negotiated the Agreement, we said that some of these provisions would, we hoped, be biodegradable and that as the environment changed, they could dissolve and our reliance on them would change.  Part of the thinking also was that a robust and articulate bill of rights, as we hoped would emerge under the Agreement, would itself be a significant safeguard and would mean that a lot of these checks and balances would not have to play out as vetoes inside the institutional decision-making.</p> <p>  However, it does need to change.  There are different ways this can be done.  Obviously, not all parties will agree to a change.  In the current context, unionist parties would say that any attempt to move away from this is an attempt to weaken the position of unionists, at a point where this might become a more significant protection for them, and that we are trying to remove and dissolve it in light of all the arguments around the protocol, etc.  There are ways of doing things, for instance, reverting to the idea that the Assembly has to jointly elect First Ministers, rather than parties being given the exclusive private right to nominate respective posts.  That joint election should no longer rest exclusively on parallel consent, which is the 50% + 50% + 50% rule, but it could be done by the other qualified weighted majority or by a two-thirds majority, which would mean it would not then depend on designation.  In the current situation, it would mean, for example, that one party would not be able to prevent the formation of the Executive, just by refusing to exercise its exclusive right to nominate a deputy First Minister.  That is a way of reducing the impact of designation, even if we cannot entirely remove it from the provisions.  I do not think you would get cross-party agreement to completely remove it, but you could severely reduce its impact and create other alternatives in that respect, given that there are more people designated as "other", etc.</p></speech>

It meant that it had to be supported by 50% by parties with the support of more than 50% of people, including more than 50% of nationalists and more than 50% of unionists.</p><p>That was called parallel consent.  The joint election of First Ministers was the only part in the agreement where parallel consent was an absolute requirement and that was disposed of at St. Andrew's at the behest of the DUP which now quotes parallel consent as though it is key thing for everything in the Good Friday Agreement.  Parallel consent was only named for the one decision, which was the joint election.  We should go back to joint election but it should not rest on parallel consent alone.</p></speech>

The Irish Government has tried to honour Article 2 in a significant way, including by ensuring it appears on passports.  While I agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile that identity is not only expressed in the right to carry a passport, it is good it is in the artwork of the current passport and I hope that will not be lost in the move to commission new artwork for the passport.<br/><br/>As regards moving North-South discussions forward, we need to respect the fact that some of the architecture was set out in 1998.  We want to develop that as far as we can.  In so far as that is stymied, we can use alternative ways to assist in some of the issues, for example, as the Senator mentioned, the shared island unit.  If some issues are being stilted and stunted in the context of the North-South Ministerial Council arrangements that does not rule out other airspace being opened up in a creative, positive, pragmatic and non-threatening way, but that is not a substitute for being able to hold a mature, adult conversation about the prospect and possibility of constitutional change.<br/><br/>In respect of constitutional change, democratic, pro-agreement Ireland needs to have a discussion to clarify what the criteria might be for calling a poll, or the question to be asked, rather than waiting for a British secretary of state to set his or her criteria.  In the same way as democratic Ireland thought ahead, through the New Ireland Forum and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, even when unionists were refusing to engage and participate.  Democratic Ireland thought about the type of political arrangements which might be agreed in negotiations and proposals that could be borne by both unionists and nationalists.  We had to be realistic about what was likely to be agreed in negotiations and could be passed in a referendum North and South, as Mr. John Hume always recommended.<br/><br/>If we were able to have that sort of constructive dialogue in the past there is no reason not to do the same around constitutional change.  It meant we were ready in negotiations with unionists with suggestions they could agree to and unionist voters were able to vote for.  It can be done in a constructive way, especially if it is done in terms of curating Article 3.  That means a renewed or revived forum for peace and reconciliation that considers how we can develop the thinking and share new thinking around Article 3 and that is equally open to those who support Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom as it is to those who support a united Ireland.  It would not only consider a united Ireland.  Those who want to talk about and plan for a united Ireland could do so.  Those who have a different view could express theirs also.  Those are terms in which Article 3 is written.<br/><br/>We need to examine this in a manner that is seen to be without prejudice or presumption and of course without the predicament of calling a referendum or a referendum being called upon us with no plan.  Other people may have their reasons for moving towards a referendum.  Mr. David Trimble did in 2002, hoping it would be held in 2003.  We know why he did it, but a unionist leader or leaders could calculate that they want to hold a poll.<br/><br/>I do not use the term &quot;Border poll&quot;, but rather constitutional change.  I know I will not win a battle of political correctness on that issue, but the reason I do not use the term &quot;Border poll&quot; is that those of us who want a united Ireland need to remember we need to address many more issues than just antipathy to the Border.  We must also respect the views of people who will vote to remain part of the United Kingdom and who will not <i>per se</i>be voting for the Border.  I have unionist friends who say they would be quite happy to have a borderless Ireland and want it to be even more borderless than it is at present.  Their vote for the union is not a vote for a Border in any shape or form.  Therefore it is helpful to alter the language.<br/><br/>We should also be clear that the referendum should not be a vote for or against a united Ireland.  The vote should be a choice between the two equally legitimate aspirations, United Kingdom or united Ireland, because then it is up to both sides to come up with a positive prospectus and give positive assurances about what the outcome will mean if their side of the debate wins.  If the question is unity - yes or no - in addition to typecasting unionists into a no-vote again, there is also the danger of making it easy to build up confusion and fears on a &quot;if you do not know, vote no&quot; basis.  That could apply in the South as well as the North.</p></speech>

I have met Mr. Durkan previously.  It is good to see him again.</p> <p>  One of the useful things about the debate here is we have the opportunity to ask architects of the Good Friday Agreement about the past but also about their views of events today.  Mr. Durkan has been an MP for more than 12 years.  He knows Westminster inside out.  He knows it intrinsically.  The Irish Government has made many comments in the media in recent weeks that the new premiership of Ms Liz Truss offers the opportunity for a reset of Irish and British relations and that reset is important.  With Mr. Durkan's experience of both Irish politics and being in Westminster, does he think that reset is likely or feasible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.1028" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022092900002#L01100"><p>I thank the Senator.  I know why people said responsibly and reasonably that an opportunity for a reset exists.  Recent events mean that opportunity is somewhat polluted, in circumstances where you have a British Government in disarray and distracted.  However, the Irish Government and the Irish national democratic interest will have to be the adult in the room in trying to stabilise matters and move forward.  We saw that with Brexit.  Only the Irish Government planned and commissioned impact appraisals about what would flow from a vote to leave.  Whatever the British Government said at the time, it was not doing any of that work.  Whitehall was vetoed from doing it whereas the Departments in Dublin had desks stacked with papers they hoped could be disposed of on 24 June 2016.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Irish Government, and parties in this House and more widely on the island, through things like the all-Island civic dialogue, paid due attention to the broad interests of the island, including the operation of the Good Friday Agreement with regard to the island economy and other dimensions.</p><p>The Irish Government will have to be the pace leader when it comes to these things and that applies in the context of the review when it comes to the anniversary of the agreement next year, which I would like to approach in a spirit of renew and review.  I know some people have concerns that if you do that, you are creating a run on the agreement, but it has already been sliced and diced in many different ways and subject to false interpretation.  We should come at it constructively and fairly.  There are things at the institutional level, which can be looked at and which do not preclude a healthy and reasonable conversation about constitutional change and how that could be managed in the background.  There are other issues around reconciliation and legacy that also need to be faced up to.  Irish Governments of all hues have been more responsible in relation to those issues than British Governments.</p></speech>

Over the last couple of months, when we have been speaking to people, there have been two very clear views on the Good Friday Agreement.  Some people argue that it should be left alone, as it was in 1998, and that an agreement is an agreement which cannot be altered and changed.  Others have suggested that it should be opened up to discussion again.  Am I right to say Mr. Durkan's view is that within two years, we should renew and review it and tinker with it, or should we leave it alone?  Where does Mr. Durkan stand on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.1031" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022092900002#M00300"><p>We should respect the validity of the broad architecture of the agreement.  However, 25 years on, the fixtures, fittings and furniture that come with it certainly need to be looked at again and used.  The agreement should not be looked on as a precious ornament, which is not to be touched.  It is a tool kit to be used and developed, not least in the context of many of the issues and questions Brexit throws up.  In terms of protecting the island economy and meeting the issues and difficulties that exist with the protocol, using the machinery of the agreement could be an answer, by using, repointing and repurposing some of the existing North-South implementation bodies.  We have a trade and business development body called InterTradeIreland.  While it was set up specifically with a remit to look at small and medium enterprises and to make sure they took full advantage of the market space not only in the island economy North and South, but also in wider markets, we need to look at that remit again not just in the context of the island and EU markets, but also the UK market.  Both the UK Government and the EU in their respective proposals about express lanes or red and green channels talk about a trusted trader scheme.  Can an existing North-South body be repointed to possibly oversee that?  It is in the protocol that proposals are invited to the EU-UK specialised committee from the North-South Ministerial Council, or some of the implementation bodies.  There is an invitation to use creative and lateral thinking but currently nobody seems to be taking that up.  We do not have a North-South Ministerial Council because we do not have an Executive but that is where the argument should be made to those holding back from forming an Executive to say they could challenge other parties in the North to agree proposals from the Executive to the joint committee and the specialised committee.  They could also challenge other parties in the North and the Irish Government to agree positive ideas for improving the workings of the protocol or easing the frictions around it by using those provisions in the protocol for the North-South Ministerial Council or implementation bodies.  We need to take and use the agreement and its machinery.  It is not treasure to be kept in a glass case.</p></speech>

It is not a golden thing on a hill that we should observe and leave it at that.  It is a tool kit that we can use to move forward in the modern era.  That is very astute.</p> <p>  Mr. Durkan mentioned the Executive.  There was an election in May but five or six months later, there is still no functioning Executive.  While we know the reasons behind that, it must be incredibly disheartening for the average person on the street of any town in Northern Ireland that having voted in an election, there is still not a functioning Executive.  In Mr. Durkan's view, and let us be blunt about it, is the DUP withholding from this Executive to try to push a second election in which it may do better?  Does he think an Executive will be formed before the deadline in October or does he think the North is looking to a second election?</p></speech>

I am not sure the DUP is holding out for a second election or if DUP councillors, who face council elections next year, think they would be helped by an Assembly election in the current context.  I think they might feel the public mood would not be very good.  Some of them might think that even should they claw back an extra seat or two, they will not out poll Sinn F&eacute;in.  Even if they got an equal number of seats, Sinn F&eacute;in would still have the right to be named First Minister.  There is no difference between First and deputy First Minister, but this difference has taken on a lot of false significance, which then becomes real.  I am not sure that a second election, in particular in these circumstances, would ease its problems.  Maybe some of them thought that against a backdrop of Liz Truss coming in and doing the protocol Bill that an election would help if they could make the Bill part of that.  I think the events of the last week have completely changed that scenario, if that was in some of their heads.  My view had been that if Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng had not done what they did with this mini-budget, we would see a bit of choreography whereby Liz Truss might let it be known that she had appointed all her ministers in every department in London on the basis that they would be ready to use the powers that come to ministers of the Crown under the Northern Ireland protocol Bill, that Jeffrey Donaldson and the DUP would claim that as significant assurance, and that they would probably have a few meetings with ministers to say they are ready to run and to use these powers and that they can go in on that basis, but if they are let down, the same as David Trimble, they will have the right to withdraw.  That would have included telling the House of Lords that if it interfered with the Bill, the DUP would pull out.  The House of Lords would be told that if it is bothered about this Bill, it is in danger of bringing down the institutions in Northern Ireland again.  They would use it as leverage.  They would claim victory but use it as leverage in that way.  That scenario has probably been changed by events of the past few days.  Liz Truss's standing probably would not work for that choreography in the way it might have done.</p></speech>

They come from the European Research Group, ERG, which is a particular home within the Conservative Party.  Would Mr. Durkan be worried about their political outlooks when it comes to Northern Ireland based on where they come from politically?</p></speech>

It becomes harder to see how those ministers are going to show rigorous impartiality given the sensitivities of some of these issues.  As Brexit champions, they were singularly insensitive to any of the considerations around the Good Friday Agreement.  That would be an issue.  I think it is wider than that in the sense that the ministers appointed to the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, do not have many levers at their disposal.</p><p>Chris Heaton-Harris might be given more of a role in EU-UK negotiations than was the case for previous Secretaries of State.  I do not know but there is some speculation about that.  The real issue is going to be when one looks at all of the ministers she has appointed.  In a way it is similar to what Borris Johnson announced when he first took over from Theresa May that every minister was appointed on the grounds that they had promised to deliver Brexit in absolute terms.  I would imagine Liz Truss would probably say that, similarly, she appointed all the ministers of the Crown in all of the various departments.  Remember the protocol Bill means that a minister in any department in London can have the power to change the law and change the legislation to supply part of the protocol partially or totally, then reapply it in bits, reinterpret it, and even rewrite legislation.</p><p> In the UK Parliament everybody calls these Henry VIII powers.  Out of mischief, I would actually call them James II powers because it is giving overweening powers to the Crown and completely negating the powers of Parliament.  The Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and others would claim that the glorious revolution and the Williamite cause was all about challenging that overweening power of the Crown and establishing rights of Parliament.  In supporting the protocol Bill, they have changed sides on the Williamite revolution.  </p></speech>

Yes, or I certainly think that we have to plan responsibly and carefully for it so that all of the issues that need to be appraised are properly addressed.  I do not think that will be a short exercise.  It will involve layers of inter-party discussion, layers of public engagement and different channels of expert consideration feeding back into public debate and back into inter-party discussions.  Most of the ideas that are in the Good Friday Agreement did not begin in the negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement.  Most of them were there based on and written into layers of understanding or if not written in at least discussed when we were having various talks between parties.  That includes the Brooke-Mayhew talks and the Hume-Adams talks.  It goes back to the New Ireland Forum, it includes the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and all sorts of Anglo-Irish negotiations that went on between officials.  We need to do that work now.  We cannot leave it until somebody decides that the criteria have been met to call a poll and then people are not ready to put forward a clear, coherent proposition in a credible way.  We also need to design that conversation so that it is actually about reconciliation.</p> <p>  One of the fulfilments of reconciliation under the agreement would be if we could have a safe, healthy debate on the choice of constitutional status for the North where people were not worried that the fact of having a referendum was jeopardising the agreement and people were assured that in either outcome the promises in terms of rights and protections that the agreement affords would still stand.  We need to do that, so I do not buy the argument that it somehow upsets or distracts from the reconciliation agenda to discuss the question of constitutional change.  We need to look at how we can have a healthy debate with honest differences over honest preferences where each side is going to have to take its chance.</p></speech>

Similarly, people need to be assured that if the vote is for a united Ireland, the agreements, promises and protections are not in any way dissolved by that.  The shape and form of a united Ireland has to give real life to those protections as well.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and his officials.

It is good to be back before the committee this week with another very important reforming intervention.  The two sets of regulations consist of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development)(No. 3) Regulations 2022 and the Planning and Development (Solar Safeguarding Zone) Regulations 2022, both of which concern planning exemptions for solar installations.  The two sets of planning regulations I am presenting to the committee today stem from commitments in the climate action plan and the programme for Government to review the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the principal regulations.  Further to these commitments, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken such a review.  The focus of the review was on microgeneration and primarily on facilitating the generation of electricity for self-consumption as a supplement to the microgeneration support scheme launched by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications earlier this year.</p><p>The first set of draft regulations I have laid before the Oireachtas is the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 3) Regulations 2022.  These amend the pre-existing solar panel planning exemptions set out in Schedule 2 to the principal regulations in respect of houses, industrial buildings, light industrial buildings and business premises and agricultural structures, and also extend the exemptions to apartments, educational buildings, health centres or hospitals, recreational or sports facilities, places of worship, community facilities or centres and certain sites operated by statutory undertakers.  In general, the regulations propose the removal of the rooftop square-metre-based limits that currently apply, namely, 12 sq. m for houses and 50 sq. m for other buildings, in the principal regulations and to instead allow full coverage, subject to conditions requiring the installation to be a minimum distance from the edge of the roof as well as restrictions in certain areas.  However, in light of the potential threat to aviation safety arising from increased solar development, 43 solar safeguarding zones have been identified, in consultation with the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, within which an increased 300 sq. m rooftop limit will now apply to all classes of development other than houses.  It will be open to anyone seeking to avail of a larger rooftop solar installation within a solar safeguarding zone than the 300 sq. m limitation to apply for planning permission.</p><p>The second set of draft regulations that I have laid before the Oireachtas, the Planning and Development (Solar Safeguarding Zone) Regulations 2022, are the supplementary supporting regulations that set out the 43 solar safeguarding zones, which are required to address aviation safety concerns in respect of glint and glare impacts from solar panels.  The solar safeguarding zones are outlined both on maps and by reference to townlands in county councils and local electoral divisions in city councils.  A rooftop limit will apply in solar safeguarding zones which extend outwards in a radial manner 5 km from airports and 3 km from smaller aerodromes, certain military barracks and emergency helipads.  Following publication of the final regulations, my Department intends to make the solar safeguarding zones available for viewing on my Department&rsquo;s planning website, <i>myplan.ie</i>, which will provide interactive maps with greater detail on boundary delineation in relation to these zones.  Under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the approval of the Oireachtas is required before any exempted development regulations are signed into law.  Hence, the presentation of these regulations to the committee today.</p><p>I commend the two sets of draft regulations to the committee.  If the regulations are approved, the Government will be removing obstacles for the roll-out of solar energy development nationwide, enabling individuals, communities, businesses and farms to play their part in creating a future fuelled by renewable energy and acting against climate change.  They will further help people and businesses to reduce their energy bills and increase Ireland&rsquo;s energy security, which is of vital importance given the current international situation.  If, further to today&rsquo;s presentation to the committee, these draft regulations are subsequently approved by positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas as required under the Planning Act, they will come into force as soon as they are signed.  If approved by the Oireachtas, it would be the intention to sign the regulations into law at the earliest opportunity.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

They form a very important part of our climate action plan, as he mentioned, and a step towards decarbonisation.  I also acknowledge the work of his officials and the negotiation by the IAA to increase the square metres in the zones that were designated for glint and glare.  It is a real improvement because it helps schools, farms, factories etc. in those areas.  We know solar works really well in this country and the important part it can play.  Microgeneration is what we are dealing with mostly today.  It is a secure source of energy on people's roofs where the energy is being used at source and at production, which is the best way to use electricity.  The measures brought here today remove an unnecessary complexity in trying to put solar panels on roofs, where up to this point it was necessary to go for planning permission, with the costs and hassle involved with that.  We remove that if we agree these regulations.  That is a very important step and a step toward the decarbonisation of energy in this country, which we need to do quickly, rapidly and at scale.</p> <p>  Some very good research was done recently by MaREI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine in Cork which showed the overall capacity we have on rooftops across Ireland to produce solar electricity and how that will have a positive impact on the security of supply and save people money.  These regulations are a very important step and I am glad to see them come before the committee today.</p></speech>

I fully concur with the Chair's remarks.  Some of us have been asking for these for almost two full D&aacute;il terms, so it is great to see them come finally to fruition.  I have just four technical questions.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the speedy passage of the regulations.  As much to put it on the record as anything, will the Minister of State explain the rationale behind the two limits of 3 km and 5 km, that is, why they were chosen and what they are based on?  Second, for absolute clarity for anyone listening in, will the Minister of State explain the expansion to the 300 sq. m limit?  The third is about the timeline.  The Minister of State said at the end that he would like to see this signed as quickly as possible.  If we are able to get this through the D&aacute;il and Seanad in the next week or two, are we looking at the signature and passage by the end of October?  I think people would like to know.</p> <p>  The fourth is not specifically related to the regulations but it is something I would like to raise.  One challenge even with microgeneration through wind is the inability of our system to incorporate what are often called direct lines.  For example, Belfast City Airport has a very significant number of solar panels, and because it can run direct lines from the structure where the solar panels are into other aspects of its complex, it has an incredibly high level of renewable energy resources.  We do not have that capacity at the moment.  For example, a complex of community and school buildings could, as a consequence of this good measure, have solar in a particular location but may not have the capacity to run excess generation to another building rather than into the grid.  Is that something that can be resolved?  Is it something officials in the Department and their counterparts in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications are looking at?  It would ensure the maximum benefit of new solar for any particular kind of campus base solar that emerges out of this.</p> <p>  Again, I welcome and fully support the proposition before us today.</p></speech>

It was decided at that juncture that we would have ten 5 km buffer zones and around 33 3 km buffer zones.  The 5 km ones were around major airports and aerodromes and obviously the smaller ones were around emergency helipads, barracks and some emergency military sites around the country.  Some are in remote locations.  The landmass in respect of the country is less than 2% because many overlap.  There were significant negotiations in the original draft.  It was 60 sq. m.  We got it increased to 300 sq. m.  That was through negotiation around issues such as glint and glare and issues for landing and taking off that the safety authorities had raised as significant concerns to them.  It did take significant work to get past that hurdle.  It does make it exempt now for every house in the country and there is an increased limit for the commercial sector, which is very welcome.</p></speech>

There are also a number of significant ones beside airports but they went through the planning phase.  They can get due diligence and greater certainty in terms of the application process and the robustness that gives.  When it comes exempt development, it is necessary to be a bit more careful in what is done.</p> <p>  On the timeline, I expect to sign the regulations next week, all going well.  There is a little bit of work to be done on the maps but it is not very significant.  We are almost there but we must make sure everything is ready for the website.  It is hoped they will be signed next week.</p> <p>  On the last question, the microgen working group is dealing with that issue so I will raise it with it.  I do not have a specific response under my jurisdiction but I will talk it about that.</p></speech>

This is fantastic.  I do not have a question but, rather, concur with everything the Chair has said.  There are a number of community groups in Dublin South-Central that are trying to become as energy self-sufficient as possible.  It is particularly pertinent at the moment.  This is not the Minister of State's area but he might be able to exert some influence.  A microgeneration support scheme for panels for businesses, public organisations and community groups was launched recently.  That allows for a certain amount of solar panels and production of energy.  I have had feedback that it does not go far enough and more is needed.  It is important we do that.  With the absence of a cap on the roof space that can be used, it is important we keep that under review.  I absolutely support this.  It is fantastic.  I thank the Minister of State for all his hard work and engagement.</p></speech>

What is the position on this in architectural conservation areas with protected structures and buildings?

Last week, we discussed maternity and sick leave for councillors.</p> <p>  Sometimes people are looking at politicians and only see the adversarial way, especially when one looked at the budget this week and the disagreements but there are many things on which we can agree and on which we can work together constructively.  This is an area where it has probably taken us too long to get to where we are, but we are here now.  It is a positive move that we all support and want to see implemented.  We support the regulations the Minister of State is bringing forward.</p> <p>  I will raise a few issues.  Recently I spoke with a 72-year-old woman who has a two-bedroomed terraced house.  When she took the grants for the solar and retrofitting, the cost was still coming out at &euro;59,000.  In the whole area of the installation of solar panels we are seeing that the grant for these panels, I believe, is being reduced now to &euro;2,400 from &euro;3,000.  Can the Minister of State clarify that point for me, please?</p> <p>  The average cost for the installation of solar panels was &euro;7,000.  Now, with the increased capacity that people can now put on their roofs, one will obviously see the cost increase.  This will not be affordable for many people.  On one side we are increasing the capacity, which is a good thing and something we all support.  On the other side then, it will be outside the ability of many people to install these solar panels.  It there something we can do or that the Government is looking at to see how we can bridge that gap?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-29a.1079" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022092900002#C01700"><p>The first thing I will say is that anything that does not necessitate a planning application will make it cheaper to deliver on the roofs or tops of buildings.  If one takes the commercial sector, in the majority of areas 98% of the country potentially can have such panels fitted as big as they may want on their roofs without a planning application, up to 300 sq. m.  That is a very significant step.  Households right across the country do not have to engage in the planning process.  There was a very draconian limit in place prior to that.  Again, this is going to be a very positive step.</p> <p> On the grants and support question, these are obviously not planning matters and are under the control of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  We will raise those issues of affordability with him.  We know that there is a very significant effort being made to try to transform our economy into a net zero carbon economy.  This is a long journey we are embarking upon and it is going to take significant capital funding to unlock many of those communities.  Where I am from, in very rural areas like Longford and Westmeath, one sees so many challenges in trying to get on a more sustainable footing for households.  We will certainly raise those issues with the Minister but I must focus on the planning exemptions in trying to make it easier and cost-effective in planning terms so that there are no impediments to deliver these panels on their households or businesses in the areas under my responsibility.</p></speech>

He is dealing with planning today but it is important that he goes to the Minister.  This is something that we want to move forward with and it is important.</p> <p>  Another issue which may not be of concern but which I wish to raise is that if I engage someone to install a gas boiler, they have to be certified to install it.  We are talking now about putting much bigger solar panels on people&rsquo;s roofs.  Are there regulations around the people who install solar panels?  I know that this is a side issue but we are looking now at much bigger solar panels being put on people&rsquo;s roofs and we must be sure of the safety of them into the future.  I am not looking for a direct answer here but we want to ensure that this is done correctly.</p></speech>

There are safeguards there to watch over the process to ensure these works are done correctly.  It is very important that operators are registered and that work is carried out effectively.  The SEAI is obviously driven to do that.</p></speech>

Is this something that needs to be looked at?  I am not looking to delay anything now but we are changing the rules here and it is just that I think that we need the-----</p></speech>

One thing about that is when you are assessing changes to exempt development, you have to look at both the positive and negative impacts.  A change like this has so many positive impacts that they also have to go through robust assessment of the effects they may have on the environment and on the wider society at large.  That, in itself, was a large body of work.  I am confident that those exemptions have been assessed already as it has taken so long to get through this process, between negotiating with the various different safeguarding actors who have responsibility for glint and glare and for our aerodromes, as well as going through the SEAI process, to ensure that everything is right.  I would be very happy that any considerations on the additional scale of the solar panels on roofs has been fully mitigated by the robustness of the process to get to the stage.</p></speech>

With the new regulations being brought forward by the Minister of State, it would make a very significant difference to us if we were to do something similar to that here with our social housing stock.  This difference would in the first instance be for those who live in social housing and the positive benefits this would have for them.  Also, this would assist in trying to hit our carbon targets.  It is very much the way we need to go.  I know that this issue is not in the Minister of State&rsquo;s remit here today but I believe it is important.  The Minister of State is bringing forward positive recommendations here and I assume that the other Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would be in full support of that idea where he needs to match that with work on social housing.  I ask that the Minister of State takes this idea to the Minister.</p> <p>  My final point is that we support this.  It is positive and has taken a long time to come but we will move forward now.</p></speech>

I believe that concludes matters but I will make some concluding marks of my own to the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Following on from the point made by Deputy Gould on the roll-out of solar panels, the announcement of the solar panels for schools is a very strong measure.  It makes a great deal of sense to help schools cope with electricity costs as well.  They will also then have that feed-in tariff opportunity when the schools are not in operation.  We also saw the figures for the roll-out of the energy retrofits for social housing, with those figures increasing and paid for out of the carbon tax.  </p> <p>  The grants system works very well.  The size of the system that somebody should put in their house should be based on the consumption within that house because I believe that is the best model one can have.  One generates electricity and one uses it as close to source as possible.  The figures from the MaREI research showed that a 2.5 kW system will pay back for itself within seven years.  With the grant, with that sort of payback time, and with the increasing cost of electricity, that grant system makes a great deal of sense.  This is being shown because there is such a very significant subscription to it out there and many of those companies are scaling up.</p><p>That will also bring down the price and we will see them across most rooftops in Ireland, which is only right because solar works very well here.  The exemptions we have brought in are another positive move in that transition to a future of renewable and decarbonised energy.</p></speech>

I was in the private sector before I came here and I know that when you are installing anything like energy-efficient lighting, you must recoup the cost in three years.  Many businesses and people would think that seven years is too long.  That is just from a business point of view.  The reason for this is that the technology will be outdated in seven years and you will need to go again.  If we are looking at incentivising people to install new technologies such as solar panels, from my experience I believe we should be looking at getting the money back within a three or four-year window and for the technology to continue working for a few years after that because, if it needs to be replaced at that point, you are not really making money.  I just wanted to give the Chairman a bit of insight on that.</p></speech>

The difficulty that might arise is with battery systems, but batteries are not required in all installations.  It depends on the make-up of the household and when power is used.  People need to consider that carefully.  A payback period of seven years for something with a 25-year life expectancy is quite good and electricity costs are only going to go one way.</p></speech>
