Some Deputies are appearing remotely from their offices within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  I ask those who are attending remotely to confirm they are within the precincts to fulfil that constitutional requirement.  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meetings on 4 and 9 March have been circulated to members.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published on the committee&rsquo;s webpage.</p> <p>  The next item of business on today&rsquo;s agenda is correspondence.  We have a substantial amount to deal with.  The Committee of Public Accounts has traditionally considered its correspondence in public session but due to Covid-19 restrictions, revised meeting arrangements have limited the committee&rsquo;s opportunities to meet in public.  We have mainly used that time to fulfil our core role, which is to examine the accounts of public bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </p> <p>  However, we have set aside time today to consider a number of items of correspondence.  Decisions of the committee on items of correspondence that are not addressed at today&rsquo;s meetings are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings which are published on the Oireachtas website.</p> <p>  No. 381B is from Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, chief executive of Children's Health Ireland, dated 17 February 2021 providing information requested by the committee on non-compliant procurement.  At our meeting on 25 February, we decided to note and publish this item.  It was also agreed to hold it over for consideration in public.  This item is flagged for discussion by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#A00400"><p>It is quite difficult to get the context of this response.  A few matters jumped out to me.  One was the payment of &euro;121,000 to the Combined Media company relating to the development, launching and management of the Children's Health Ireland jobs website.  A further &euro;83,000 was paid to Q4 Public Relations.</p><p>None of us expects the changes for children's health to come without a cost.  We are trying to keep a close eye on what we are spending and what we are getting for it.  We heard recently from the oversight body for the procurement of the children's hospital that there is substantial slippage in the timeline.  There may well be costs associated with things having to be upgraded while we are waiting for that to be completed.  Some of these are network supports and specialised services that are being brought in.</p><p>Why does it need to spend &euro;121,000 on the Children's Health Ireland jobs website which seems like a large amount of money with further money spent on public relations and communications?  Those kinds of things jump out at me.  It is understood that good IT systems are required, but the expectation is that those IT systems in the main will focus on clinical or operational issues.  I am not fully <i>au fait</i>with why it needs to spend money on those two items.  We need to expand on that further.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#A00500"><p>I concur with Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I do not understand why an organisation such as Children's Health Ireland would be required to spend &euro;90,000 in a year on a contract for a public relations company.  We see this with a number of State agencies.  While in the overall budgets these might seem like small amounts of money, why would a State agency that is charged with building a children's hospital and providing for children's health need to commission a stand-alone PR company to carry out its work?</p> <p>  The response from Children's Health Ireland outlines part of the tender process that was employed, but it does not outline the rationale as to why this was required in the first place.  Similarly, there was a very large outlay of funding of in excess of &euro;121,000 on the Combined Media company.  We should follow up with a further letter to Children's Health Ireland requesting the rationale for tendering for outside companies to do work that I would have thought should be available within the public service.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#A00600"><p>I agree with Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy on the public relations expenditure.  I have no issue with the company, Q4 Public Relations, whose reputation precedes it.  It is a very professional outfit, but why do we need it in the first place?  We have in-house media and communications expertise in the Department of Health and the HSE.  While I know that in the greater scheme of things it is a relatively small amount of money, there is a principle involved here.  It is now the norm that however small a State agency or an arm of the State may be, as a matter of practice one of the PR companies is retained to advise.</p> <p>  Of the amounts of money that were spent, as outlined by Deputy Catherine Murphy, what proportion was used in preparation of personnel to appear before Oireachtas committees?</p><p>I think that is in part what this money was used for.  These people are brought in and told Deputy MacSharry will say this and Deputy Catherine Murphy will say that and they should say the other.  I do not think that is a space we need to be in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B00200"><p>I often think that the provision of fees for communications services is demonised, particularly by politicians.  I very much disagree with that.  We have seen the importance of communications over recent months.  My difficulty is with the retention of an external company for that service.  I would rather see an in-house communications person ensuring that the communications are good.  I agree with Deputy MacSharry that that should be about communicating and not accountability.  There is a difference.  Perhaps, the Comptroller and Auditor General can help us.  It looks like the communications contract was initiated prior to the coming into existence of Children's Health Ireland, CHI.  The use of the word "completed" confused me.  Does it mean the contract ended in 2020 and there has been no contract for 2021?</p> <p>  In regard to the jobs website, the word "management" would imply that there is one or a number of people working on the site on a constant basis.  I imagine that if one is advertising jobs on a regular basis that would be required, but, again, I would like to see that work being done in-house where there is greater governance and accountability.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to clarify the word "completed" in regard to the contract and the word "management" in regard to the jobs website.</p></speech>

My own take is it that the two figures are fairly substantial.  I will not revisit the points that have been made.  The issues have been well covered by the four Deputies, but we do need to seek some further information on the matter.  If members are happy with that, I will ask the clerk to write to Children's Health Ireland seeking clarification around the points raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B00500"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B00600"><p>Members would, perhaps, want to be aware that this letter came from Children's Health Ireland because I drew attention to a non-competitive procurement.  This is a subset of all of the procurement that was undertaken by Children's Health Ireland.  In the letter it is explaining the circumstances that gave rise to the non-compliance and the steps that are being taken.  Where it talks about "tendering completed", it is talking about competitions that were undertaken to ensure that in future there would be compliance there.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall spend, this is a subset of what is being spent within Children's Health Ireland.  Some of the points that were made were about the expenses that are involved in the preparation of the hospital to occupy the new hospital and the amalgamation that is under way.  There is provision for a significant spend in that area.  My recollection is that it is of the order of &euro;300 million.  There may be an issue there that would be of interest to the committee such that it might want to call Children's Health Ireland to appear before it to discuss with it the expenditure programmes it is undertaking as part of the preparation for moving to the new hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B00700"><p>It is the context that is important.  It is not just the children's hospital.  Blanchardstown hospital has opened its emergency unit for children.  I am not sure what stage Tallaght hospital is at.  We want to know that what we are spending, for example on IT systems, is in the context of that &euro;300 million because they are obviously linked.  It is the context of the spend in the two areas that have been raised in respect of which we need the information.  It is in the overall context that we need to understand that spend.</p> <p>  In terms of the jobs website, there is an issue there in regard to job retention as much as anything else.  I would like to hear what Children's Health Ireland has to say on that as well because there will forever be a website encouraging people to apply for jobs if it cannot retain the people and if it cannot retain people, there is a reason for that too.  There is a circular argument there.  We need that context and we need to know how those three entities fit in; we also need to know what is the slippage and whether or not that slippage will impact on the need to spend money, for example, on upgrading things while we are waiting if it is not brought in on time.  There is a range of issues that I think are important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B00800"><p>We will ask the clerk to seek further information and we will publish correspondence 381B.</p><p><b></b>No. 393B is correspondence from Ms Anne Graham, chief executive, National Transport Authority, dated 23 February 2021 providing an update requested by the committee regarding the rail fleet procurement.  At our meeting on 4 March we decided to note and publish this item.  It was also decided to hold it over for consideration in public.  This item is flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B00900"><p>These 41 rail carriages are incredibly important.  I note there is some slippage in the delivery.  There has been a significant problem with overcrowding and there was a delay in placing the order for these carriages.  I am not sure if the order is fully placed at this stage.  I apologise, I note the correspondence says some are likely to arrive mid-2022, with a full order of 41 to be completed by the end of 2022.  Covid has impacted on that.</p> <p>  There is also a very large spend in relation to BusConnects.  There are two pieces of correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B01000"><p>I suggest to the Deputy that we would deal with the correspondence regarding BusConnects separately.  It might be more helpful if we dealt with it as a separate piece of correspondence.  I ask the Deputy to confine her remarks to correspondence 393B.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B01100"><p>Okay.  On correspondence 393B, this has been announced on several occasions.  It is not at all clear where it fits into the national budget.  For example, I could see it appearing again in the national development plan because it will be money that has been committed and not spent.  The slippage in timeline is probably less likely to be a significant factor this year because of Covid, but it will become an issue next year.  I do not think we have received a costing on these carriages.  It would be useful to have that information because this is a pretty big spend.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B01200"><p>The rail cars about which the Deputy is concerned are being delivered on a phased basis up to late 2022.</p></speech>

We have been told the expected delivery timeline.  It would be useful to know the cost.  Essentially, what I want to know is when they will be paid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#B01400"><p>I ask Deputies who have spoken previously and still have a hand raised to take the signal down unless they wish to come back in again.  I note Deputy McAuliffe's hand signal is still up.  Does he wish to come back in?</p> <p>  We will publish this correspondence and seek information regarding the cost of the project.</p> <p>  No. 394B is correspondence also from Ms Anne Graham, chief executive, National Transport Authority, dated 23 February 2021 providing detailed information requested by the committee in relation to expenditure on the BusConnects programme.  At our meeting on 4 March we decided to note and publish this item and to forward it to the correspondent who raised the matter.</p><p>We also agreed to include the Department of Transport and the National Transport Authority, NTA, on our work programme.  I understand the Department has not been before the committee since 2018.  The Department is also responsible for the motor tax fund and the previous Committee of Public Accounts made recommendations relating to it.  I will open the discussion to members who wish to speak to this item of correspondence regarding BusConnects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#C00200"><p>The public consultation aspect of many projects that are on the way at the moment, such as BusConnects, is not as satisfactory as it ought to be.  That is due to Covid and people not being able to get briefings and small maps and things like that.  There will also be procurement issues.  The issue of whether they are building in delays into tender projects in the context of the current stop-start nature of the construction sector is something about which I have concerns in terms of adding to the costs.  I know that is probably more an issue for the Committee on Transport and Communication Networks, but this is a very sizeable project and there is reason for extra care to be taken.  I think it would be quite useful to ask the Department and the NTA how they are managing construction projects and how they are tendered for in the context of Covid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#C00300"><p>Do any other members wish to come in on that item of correspondence?  Okay.  We will seek the further information to which Deputy Murphy referred.</p> <p>  No. 395 is correspondence from Mr. John Dollard, chief superintendent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dated 23 February 2021.  It is in response to further information requested by the committee in respect of the investigation relating to the Garda College at Templemore and the so-called Cabra account, which received quite a bit of coverage.  As regards the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, Mr. Dollard states that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s only engagement with OLAF in relation to its investigation was to request that the names of those involved not be published as to do so may prejudice any possible criminal investigation.  In regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, investigation, the correspondence states that a Garda liaison officer has been appointed to assist GSOC with its inquiries.  At our meeting on 4 March we decided to note and publish this item.  It was also decided to hold it over for consideration in public.  Several Deputies, including Deputy Carthy, have raised this issue.  Does Deputy Carthy wish to speak on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#C00400"><p>This is part of what is becoming an all-too familiar pattern in terms of investigations and inquiries, particularly as they relate to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What happens is that an investigation or complaint is passed on to GSOC and then, for whatever length of time GSOC is investigating the matter, the garda&iacute;, the Minister responsible and anybody else involved can say they cannot discuss the matter because it is a GSOC operational matter.  When GSOC eventually compiles a report, the sting is taken out of the issue, so to speak, by the passage of time.</p> <p>  It is important that we remind ourselves that these are very significant and important issues relating to financial procedures at the Garda College at Templemore.  We know that ongoing investigations are being carried out by GSOC.  In its correspondence of 20 January 2020, it indicated it is close to a resolution, or at least its investigation is close to conclusion.  We know from the correspondence from Chief Superintendent Dollard that OLAF has completed a summary of facts and submitted it to the Garda for comment.  The only comment the Garda made was to request that the names of individuals not be included in any findings.</p> <p>  This is a matter of which the committee needs to keep abreast.  I suggest that, if it is in order, we write to OLAF to inform it that the Committee of Public Accounts has an interest in this matter and would appreciate copies of any publications or findings it makes in respect of this case.  I also ask that the secretariat include this item on our correspondence meeting in, say, late April, so that we can seek a further update from GSOC at that stage in respect of its deliberations.</p></speech>

As they are related, I will address each of them before opening the floor to members.</p> <p> The first of the three is correspondence item No. 396 B, from Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, and dated 24 February.  Mr. Kavanagh wishes to clarify information provided during our meeting with HRI on 23 February 2021.  He believes his exchange with me regarding the provision of funding for CCTV at racecourses around the country could have given the incorrect impression that &euro;9.1 million was allocated in the 2018 integrity services budget for CCTV when, in fact, &euro;9.1 million represented the total budget.  The allocation for CCTV systems was &euro;60,000.  Mr. Kavanagh goes on to say that midway through the year, the IHRB requested that the &euro;60,000 be reallocated to the development of an online trainers licensing system, with the issue of CCTV funding to be revisited in future budgets.  At our meeting on 4 March we decided to clarify this publicly.  As well as holding it over for consideration in public, we also decided to request the IHRB to provide an information note regarding CCTV systems, including why the proposed systems were not installed at more than one racecourse.  I will come to that response shortly.</p> <p>  The second item of the three is correspondence item No. 423.  It too is from Mr. Brian Kavanagh, chief executive, Horse Racing Ireland.  It is dated 4 March and provides follow-up information relating to 14 questions arising from our meeting with HRI on 23 February.  At our meeting on 11 March we decided to note and publish this item.</p> <p>  The third and final related item is correspondence item No. 439 B.  It is from Mr. Denis Egan, chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, and is dated 11 March.  It is the response I mentioned to our correspondence to IHRB regarding CCTV installations at racecourses.  Mr. Egan states that &euro;60,000 was originally allocated in the IHRB&rsquo;s budget to provide CCTV at four racecourses but that the HRI took over the project in March 2018 and the funds were then transferred to its budget.  However, the project did not commence in 2018 and the money went back to the IHRB.  This money is doing the rounds.  Mr. Egan states that money - a total of &euro;80,000 this time - was again allocated for CCTV systems in the HRI budget of 2019.</p><p>However, the project had not started by July 2019, so the money again went back to the IHRB.  The correspondence goes on to give some detail about the online licensing system that was prioritised over CCTV systems, including the IHRB's request that the &euro;80,000 be allocated to online licensing and the board of HRI's agreement to that request.  Despite being requested of the IHRB, though, the current position regarding the installation of CCTV systems is not addressed.  I propose that we note and publish this item and reiterate the committee's request to the IHRB to clarify the current situation regarding the roll-out of CCTV systems at racecourses around the country and to include budget allocations and timelines for installation.</p><p> I am baffled.  This project was given the go-ahead in 2018, but here we are heading into the middle of 2021 and it is still not off the blocks.  We need some straight answers.  I will open the discussion to the floor.  Deputies Carthy, Hourigan, Catherine Murphy and Munster have indicated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#D00200"><p>I agree with the Chairman.  There are a hell of a lot of unanswered questions.  When HRI appeared before the committee, it outlined the situation as regards funding of CCTV and indicated that, following installation at a single racecourse stables in 2017, funding had been provided to extend the installation to all courses.  We were made aware that, at the start of 2018, a change in the laboratory that was being used by the regulatory board had seen an increase of, I believe, more than 400% in the number of positive tests.  Six months later, though, the regulatory board sought to divert the funds away from the installation of CCTV to an online integrity portal.</p> <p>  In fairness, HRI has been forthcoming with information pertaining to itself, but its relationship with the regulatory board is an odd one because it seems to obscure the situation.  I suggest that the committee write directly to the regulatory board requesting a briefing on the proposed installation of CCTV from 2017 onwards and to include in that briefing detailed notes on changes in budget allocations.  I also suggest that we request a note from the regulatory board on the integrity portal or whatever it is - the board referred to it as being an online trainers licensing system - so that we might get a better understanding of it.  HRI indicated that the regulatory board was the expert in this area and had a better understanding of how the money would be spent, but it seems very odd.  The relationship between the two bodies is obscuring information.  We need these questions answered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#D00300"><p>The context is that just short of &euro;80 million, which comes from the gambling tax, goes to HRI.  It must be acknowledged that this is an extremely valuable sector.  A week is a long time in politics.  Compare how negative the situation was a few weeks ago with how positive it was last week.  All credit goes to Ms Rachael Blackmore for lifting many people's spirits.</p> <p>  We are discussing the integrity fund.  We need to protect that investment and the large number of people working in this sector.  The sector must be above reproach, and the money for CCTV at stables is meant for that purpose.  Even though the funding was allocated in 2018, CCTV had only been installed at the stables of only one racecourse when we met HRI this year.  There is still confusion about what the expectation was exactly when the money was allocated.  When will every racecourse be fully covered by CCTV?</p> <p>  I am uneasy with the crossover between the two boards.  Three people from the regulatory board are on the board of HRI.  I am concerned about the lack of separation and whether that was done by design.  It is important that we have clarity about this aspect.</p> <p>  The situation with the allocation is not clear.  As the Chairman stated, the money has gone back and forth before being diverted.  Installing CCTV at 26 racecourses is not an onerous project and I do not know why it has not been done.  I do not believe that all of the &euro;9.1 million allocation was intended for CCTV - it would be expensive CCTV if it was - but I remain unclear as to how much of that money was intended for CCTV, how many racecourses were to be covered by it and what the programme was.  We must have clarity on this.  Having some of the other information that was provided in the correspondence is useful, but we have concerns about this matter in particular.</p></speech>

Another will have it installed.  The &euro;9.1 million was allocated in 2018.  If a tender was sought for the roll-out of CCTV, which we know is needed, given that certain incidents have occurred in stable yards at racecourses, a company could have been employed for a portion of that &euro;9.1 million to install CCTV systems across the 25 or 26 racecourses in the State.  We need clarification.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#D00700"><p>That meeting will be a useful exercise.  I share Deputy Catherine Murphy's concerns that the racing authority and regulatory board seem to have an intertwined relationship.  I am not sure that that is necessarily healthy.  This is not to cast aspersions or undermine the successes that the Deputy and others have mentioned.  I would like to be associated with the words of congratulation to Ms Rachael Blackmore.  My only regret is that I did not back her, but that is just the way things go.</p> <p>  I will refer specifically to correspondence No. 423B from HRI, which contained responses to questions that we raised.  Sometimes, people infer that when committees like ours question how public money is spent, we are attacking the principle of supporting the horse racing sector.  This sector provides a valuable contribution to our rural economy but could it do more for more people?</p><p> Members will recall when we had Horse Racing Ireland before the committee and I questioned its decision, which essentially ensures that the State funding or the taxpayers' money that is invested is redistributed through prize money.  In the year in that we are discussing, which this correspondence deals with, the State's contribution to HRI was &euro;67 million and the prize money awarded that year was &euro;66 million but when I put it to HRI that this was consolidating a small number of top trainers in particular, it disputed that and argued that the money had trickled down, so that was trickle-down economics at its best, and that much more outside of.the official figures went to breeders across the country.  In this response, it shows that of that prize money of &euro;66 million, a sum of &euro;385,000 went to breeders.  Clearly, it is not the case that breeders, particularly smaller breeders, get a substantial part of the funding.  Clearly, there are some sectors within the horse racing family that are less profitable or benefit less than others.  The point-to-point racing sector, which we correctly hear is the breeding ground for future successes, received circa &euro;900,000 per annum but, again, that is from a prize fund of &euro;66 million in 2019.  Consequently, I propose that we write to HRI.  I also propose that we write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ask it whether it is satisfied that the prize money and prize fund distribution are the best way to redistribute State funds to have the maximum beneficial impact on rural economies and on the future growth of the sector.  We should ask the Department whether, in its view the prize money and prize fund distribution are the best way to ensure that as many people as possible receive a benefit and that as many communities as possible receive an economic benefit from the substantial State contribution that is invested in the sector.  That is my formal proposal.</p></speech>

I ask the clerk to the committee to clarify the following.  I did ask Mr. Kavanagh if we could have a copy of his submission to the Department on point-to-point racing because, as one can see, a sum of &euro;900,000 was paid out for point-to-point prize winning.  I questioned where would the money go or be spent if point-to-point races were not run?</p> <p>  Equally, we now see a situation arising where our point-to-point entrants are going elsewhere.  They should be racing in this State but we are not open because we have no further plan to get us out of level 5.  The problem now is that these horses are being brought to the UK to take part in point-to-point races.  I did ask to see the submission that was made, as they are the representatives for the horse industry.</p> <p>  Equally, we asked about salaries.  There is very little transparency about salaries in the accounts and HRI used something it states it submitted to the Department outlining that it has some form of an amnesty.  My understanding, and maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General will clarify this, was that this was only pertinent because it was making out there was some commercial sensitivity.  It is the only organisation.  Again, my understanding was that it was to be provided to the board and back to the Committee of Public Accounts as to how the salaries were paid, and the breakdown of those.</p></speech>

My understanding was that it was on the grounds of commercial sensitivity.  In fact, they have actually provided, in a document here, the banding that would normally be included in the financial statements.  So, I do not really understand how, if it was commercially sensitive and they have an exclusion, that they are able to provide the information.  I would see no reason that they would not have it every year in the financial statements.</p></speech>

One can make the argument that there is not anything commercially sensitive.  To whom is it commercially sensitive?</p></speech>

The chief executive salary was given.  From the banding information, that is provided in the correspondence to the committee, it seems to me quite difficult to pick out who the others would be and so I do not really understand the explanation around commercial sensitivity.  It might be something that the committee would take up with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well, since they were the ones who gave this exemption.</p></speech>

That is what we should do.  The greater the transparency, the better the integrity of the sector but that has been called into question.  The sector is worth billions of euro to the economy and one can see that from the results from Cheltenham last week.  I concur with everybody's congratulations to Rachael Blackmore and all of the trainers.  It is a very successful industry and we would like to keep its integrity levels high but all of the things relating to the CCTV footage have called that into question.  That should be a priority.  Trainers are licensed.  There are no impediments from not having this on an IT system but the integrity of the sector is in question when we do not have the CCTV footage where it should be.</p> <p>  Again, I ask about the submissions.  Maybe the clerk can confirm that we did not request them but I was under the impression that I did make a request but the details have not come back in any correspondence.  </p></speech>

There is a proposal that the committee writes to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the prize money.  When doing so we can also raise the issue of salaries.  Commercial sensitivity normally kicks in where a particular entity has competitors but I do not see any competitors.</p></speech>

Similarly, there is legislation explaining what the directorships of IHRB will be.

Perhaps we will have to recommend in a report that even the optics of it are not right, never mind the functioning of it.  We have seen how the CCTV initiative went backwards and forwards and it was not at all clear who had and was taking responsibility.  If one is protecting the very large investment and the number of people who are employed in the sector, then it is important to get the institutional arrangements right.  I would not want that to be undermined and if there is a requirement for a legislative change when we look at it, then we should recommend that.</p></speech>

So, three members who are directors of IHRB are also directors of HRI, which is significant, I think, in the overall scheme of things.  There is some information in the letter from IHRB in relation to the cost of CCTV.  It states that &euro;60,000 was provided in the 2018 budget to install CCTV at four racecourses and then the figure in the following year was &euro;80,000.  So, presumably, &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 is the scale of expenditure, one is talking per racecourse, which does not seem like a huge budget.</p></speech>

Three years have passed and it has not happened.  We will seek clarification on that matter, the letter to the Department on the issue raised by Deputy Carthy, namely, the trickle-down effect of the prize money, and also the point regarding the submission from Mr. Kavanagh.</p> <p>  No. 398 from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 26 February 2021, provides a great deal of information arising from our meeting of 22 January 2021.  It includes notes on the expenditure on external services during the procurement of the national broadband plan; RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s implementation of the Eversheds Sutherland report; annual expenditure and outputs on energy upgrade schemes since 2017; guidance issued by the National Cyber Security Centre to the health sector; the national retrofit scheme; the &euro;8.6 million spent by EirGrid under selling and advertising in 2019; television licence compliance; and the use of temporary CCTV cameras to reduce illegal dumping.  </p> <p>  At our meeting on 4 March, we decided to note and publish this correspondence and hold it over for consideration in public.  We also agreed to request RT&Eacute; to provide an update regarding the Eversheds Sutherland report and clarification on the 78 employment contracts and whether they were backdated to when the individuals started working with RT&Eacute;.  We have added RT&Eacute; and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to the work programme, and the secretariat is inquiring about availability for our first meeting after the Easter recess on 20 April.</p> <p>  The matter is flagged for discussion by Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

I thank the Secretary General for his reply; it is most comprehensive.  There is some very useful information in it.</p> <p>  To pick up on the issue of the national broadband plan, we know that an attempt is being made to reduce costs by using metropolitan area networks, MANs, and existing poles from Eircom.  Analysys Mason is one of the entities that provided technical guidance.  I recall that it produced a report, and when representatives appeared before the committee, that report was a year old.  When it was published, the upshot of the report was that we were told that the use of these facilities would halve the cost of broadband.</p> <p>  We know that the national broadband plan is about the number of houses that are passed.  However, the number of premises that are connected will be determined, in some cases, by the cost of broadband.  In keeping an eye on this project, we must ask the Department for an update on analysis that has been done.  At the point that this Analysys Mason report was provided, Ireland had the most expensive broadband in Europe.  It is absolutely right that existing facilities are leveraged to reduce the cost, but we need to know if the Department is keeping an eye on the end user cost because that will determine the entities that run it.  We are told that any benefit will come back to the State.  It is important, therefore, that we keep an eye on that.</p> <p>  On the Eversheds Sutherland report on RT&Eacute;, we wrote to RT&Eacute; seeking a response.  I have not seen a clarification in respect of the 78 people who had accepted permanent contracts of employment, as opposed to permanent contracts for services.  There is no doubt that an organisation such as RT&Eacute; will need to have people on contracts for services, given the nature of the business.  However, there was a cohort of people that should have been on staff or on contracts of employment.</p> <p>  This issue really matters because it is an example of a practice that will be taking place elsewhere.  RT&Eacute; has formally offered those people contracts but we must ensure we receive a proper response on whether the contracts will apply retrospectively.  It can make a sizeable difference to people, for example, in respect of pension entitlements later on, taxation forgone by Revenue, and also in respect of the number of years of employment completed, should a person be made redundant.  Therefore, it is most important that we stick with it, watch out for a response and do not let the matter slip.</p> <p>  On the Eircode system, we have heard about public awareness.  We have been told that public awareness is being monitored and it is clear that there are public awareness targets.  However, do we know if there is any evidence of usage of this pretty expensive system?  I would have thought that outcomes would have been sought in relation to that.  The system is a valuable one, for example, for the National Ambulance Service, but are people generally using it outside of that?  The design of the system was previously heavily criticised in respect of how it might be used.  </p> <p>  On the issue of CCTV and illegal dumping, the Data Protection Commission is engaging with the City and County Management Association.  Very often, people have expectations that CCTV will sort everything out.  Local authorities have a scheme in place to tackle the problem.  I do not know whether it is active in each local authority area at this point.  However, the Data Protection Commission has a problem with the scheme, which means that it cannot be used.  There seems to be something odd about us providing grants for a scheme on the one side and on the other side an entity of the State having concerns, or more than that, about it being used.  What are the circumstances that allow CCTV to be used legally?  Are we spending money on grants that are not going to provide a return on that investment and the investment of community time because it is down to individuals?  There is matching funding for a dumping initiative, if I remember rightly.  While the initiative might be valuable, if it cannot be used, we must question the value of it.  We must also ask what needs to be put in place for the Data Protection Commission in respect of who can access the information to make the scheme an active one.  Those are the main issues I wish to raise.</p></speech>

Could we write and ask it to publish that report in full in advance of appearing before us, and if it could do so now?</p><p> I also find it strange that RT&Eacute; only published information about the normalisation of contracts in response to correspondence from the committee when in fact it had committed to resolving it by early 2019.  Can we ask for clarity as to whether the majority of those workers had their situations normalised at this stage and if they were compensated for years previous to that?</p><p> I suggest we write to the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, to seek its input as to whether it believes the situation has been fully resolved and how it feels the resolution process played out.  We are looking at bogus self-employment in the next couple of weeks.  There seems to be a huge difference between how workers on one side of the spectrum are treated with regard to their social protection and how workers or big stars on the other side of the spectrum are treated within RT&Eacute;.  As the national broadcaster, that would illustrate to me quite starkly how ordinary workers in this State have been treated versus high earners.</p><p> Could we write to the NUJ to ask it about this issue?  Can we also ask RT&Eacute; to publish that report in full in advance of appearing before the committee?</p></speech>

Everyone else is happy enough with it.</p> <p>  I will make a couple of points regarding the report from the Secretary General, Mr. Mark Griffin.  I must say it is very comprehensive.  A study is being carried out regarding the potential use of the Lough Ree and Shannonbridge power plants.  The just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, requested a study be undertaken, according to the correspondence from the Secretary General.  It sets out that a feasibility study into the options for the future use of the existing infrastructure in west Offaly and Lough Ree has been undertaken over recent months.  Members will remember and note those two power plants ceased operations earlier this year.  The question, and the context in which I raised this with Mr. Griffin on the day he appeared before the committee, is that they are located strategically on the national grid in an area where large land banks are to be used for solar panels and sensitively located wind turbines.  I stress the words "sensitively located".  They are on fairly extensive sites which could be used for biomass or biogas.  We note the group that has undertaken the work is expected to conclude shortly.  I ask the clerk to the committee to request that we be kept abreast by the Department and the Secretary General, Mr. Griffin, of any progress.  There is huge concern in the midlands that those two sites do not become land with plant rusting away on them.  They are in a very strategic location on the grid to be brought into future use.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to raise is regarding the CCTV cameras, which has been alluded to already.  From speaking to local authorities and from having raised the issue with Mr. Griffin when the Department appeared before the committee, my understanding is that the legislation must be changed to facilitate the use of CCTV to try to counter illegal dumping, which is a problem in my constituency of Laois&ndash;Offaly.  I am sure it is a problem in every other constituency throughout the country, and it is not getting better.  Local authorities were using cameras, and it was possible to move them from one location to another.  The Data Protection Commission intervened and said they must stop because there is a question mark over legislation and the legalities of all this, and legislation must be framed for it.  I ask that we send a note to the Secretary General of the Department asking that the legislation be brought forward to the D&aacute;il as soon as possible.  It is a very real problem.</p></speech>

Can the committee be furnished with that review once it is complete?  Can we examine it and bring the Department back in at some point?</p></speech>

There is no point in saying we want the Department to bring forward legislation.  We should seek for it to confirm to us when it will bring forward the draft legislation rather than writing the same letter again this time next year.</p></speech>

It states, "The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working on the draft heads of a Circular Economy Bill, with a view to underpinning measures promoting the development of a circular economy."  It goes on to say, "This could help to ensure that the processing of personal data may be carried out by local authorities tasked with enforcing litter and waste law".  The only concern I have, on which we should seek an update, as I mentioned earlier, is that it is in that larger legislation which may take a long time to come.  This is a real issue out there now, however</p></speech>

My concern, which I am sure Deputy Burke also has, is that this legislation may take some time.  Meanwhile, people are dumping illegally on a commercial scale in many parts of the country and the local authorities basically have their hands tied behind their backs trying to deal with it.  We will send a letter to the Secretary General asking for it be expedited, but also for a timeline for it to come before the D&aacute;il.  Is the Deputy happy enough with that?</p></speech>

We know the initiatives it is taking regarding the use of metropolitan area networks, and that is fine.  It is the end user that matters, however, and that is what the Analysys Mason report produced.  Can we ask the Department what exactly it is measuring with regard to the Eircode system?  Is it public awareness or public use?  Public use really is the optimum of what we should be measuring rather than just awareness.</p></speech>

It also states that the Department of Justice is working on a Bill to replace the Act, which will take account of the recent Supreme Court referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union and other relevant rulings.  It goes on to say that Revenue continues to investigate all forms of serious tax and duty offences using the wide range of powers available to it.  At our meeting of 11 March, we decided to note and publish this item of correspondence.  </p> <p>  Deputies will remember that what is being referred in the context of the CJEU case is the murder case involving Mr. Dwyer and mobile phone data in that case.

I think we should send this correspondence to the Joint Committee on Justice.  It is useful, and it is expanding on the understanding of the implications of that legislation.  This goes beyond criminal investigations, and impinges on organisations such as the Revenue as well.  If we do that, it would be a worthwhile initiative.  This feeds into the point made by Deputy Colm Burke regarding seeking a timeline for the legislation because it has been promised for some time and it is an urgent.</p></speech>

At our meeting of 11 March, we decided to note and publish this item and advise the correspondent who raised the matter accordingly.</p> <p>  As it is not addressed in the response from UL, we also agreed to request that the university confirm whether the protected disclosure referred to included the specific matter of information provided to the committee on 24 January 2019, and if so, what was the outcome of that aspect of the investigation.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#H00800"><p>I agree with Deputy Murphy.  I am not happy with the response from UL at all.  Regarding the representatives from the university appearing before the committee, I want to ensure that the invitation in that regard is all-encompassing.  I state that because we want to discuss a series of issues not dealt with adequately as a result of the work of the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  It was even suggested that the Garda fraud squad be requested to look at this.  I made such a formal request previously to the then president or chancellor of the university, or whatever position it was at the time.  The answer I got was that he would take that under advisement.  I certainly felt that a cursory look at the situation by the Garda was necessary, at a minimum, such was the material available to us.  We will want to go over that ground and I am conscious that we have these new Standing Orders now, which are for our benefit.  I want to ensure, therefore, that whatever we have to say is covered, and that the request, for example, would be something like, "Dear UL, we want to discuss everything, yours sincerely".  The subject matter of the invitation is important in ensuring we can cover everything.</p> <p>  On protective disclosures generally, the system is totally stacked.  I happily advise anyone thinking of issuing a protected disclosure to not do so in the current environment, because he or she will be thrown under the bus, penalised and subject to different treatment.  Outwardly, the situation will be dressed up as being one which is open, where people are encouraged to come forward and there is a desire to improve, and all that kind of stuff.  There is one proviso, however, and that is it does not make the system or the organisation look bad.  That is the problem with the current situation.  I refer to the idea of farming such matters out to a senior counsel, who is picked, and the terms of reference then be determined by people in-house in an organisation or in a Department or whatever.  I refer to all the vested interests who do not want a negative outlook on a Department or agency or a portion of a Department or agency.  </p> <p>  I do not know if that is work for this committee, the Joint Committee on Justice or other committees, but we must start from scratch regarding protected disclosures, protecting whistle-blowers and ensuring that what we have seen time and time again, such as in the case of Maurice McCabe, for example, who was very high profile, does not happen.  All of us, as Deputies and members of this committee, have seen many examples of people who have not ended up as part of a "Prime Time Investigates" programme, but for all the world have suffered comparable discrimination and penalisation through, in effect, trying to improve their workplaces and make them fairer and better for society.</p></speech>

Is the Comptroller and Auditor General made aware of such protected disclosures?  There would also be a value in this committee writing to each Department and asking how many protected disclosures they have had.  It would merit some attention.  Not every protected disclosure will be found to be correct, but people are really putting their heads above the parapet.  We must then interrogate whether those people who have brought protected disclosures forward are still in the jobs they were in before bringing forward information, which may have been of value in changing a workplace culture.  I refer to bringing to attention of the Department how such issues have been dealt with and whether that has been done internally or externally.</p> <p>  Those are things we could meaningfully do as a committee, because this matter comes up repeatedly.  It is a changing culture with respect to whistle-blowers and such actions being seen as a valuable compliance initiative.  We must ensure that people are not being discouraged from coming forward because there have been so many examples of people being thrown under a bus as a result, as Deputy MacSharry said.  There have been too many examples of that happening.</p></speech>

There is a requirement on all public bodies to publish an annual report explaining the number of reports received from whistle-blowers and explaining how those reports were dealt with.  Where a matter reported by a whistle-blower relates to something of a financial impropriety, let us say, we would certainly want to know the substance of that report.  Regarding any such reports, we would want to see that there was evidence that those matters had been dealt with.  What we would not really be in a position to do is to look at what has happened to the whistle-blower.  We would certainly expect to see that there are protections in place in such matters and that no penalty has been imposed on somebody for coming forward in good faith.</p><p>It is not really something I think that we can get into directly.</p></speech>

That would be quite a serious matter if that happened.</p> <p>  We have University of Limerick coming in later in for a hearing.  Maybe we could take up some of those points with it.

Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 418B, from Gillian Gilleran on behalf of the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, dated 3 March 2021, providing information requested by the committee arising from the meetings with the Department of Justice on 9 and 10 December 2020.</p> <p>  In the Department&rsquo;s initial response of 7 January 2021, there were two questions outstanding, as the Department stated that it awaited information from the State Claims Agency.

I know we have dealt with the allegations arising from cases when we had the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service before the committee.</p> <p>  Sometimes, however, we lose sight of the effect that being a whistleblower can have on an individual.  The Department actually seems to paint a rosy picture of how whistleblowers are treated by it.  I recently heard Mr. Noel McGree speak about his absolutely harrowing treatment as a whistleblower in the Irish Prison Service.  Equally, there is a concern about the ongoing personal consequences years later.</p> <p>  If it is in order, I would like if the committee invited Mr. Noel McGree to come before us at some stage to outline his experience.  Could that be added to the agenda for the next time the committee reviews its workplan?  It would be of benefit to us just to hear what it feels like and the consequences of being a whistleblower, given what was said a couple of minutes ago about the previous correspondence.</p></speech>

He seems to have had encountered many difficulties.  It would be worthwhile exploring that.  We can check with him as to whether he is still willing to appear before the committee.  We can put it on the work programme if the committee wishes.</p></speech>

In her correspondence, Ms Downes accepts that the committee has obtained the consent of the survivors for this purpose.  She also notes that the committee agreed that correspondence received from survivors would be provided to Caranua for a reply but that Caranua has not yet been provided with a copy of the correspondence referred to.</p> <p>  While Caranua is expected to wind-up tomorrow, 24 March, we will expect a response.

There are a couple of oversights in the correspondence that I wanted to flag.</p> <p>  Ms Downes in her correspondence highlighted that she never contended that the committee did not have the permission of the two survivors to discuss their cases.  We knew fine well, however, that at least one of the cases had emailed Caranua prior to the committee meeting giving permission for their case to be discussed.</p> <p>  The correspondence made reference to the committee not raising specific points of issue relating to that case.  That case is in the public domain.  Even when we flagged it previously with Caranua, after the meeting it contacted those individuals.  It knew fine well who those individuals were.  While it is good it corresponded with them, the survivors themselves had been at pains trying to engage with Caranua.  Until it was raised at the committee, they had no satisfaction whatsoever.</p> <p>  There are still outstanding concerns.  I have communicated to the committee secretariat.  Caranua can expect to receive it shortly.  I look forward to it receiving a response from Caranua.</p></speech>

It was very surprising.  Its approach to this committee leaves a lot to be desired.  The tone of the interaction at the committee hearing and in Caranua's written correspondence is unlike anything we have received in my time on this committee.  It is important for me to put that on the record.  I do not believe that I or any other member of this committee intended to engage with Caranua in a confrontational way.  We were all simply putting what I thought were standard questions - in some instances, on behalf of survivors of institutional abuse.  The responses from Caranua were over the top.</p><p>I am particularly uncomfortable with the assertion that has now been made in a number of items of correspondence and was repeated on several occasions at the hearing.  I will quote directly from the most recent correspondence from the CEO, Rachel Downes, in which she states:</p> <blockquote> 	I suggested that members of the Committee could discuss matters that were presenting as a concern after the hearing. I have received no request from any member to discuss matters subsequent to my attendance before the Committee. </blockquote> <p>Repeatedly during the hearing and in other correspondence, this same assertion has been made that members could have a private chat with the CEO to discuss matters.  This shows a lack of appreciation for the role of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Our role is not to satisfy our own desire for information.  Our role is to put questions on behalf of the Irish taxpayer and Irish citizens.  I would have thought that previous experience would have shown that private conversations in car parks are not the way in which witnesses or bodies should be interacting with this committee.  I wanted to put all of that on the record.  </p><p>It is also important that we correspond with the Department of Education to get a detailed framework as to how the issues pertaining to Caranua will move and be addressed because the explanation outlined to us that a new board will be put in place without staff and without a budget to all intents and purposes yet some executive responsibility will lie within the Department is a recipe for disaster.  It is, therefore, very important that we get clarification on that as speedily as possible.  My proposal is that we write to the Secretary General of the Department seeking that clarification, the framework for how the work of Caranua will proceed, a timeframe for the legislation to formally wind down Caranua and a subsequent framework for how outstanding issues relating to institutional abuse and claims may be dealt with in the future.</p></speech>

The important outstanding business is about victims.  I know there has been difficulty in resolving these two cases but the ball is firmly in the Department's court and we should look for a progress report on that from the Secretary General.  Is the Deputy happy with that?</p></speech>

No. 436 is a letter to me as Chairperson of the committee, dated 10 March, and No. 443 includes a request for updates relating to the letter.  Part of the discussion on 9 March concerned Bibby Financial Services Ireland because it is in receipt of funding detailed in the SBCI financial statements.  No. 436, the letter from Bibby Financial Services, makes a number of points arising from that discussion and as the company was not represented at the meeting and, therefore, did not have the right of reply, I believe it is appropriate that the committee should note the following points that were made in the letter: Bibby states that it has at all times operated in accordance with the terms and covenants of its agreement with SBCI and in compliance with all other regulations in Ireland.  Bibby states that none of the funding it received as part of its agreement with SBCI has been used by the Bibby Line Group or Bibby Financial Services' UK business.  Bibby strongly refutes any suggestion that it has operated in an unlawful way at any time or has acted outside the terms of its agreement with SBCI.  Bibby states that it has undergone rigorous due diligence and audit processes on a number of occasions with SBCI and has met all requirements on all occasions.  Bibby states that it is proud of its role in supporting the Irish economy and that it has made more than &euro;600 million available to Irish SMEs since 2018.  I propose that we note and publish No. 436 and advise Bibby accordingly.  Is that agreed?  In the correspondence advising Bibby of the decision, I will inform Bibby about the option of making a submission under Standing Order 711 in the event that it is unhappy with the way in which the matter has been dealt with.  In relation to SBCI, the secretariat is compiling the questions that members have submitted for it to respond to.  I understand there are currently more than 30 questions and we will consider these at our meeting tomorrow.  We are seeking a lot of information from SBCI regarding this.  As has been outlined, there are more than 30 questions to be put.  I remind members that when we talk about an entity or body that is not present, we should be careful regarding our legal requirements.  I will open it up to the floor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#K00800"><p>I am delighted that the Chairman read out the letter from the relevant company.  It is more than entitled to do so.  Our issue as a committee is with the SBCI and the lending of money that was envisaged for a particular purpose.  Of course, it will understand, as, I am sure, does the company that wrote to us does, that we have a responsibility to examine that.  Many questions have been submitted and I know they will be laundered through the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser tomorrow.  I have not submitted my questions yet because I do not intend to have them laundered by anybody.  I have my own legal advisers, who can advise on that.  My analysis of this particular transaction is a matter of major concern to me.  The auditors of the company that wrote to the Chairman have resigned.  It is a matter of concern whether SBCI would have been aware of that at the time we were questioning about this matter.  If it was not aware of it, what was the reason?  Other issues do not make me comfortable that the money that was lent was lent for the purposes for which it was intended.  That may be a failing, as I was at pains to point out at our previous meeting, which I know was in private.  In fairness to the company in question, I am happy to say publicly that the failing may have been with the original legislation and oversight of it by the Oireachtas.  It may have been failings in the legislation itself but it is our responsibility to get to the bottom of it because of the amount involved.  Certainly the spirit of the legislation, which I was in the House for when it was put through, is not captured in this.  There is no suggestion that the company did anything wrong but it may well be the case that SBCI or indeed Members of these Houses did.  We have a responsibility to find out whether this is the case.  I formally propose that notwithstanding any considerations tomorrow at our private meeting, we invite SBCI back before us to examine this transaction in detail.</p><p>Moreover, the invitation should specifically point out that we want to talk in detail about this transaction and no other.  An all-encompassing invitation should be issued so that the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland representatives are in no doubt whatsoever about the need to have all details with them in respect of underwriting, due diligence and everything else in order that we can go through all of this in detail.  I am afraid information given at the meeting by the SBCI representatives does not tally with the information in this letter or other information provided to me and other members of the committee.</p><p> It is a matter without prejudice to anyone.  It may well be our fault - the fault of Deputies and Senators in these Houses.  This requires and demands a public investigation with SBCI without prejudice to the company involved.  That is our responsibility.</p><p> In advance of our private meeting tomorrow I want to put a point on the record.  Parliamentary privilege exists for a reason.  Sometimes, where the Legislature crosses with private society and the commercial world, it is necessary to refer to certain entities and companies and, at times, individuals.  That is the very reason parliamentary privilege exists in a democracy.  It is beyond ridiculous and absurd in the extreme to wall ourselves off to the extent that we cannot do our job in holding ourselves and the public purse to account.  That is what I intend to do regardless of any advice tomorrow.  I believe and hope colleagues will approve the proposal today.  I do not want it to go to a private discussion tomorrow.  I wish to formally propose that, as a matter of urgency, we bring SBCI representatives back in to discuss that transaction.</p></speech>

The legislation was clear.  We all recall that such companies were struggling at the time to get finance from the commercial banks.  This was to be a facility.  Obviously, Bibby Financial Services Ireland is a component of the arrangements.  The company provides a discount or service in respect of invoices to improve cash flow.</p> <p>  It is absolutely a requirement of the Committee of Public Accounts to ensure money is used the way it was intended to be used.  I do not believe any of us need to make an apology for that.  It is absolutely fine for people to take issue with it.  Anyway, all we need to do is look at the evidence and interrogate it.  I want to ensure that the questions are comprehensive enough and deal with the issue from the point of view of the evidence that has been provided to us.  This is not a battle with a particular entity.  It is about ensuring that we are getting what the legislation set out for this fund and what it was to be used for.</p></speech>

Moreover, the level of questions that we are sending back to the corporation warrants that SBCI representatives would appear before the committee again.  A considerable number of what seem to be contradictory statements have been made since they were before the committee in answers that they came back with or on the basis of information we had.  I second the proposal and I hope this happens sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

The SBCI letter now seems to dispute some of the issues raised.  I would like to see the evidence of this because the evidence we had does not appear to agree with some of the issues raised in the letter.  It is important that we get the SBCI representatives to check back in and go through this again.  We need to see what explanations are being brought forward in respect of some of the issues raised on the last occasion.</p></speech>

There should be no question about that as we are discussing public funds.  I suggest we await a reply to the 30 questions.  At that point I certainly would like to see the answers to the questions before SBCI representatives come in the door.  Does anyone else have further questions to add to that?</p></speech>

I have no problem putting things in writing but we are all used to the parliamentary questions.  A written answer will never capture what we can capture in a hearing where people can go to and fro and I can pick up where Deputy Murphy leaves off or <i>vice versa</i>.  It can all be done quickly rather than going into the administrative merry go round where 30 questions go out and 30 answers are considered.  In such cases the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers plays a part and there are articles in the newspaper.  We go back at it again and again.  Instead, let us get them in and schedule a two-hour session.  The two-hour sessions are laughable really and it is difficult to get under the bonnet of issues in that timeframe, but we should get the SBCI representatives in and go through it.  I hate the administrative merry-go-round.  It is something they do in the legal world.  They cannot ring each other.  They have to write to each other and it is &euro;1,500 per letter and so on.  Let us get them in and throw the questions out.  I hate to be at odds with you, Chairman, and I know you are trying to be helpful and we have a large agenda.</p></speech>

The only reason I suggested it was that we would be able to focus in this discussion on the issues, get to the real issues and drill into it.  That is the only reason.  If members reckon there is a better way of doing it and that we should look to bring them in and put those questions to them, then I am happy enough to go along with that.  We will look to have them brought back in.</p></speech>

We know the answer.  What we really need to do is ask them face to face and eye to eye why the information they gave us was very different to the information that went to other people.  The one contradicts the other.  I do not think we need to put them on notice of that.  That is my view on reflection.  My thanks to the clerk for putting it together but we would be better off, if at all possible, having them at another sitting before we put them on notice.</p></speech>

Would we be having this discussion in public?  We probably would have the opportunity for extra sessions.  Time matters.  I believe we would be doing more of this in public than we are doing if circumstances were different.  That has pretty much been the routine.</p> <p>  There are questions.  I am trying to think about the timeline.  There are questions that we can valuably put so that we can have a better discussion when it comes to having them at a public session.

I know we have discussed this and I do not want to open it for discussion but it regards the service level agreement and SouthDoc.  It is in the bundle of correspondence today.  I ask the clerk to follow up with the HSE regarding the service level agreement, if members are happy with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021032300002#M01000"><p>I welcome and thank Deputy Gould for raising this issue.  It appears to be a perplexing situation.  The HSE has outsourced the running of the doctor on call services to a private company.  The HSE is under the impression that this company has an obligation to provide particular services in some parts of Cork.  We are told that on 14 March last year SouthDoc closed 11 facilities across counties Cork and Kerry.  On 18 and 29 September and on 1 October the HSE wrote to SouthDoc requesting the restoration of a service plan for Listowel and Blackpool.  SouthDoc sent a letter stating it is not planning to open either Listowel or Blackpool.</p> <p>  This is a potentially very serious matter and it is crucial we get a full appraisal from the HSE as to how it finds itself in this position where services to local communities are being essentially denied by a private company which has received &euro;7.294 million in 2019 and 2020.  How can an organisation be in receipt of that level of taxpayers' money and yet refuse point blank to provide a service?  We know the HSE can often be dysfunctional but when it outsources to private companies it often appears to be even more dysfunctional.  This committee needs to do a bit of work in respect of how we got to this point.</p></speech>

The question is whether or not work should be done by the HSE with SouthDoc to aim towards that.  The current situation is that the provision of services is totally on one side of the city and there is not access by bus or other public transport to the location on the south side of the city.  Even the people on the south side do not have bus access to that location.  There is a major question, if a proper reorganisation was done, about whether one centre in the city centre would be far more effective than the way it is now.  It is totally disjointed and now we have one centre closed.  It is something the HSE should be looking at with SouthDoc to resolve rather than pushing it down the road, which appears to be what it is doing at the moment.</p></speech>

It still raises the question of whether there could be a far more efficient service by having one location in the centre of the city, rather than the way it is now organised.  I do not know why that was not done the first day but it is a problem now because even people on the south side cannot get there by public transport.</p></speech>

It goes to the heart of how public funds are often spent in our health services.  This is a situation I do not fully appreciate as I do not know the geography as well as Deputy Burke in relation to what the optimum operation of this service will be.  The difficulty is once one enters into an expensive contract with a private company, one is tied to that even if public health and common sense suggest an alternative course of action is warranted.  This goes to the heart of how millions of euro of taxpayers' money is spent in delivery of our health services and I think this committee has an important role to play in getting to the bottom of whether or not the HSE signed us up to a contract that does not deliver the service we are paying for.</p></speech>

We will proceed with that.</p> <p>  That concludes the correspondence.  The other issue is Standing Order 218.  Most members have concerns around that and I asked two weeks ago for members to bring suggestions regarding changes, abolition, scrapping or replacing Standing Order 218.

Today, the committee will engage in its ongoing scrutiny of the stability programme update report with representatives of the Central Bank of Ireland to discuss the current economic and fiscal situation and key issues that the medium-term fiscal strategy could consider and address.  I welcome Dr. Mark Cassidy, director of economics and statistics, and Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hickey, senior economist from the Irish economic analysis division.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain to the witnesses some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they may make to other persons in their evidence.  Pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, the evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind Members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the places in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a Member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any Member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. Cassidy to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hickey from the Irish economic analysis division of the Central Bank.  I will give a brief summary of the outlook for the economy, drawing on the macroeconomic forecasts set out in our latest quarterly bulletin, but I will also take account of the developments and available indicators since then.  We will be publishing updated forecasts in our forthcoming quarterly bulletin at the beginning of April.</p> <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic and the measures to contain the spread of the virus, which has caused an unprecedented contraction in the Irish and world economies over the past year, are likely to remain the dominant determinant of the path of the economy this year and in 2022.  The near-term prospects have deteriorated following a resurgence in Covid-19 cases early in 2021.  However, the prospect of a successful deployment of vaccines from an increasing range of choices does offer the prospect of recovery from the second half of the year, underpinned by continued support from accommodative monetary and fiscal policy.</p> <p>  Preliminary national accounts statistics, which show GDP growth of 3.4% last year, indicate remarkable resilience in headline growth given the exceptional scale of the shock to domestic and world demand.  However, the headline GDP figure was boosted by strong export growth that was, in turn, largely accounted for by a surge in pharmaceutical exports and continued strength in the IT sector.  This masked a decline in domestic demand which was among the most severe in the EU.  Output declined in all other sectors, with the largest declines in sectors with a high dependence on face-to-face contact with customers including the arts, hotels, bars and restaurants and high-street retailers.  Private consumption last year was down by 9% compared with the previous year, with modified domestic demand down by 5.4%.</p> <p>  The impact of the pandemic is particularly evident in the labour market.  While the headline unemployment rate has not changed significantly, reflecting standard international statistical conventions regarding its measurement, the Covid-adjusted rate, which includes those workers who are availing of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, increased rapidly.  It currently stands at a rate of 24.8%.  When we also include the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, approximately 960,000 people, or 39.3% of the labour force, are currently in receipt of one form or other of income support.  The figures also show that younger and lower paid workers have been most affected.</p> <p>  The concentration of the pandemic labour market shock among workers in the bottom half of the income distribution is reflected in a corresponding decline in compensation per worker or earnings.  That this has not been reflected in a decline in disposable incomes &ndash; disposable incomes actually increased last year by about 4% &ndash; is testament to the effectiveness of Government income support measures.  Similarly, at firm level, Government support measures have provided significant mitigation to the financial distress to SMEs most affected by pandemic-related business disruption.  These supports, while proportionate and appropriate to the size of the shock to households and firms, have been unprecedented in scale, amounting to more than 11% of modified gross national income, GNI*.  The general government balance has moved from a small surplus of 0.9% to a deficit of just under 9% of GNI* in 2020 and is likely to remain close to that level again this year.  This has resulted also in an increase in public sector debt and the debt-to-national income ratio.</p> <p>  The resurgence in infections since December and the reimposition of strict containment measures weakens the near-term outlook and makes it more uncertain.  The containment measures have dampened economic activity significantly in the first quarter of this year and, beyond that, some public health measures are likely to continue to be required, until the successful deployment of effective vaccines reaches a significant proportion of the population.  Assuming successful deployment of vaccines by the second half of the year, domestic economic activity should begin to rebound.  On this basis, modified domestic demand is forecast to grow by 2.9% in 2021, while GDP is projected to grow by 3.8%, although the recovery in the labour market is likely to lag somewhat until the broader economic recovery becomes more established.  The outlook is considerably uncertain, however, and contingent on key assumptions on Covid-19 developments.</p> <p>  Looking ahead, a further pick-up is projected in 2022, with modified domestic demand forecast to grow by 3.6% and GDP projected to grow by 4.6%.  While uncertainty and a subdued labour market are likely to keep precautionary savings elevated in 2021, these restraints should ease next year.  The unwinding of the large stock of savings accumulated during the pandemic should support a strong recovery in consumption in 2022.  Similarly, the reduction in uncertainty should allow investment to begin to recover next year.</p> <p>  The new EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, has averted the threat of a no-deal Brexit and means that the significant disruption to economic activity that would have accompanied such an outcome has been avoided.  The new agreement allows for the continuation of a basic economic relationship between the EU and UK.  Nevertheless, the EU-UK TCA makes trade in both goods and services more cumbersome and costly relative to EU membership.  In the short run, this is likely to be associated with continued supply-chain disruption.  In the long run, the negative impact of the UK's EU exit on trade flows, migration and productivity will reduce output in the Irish economy.</p> <p>  I will conclude my remarks with some views on the policy response to the pandemic and, in particular, how the available policy instruments can best support a sustainable recovery.  The impact of the pandemic has been mitigated by a range of fiscal, monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policy actions to support vulnerable households and businesses.  In the near term, policy must remain focused on supporting household incomes and firm liquidity to provide the most solid basis for recovery.  However, the size and nature of that support should be ready to adapt to changing circumstances.</p><p>Policy support should continue to counter the threat to viable economic activities and employment from the pandemic and, in time, facilitate structural transformations that support economically sustainable activities.  This would help to enhance resilience, support the productive capacity of the economy and mitigate scarring effects such as long-term unemployment.</p><p> On the fiscal side, the increase in deficit and debt ratios that has occurred has been both warranted and necessary.  Policy support will need to be maintained over the short term to stabilise the economy.  When health risks diminish, however, any continued support via current expenditure should be targeted and temporary, while any permanent increases in current expenditure will need to be funded in a sustainable manner.  Ultimately, more favourable growth dynamics in coming years should support a decline in the public debt ratio.  Even if action does not need to be taken now, however, it is important to plan to reduce the level of the debt ratio in time to a more sustainable level to ensure that the economy can face future shocks with sufficient headroom such that all available policy instruments can be deployed.</p><p> I look forward to the discussion with members.</p></speech>

The first, in January, comprised ten-year bonds at a slightly negative yield, while the second, earlier this month, was at very slightly positive yields.  That &euro;7 billion accounts for approximately 40% of the overall planned issuance for this year, which is in the range of &euro;16 billion to &euro;20 billion.  We do not have a figure for the amount of that issuance held by the ECB, although a significant proportion - perhaps of the order of one third, but I will seek to provide an exact figure - of the overall debt stock is held by the euro system.  It is a significant proportion, although we do not have a figure for the most recent issuance.  I can provide that precise figure in follow-up.</p></speech>

I had heard that the figure was one third, so the ECB has, essentially, monetised that debt.</p> <p>  Following on from that, many have pointed out that a clean distinction between monetary and fiscal policy was one of the first casualties of the global financial crisis of 2008.  In the current crisis, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish where one policy ends and the other begins, which is only natural given where we are today.  This interplay of monetary and fiscal policy has brought a co-ordinated crisis response, one of mutual benefit.  The ECB backstop - the bond markets of member states - is allowing them to engage in countercyclical spending and I very much welcome that.</p> <p>  Closer to home, however, there is a crisis in our highly domestic banking sector, which Mario Draghi described as a "quasi-monopoly", and the concentration of the banks' internal risk-weighted models means we have the highest mortgage rates in the EU.  A further crisis is that if Ulster Bank's deposit book is distributed among the other banks, they could move to impose negative rates on retail customers.   Moreover, there is the possibility that the Government, through its significant shareholdings, could urge the banks to offset potential negative rates by accessing funding through, perhaps, the ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations, TLTRO, which offers the bank funding at negative rates and is unofficially seen as a way to mitigate negative interest rates for banks.</p> <p>  Given that a future of banking in Ireland commission could be in train and considering everything I have mentioned, the case for the Central Bank playing an active role in the commission seems fairly indisputable.  What are Dr. Cassidy's thoughts on that?  Does he agree?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#B00600"><p>I fully agree with the Deputy's assessment regarding the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy.  They are much more complementary this time than at the time of the previous crisis.  Important lessons have been learned and they are having a favourable impact.</p> <p>  With regard to the banking system, there is only so much I can say, given the side of the Central Bank from which I am coming.  It is clear we have a heavily concentrated banking system compared with those of some other European countries, with somewhat less competition.  Legacy and other issues, too, contribute to making our retail interest rates higher than those of other countries.  As the Deputy will probably be aware, they are the second highest in the EU.  That relates partly to previous losses from the crisis and partly to issues with banks being able to access collateral.  This leads to a requirement for more capital in banks, which can pass through to their ability to pass on lower rates to consumers.</p> <p>  The TLTRO, which the Deputy mentioned, are a potential option of which banks can avail if they wish to access that type of funding.  Certain conditions are attached and some of the Irish banks access that type of funding.  While I acknowledge there has been some commentary recently on the Central Bank's participation in the banking commission, I would rather not comment beyond what has been said in the past because of my area of responsibility.</p></speech>

I was not surprised that it joined in the chorus of those who have criticised the shared equity scheme as being inflationary and further pushing home ownership out of the hands of many people.  The Land Development Agency is also of great concern.  Has the Central Bank carried out an estimate of the price impact of these two Government initiatives?  What is its view on the recently announced move by the New Zealand Government to require its central bank to consider house prices when making decisions about monetary policy alongside other factors such as inflation and unemployment?</p></speech>

We provided an assessment to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in which we examined the shared equity scheme under a number of headings relating to our mandate for financial stability, our mandate for consumer protection and broader dynamics in the market.  As for the third heading, which related to pricing and affordability, our assessment was that the main problem in the market relates to a lack of supply, about which I think there is a general consensus.  We think the main effect of the shared equity scheme may be on demand and that while that may have some effect on supply, the effect may not be too great because there seems to be some sluggishness in how supply responds to demand.</p> <p>  We cannot yet provide an assessment regarding how great any impact on prices might be because we do not yet have enough information regarding the design of these measures.  We would need information on who the measures could apply to, whether there would be particular thresholds or caps on the measures and whether they would apply to certain cohorts.  Until we have more details, we will not be able to provide any quantification on supply.</p> <p>  Whether house prices should be taken into consideration in the assessment of price stability is a very topical, important and relevant issue.  The Central Bank of Ireland, of course, is part of the euro system and we contribute to its monetary policy.  The ECB is currently undertaking a fundamental review of its monetary policy strategy.  It will be a very comprehensive review of many different areas.  One key element will examine whether owner-occupied housing should be included in the measurement of the price basket when ECB takes decisions regarding price stability.  It is too early to say what the outcome will be in that respect - the findings are expected to be announced during the second half of this year - but the issue is under active consideration as part of that stability review.</p></speech>

It relates to climate change.  In previous years, the ECB and the central banks it co-ordinates have often had too great a focus on price stability, unlike the US Federal Reserve, which also has a focus on creating full employment.  The president of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, recently stated that climate change affects all the bank's policy areas and that a new climate change unit has been established.  This decision, an ECB press release stated, "reflects the growing importance of climate change for the economy".  It seems to tie in with the EU's efforts to initiate a green new deal with a just transition, which is necessary if Europe is to reach its targets.</p><p>It is clear that in order to do this, massive investment is required in green technology.  Economists working in the climate area argue that spending of 2.5% of GDP on green investment and just transition is required but our Minister for Finance is arguing that we must start to reduce our spending and reduce our rate of borrowing.  At the same time, the T&aacute;naiste has been warning that inflation is about to take off, despite the fact that the EU has spent the past decade fighting deflation.  Does the Central Bank accept that EU states must have access to the kind of funding required for large-scale green investment projects and that it is necessary to increase investment in these technologies if the EU is to come anywhere close to reaching its targets?</p></speech>

Deputy Farrell mentioned that a new climate change unit has been set up at the ECB.  I can confirm that we have done the same within the Central Bank in Dublin.  That reflects the importance of climate change, including for central banks; this is not just something that we are looking out at in the rest of the economy.  Climate change has a significant impact on the mandate of central banks, including through potential risks or impacts on price stability through its effects on the real economy, as well as its potential effects on financial stability, perhaps through the exposure of banks or insurance companies.  We are directly interested and are taking our responsibilities in that regard very seriously.  There is also the extent to which the central banking community in the euro system should be commenting on more general economic issues around central banking or taking that into consideration in our monetary policy decisions.  I am sorry to be giving a similar answer to the previous one but this is under active consideration in the current ECB strategy review.  What I can say is that the mandate of the ECB is very clear, namely that the primary concern is price stability.  The secondary objective, without prejudice to price stability, is to take action to support the general economic policies of the EU which would include climate change.  There is an indirect opportunity there, as long as it does not conflict with the primary objective of price stability which remains paramount.</p> <p>  In terms of the politics, I will not comment on the political dimension apart from agreeing with the fundamental importance of capital expenditure to mitigate risks relating to climate change.  This is very clearly present in both our domestic national development plan, much of which relates to climate activities and also in the plans for the EU recovery and resilience facility, over one third of which must involve climate change measures.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

To what extent does the Central Bank intend to influence the recovery period in our economy, after the restrictions are lifted, particularly with regard to the lessons learned from the previous economic crash?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#C00500"><p>Our main responsibility in this areas relates to our active contribution to the monetary policy of the euro system.  It is clear that the accommodative monetary policy reflected in low, zero and, in some instances, negative interest rates, as well as very significant asset purchases, has had a significant downward impact on Government borrowing costs, which are at around zero at the moment.  That largely reflects ECB monetary policy actions to which we can contribute.  In addition to the direct effect on sovereign borrowing costs, there is the effect on lending costs of financial institutions, which depend more than anything on those sovereign yields.  The third effect is that the ECB's monetary policy is having a positive impact on the economic performance of the euro area as a whole and we benefit, in a secondary way, through spillovers from that positive growth.  That is currently having a very significant effect and we published some analysis of that yesterday.  The analysis shows that for both Ireland and the euro area, the results are roughly similar.  Output this year is around 1.5% higher than it would be in the absence of this monetary policy.</p> <p>  I have just outlined the actions that have already been taken.  What I would say about the recovery period is that the ECB is committed to ensuring that this accommodative monetary policy remains in place.  The asset purchases will continue until at least March 2022 and longer, if necessary.  Similarly, the guidance is that the interest rate environment will remain low until the recovery is established.  It is very clear, through the monetary policy to which we contribute, that we are having and will continue to have a significant effect.</p> <p>  Our other responsibility is in the area of providing economic analysis and comment.  Our public comments with regard to the public finances are very supportive of the idea that additional policy measures are required and that there is a role for fiscal policy in supporting the recovery, enhancing the productive capacity and reducing the scarring effects.  We are very supportive of Government actions in that regard.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

It is also likely - and I have read newspaper reports recently to this effect - that there may be some poaching of skilled labour by adjoining jurisdictions if they emerge from lockdown before we do.  To what extent has the Central Bank factored in that issue in the context of its potential impact on our economy?</p></speech>

It is very clear that this is not happening at the same pace everywhere but the expectation is that there will be some convergence in the roll out of vaccines in the longer term.  That said, some countries may recover somewhat quicker than others.  In terms of our assumptions regarding the recovery of the economy, we see it beginning quite strongly during the second half of the year, which is not out of line with estimates for the rest of the EU.  The scope for what the Deputy is describing is limited enough, although we have not done any assessment beyond that.</p></speech>

In terms of our economic analysis, we look at all factors.  Labour market developments in this country, including not just the numbers in employment but also the skill levels and the human capital of the economy, are absolutely critical in determining our future path.  As a result, monitoring those issues and publishing our analysis is a critical part of our mandate in the context of economic analysis and advice.</p></speech>

Hopefully, this recovery will come about in a somewhat different fashion to the recovery following the last economic crash.  It has been indicated to various committees in recent weeks that the banking sector will develop the means to assess the viability of small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  I am not sure this is necessarily the best approach because it puts the assessment in the hands of the banks instead of the customer.  It is necessary to take into account the views of those who have set up and maintained businesses and kept people in employment in both good times and bad in recent years.  To what extent will the Central Bank be in a position to encourage the lenders to take account of the expertise in the SME sector, as opposed to what happened in the aftermath of the economic crash?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#C01100"><p>We were in a very different situation with the recovery the last time.  We have a much stronger banking system now, much healthier public finances, lower indebtedness and the structure of the economy is much better placed to recover.</p><p>We are also in a situation where the Government can put money into the economy during a downturn as opposed to the need to take it out of the economy during the downturn, which was the situation last year because our borrowing costs had risen to levels which, frankly, nobody was willing to lend us money at, and which compares with a situation now where we are borrowing for ten years at effectively 0%.</p><p> The viability of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, will be a critical issue on the path to recovery of this economy.  It is clear that there are a lot of SMEs that are experiencing considerable losses at the same time that they would be structurally fundamentally sound when the economy begins.  That, of course, is the rationale for the Government supports to the SME sector which are extremely important.  Much of the distress will not become evident until after those supports are removed and that is when public policy reaches a critical juncture.  Certainly, public policy will have to make decisions with regard to the balance between ongoing support for the sector versus trying to assess viability and trying to support new emerging sectors.</p><p> With regard to the Central Bank's role in this, I suppose we engage at a supervisory level with the banks.  It is important for them to make quality risk assessments so as not to be putting their own funds in jeopardy.  At the same time, we also discuss with banks the bigger picture.  The economy as a whole does not benefit if there is to be undue closing of small and medium-sized enterprises.  It is in nobody's interest for the economy as a whole to be affected negatively as a result.  Therefore, it is important that banks also take into consideration the larger picture in making decisions.  I am not involved in the supervisory area.  Personally, I cannot say anything more about that engagement, except to agree with what Deputy Durkan says.  As a general comment, there are many small and medium-sized enterprises that are a significant part of society and community and they need to be considered as such rather than in the narrow financial contribution.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#D01200"><p>There are greatest concerns in terms of the economy generally and then from a policy perspective.  For the economy generally, clearly we are hoping for the scenario, that I think people now expect, whereby the vaccines get successfully rolled out during the second half of the year and are effective in combatting the virus.  Anything where that does not materialise is the greatest short-term risk for the economy.</p> <p>  Over the longer term, and this is getting also into the policy dimension, there are a number of challenges for Government policy.  First of all, one will see additional financial pressures for the Exchequer from ageing, particularly as and from 2040, and also in relation to climate change.  There is a draft Bill today which will include intermediate or secondary targets for before 2050.  There are many medium-term pressures in the public finances that need to be considered now.  They would be difficult to deal with if they are not addressed now.</p> <p>  In addition, Ireland is a small, open economy.  We are always more vulnerable to shocks to the external environment than other countries and that remains the case.  I would note maybe two of those in particular.  First, we have a high degree of reliance on corporation taxes paid by foreign multinationals.  It is welcome that we receive these corporation taxes but there are risks to those because there is quite a high degree of concentration in a small number of sectors and small number of firms.  There is also an international process under the OECD in terms of changes to international taxation arrangements and it is acknowledged that Ireland could lose some of its current tax revenues as a result of that process.  Risks relating to the external environment, multinationals and SMEs are important.</p> <p>  I suppose a third concern is that while the public finances remain in a generally favourable position and they can absorb the additional expenditures that will be required this year and perhaps after to alleviate the current costs of the restrictions because of Covid but also to help the economy recover, we still have a high level of public sector debt and a high level of public sector debt leaves an economy more vulnerable to unforeseen shocks that might come down the line.  For that reason more than any, a key element of our policy advice is when conditions allow - I emphasise that part because we are not currently in that state - it will be essential to return the public sector debt ratio to a lower, more sustainable level than the current level which is approximately 100% of national income.  Economic growth will do most of the heavy lifting in that regard but at the same time there is a need to think about a path to return the Government balance to a more sustainable situation that is compatible with a lower debt ratio.  Those are just some of the concerns that come to mind.</p></speech>

Obviously, in a particular focused area of strategy we are trying to convert people to the use of hybrids, non-traditional diesel cars, etc.  There are some incentives to encourage people to switch.  Obviously, because transportation related taxes account for a significant amount of revenue for the State, when should these incentives cease and how will they be replaced?</p></speech>

Housing markets are different from most markets that exist because they are so different across countries.  It is very difficult to get any type of harmonised or standardised data on housing markets because they differ.  I suspect that is one factor but whether there are areas where things can be improved and data may become available, I am not aware.  It is not an area in which I have worked.</p></speech>

We have significant responsibility for the mortgage market and publish a deep analysis of it every year in our review of mortgage market measures.  To the extent that the supply of housing is a key factor affecting current mortgages, we have some responsibility but whether we are best placed to do the depth of analysis, I am not sure.</p></speech>

Their actions caused an unprecedented economic crash and ordinary people paid the bill through income losses, job losses and crushing cuts to areas such as housing, health and education.  The people want to know that austerity is off the table and they are not going to be asked to pay the bill this time because it would be grossly unfair and counterproductive, as clearly was the case in previous cuts to areas such as healthcare, housing and education.  In the context of Covid, one thinks about the price that we are paying for the cuts and lack of investment in areas such as those.  Am I hearing our guests right that the advice of the Central Bank is to the effect that austerity of the sort where ordinary people pay the bill for the Covid crisis should be off the agenda?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#E01600"><p>There are elements of that question that I cannot get into but I can say a few things.  Current Government policies are considerably reducing the costs and hardships of the crisis.  We saw that in some data we published recently where average wages would have declined and, in fact, average incomes in the economy increased last year due to the impact of Government supports.  That contribution was greater for lower-income groups.  Government policies have already had a positive effect.</p> <p>  The Deputy is asking about the forward-looking situation, once the temporary supports that are now in place are removed and a recovery is under way.  The Deputy mentioned public sector investment.  Experience shows that it is extremely unwise for an economy to cut back on capital investment following an economic crisis because that has negative effects on the productive capacity of an economy in the long run.  That is a key lesson and a mistake was made in the past in that respect.  In Ireland, we did not have too much choice because we could not afford to borrow money at the time but investment certainly fell significantly here and elsewhere after the most recent crisis.  That has had significant negative effects.</p> <p>  Our advice and recommendation is that, first of all, current temporary policies remain necessary and they need not be removed prematurely.  When they are removed, attention needs to be focused on the recovery of the economy.  What will be most important there will be measures that reduce scarring effects, particularly long-term unemployment.  There will be structural changes.  In many ways, the economy will go back to where it was before but not fully.  There will be changes in consumer preferences, tastes and habits that have been picked up during the crisis that will be permanent.  We will have changes in commuting patterns because of working from home and that will have structural effects on the economy.  What policy can do there is to try to gear the economy towards the new reality, including the retraining and upskilling of people.  That is a significant way in which policy can have a positive effect.</p> <p>  I earlier mentioned enhancing the productive capacity of the economy.  In terms of paying the bill for Covid, I also mentioned the fact that we think the current situation is sustainable.  We do not think there is any need for what is commonly called austerity, albeit that can mean different things to different people.  Austerity is certainly not required to a degree whereby demand is removed from the economy at a time when the recovery is not established.  We firmly believe that when the time is right, public sector debt will need to return.  We think that economic growth will do much of the heavy lifting in that respect and that is another reason to emphasise the importance of capital investment.  We also think that the general situation in terms of Government balance, including the mix between current expenditure and taxation, will need to move to a more sustainable position, closer to balance or even surplus.  With regard to how that is done, I would be getting into a political decision with regard to the distributional effects.</p></speech>

Perhaps Dr. Cassidy will think this is getting into the political area, or whatever, but does he want to comment on the Oxfam report?  I know that the Central Bank produces reports on wealth and its distribution.  The Oxfam report, The Inequality Virus, states that, in Ireland and globally, huge numbers of ordinary people have lost jobs and incomes and have really suffered while a significant cohort of billionaires, the super wealthy and certain industries with which they are associated have done extraordinarily well and have seen their wealth increase significantly.  That is true in Ireland.  The report states that the wealth of Ireland's billionaires has increased by &euro;3.3 billion.  Has Dr. Cassidy any comment on that?  Do the Central Bank figures on wealth accumulation bear that out?  If Dr. Cassidy is not going to comment on what we should do in the areas of wealth and redistribution, would he agree that taxing such individuals is certainly something that should be considered as an option?</p><p>It is being considered as an option and, in some cases, acted on in some countries.  Countries like Chile and some others have introduced Covid-related wealth taxes.  Rather than debt-financing Covid expenditure, they have at least opened up the option of taxes on those who have done well from Covid, and the very wealthy, to pay for the cost of the Covid crisis.</p></speech>

I can comment that there are distributional effects of Covid which are common across countries.  Lower income, part-time and younger workers are more negatively affected because of the nature of the crisis.  It will be important to take that into consideration in the recovery period, particularly to ensure that temporary changes and inequality are not sustained over time because short-run effects become longer-run effects.</p> <p>  We publish material on wealth.  It shows that for Irish households wealth depends upon the housing crisis, far more than anything.  Housing remains the dominant form of wealth to a greater extent in Ireland than elsewhere.  Certainly, a small number of the population is highly wealthy, but for the vast majority wealth has recovered having fallen dramatically after the last crisis.  House prices are the main factor in that.  However, I cannot comment on the policy issue.</p></speech>

On wealth distribution, I take Dr. Cassidy's point about property values and so on but has he any further comment on it?  The figure I am aware of is that the wealthiest 10% has approximately 58% of all the wealth.  Therefore, if there is a concentration of wealth in property and other areas as a result of Covid, does it follow that there has been a growth in inequality as a result of the distribution of wealth from Covid?  Is this an issue that needs to be looked at?</p></speech>

I imagine that Covid would have a very limited effect, but one could also look at the environment in which Covid is taking place and the fact that financial assets have increased quite significantly because of the low-interest rate environment.  The motivation for low interest rates is to try to improve overall economic activity to benefit everybody in the economy.  The evidence also shows that while there may have been some increase in wealth and financial assets, there has also been a significant effect on employment across the real economy.  There are two effects there and I certainly support the monetary policy environment and the policies that are in place.  Covid is having temporary income shocks that, hopefully, will not be sustained but I am not aware of Covid having particular effects, by itself, on wealth.</p></speech>

He referenced the incapacity, a decade ago, of the State to finance infrastructure projects that in the specific circumstances we have at the moment we could finance.  We know the best thing is to invest in transport, housing and so on to stimulate the economy and get people back to work and do so in a sustainable fashion.  There is a very lively debate going on at the moment around how the EU fiscal rules may be at least modified to allow that kind of positive investment.  Has Dr. Cassidy a view on how that should happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#F00800"><p>I thank the Deputy.  This is very important.  The European Commission issued an initial review of the framework in February.  Progress on that has understandably stalled since the pandemic has taken up attention, but it pointed to certain weaknesses in the fiscal framework from a backward-looking perspective.  Fiscal policies were often pro-cyclical and the composition of public finances was not as growth enhancing or encouraging of investment, including sustainable investment, as it might be.  The complexity of the fiscal framework, particularly in relation to matters such as structural balances which are very difficult to calculate and are largely outside Government control, is another issue.  The Government can decide how much it will spend but not necessarily how much it will take in.  These are all potential areas, flagged by the European Commission, where there will be some changes to the framework in future.</p> <p>  I cannot be too definitive because these are inherently political matters, but the simplicity versus the complexity of the framework should be considered.  Simpler rules on expenditure would be one option, rather than a focus on balances.  There is a certain degree of one size fits all when it comes to assessment of debt which focuses on a single figure - the debt ratio.  A broader understanding of an individual country's debt situation, the sustainability of its finances, and a distinction between good debt and bad debt is necessary.  Good debt is accrued for capital and environmental investment versus bad debt which is not productive.  Looking at what is underlying the debt and the sentiment of financial markets to further increases in debt are other issues.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues and an appetite for change in certain areas.  However, there are political issues and some countries will be more resistant to changes than others, so I do not know what the reality will be.  Certainly, the recent Commission report provides a basis for looking at these issues in the coming years once the current problems are out of the way.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily expect Dr. Cassidy to comment on political remarks, but the T&aacute;naiste expressed a view, in an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i>, that we should be preparing for rises in interest rates and price inflation.  I do not agree with him and do not agree it is something we should be concerned about at this stage.  Frankly, I agree that inflation may not be a bad thing over a period of time.  What is Dr. Cassidy's view on the potential for price rises and interest rate rises and their impact?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#F01000"><p>It is something that will be on our minds.  Regarding the short term, we published projections for inflation and the outlook is for it to remain modest in the coming years.  The announcements of the European Central Bank, ECB, on how long it expects to support monetary policy, both interest rates and asset purchases which put further downward pressure on Government borrowing costs, have clearly noted that support of an accommodative policy will remain in place for a while.  The asset purchases and interest rate will remain until at least March 2022 and possibly longer, depending on Covid.  The ECB projections are for inflation to be still below the global target of close to 2% by the end of its forecast horizon of 2023.</p> <p>  We do not expect to see the trends of higher inflation and higher interest rates in the short term.  Some of the risks of higher interest rates have been mitigated by the bond issuance of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which leaves our maturities and need to roll over debt in a very favourable position.  However, it is also the case that inflation and interest rates will increase at some stage.  The resilience of the economy will depend on how well placed it will be to withstand that.  I point particularly to the increase in interest rates.  If public sector debt is high, and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council published a useful document on this recently, there is significantly more vulnerability to higher interest rates when they occur.  At some stage, they will occur although I certainly will not put a time frame on it.  It is important that the economy is well placed.  This means that public sector debt should be lower than it is now when interest rates increase.</p></speech>

From what I am hearing from Dr. Cassidy, it seems he would not necessarily agree with the T&aacute;naiste's remarks.  I do not believe there is any evidence basis for them, frankly, and that seems to be what Dr. Cassidy is saying.  One of the policy interventions that was made last year was an intervention that my party and I have been calling for in the context of how we might deal with a potential no-deal Brexit.  I refer to the introduction of the initial temporary wage subsidy scheme, which has since evolved into the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Would Dr. Cassidy be of the view, given the exposure of the locally traded sector to the decline we have experienced and the clear challenges that certain economic sectors will face in re-establishing themselves, that we should, as a feature of the labour market, have embedded into our system a formal short-time working scheme equivalent, for example, to the that which operates very successfully in Germany and which supported jobs and businesses through the financial crash in the late 2000s and early 2010s?  Is this something he thinks we should consider, perhaps with a condition attached around training and upskilling?  We have a serious issue on our hands in terms of productivity and competitiveness for SMEs and an ongoing challenge in the context of upskilling and retraining.  I ask Dr. Cassidy to comment on that broad policy issue.</p></speech>

However, I will first go back to his initial comment because I cannot let it go by.  I am not saying that I do not agree with the T&aacute;naiste.  Let me be very specific on that.  The T&aacute;naiste, as far as I am aware, did not put a timeframe on this.  If the view is that, at some time, the next moves in regard to inflation and interest rates is that they are likely to be up, that is the case.  I think what is uncertain is when that will happen.  I must just make that point.</p> <p>  What the Deputy is suggesting in terms of the wage subsidy scheme evolving into something more permanent is worth consideration.  He is talking about something that can reduce the risk that arises when a crisis happens and workers become disengaged from a firm for a period.  It may only be temporary but such a disengagement leads to longer-lasting effects.  There are potential schemes that could be used.  The EWSS was introduced, obviously, for temporary purposes, but the rationale behind it could potentially be considered as something more permanent.  I would not want to get into it any further than that except to agree with the Deputy that there is a lot of merit in what he is saying for reasons that relate to maintaining skills, motivation and engagement.  If a worker leaves a firm, even only temporarily, it becomes much more difficult to re-engage that individual.  I think what the Deputy is suggesting is worth consideration.</p></speech>

At the end of his opening statement, Dr. Cassidy said that "policy must remain focused on supporting household incomes and firm liquidity in order to provide the most solid basis for recovery".  In his view, is the taxing of the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme counterproductive?</p></speech>

At a higher level, I think both types of income support have been absolutely critical.  We have evidence on how they have supported the incomes of many in the economy such that incomes generally have been maintained.  However, in terms of taxation versus non-taxation, I would rather not comment.</p></speech>

The first is about reducing the scarring effects that could occur through long-term unemployment.  There are issues in terms of upskilling, retraining and even other active labour market policies.  That is one area referred to by the Deputy.  The other is enhancing the productive capacity of the economy.  This would involve investment in infrastructure and human capital and also measures that could smooth the adjustment.  We will have a reallocation of resources after this crisis.  Much will go back to normal but not everything will.  Some sectors will be permanently smaller after the crisis.  As always, however, there will be new, emerging sectors.  We must, first of all, try to ensure that the skills exist for those to develop, whether in the areas of data, IT, management and so on.  That type of upskilling is needed.  In essence, it is about ensuring there is a supportive environment for the development and growth of new industries and sectors.  That is what we have in mind when we talk about those policies.</p></speech>

Dr. Cassidy spoke earlier about multinationals.  Are we over-reliant on those companies and, if so, what particular measures should we be taking to protect ourselves from that overexposure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#G00800"><p>I will make a couple of points on that question.  First, it certainly is the case that multinational contribute significantly.  Their contribution is extremely welcome.  There are some issues in regard to the measurement of their output, but they contribute in a very real and meaningful way to export, employment and the public finances and also in terms of positive spillovers, including technology spillovers that help to upskill workers.  The multinationals make an extremely positive contribution but our output figures show quite a degree of reliance.  When that is the case, we need to look at whether the economy would be resilient in the event of either a firm-specific shock - we should keep in mind that a small number of firms dominate output in many of these sectors - or a sector-specific shock in a context where, for example, the pharmaceutical sector and the IT services sector dominate.  We need to ensure that we would be resilient in such an event.  We are not anticipating any reduction in the size of the multinational enterprise, MNE, sector but we want to be resilient because there is always a risk.</p> <p>  There are three things that need to be taken into consideration from a policy perspective.  First, policies need to remain supportive of the multinational sector.  We must remain a good place for multinationals to do business.  Most of these sectors have been embedded in the economy for a long time.  They are here for the long run and we need to make sure we remain a favourable location for business.  Second, we need to make sure that, complementary to the MNE sector, there is a successful Irish-owned sector.  It is indigenous SMEs that provide most of the employment - up to 1 million people - in this economy.  There are issues in this regard.  There is significantly weaker productivity among Irish-owned firms than there is among multinational firms.  Policy needs to ensure that we also have a productive, innovative and expanding indigenous sector.</p> <p>  The third point relates to corporation taxes.  We have developed a very high degree of reliance on those taxes.  I understand that 20% of our overall tax revenues now relate to corporation taxes, which is extremely high by historical standards.  That revenue source is dominated by multinationals and it means that if there were to be any shock to the overall balance between revenues and expenditure, it could be a shock akin to what happened when we had a degree of reliance on the construction sector back in the 2000s.  We need to ensure that our public finances are not overly reliant on the tax revenues from multinationals and that we do not make decisions about permanent spending increases based upon revenues from corporation taxes that could turn out not to be sustainable over the long term.  Again, I am not making a prediction in that regard.  It is just about being prudent in terms of management.  I would point to those policy areas in response to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Dr. Cassidy highlights the amount of savings of some people, which they would be spending around 2022.  He also made reference to other sectors that have been hit much harder.  Has he a measure of those harder hit sectors and the difficulty those people are experiencing, in particular in meeting their mortgages?  Is the Central Bank monitoring the level of distress in that sector?  I am not sure there was any reference to it in the earlier discussion but I am particularly interested in whether the Central Bank has been monitoring, or has a measure or a view of, the distress those people are experiencing.</p><p> Second, in regard to the EU budget rules, much of which is set aside for the moment, it is only a matter of time before some shape is reintroduced in that regard.  Does the Central Bank have a view on those budgetary rules and what shape does it consider is best suited as we emerge into a post-Covid environment?</p><p> Third, does Dr. Cassidy have a view on the possibility of inflation or interest rate increases?</p></speech>

Let me deal with those three issues in turn.  The first question highlights a clear gap in terms of people's experience during the crisis.  For those people who have not been directly affected by any income losses, what they have generally experienced is a significant increase in their savings, largely because they have not had the opportunities to spend because outlets have been closed down and, in fact, in the past year savings have increased by around &euro;15 billion.  We think there is now a significant stock of savings that will be important in terms of supporting the recovery when it happens.  On the other hand, there are many sectors of the economy very negatively affected, particularly those reliant on face-to-face contact, such as hospitality, large parts of retail and arts and entertainment.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the analysis of this.  We have done something on this and we published it last year.  First, the losses have been significantly mitigated by the effect of the Government supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Given that, for most of these small enterprises, wages represent a very large amount of their costs, this has reduced the potential cost.  At the same time, they also have significant non-wage costs and many SMEs have experienced losses on those.  Our estimates are that SMEs last year would have experienced overall losses of roughly between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion, which is very significant.  We think the Government measures had a significant effect but the other estimate that we have published is that, even allowing for the supports, close to 15%, or just over one sixth of SMEs, are unlikely to have the financial capacity to meet their liabilities during 2021.</p> <p>  Essentially, bringing all of that together, while the Government supports have had a significant effect, significant losses have been incurred by many SMEs, including many viable SMEs and many SMEs which came into this crisis in a good financial position.  However, if they are closed for 12 months of the year, of course, they are going to incur losses.  Those are the estimates that we have.</p></speech>

Can Dr. Cassidy switch the focus to the distress on households and people?</p></speech>

The distress on households has been mitigated even more than the supports.  We published something on this in recent weeks and it shows that average household incomes actually increased last year.  There were two reasons for that.  First, a large part of the population are not affected directly by the crisis and, in fact, average incomes for that part of the population generally increased.  More remarkable has been the effect of the Government income supports.  Particularly for lower income workers and younger workers, the supports received from the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment have significantly reduced the financial hardship, although not in all cases and there have still been some income cuts among some parts.</p> <p>  I have some figures to hand.  Generally, if there had not been income supports, average incomes last year across the board would have declined by about 6% but, in fact, average incomes increased by about 4%.  Among younger workers, the effect was even greater.</p></speech>

That is what I am taking out of it but it does not sound like what one would hear from many people around Cork.</p></speech>

However, in the same paper where we look at income, we also look at debt sustainability.  It shows that debt ratios have increased in many cases but, in fact, they have increased much less than they would have in the absence of supports.  I would emphasise that a lot of the issues will only become visible and evident once the supports are removed.  Once the supports are removed and the recovery starts, if there are people who do not return to work, and there will be people who do not return to work, for that cohort, that is when we may see the pressures on debt sustainability and mortgage arrears.  For that reason, we would expect to see some adverse impact on mortgage arrears arising from this pandemic, even if the figures are not yet visible because of the effect of income supports.  I would in no way want to sound complacent about what the lasting effects will be.</p> <p>  In terms of EU budgetary rules, I would not comment on what is appropriate but there is much to be considered.  There have been issues raised, first, that the current framework is overly complex; second, that it is not sufficiently supportive of growth and capital investment; and, third, that it is a little bit one-size-fits-all and does not take into account that a country's debt ratio is not the only metric one needs to look at.  There is also what that debt represents, whether it is debt that has been accrued because of capital; what does the market think regarding the sustainability of that debt; and, more important than anything else, what is the financing cost of that debt.  A 100% debt ratio at 0% interest is a lot better situation than a 100% debt ratio at 3% or 4% interest.</p> <p>  Those are the issues.  The process was paused last February when the European Commission first reported on the budgetary rules and, of course, the Stability and Growth Pact escape clause has been triggered and that will be extended for a while.  After the recovery starts, I think there is an opportunity to look again at the fiscal framework.  There is scope there but it is a political issue as to what changes will actually materialise.</p> <p>  In terms of interest rates and inflation, all I would say is that we do not see them increasing markedly in the near term, and I think there are reasons for that.  With regard to interest rates, the ECB is on the record as saying it expects its current asset purchases and its low interest rate environment to be in place for a while.  However, I would say that interest rates and inflation are at historically low levels and, at some stage - I would not put a timeframe on it - there is likely to be an upward trend in those.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  Some of the issues I want to raise have already been touched on.  I want to explore the supports and how long the Central Bank believes they will last.  Looking at the economic letter that Mr. Hickey was part of drafting, page 3 states that the spending on temporary Covid supports, such as the EWSS, is likely to reduce in the coming years.</p><p>Can I take that as an indication that the Central Bank believes this type of support should be continued not only post June, when it is expected to cease, or at least planned at this time to cease, but potentially into 2022?</p></speech>

It depends not on the time but on the economic circumstances.  In the economic circumstances we are in at the moment it would clearly be extremely unwise to think of reducing these supports.  I think a time will come when the economy will start recovering towards normal, and then we need to consider how best to start gradually removing these supports.  I think that will be State dependent rather than time dependent.  I think it will depend on the economic data not only on how quickly the economy is reopening and what parts of the economy are reopening but also on how consumers are reacting.  The economy may reopen but some parts of it may still lag the recovery.  I think the data on consumer spending and employment trends as well as other economic indicators, rather than putting a specific time and, ultimately-----</p></speech>

Does the Central Bank see that the latter end of this year would be the right time to start to phase out or indeed to stop some of these supports in their entirety?  I take from Dr. Cassidy's economic letter that there might be a tapering out, depending on the circumstances, but some of these supports are going out to 2022.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#J00400"><p>We have a central assumption underlying our economic forecast.  We are not forecasting the public health situation.  We are making an assumption that during the second half of the year the vaccine will not become a one-stop shop but will gradually become effective such that by the end of the year the virus will be effectively contained.  If that assumption materialises, the advice will be for a tapering during the second half of the year.  As for the exact design of that tapering and this kind of cliff-edge effect, the economy will not return on day one to exactly where it was.  Therefore, the idea that one would suddenly stop all supports does not make economic sense, and I think that is generally acknowledged.  Previously, yes, I think a form of tapering was planned.  It is not for me to make Government policy, but under that assumption what one might expect to see would be a tapering during the second half of the year.  I would not, however, want to go further than that-----</p></speech>

Dr. Cassidy points out, as I in fact pointed out to him, that there was, at the lower end, &euro;5.4 billion of core, non-Covid-related expenditure in last year's budget and that could be in excess of &euro;8 billion.  He argues in his letter that that needs to be funded by sustainable financing through tax increases, yet we have a programme for Government which basically rules out all those types of measures bar plastic bag levies or carbon taxes.  How credible does Dr. Cassidy think that is?</p></speech>

It was, as the Deputy said, a minimum of &euro;5.4 billion.  We use that as an illustration of our more general point, which is that, looking forward, the economics suggest that if permanent spending increases are to be introduced, and we are certainly not advocating permanent current spending increases, then in some way they need to be funded.  We use our economic modelling techniques to show the extent of that.  Our results show that an increase of that order, approximately &euro;5 billion or &euro;5.5 billion, would, if not funded, lead to a permanent increase in the general government deficit of approximately 1.5 percentage points.  What that means is that if one is thinking of returning to a balanced situation over a certain time, those 1.5 percentage points would need to be raised elsewhere.  That is just pointing out the choice that exists.  If one wants to increase permanent expenditure, which is a purely political decision, then over the more medium term that needs to be financed in one way or the other.  There were some permanent increases, as the Deputy mentioned, and as the Fiscal Advisory Council has highlighted, in the previous budget.</p></speech>

We are talking about some permanent increases.  Most of them - not the majority of them but the larger proportion of them - related to health and staff within our healthcare system, which many would argue we needed and should have made a long time ago.  However, we also have the one-off expenditure, which has run into &euro;32 billion or so over the course of two years and will probably increase given that last year's assumptions are not materialising in terms of the supports that are needed this year.  Is it the Central Bank's view that the State can grow itself out of this without imposing restrictions or additional tax increases or cutting back on the type of expenditure we made in health, education and transport, which were probably the three key areas where core expenditure came?  There are two questions there.  I am looking at the one-off expenditure on Covid and the core expenditure.  Is there an opportunity to grow our way out of this?</p></speech>

The one-off expenditure has very different and more benign effects on the budgetary position.  Essentially, it will lead to a one-off level shift up in the deficit but will not lead to permanent pressures which are repeated year after year.  That is very important and we see that when we expect the budget deficit to reduce to 4% next year.  That is because of an assumption that these temporary measures will not be in place and it shows how they are removed.  That is why we feel very confident in supporting the temporary measures that have been introduced.  They are affordable.  We think we will need to see a reduction in the public sector debt ratio at the right time.  We think economic growth will bear the brunt of that.  We think any policies that would restrict growth in the future, therefore, would be counterproductive.  We think, in addition to the impact of economic growth, that that budget balance will need to get down to balance and, if the economy gets back to full employment, ideally something of a small surplus.  The public finance position, the general government balance position, in addition to debt, will be important for that.  The balance, that is, what government expenditure goes on, is also critically important in that regard.  Capital spending is much more conducive to economic growth than current spending.  The multipliers, that is, the amount by which an additional &euro;1 million of government spending leads to longer term growth, are much higher - about 2.5 times higher - when spent on capital investment.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it.  Therefore, my question to Dr. Cassidy is this: what level, in his view, of public capital expenditure could the State absorb?  We have been here before, where there were capacity issues and so on, but we are in a new year and new dynamics, with high levels of unemployment and, unfortunately, some of these jobs not coming back in the short term.  Is capital expenditure one of the ways in which we can deal with a number of problems at the same time in respect of not only employment but also the type of investment we need and then the return in terms of growth?</p></speech>

Second, of course, he will be fully aware of the national development plan.  We have seen capital investment.  Over 2018 and 2019, the average increase was 20% per year.  Even last year capital expenditure here continued to increase by approximately 15%.  That contrasts significantly with other European countries, which saw roughly zero or even a fall in capital investment, so the evidence of the lessons having been learned here is quite apparent.  What we will have over the next ten years, I think, will be really a guideline that public capital investment would average approximately 4% of national income every year, which is a substantial share, probably currently about &euro;10 billion a year.  I think that would be conducive to growth.  Certainly, it represents an avoidance of the mistakes of the past where one cut back on capital because of pressures on the public finances.</p> <p>  The Deputy alluded to a very important point, that we have, unfortunately, moved away from the kind of overheating, full employment position we were in only 12 months ago.  That does also mean that capital investment now would be more productive than in a situation in which we are at full employment and-----</p></speech>

I will open a second round for members of three minutes each.  While people are gathering their thoughts, perhaps members will indicate using the hands-up button on their Teams screens if they want to come in for a second round.  In the meantime, I will ask a couple of questions.</p> <p>  I want to return to the issue of SMEs and the recovery.  We heard a little bit this week, although maybe not as much as I would like, about the EU recovery funds to which Ireland may have access.  With regard to those grants and loans, what will the financial packages involved look like and what is the role of the Central Bank in this regard?  Does it Bank have any role in regulation?  In what way will the funds make their way to SMEs?</p></speech>

The current estimate is that we might receive approximately &euro;1 billion in total from the EU recovery and resilience fund, of which in the region of  &euro;900 million will come this year.  There will be requirements regarding how that money will be disbursed when we receive it.  There will be a need to take into consideration expenditure on climate-related matters.  Approximately 35% or 40% may need to go on climate.  There will also be a need to take into consideration productive investment, fairness and macro-stabilisation.  Essentially, the funding is for investment recovery and enhancing long-term potential, which is extremely appropriate.  In terms of the economic framework of the EU, measures that can enhance investment and improve environmental sustainability will be very appropriate.  I am not sure to what extent that would make its way to SMEs.  The &euro;1 billion I was talking about will be in the form of grants.  There is the potential for the same amount again within the overall EU envelope as loans, but it is not at all clear whether Ireland or many other countries would avail of those because borrowing costs in the private market are so low at the moment.</p></speech>

At the moment, we are able to borrow for approximately 0% over ten years so I am not sure what the incentive would be.  I do not have the details available as to what those rates would be and what terms and conditions might apply.  I certainly believe that for most countries, given the low interest rate environment, the grants are the most interesting.</p></speech>

The building back better aspect and the green recovery in particular are really positive principles.  There is, however, a very specific profile to those grants.  We heard this week that because of Ireland's GDP and our measurement of the economy in that way, we are going to receive fewer of those grants than we might otherwise be able to draw down.  During this session Dr. Cassidy outlined the three points relating to corporation tax - they are very good points - namely, that Ireland should remain a good place to do business, that we should have a successful indigenous sector and that we should not rely too much on corporation tax.  It seems, however, that while Ireland is losing out on those grants, the argument is that we are getting it back in corporation tax.  There is a qualitative difference between receiving corporation tax and being part of that recovery fund and those grants.  The first point about Ireland remaining a good place to do business is now working against the second, namely, to foster a successful indigenous sector.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

As a result of the presence of multinationals, it is well recognised that our headline GDP is overstated as a measure of the incomes of the economy.  GDP is probably in the region of 40% higher than GNI, which is what we get when we adjust for some of the practices of multinationals that relate to depreciation of intellectual property, depreciation of aircraft leasing and what is called contract manufacturing.  These are activities that do not really contribute to the Irish economy, but they do add to the headline GDP.  One impact of that is exactly what the Chairman mentioned, which is that it sometimes means our contributions or receipts to and from the EU are affected because the denominator is GDP rather than GNI*.  I have heard what the Chairman is describing in terms of what we receive but consider, for example, something rather simple.  If a country's contribution to the European Union is a percentage of its national income, and if GDP is used for Ireland, we are paying a much higher share than if GNI* was used.  It is the case that our contributions to, and in some cases returns from, the EU can be affected because of this measurement issue of national income.  I would not deny to that extent but in considering the contribution of multinationals, while corporation tax is important, it is only one element.  It is not just exports.  The overall multinational sector employs more than 350,000 people.  These are high-skilled jobs with above average wages.  They create a demand for skilled work and they have other spillovers in the environment and in local communities and also in terms of productivity and innovation technology.  The benefits from the multinational sector are much greater and more intrinsic than just corporation tax.  It is very important that the sector remains healthy and is encouraged in the State.</p></speech>

Earlier we talked about how we will determine what is a viable business.  Many businesses will be quite worried about what those determinants are.  Obviously, we are in a very febrile atmosphere and there is a great deal of flux in many industries.  I presume that some of the factors to be considered are levels of indebtedness and levels of production.  Would issues around labour force and capacity be considered?  This is a particular question for the construction sector where companies might be losing skilled people due to the shutdowns.  It might also apply to the aviation sector, where, for example, people in a certain cohort may be retiring.  Will Dr. Cassidy outline the factors that he believes will impact on whether or not an SME is considered viable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#K00800"><p>This is a difficult issue.  I am not sure what that assessment of viability will be.  It will not be the Central Bank that will make a viability assessment.  I am not sure what it will entail.  In a way it is too early.  I am aware that this is not a very satisfactory answer because, ideally, we would be able to design and consider future policies now, but we do not know how we will come out of the crisis.  For example, we do not know how spending patterns will change, which would mean that some of the temporary effects from the crisis may be sustained over time.  Some businesses that may have been viable going into the crisis may not be viable over the longer term.  Getting the balance right between, on the one hand, ensuring viable business, which is certainly for the economic benefit of the State, versus, on the other, keeping alive businesses that will not be viable over the longer term by allocating resources to those businesses that could be allocated elsewhere.  That is an extremely difficult balance to achieve.</p> <p>  In the first instance, there is a widespread recognition that many of the firms which have suffered significant losses and increases in debt during the crisis are viable and that the latter is just down to their businesses has been locked down temporarily, albeit for more than a year in many cases.  They came into the crisis viable; they will potentially be viable in the future and Government supports can help them in that regard.</p><p>At the same time, we have seen some firm closures and, undoubtedly, there will be firms that will not be viable after this pandemic.  Policy also needs to examine the most efficient, effective and least costly ways of restructuring those firms that will allow for the business to try to trade itself out of trouble during a restructuring process or to prevent it from entering liquidation prematurely premature liquidation.  There are measures under consideration such as lighter, more flexible examinership procedures that could help in that regard.  Policies will look, first, at continuing supports and how they might need to be adjusted and, second, in terms of potential restructuring procedures in the economy.  There are a couple of difficulties in that regard.  It is very difficult in practice in terms of that viability assessment.</p></speech>

I am going to abide by my own rule.  I have more questions but we are on to the second round, I am afraid.  I call Deputy Durkan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#L00300"><p>I have two or three brief questions and only one answer will be required.  The components used in determining the level of wealth in a particular country are, presumably, all goods and services, all property and all salaries and wages.  Could I have confirmation on that and also the extent to which that may misdirect economic policy?  For example, we could say that all property is inflated in terms of price and that all property is market related and, as we know from the economic crash, its value suddenly disappear.  I presume the GNP and the GNI* figures are used to measure wealth.  Are they used separately in these measurements or independently of each other?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#L00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  There is a couple of different elements to that.  The first would be a distinction I would make between national income and national wealth in the same way that a household will have its annual income and also its annual wealth.  When we talk about GNI, GDP and all of these measures they relate to income so they relate to how much an economy is producing or, alternatively, how much an economy is spending or earning within a year.  They do not include factors of wealth such as assets, housing or the like.  We have very good cross-country comparisons on income.  We have very poor cross-country comparisons on wealth because it is very difficult to compare many of the assets an economy might have in order to put a figure on those.  I might restrict the answer to income, which is what these measures relate to, and say two things about them.  We published something on this recently by our previous Governor, Professor Patrick Honohan, which looks at different measures of income that are used and how each may not be appropriate and can give very misleading results.</p> <p>  To summarise, if we look at GDP, which is what most economists around the world use, Ireland comes out as the richest country, in income terms, in the European Union and the fifth richest in the world.  That is entirely misleading and it is because GDP is inflated by some factors relating to the multinational sectors that in no way benefit the incomes of the Irish economy.  If we look at alternative measures just for those, we are probably around eighth highest in the European Union.  That is probably a reasonably meaningful comparison.</p> <p>  Professor Honohan also looked at what happens if we adjust that for the prices people pay.  Two countries may have the same incomes but one may be paying twice as much for its goods and services, and even for housing costs within a year, than another.  Ireland has an extremely high price level compared with other European countries, so if we adjust for the price level, again, we are down around eighth to 12th in the European Union, which is more meaningful.</p> <p>  I would make one other point on that.  National income is purely a financial and monetary concept.  There are also broader measures of welfare which are extremely important to take into consideration.  They may also reflect health, education and measures of well-being and happiness within an economy.  These are more difficult to measure.  They may be more representative of welfare in one country compared with another.  There is one such measure that Professor Honohan's publication mentioned, which is a United Nations human development indicator.  It includes all of these and when that is properly measured for Ireland, again, we are somewhere around the middle of the pack in terms of measurement compared with other European countries.  My apologies for going back and forth with a couple of different concepts in respect of measurement but I hope what I said goes towards answering the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Cassidy.  The final question is whether the Central Bank would have a concern if house prices were increasing at a rate that might otherwise be alarming.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021032300002#L00600"><p>Yes, and let me clarify what I would say about the term "might otherwise be alarming".  If prices are increasing fuelled by a lending boom - a credit boom - and people are purchasing houses not out of the income they are earning in work but are borrowing to do so and we get the same dynamic that we saw in the 2000s, and if there is a fixed supply of housing or housing that is increasing somewhat, people are borrowing more, which puts upward pressure on prices and means that other people coming after them have to borrow more again.  I suppose that price credit dynamic is what we would be most concerned with and we have very clear evidence from the past about what that can lead to.</p> <p>  The second comment I would make is that there is clearly an issue with regard to affordability of housing at the moment.  House prices are extremely high.  Many individuals and families cannot afford appropriate suitable accommodation, whether to rent or buy.  The issue very clearly for us is a shortage in the supply of housing.  That is a factor that needs to be addressed if that problem is to be overcome.</p></speech>

They are completed and ready for occupation but are not being occupied.  It would appear to me that such activity will impact in a positive way from the point of view of the owners but in a negative way from the point of view of the borrowers who would hope to buy and occupy those apartments.  What, if anything, can be done about that?  Should the Central Bank take an interest in that possibility and deal with it?</p></speech>

Anything that reduces the supply of accommodation, both apartments and houses, coming into the market is a negative in terms of dynamics in the housing market.  What we need is more supply coming on stream as best as possible.  Beyond that is getting more into housing policy.  We are clear in our advice on housing policy.  There is a need to increase supply but in terms of how best to do that, we might not be as close to the complexities as the Government in that regard.</p></speech>

I want to return to the banking sector.  A number of weeks ago we had a debate in the D&aacute;il about current events in the banking sector and the Minister for Finance stated that he considered it very unlikely that another pillar bank would enter the market in Ireland.  Would Dr. Cassidy agree with that?</p></speech>

I do not mean to evade the question.  I would say there is less competition in the Irish retail banking sector than there is in most other European countries.</p><p>That has implications and banking is seen as an inherently national activity.  It would be useful if the completion of a banking union allowed for a more European financial sector development.  Currently we have a highly concentrated banking system with implications for choice.</p></speech>

That would allow the same sort of cross-border choices with the provision of financial services that exist in more regular services.  There is still a way to go.  Banking, for whatever reason, is still a national activity.  We are certainly not the only country in Europe with long-term issues relating to the banking system across Europe.  For many countries there is "over-banking" and there is a need for consolidation of the banking system.  For many countries, including Ireland, the profitability environment has been very challenging.</p></speech>

The European Central Bank and Single Supervisory Mechanism supervises the large banks in Ireland, including the Bank of Ireland and AIB.  That already exists.  There is not the same level of provision of services at a European level that exists for other services.  To have a complete economic, monetary and financial union, there is further room to remove barriers across the EU in a way that would be prudent.  A framework exists with the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the European Central Bank but there are other parts of the banking union that will be developed in the coming years.</p></speech>

Dr. Cassidy spoke to another Deputy about the cost of housing, house prices in general and the role of the Central Bank.  He stated the role of the Central Bank would be to look at the cost of mortgages and he referenced the fact that house prices are such an extraordinary multiple of the average income of most households.  Would the cost of land, transactions, hoarding or speculation also be the business of the Central Bank?  Has the Central Bank reviewed the economic mechanisms that would or might impact land transactions or speculation?</p></speech>

We are interested from both a financial stability perspective to ensure the overall system remains stable and from a consumer protection aspect in ensuring consumers have full information and transparency about mortgages they are receiving.  It is those areas rather than the cost of mortgages that we deal with.  We provide information on the cost of mortgages but we do not involve ourselves in those pricing decisions.</p> <p>  With regard to the housing market, our role is consistent with the financial stability mandate in ensuring the dynamics in the mortgage market are not inconsistent with stability.  That is why we think our mortgage measures are critical first in ensuring the resilience of borrowers and lenders and in preventing the type of unstable price-credit dynamic I spoke of earlier that can arise in the housing and mortgage market.  That is our main responsibility with the mortgage market.  We also have a mandate in the provision of economic analysis and commentary and in that regard we are interested in broader housing market dynamics.</p></speech>

I am speaking specifically about land transactions.  The witnesses have indicated they have a mandate to consider the financial stability of the finance sector in general.  After the past decade and a half we can all say that land speculation has given rise to financial instability for this nation.  It has had a considerable impact, and it affects borrowers, lenders and the price-credit dynamic.  Does the Central Bank have a particular role in that?</p></speech>

Following on from our meeting with D&oacute;chas and others last October regarding the implementation of the UN's sustainable development goals, SDGs, it is timely and right that we have the opportunity today to discuss SDG 5, achieving gender equality.  On behalf of the committee, I am very pleased to welcome: Ms Mary Van Lieshout, deputy CEO of GOAL; Ms Karol Balfe, head of tackling violence and building peace at Christian Aid Ireland; Ms Maeve Taylor, director of advocacy and communications of the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA; Ms Louise Winstanley of ABColombia; and Ms Suzanne Keatinge, CEO, and Ms Louise Finan, head of policy, of D&oacute;chas.  I particularly welcome Ms Muna Abbas, country director with Plan International, who joins us from Jordan.</p> <p>  I begin with a brief word on our format in terms of privilege and process.  Witnesses and guests are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as in any way adverse or damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, speakers will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  I am sure there will be no need to make any such direction and, if there is, that it will be complied with immediately.  For any of our witnesses who are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, which I understand is all of them, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as would a witness who is physically present.  Guests participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are further advised to be mindful of domestic law and how it might apply to any evidence given or tendered.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  I draw it to the attention of anyone watching this meeting online that some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting in a remote format.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everybody exercise forbearance in the event of any technical issues that may arise and interfere with proceedings.</p> <p>  I call on Ms Van Lieshout to give her opening remarks and introduce us to the other witnesses, who may then give their opening remarks.  After that, we will proceed to observations and questions from committee members.  I ask members and guests to be mindful that we must bring our proceedings to a conclusion within a period of two hours from when the meeting started, in accordance with Covid regulations.  Ms Van Lieshout has the floor and she is very welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Van Lieshout" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021032300002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity for members of D&oacute;chas, the Irish network of international, development and humanitarian organisations, to brief members on the impact the Covid-19 crisis has had on progress towards gender equality globally.  The last time a representative of D&oacute;chas appeared before the committee, in October 2020, there was a discussion on the implementation of the sustainable development goals, both in Ireland and overseas.  SDG 5, achieving gender equality, means we commit to ending all forms of discrimination, violence and harmful practices against women and girls everywhere.  It means recognising the value of unpaid care and domestic work.  It means ensuring women's full and effective participation, and equal opportunities for leadership, at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life.  It means ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health, reproductive rights and economic rights and resources.  Above all, SDG 5 means that governments must adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls at all levels.</p> <p>  I am particularly pleased to be appearing before the committee this month as it coincides with a number of global events on gender equality.  The 65th sessions of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the UN's largest annual gathering on gender equality and women's empowerment, is taking place currently.</p><p>The Generation Equality Forum, organised by UN women and co-hosted by France and Mexico, will begin at the end of March having been delayed by a year because of Covid-19.  It is timely also that we discuss this issue today as the Citizens' Assembly in Ireland resumes its work exploring recommendations to advance gender equality.  Our efforts at home are inextricably linked with efforts at the EU, regionally and internationally to ensure women's rights.</p><p> It is more than 25 years since the landmark Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action were agreed at the Fourth World Conference on Women when 189 states, including Ireland, declared their determination to advance the goals of equality, development and peace for all women everywhere in the interest of all humanity.  Since then, we know that progress on gender equality has seen some positive steps forward but progress has been all too slow.  Not a single country today can claim to have achieved gender equality, nor can any country claim to be one where women feel completely safe on our streets, as the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard while walking home in London demonstrates.  This must change.</p><p> Today, however, we wish to focus on the specific impacts Covid-19 has had on women and girls across the world and we ask this committee to become a champion for them.  The UN Secretary General, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, recently said that gender equality was the world's biggest human rights scourge and the Covid-19 crisis has a woman&rsquo;s face.  He said, &ldquo;Violence against women and girls in all forms has skyrocketed, from online abuse to domestic violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation and child marriage.&rdquo;</p><p> Goal is very conscious of the impact of Covid-19 on achieving gender equality and our teams are seeing first-hand how violence against women and girls in all forms has escalated.  In response, we are integrating gender-based violence and child protection messaging into our Covid-19 awareness campaigns.  In Zimbabwe, for example, Goal is including gender-based violence, GBV, protection messaging into its Covid-19 campaign, which to date has reached 2.8 million people.  We know also that women's jobs are two times more vulnerable than men's and, indeed, we are currently seeing large volumes of women leaving the workforce as a result of the pandemic.</p><p> To speak to these issues in more detail, I am delighted to be accompanied today by colleagues from Plan International in Jordan, Christian Aid Ireland's partner, ABColombia, and the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPS, who will speak of the impact of the pandemic on girls' education, displacement, conflict and reproductive health.  What each theme has in common is that there must be a renewed urgency to finding gender transformative policy responses that not only build back better, but in a more equal way.  We need to ensure that Ireland, in every facet of its foreign policy, positions gender equality at the centre of its approach towards a healthy and peaceful world.  In effect, Ireland must develop on goal 5 of the sustainable development goals by 2030.</p><p> Today we have four specific asks of the committee.  Our first ask is that the committee assists us in ensuring there is a more robust tracking of Ireland's progress in furthering the SDG agenda in its partner countries and internationally, including tracking data on marginalised groups which include women and girls and people living with disabilities.</p><p> We ask the committee also to support the EU's Gender Action Plan and call on the Irish Government to swiftly operationalise it, including the commitment to allocate 85% of overseas development aid, ODA, to programmes which have gender equality as their principle objective, and to support the implementation of a gender responsive recovery plan from Covid-19.</p><p> Third, we ask that the committee support Ireland's international commitment in its A Better World policy to addressing girls' education as a priority.  We need a clear roadmap that outlines how Irish Aid intends to commit to and spend at least &euro;250 million over five years on global education.</p><p> Finally, we ask the committee to work with the Irish Government to ensure it uses its voice on the UN Security Council to encourage all countries to fully implement the commitments in the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, better known as CEDAW.</p><p> Ireland has been a champion for women, peace and security and we want to see that champion work on gender equality more broadly.  I thank the committee for its support for these asks.  I will now hand over to Ms Muna Abbas, head of mission and country director with Plan International in Jordan, who will speak to the committee about the situation in Jordan with respect to girls' education, Covid-19 and displacement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.321" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Muna Abbas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021032300002#B00200"><p>I thank Ms Van Lieshout.  I thank the Chairman and respected committee members.  It is my pleasure to be with the committee this morning.</p> <p>  While the Syrian crisis marks its tenth year this month, 40% of children under the age of 18 are registered as refugees.  Jordan and Lebanon, as neighbouring countries, host the highest percentage of refugees globally when compared to the local population.  Both Jordan and Lebanon are countries with limited resources where governments have already been struggling to respond to the needs of their own citizens, a situation that puts these countries at high risk of instability.</p> <p>  In Jordan, for example, 90,000 Syrian refugee children were reported to be out of school in 2019.  This number is expected to be dramatically increased during the pandemic as the Government has closed schools and other learning spaces in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus.</p> <p>  In such a complex context, girls are the most affected as they can be subjected to gender-based violence, including early marriage.  When we say, "early marriage", we mean marriage under the age of 18.  Eventually, they are deprived of their right to education while also not having access to vital services for protection, nutrition, health and well-being.  Before the conflict, 13% of Syrian women aged between 20 to 35 were married before the age of 18.  Now, among Syrian refugees living in Jordan, rates have risen to as high as 29%. </p> <p>  In assessments conducted by Plan International in Jordan jointly with the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, to assess the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown on girls, results show that adolescent girls have high household burdens and fewer positive outlets.  Girls are busier doing household chores as well as taking care of younger children and helping them with their studies.  All this means less time for adolescent girls to focus on their own education.</p> <p>  The gender digital divide whereby girls have reduced access to information and communication technology translates into reduced learning opportunities during school closures.  For example, the average cost for Internet services per household in Jordan is approximately $50 per month, which most families cannot afford, especially during the pandemic and lockdown and particularly among Syrian refugee families.  Girls also reported that they have less access to tech devices such as mobile telephones, tablets and computers compared with boys in the same family.</p> <p>  With the support of Irish Aid and other donors, over the past four years we were able to support thousands of Syrians and vulnerable Jordanian children, mainly girls, to access educational opportunities.  During the pandemic last year, hundreds of girls were supported to attend online classes by providing them with electronic devices and Internet connectivity.</p> <p>  The needs are huge and they are still here.  An entire generation is at risk.  We know we can help and how we can do so.  We believe that together we can make a difference to those children's lives.  I thank the committee.  I will hand over to Ms Winstanly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Winstanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021032300002#B00300"><p>Agenda 2030 for the UN sustainable development goals recognises that development cannot be achieved without addressing violent conflict and building peace.  In 2016, more countries were experiencing violent conflict than at any other time in the previous 30 years.  Much of this violence is due to reoccurring and protracted conflicts.  ABColombia is a partner of Christian Aid Ireland.</p><p>For the next few minutes I will focus on Colombia.</p><p> Ireland has a long history of supporting peace in Colombia and this year it is particularly crucial.  November will mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the peace accord, which is currently in a very fragile state.  In 2020, there was a quadrupling of the number of victims of massacres and combat increased by 65% compared with the last year before the signing of the peace accord.  In January this year, over 11,000 people were forced to displace due to armed conflict as neo-paramilitary and other armed groups expanded their control over communities, territory and illicit economies.  Targeted killings have also resulted in over 400 human rights defenders and 261 former FARC combatants being killed since 2016.</p><p> The coronavirus pandemic has played into this context, particularly affecting women and aggravating inequality and poverty.  Women's participation in the labour market has fallen to the level of ten years ago as the pandemic hit the informal work in which women were engaged particularly hard.  Confinement as a measure against coronavirus has meant those threatening women human rights defenders have been easily able to locate them.  Many women defenders have been shot in or near their homes.  Domestic violence has increased, as have femicides.</p><p> The conflict has left many women as heads of household, widening the inequality gap, and sexual and gender violence has been perpetrated as a weapon of war.  One of the unique features of the Colombian peace accord is that it wove into all the agreements specific gender provisions.  These gender provisions have the potential for structural change by reducing gender inequalities and furthering the rights of rural women, which is why when considering gender, peace and development in Colombia, the peace accord in an important roadmap not only for peace building but also for good governance policies.</p><p> Comprehensive implementation of these programmes would contribute to gender empowerment and equality.  However, for the peace accord to be implemented, it is essential to address the escalating violence by near-paramilitary and other criminal groups.  These groups will only effectively be dismantled if the intellectual authors are identified and prosecuted and their sources of finance and political protection are cut off.  Ireland, with its position on the UN Security Council, should call for that body to establish an independent group or panel of experts on organised crime to examine the position in Colombia.  A technical report from an independent group of experts would strengthen the work of the UN mission of verification to Colombia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, both of which have security guarantees within their mandates.  Such a report would also assist Colombia in the design and implementation of a public policy to facilitate the identification and prosecution of the intellectual authors and a dismantling of these groups.</p><p> Colombia is a country which, compared with many other complex cases of conflict around the world, has a real possibility of achieving peace.  It needs a country like Ireland to throw its weight and experience behind achieving the appointment of UN Security Council group of experts on organised crime that can offer the technical expertise that Colombia needs now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.324" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021032300002#C00200"><p>Good morning and I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I will specifically address the question of sexual and reproductive health rights as an aspect of gender equality.  The Irish Family Planning Association is the secretariat to the all-party Oireachtas interest group on sexual and reproductive health and the Irish collaborating partner of the UN Population Fund, UNFPA.  It is also a member of the International Planned Parenthood Federation.</p> <p>  I will start with A Better World, Ireland's policy for international development, which is grounded, as members know, in human rights and the sustainable development goals.  It recognises sexual and reproductive health rights as central to gender equality and universal health coverage.  A Better World commits Ireland to advancing and protecting the programme of action of the International Conference on Population and Development, including action on sexual and reproductive health.  According to A Better World, access to health services, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, is fundamental to realising sexual and reproductive health rights and for transforming women's health outcomes.  The pandemic has had a devastating impact on women's and girls' access to basic health services, including family planning.  I will concentrate on three aspects, which are sexual and reproductive health and rights, female genital mutilation and child marriage and access to contraception.</p> <p>  In 2020, in a policy brief on the impact of the pandemic on women, the UN Secretary General outlined the unique health needs of women and girls and also the social norms and gender stereotypes that act as barriers to services.  My colleagues have mentioned some of these.  According to the report, the diversion of attention and critical resources away from essential sexual and reproductive health services can result in exacerbated maternal mortality and morbidity, increased rates of adolescent pregnancies, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases.</p> <p>  Last November, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brophy, launched the 2020 State of World Population report, which is published each year by UNFPA, the UN sexual and reproductive health agency.  The report estimated the impact of the pandemic on girls and according to the report, programmes designed to promote gender equality by ending practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation are facing serious delays in implementation.</p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Abbas, has already raised the question of child marriage.  According to the UNFPA, at a conservative estimate, a one-year average delay in interventions to end child marriage could lead to over 7 million more child marriages over the next decade that could otherwise have been averted.  In addition, the State of World Population report projected that financial insecurities caused by the pandemic could result in 5.6 million additional child marriages taking place between 2020 and 2030.  The total effect of Covid-19 could therefore potentially result in 13 million additional child marriages that would not otherwise have happened.</p> <p>  On the question of female genital mutilation, the UNFPA predicts an estimated two-year delay in prevention programmes would lead to 2 million cases of female genital mutilation over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted.  In that respect progress towards the elimination of female genital mutilation, which is target 5.5 of the sustainable development goals, could be reduced by a third.</p> <p>  The UNFPA also conducted analysis in 115 low and middle income countries in January this year.  The research suggests that while many countries were able to maintain or restore access to essential services, an estimated 12 million women may have been unable to access family planning services during the pandemic, with disruption of supplies and services lasting an average of 3.6 months.  As a result of these disruptions, as many as 1.4 million unintended pregnancies may have occurred before women were able to resume use of these services.</p> <p>  The forthcoming session of the Commission on Population and Development, which will be in April 2021, will focus on the impact of Covid-19 on sexual and reproductive health in the context of population, food security, nutrition and sustainable development.  These are the four key principles of Irish Aid's programme.  In advance of the commission, the UN Secretary General has called for coverage of sexual and reproductive healthcare to be prioritised as integral to sustainable development.  He has highlighted the need for family planning, emergency contraception, the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, post-abortion care and, where legal, safe abortion services to the full extent of the law.</p> <p>   Female genital mutilation, child marriage and unintended pregnancy have a devastating impact on girls, affecting physical and mental health, their ability to stay in education, the capacity to reach full potential as women, citizens, workers and leaders.  Investment in sexual and reproductive health will have transformative effects on gender equality and women's empowerment.  This includes programmes that support the right of women and couples to choose the number and spacing of any children they opt to have.  We can reduce unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion through the provision of comprehensive sexuality education, contraception and safe and legal abortion care.  However, UNFPA, in its 2020 pandemic response plan, identified a funding gap of approximately US$276 million that would be required to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of those in humanitarian, fragile and development contexts.</p><p>Ireland is a consistent supporter of the UNFPA, which oversees implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD, agenda.  Ireland contributes core funding of approximately &euro;3.5 million a year.  Ireland supports reproductive health initiatives through its bilateral programme and is highly regarded by its partners for a strategic approach that sees gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights as indispensable to sustainable development.  This support must be maintained, expanded and increased if efforts to build forward better are to meaningfully address gender equality.</p></speech>

They are very much appreciated.  They contained some useful information but also some stark and worrying statistics and information.  I appreciate the opportunity to engage with the witnesses and to ask questions.  I agree totally with the comment that gender inequality is one of the world's greatest human rights scourges.  That is a very important point to make at this stage and a very important starting point for us all.  It is important to address the human rights scourge that is gender inequality.  We see human rights as the bedrock of everything we do and everything we should do, but we also see how human rights defenders across the world, particularly women human rights defenders, are targeted and imprisoned.  I have addressed this issue on many occasions.  In countries such as Saudi Arabia, female human rights defenders are imprisoned for doing such basic things as applying for a job within the UN.  These are big issues that we need to get on top of if we are serious about addressing human rights abuses.</p> <p>  Covid has shown up many difficulties and highlighted many areas in which gender inequality is rife.  It is has also highlighted other challenges with regard to domestic violence.  This has, of course, been with us for far too long but it has become more prevalent over the past year or so.  I have engaged with a number of organisations that deal with domestic violence in Ireland.  Only last week, I met a group in my constituency of Wicklow: Bray Women's Refuge.  Those I met with unfortunately painted a very stark picture with regard to how bad the problem has become over the past year.  We have such supports in our country, although unfortunately not at the level needed, but I can only imagine how women must feel in less well off, developing countries where there are not such supports.</p> <p>  Ireland has done a great deal to address the issues of inequality and gender inequality but we are not doing enough with regard to the SDGs, particularly the fifth goal, which concerns gender inequality.  I believe we are ranked tenth in the statistics for 2020, which shows that we have a long way to go if Ireland is to be in a position to say we are doing everything we can.  In its report, Social Justice Ireland states that Ireland needs to do much more to accelerate progress in this regard within our country.</p> <p>  With regard to the four asks the witnesses have made, the first is to ensure more robust tracking of Ireland's progress in furthering the sustainable development agenda.  Will they elaborate in that regard?  </p> <p>  Another area in which I am very interested is Colombia.  I welcome the report on Colombia.  Other committee members and I have raised the matter of the serious issues within that country.  It is interesting to see how the situation is impacting on women in Colombia in particular.  I have made reference to certain statistics previously with regard to human rights defenders, including former members of Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, and other community activists, who have been targeted since 2016.  This is a very useful report of which we, as committee members, should take heed and feed into our deliberations as we engage with some of the organisations that are also on the ground in Colombia and the Colombian ambassador to Ireland in the coming while.  We have also asked for an engagement with Eamon Gilmore, who has played a very important role in the peace process in Colombia.  The report is very welcome, albeit very stark.  It shows that more than 400 human rights defenders have been murdered since the peace process commenced.</p> <p>  The issues in Jordan are again very stark.  This committee did some important work last week in marking the grim fact of the tenth year of conflict within Syria and the human impact this has had with regard to displaced people in Jordan and other neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon.  It is really important to see the impact this conflict is having with regard to education and gender inequality.  I appreciate that.</p> <p>  I have one final point to make.  It has regard to Covid, which has had a very serious impact globally.  Some of the statistics as to how it has unfortunately impacted more on women are very grim and very stark.  Again, this committee did some important work on the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine to developing countries.  We had some excellent contributors to our deliberations, including Dr. David Nabarro, Dr. Kieran Harkin and a number of other important people, who painted a  grim picture as to the inequality in the roll-out of vaccines.  Some stark information as to price was given.  Some pharmaceutical companies are making massive profits from the vaccines.  There is inequality involved.  For example, a dose of one of the vaccines costs &euro;2.50 in Europe but &euro;5.80 is charged in Uganda for the same dose.  One of the major calls made by all of those people with which we engaged, which was reflected in one of the key findings of the report the committee published, was that while COVAX is important in the roll-out of the vaccine to developing countries, the Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, is also important.</p><p>The latter is a platform that has been created to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, know-how and cell lines related to Covid-19 vaccines.  It is a voluntary scheme which would allow countries and pharmaceutical companies to develop the vaccine and roll it out.  I firmly believe there should be no profit made on the pandemic.  That was one of the key findings of the committee.  Have people on the ground in our guests' organisations looked at C-TAP in the context of the roll-out of Covid vaccines and the obvious disproportionate impact Covid is having on women across the world?  Another key finding of the committee was to call on the Government to sign up to C-TAP and encourage pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily sign up to it to share those intellectual rights such that all people, particularly those in less developed countries, can access the vaccine.</p><p> I again thank our guests for their contributions and for engaging with the committee.  I full support each of the four asks.</p></speech>

It is never easy to hear gender equality being spoken about at such length and its impact in the context of such a wide array of issues, but it exists and we cannot continue to hide from that existence because we will never have true human rights while gender inequality remains.  I have heard Covid-19 being referred to as a universal leveller.  However, it has not been a universal leveller.  Research has shown that women across the globe have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic compared with men.  One of the fundamental reasons for that is the gender inequalities that existed before Covid ever became a thing.  These gender inequalities are wide ranging.  There is the gender pay gap, the responsibility for family and childcare, the fact that front-line staff in some areas are predominantly female, but also the inadequate supports that were in place.</p> <p>  A recent piece of work by the European Institute for Gender Equality was quite startling.  It found that 4.5% of women's employment is at risk across the globe because of the pandemic, compared with 3.8% of men's employment.  Women make up 40% of the global labour force yet account for 54% of job losses to date.  Workers in industries such as retail, hospitality and residential care are predominantly women and those are the areas that have suffered the heaviest job losses to date.  Women make up the bulk of the workforce in those sectors and 40% of all jobs lost by women during the crisis were in these professions.</p> <p>  A report published last summer by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company described how women globally have been 1.8 times as likely as men to lose their jobs because of the pandemic.  It reported that societal attitudes have also shaped how women experience the economic fallout, based on their perceived place in society.  Despite the resurgence in employment during the summer months last year, men regained employment at twice the rate that women did, indicating that the economic impact of the pandemic will be felt much longer and harder by women compared with men.</p> <p>  When Ireland first went into lockdown last March, the caring responsibility was compounded in many ways by the efforts of some to be more accommodating of women.  For example, as a result of the gender pay gap, women's work often took less of a priority compared with men's work.  Employers were more understanding that women also had caring roles but, as a result of that and the priority that was given to male partners, women actually ended up working considerably longer hours every day just to meet those ever-increasing demands being made of them.  The National Women's Council of Ireland published a really good report on the impact on women's mental health and well-being of carrying the lion's share of the load in terms of work and caring in the home.</p> <p>  On the gender-based violence aspect, in three months last year there was a 40% increase in the number of applications for protection and barring orders compared with the same period the previous year.  The figures are stark.  There were 1,300 requests for refuge in domestic violence services that could not be met.   That is eight people per day whose requests for refuge went unanswered.</p> <p>  When we look at the future and coming out of Covid - we will come out of Covid at some point - there is no doubt that although women have been the hardest hit by the pandemic, they will also be the backbone of the recovery in their communities, circles and environments.  For that to happen, women's inclusion, representation, rights, social and economic outcomes, equality and protection must be at the core of national and global responses.  Financial stimulus packages and social assistance programmes must be based on greater equality, opportunities and social protection for women.  We must not allow Covid to be used as an excuse to reverse the little progress on gender equality that has been made.  Rather, it should become the catalyst to create something new that focuses on these pre-existing conditions and says "No more".  While the eyes of governments nationally and internationally are on these inequalities, there will never be a better time to address them or to implement policies that go to the core of what created the inequalities in the first place.  Covid simply shone a light on the extent of the inequalities that exist, inequalities that were there in my mother's time, my grandmother's time and my great-grandmother's time.  That is what I think needs to happen now.  When we look to the future and policies, we need to look to training, education and employment opportunities for women, the protection of activists and political representation.</p> <p>  On the issue of women's health, more than 30,000 women in Ireland alone are currently awaiting a gynaecological appointment.  When that is coupled with the waiting lists for BreastCheck and cervical cancer screening, we are looking at a potential perfect storm in terms of women's health in Ireland.  That is before looking elsewhere in Europe or across the globe where the disproportionate effect of conflict and other gender-based violence will have an even more profound effect.</p> <p>  What is needed now more than ever is that not only are women at the table in terms of future development, but that their voices are actually heard at that table.  I agree with our guests that tracking progress is absolutely vital because if it is not in place, plans become words on pages.  Without targets, focus and key performance indicators, gender equality will remain out of reach for future generations because there will not be any meaningful planned progress written down to be achieved.  I am sorry if all that comes across as a bit of a rant.  I fundamentally agree with the vast majority of what the representatives have stated.  In terms of tracking progress on gender equality, what would they like to see achieved in the next 18 months, three years and five years?  What is the best course of action for us to prioritise in the short term and the medium term?</p></speech>

A considerable number of issues have been raised by Deputies Brady and Clarke.  Deputy Clarke mentioned the vital issue of gender-based violence.  As Chair of this committee, I express regret and concern at developments in Turkey where the Turkish Government has unilaterally withdrawn from the Istanbul Convention.  That is a most retrograde step and I hope it will be the subject of a rethink at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

I will introduce some other colleagues who are joining us today.  Ms Suzanne Keatinge is the director of D&oacute;chas, and she will speak to the questions from both Deputies on the important tracking of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, and how D&oacute;chas is leading and contributing to that process.  I am also going to look to my colleague, Ms Louise Finan from D&oacute;chas, to take Deputy Brady's question on vaccine equity, because D&oacute;chas has been spearheading initiatives in that regard on behalf of the sector.  I am going to invite my colleague, Ms Karol Balfe from Christian Aid, to speak to Deputy Brady's concerns and some of the points he has raised on the protection of human rights defenders, a matter on which we all share a deep concern.  Karol Balfe will speak to some of Christian Aid's experience in that regard.  I first invite in Suzanne Keatinge.</p></speech>

The Deputies asked about SDGs.  I am grateful to the committee for looking for practical actions in terms of what it can do.  It is important to say that Ireland should have been looking at a review of the national implementation plan last year and it did not happen.  We really need to see new energy on that to make sure we are tracking what we are doing and not doing.  That applies not only in Ireland but to our programme countries.  Perhaps it is an appropriate proposal to this committee that we pay particular attention to SDG 5, based on this conversation.  I loved what Deputy Clarke said about letting women be a catalyst for something new.  Perhaps that should be our way of championing this issue.</p> <p>  We have a great international development policy and, at the heart of it, Irish Aid stated it wants to think about what leaving no one behind and reaching the furthest behind first actually means.  That has to be about women and girls.  We have not yet heard what that guidance looks like and what specifically they are going to do to make sure the policy really does make sure no one is left behind.  I urge the committee to ask questions around this policy to make sure it is very clear and that they are prioritising the right things.</p></speech>

I want to follow up on what Ms Keatinge has said about tracking, monitoring and the A Better World policy.  It is an excellent policy and, from an IFPA perspective, one of the things we were happy to see was a very strong grounding of human rights and gender equality in that policy, with respect for sexual and reproductive health and rights in a way we had not seen previously in Irish Aid or Ireland's policy.</p> <p>  I spoke yesterday to a colleague in Ethiopia who was wholehearted in her respect for the way Irish Aid has integrated policy approaches, good critical analysis and brought sexual and reproductive health and rights into its work on sustainable development as a core aspect.  However, we need to see more.  As Ms Keatinge said, we have not seen the guidance yet and one of the promises of A Better World was a new sexual and reproductive health and rights initiative.  This is something that will give guidance and allow us a framework for accountability and monitoring and for critical engagement with Irish Aid to know how Ireland is pushing forward its strong and respected objectives around gender equality in the context of sexual and reproductive health and rights.  In the context of tracking, the publication and production of that initiative would be an extremely important way forward.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for endorsing the cause of the people's alliance for vaccine equity.  We were delighted to see the committee's recent report and support its calls.</p> <p>  The key point to note is that, globally, over 70% of the healthcare workforce are women.  A fact that is quite shocking is those women often face violence in performing their roles and there is a risk that is amplified over access to the finite resources of a Covid-19 vaccine.  The safety and security of those delivering Covid-19 vaccines must also be of utmost priority.  Other health crises have shown that delivery and facilitation of vaccines will depend disproportionately on the unpaid labour of women and girls and this will impact especially on the poorest and those in rural areas.  We know providing equitable access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines in low and middle-income countries will be a catastrophic moral failure if we do not do it.  It will impede progress towards ending this pandemic.  It will compound and deepen the setback to girls' and women's rights, leaving them further behind.  We are part of a network of organisations calling for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines.  We strongly endorse the calls this committee has made and will happily provide any further information.</p></speech>

It is an important issue in many countries across the globe.  Front Line Defenders highlighted in 2020 that 333 human rights defenders were killed doing their work.  That is a very shocking figure.  These are the people who are often at the coalface of injustice.  They are often the ones who are working with communities, deeply embedded with them, fighting for issues such as gender equality, peace and human rights.  They are experiencing the most brutal forms of retaliation by being killed for the work they do.  I thank the Deputy for highlighting that important issue.</p> <p>  These matters arise in the broader context of global restrictions on civil society spaces.  Attacks on human rights defenders are not happening in isolation but are a part of a broader trend whereby states are bringing in increasingly restrictive and oppressive legislation and policy to restrict civil society's work more broadly.  Civicus has classified that in the past couple of years, 111 countries have brought in such restrictive legislation.  According to its categorisation, only 3.4% of the globe live in fully open civil society spaces.  That is a shocking fact to take back and consider in the context of how we see these issues.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has, of course, only made the situation worse because emergency powers have been introduced in a number of countries.  States have, unfortunately, used those emergency powers to restrict further the work of human rights defenders and civil society.  It is also important to highlight that there are gendered aspects to attacks on human rights defenders.  All human rights defenders experience particular attacks, but women experience different types of attacks because of the work that they do with communities and challenging social norms around gender inequality.</p><p>As well as the physical threats and killings that they face alongside male human rights defenders, they also face slurs about their name, stigmatisation, discrimination, sexual assault and sexual violence because of the work they do.  It is very important to note that these attacks, much like other levels of gender-based violence, can increase during conflict situations, so it is an important area.</p><p> In regard to what Ireland can do, I have been a champion of this around the civil society space and that has been very welcome through the various UN resolutions and initiatives that it has pushed there.  There is an opportunity with the ongoing membership of the UN Security Council because, in the Security Council, we are not seeing civil society systematically included and shaping the policies that have a huge and detrimental impact on their lives.  There is a very important way that Ireland can bring civil society and human rights defenders into the Security Council space.  Major decisions are being made about military responses in countries without consulting those human rights defenders and civil society actors.  One important thing they need to consider when doing that is that they factor in reprisals against human rights defenders who engage with the Security Council, and that they engage fully with UN guidelines on this to make sure human rights defenders do not experience further threats and attacks because of that advocacy.</p></speech>

It has been a very enlightening and provocative session.  I would like to hone in on a few areas.  The global point is that Covid has seriously exacerbated an already existing gender inequality.  I will deal first with women's participation in the workplace.  It is very clear that women are the greatest victims of displacement as the kind of jobs they are in, outside the front-line healthcare area, tend to be less well-paid and there is an in-built discrimination in areas like hospitality, which are the areas that have lost out.  Women have been displaced in employment right across the world, no less here than elsewhere.  It is a huge issue.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on what can be done.  There are two areas, the developing world and areas of conflict, and the more developed world, and the challenge is obviously greater in the former.  What would their comments be about retraining, education and long-term education?  There will be an issue.  One need not be an expert in economics to assume that quite a few of these jobs will not return in the medium term, so we will have a deficit and a spin-off.  Therefore, there is a need for retraining, for re-education and for new opportunities.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment around this, in particular how we might label our overseas development aid and demand that kind of thing in the developing world.  Can we also be in any way prescriptive in our own area?  Overall, women's participation in the workplace is a key issue.</p><p>Second, as all in this forum know, education is very important.  The witnesses gave us a very stark figure that 90,000 young female Syrian refugees did not participate in school or education last year.  That is a shocking statistic but I know it is only indicative and that it is repeated elsewhere.  I am inclined to be solutions-focused and we want to be solutions-focused in the way we do our committee work in that we want to make recommendations and ultimately effect change.  There is no difficulty or disagreement between us around the aims, objectives or ambitions and we are <i>ad idem</i>on that.  It is a question of how to resolve it.  Do the witnesses have suggestions as to how we could re-focus our overseas aid, make new demands or apply new criteria?  Is there much we can actively do to correct a wrong such as that cited in Jordan, and I know such wrongs are repeated all over the place?  Education is a huge issue.</p><p>I want to turn to the issue of domestic violence.  We are all getting anecdotal evidence around domestic violence.  It is a horrendous crime and a wrong that is with us perpetually, but it is clearly exacerbated by the Covid situation, with people being at home together and all that goes with that.  It is a real issue.  Without seeking to be parochial, in my own county, in Cavan town, we need a women's refuge.  The ideal would be that we did not need these things in the first instance but, sadly, we do.  We do not have one there and the nearest women's refuge is in Dundalk, so even in the developed western world, there is a clear need to tackle this question head-on.  When I attend policing committees, as all Oireachtas Members do at a local level, I am constantly getting statistics regarding an increase in domestic violence.  If it is bad here, it is clearly worse in many of the areas the witnesses are dealing with.  I am not sure if the witnesses can be prescriptive in this area as to what we might do.  We must unequivocally condemn this and we must be of one voice on that, needless to say.  However, how can we practically impact on the situation?  We can feel powerless in the face of such a global phenomena.</p><p>On another issue, the Chairman will be aware I have been raising this in other forums outside this committee, and it was raised earlier by Deputy Brady, so it has been addressed and I do not wish to labour it.  It is the issue of vaccine equality, which is a huge issue that links to the whole issue of gender inequality and to every other question, in particular the addressing of the Covid variants.  I support the concerns around that and I agree our Government should be out there on that.  As a committee, we have been very clear and prescriptive about that.  As a committee, we need to be very focused on getting some sort of outcomes from our work because there is not much point in having weekly meetings where we are platitudinous if we do not effect some outcomes, although it is a very amorphous kind of area.</p><p>It is a great discussion.  It is one of the tragic outcomes of Covid that it has exacerbated and set back progress on gender in quality.  We are witnessing the reversing of progress in health equality, gender equality and educational opportunity.  It is very sad that the entire equality agenda is a victim of Covid, on top of everything else.  Those are my thoughts.  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute.  Well done to our guests.</p></speech>

I was struck earlier by a comment of Ms Maeve Taylor when she spoke about the unacceptable practice of FGM, the direct adverse impact on the international targets for the elimination of FGM by 2030 and the fact Covid-19 is in a position to adversely affect these targets.  I know we have interim reviews of the performance of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, over the entire range of issues.  However, I wonder about the possibility or likelihood of putting something like FGM under the microscope and having a more urgent assessment of aspects of the SDGs, rather than await a full interim review.</p><p>Is there a possibility of an emergency look that would certainly ensure that these pretty stark changes to our targets could at least be mitigated if not entirely addressed?</p></speech>

However, I would not leave it to a short answer.  I will invite my colleagues to respond to some of the key points raised.  Muna Abbas will speak to the questions on retraining and education, Suzanne Keatinge will also respond and we will invite Maeve Taylor to talk about gender-based violence and to speak to the Chairman's question about FGM.</p></speech>

It is really hard to find accurate data and analyse that data.  We always face this problem when we try to analyse a certain problem or collect evidence.  The existing data shows that women are not participating in the workforce.  Jordan has one of the lowest rates globally in this area.  The unemployment rate for women in Jordan is very high and the employment rate for women is one of the lowest in the region and globally.  It is a complicated problem and we need to come up with comprehensive multidimensional solutions.  Education is part of it.  We need to redirect education to respond to market needs.  We also need to work on raising awareness among families and communities about the need to give more space to women to participate, to get out and to be engaged economically because many women report that they are not allowed to do so by family members, husbands or elderly people in the family.</p> <p>  It is also about enforcing laws and legislation that relate to workplace safety and safeguarding in the workplace.  For example, we do not have systems for reporting harassment in the workplace.  We cannot capture the data.  Women do not report it.  There is no system for reporting.  It is a complicated problem and we need to come up with comprehensive solutions.  Education is key.  We all know that it is life-changing and life-saving but we need to direct our education programmes to be responsive to market needs.  Covid gave us a lot of learning opportunities such as using technology and being connected on a national level to training courses and programmes women do not need to attend physically because transport is expensive and sometimes it is not safe to travel from one place to another.  Technology is giving us a lot of opportunity but so far, it has been underutilised.  It can be life-changing for women.</p></speech>

We know that next year, Ireland must offer its voluntary national review at the high-level political forum.  Is this another opportunity to say "Let's focus on this issue of gender"?</p> <p>  In response to the question from Deputy Clarke, it is really about what we should prioritise.  As we have seen here, there is no magic bullet nor is there any quick fix.  We know it is complicated and that a range of responses are needed.  If I dare attempt to think about how to prioritise over the next 18 months, a few things that have already been touched on come to mind.  First, we are in this Covid environment and the vaccine issue must be brought to the fore.  The phrase "We're in the same storm but different boats" is really important.  We know that unless we are all safe, nobody is safe.  As has already been said, the issue of vaccines is so important and we have to get it right now.</p> <p>  It is important to emphasise that in terms of Irish Aid and what Ireland is doing on the UN Security Council, it is championing the right things.  It does have these very good policies in place.  We also know that Frances Fitzgerald, MEP, is doing a great job at EU level around the gender action programme and really promoting those issues at EU level.  The problem is not lack of policies; it is lack of implementation.  This is what we really need to focus on.  It involves tracking and questioning of where the progress is and what the measurements are over time periods.  Let us not forget that with these policies, we also need to recommit to funding.  This involves funding of overseas development aid and funding around specific gender programmes if we are to implement these policies.</p> <p>  My third priority is collaboration on so many different levels.  In 2018 - perhaps some members of this committee were there - Ireland led an international caucus of female parliamentarians.  That was an amazing experience where we saw that learning from Ireland, America and Europe, but also from Africa.  It was so rich and important and will surely help us speed up some of these processes.  We have seen today that collaboration between NGOs, members of this committee and politicians.</p> <p>  The final issue I would prioritise is the need for us to keep collaborating in order to keep the conversation very live in the public space among the Irish population and globally through interactions like this one.  It involves really engaging at constituency level and getting engaged with the national conversation around gender equality.  These are four things I would prioritise.  I am sure there are more.  I will hand over to other colleagues.</p></speech>

When we look at the issues of girls in education, women in the workforce and issues like FGM and child marriage, I am prompted to think about some of the titles of United Nations Population Fund reports in recent years that have focused on girls at ten years of age and adolescent pregnancy.  In focusing on how we get women to the table, we must look back at the lives of girls and how we ensure girls can stay in education, are safe from gender-based violence and are not grappling with unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections such as HIV when they are adolescents but are able to plan their lives and futures.  One of the core issues is access to reproductive health services and information and sexuality education.  In 2019, we held a civil society dialogue in advance of the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development..</p><p>At a time when we used to be able to pack rooms with people and have them thronging around tables - it seems like a very long time ago now - at every single table there were individuals working on development issues and thematic issues relating to the LGBT community.  Those people included youth and health workers, and policy influencers.  At one point, everyone in the room was talking about sexuality education.  They were discussing issues such as their experience of poor sexuality education in Ireland as young people, their frustration about their children not having access to quality education in schools now or their understanding of the ways in which denial of sexuality education globally impacts on a girls' capacity to flourish.  Focusing in on those issues relating to girls and adolescents and how we build forward better and get women to the table is critical.</p></speech>

The constitutional court in Colombia said that it was a systematic practice.  Oxfam undertook two studies which show that between 2000 and 2009 there were 149 cases per day of sexual violence in armed conflict.  When it then did a follow-up study in 2010 to 2015, it found that there were 400 cases of sexual violence against women in conflicts each day.  What is worth noting here is that the second study showed that the increase occurred during peace talks.  We know definitely that sexual violence in conflict and domestic violence is a continuum between this kind of violence.  They are inextricably linked because of the kind of male attitudes which perpetrate this violence.</p> <p>  One of the things that the women particularly addressed during the peace talks and which they put firmly on the agenda was that there was a need in the transitional justice system to ensure that there were no amnesties for conflict-related sexual violence.  This is the first peace accord in the world which stated that there should be no amnesties.  One of the difficulties now is to completely ensure that there are no amnesties for conflict-related sexual violence.</p> <p>  One of the things that women are asking for in particular - this is really key at this moment because if the committee is going to visit Colombia, it is one of the asks that I would have - is that there be a discussion of the fact that there needs to be a national case in the transitional justice system on conflict-related sexual violence.  This would be essential if we are to really see that there are no amnesties and that the issue of sexual violence is taken very seriously.  If this does not happen, it is going to be very difficult to change male attitudes on violence towards women.  This is a key ask that I would like to put on the committee&rsquo;s agenda when it visits Colombia.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I have received apologies from Deputy Stanton who had to leave a moment ago.  Do any members wish to make further contributions at this stage?</p> <p>  Before returning to Ms Van Lieshout for closing comments, I want to acknowledge the work of D&oacute;chas and the importance of Irish Aid and its team in ensuring that its priorities are kept very much to the fore.  I also acknowledge the work that Ireland continues to do with the UN, notwithstanding our membership of the Security Council, but also in its hosting of recent meetings on the matter of girls' education and acknowledging the fact that during the pandemic alone, almost 20 million girls have been denied schooling and have left education.  There continue to be an enormous number, some 130 million girls, out of school worldwide, and I stress the importance of education.  I thank Ms Abbas for her focus, particularly on Jordan and Lebanon, having regard to the refugee situation there and the need to ensure that education standards are kept up.  She spoke about online education and courses and ensuring that they are of a certain standard that will allow for a situation where school accreditations are given and that education can be resumed at some stage in the future.</p> <p>  Unless our witnesses would like to come back in to comment further on any of those points, I will ask Ms Van Lieshout to proceed to her closing comments.  If any of her guests would like to prioritise issues for our committee after this meeting, we will obviously be in contact with our Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  We have been working, as Deputy Brady said, on the whole area of Covid-19 vaccine equity but our witnesses have raised a number of important issues this morning that we would be keen to continue to highlight across the wider civil society here in Ireland and to also ensure that the Government keeps these issues high on its agenda.</p></speech>

I also thank the Chairman for the generous offer to follow up on further requests on our behalf.</p> <p>  To summarise the conversation and to perhaps highlight and point the direction for some of those asks, I will invite Suzanne Keatinge, the director of D&oacute;chas, to conclude on behalf of the agencies represented here and of the D&oacute;chas membership.</p></speech>

In some very brief closing remarks, I want to thank the committee for giving us this chance to share with it some of these stories.  We are all very much on the same page in that we cannot afford to allow Covid-19 to get in the way of the urgent issue of gender equality.  As has been stated, Covid-19 has exacerbated and accelerated the trends.  There is a real urgency around this issue.</p> <p>  I also thank the D&oacute;chas members for sharing some of their stories and these very stark facts.  As Ms Taylor said, there have been 13 million more child marriages as a result of Covid-19 over a 12-month period, which is just extraordinary.  Ms Abbas said that there is an entire generation at risk in Jordan and in the Middle East in general because of a lack of education.  We know that many of those girls will not go back to education at all.  That potential of those women and girls is lost for an entire generation.</p> <p>  We also heard from Christian Aid about the impact of conflict.  I am aware that the committee had a session on Syria where the issue of gender-based violence and the use of women as weapons of war was very starkly put forward during those sessions.</p> <p>  We also heard that we cannot afford the luxury of being overwhelmed by this.  As Deputy Clarke said so well, we know that women are going to be the backbone of the recovery.  For that to happen, they need to be at the table and to be those leaders we have seen in our own communities.  We need to find the way and the space to bring them to the table and to hear their voices.</p> <p>  I will make one positive comment about the pandemic in that it has allowed the committee to be here this morning to hear different voices from the field and from the wide range of D&oacute;chas's NGOs, which I really appreciate.  Let us hope that we can keep doing that more.  The solution is going to come from these conversations by bringing different people together.  We can see that with that stronger collaboration, I genuinely believe that we can go faster and make that difference.</p> <p>  The outcome that I needed from the session today was to hear from the committee members that they will be our champions on gender equality, on the SDGs and on the importance of ODA and Irish Aid's work.</p><p>I hope the committee members will go away with some practical takeaways.  We are very open to exploring more and I reiterate the idea concerning the SDGs and the Spotlight report, and there being some more practical and specific things we can work on together.  We are happy to carry on that conversation.  I also refer to the informal session we had with the committee last week.  We ran out of time then, but I hope the members will agree that one of the key things we put on the table and one of the key policy asks of D&oacute;chas members was gender.  There were many more concerns, however, so I hope we will get the chance to work with the committee members in that regard.  </p><p> More importantly, I hope today the members got a sense of the important role that Irish NGOs are playing, as well as the important role of the diversity of the D&oacute;chas membership.  My team and I are here and available if the committee members have questions and if there are issues that they want to tackle more and bring such a conversation together.  We are grateful for this opportunity this morning and let us hope we can continue this partnership.</p><p> I thank the members of the committee and all the panellists at this morning's session.   </p></speech>

I also thank Ms Van Lieshout for co-ordinating this meeting.  I again express my appreciation to D&oacute;chas and all the agencies for the work they continue to do, especially since they are now doing that work in the context of a global pandemic.  It is clear from the contributions this morning, our engagement and the international reporting community that the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on women and girls is a matter of deep concern.  It is most worrying, whether those impacts are in the areas of health, education and-or food security and nutrition or in the context of gender-based violence.  The impact of Covid-19, while not yet fully assessed, is most stark, and that is why this committee felt our engagement this morning was so important.</p> <p>  I have no doubt that this is an issue that the members of this committee will be returning to, and I note the interest of Deputy Clarke and others.  I expect this subject will be on our agenda again as we move towards the summer and, hopefully, a clear pathway emerges regarding how the international community will be able to deal with the scourge of Covid-19.  This committee will continue to prioritise the implementation of our report, which was published within the last ten days, on ensuring an equitable distribution of vaccines throughout the world, especially in areas of considerable disadvantage and less development.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their engagement and for dealing with our queries.  I thank them even more for leaving us with several priority takeaways we will be keen to work on.</p></speech>

I am conscious that some members did not get to contribute at our previous meeting, but there should be plenty of opportunity for everyone to speak today.  I will try to be fair to everyone and rotate the contributions as we do at every meeting.  There will be ten minutes each for Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.  We will then return to Sinn F&eacute;in before moving to the Independents, including party leaders.  These will be Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and McNamara and Senators Mullen and Black, followed by the Green Party and the Labour Party.  If that is okay with everyone, we will proceed.  I will try to be as flexible and helpful as possible.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We have Professor Colin Harvey and Mr. Mark Bassett on the line.  We are meeting to continue our discussion on their paper, The EU and Irish Unity: Planning and Preparing for Constitutional Change in Ireland, and related topics.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome them to the meeting.</p> <p>  I must read out a note on privilege.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person or entity's good name.</p> <p>  We have Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett's document and had a long debate at our previous meeting, but I would be happy if they made brief opening statements, if they so wish.  We will then continue with questioning.</p></speech>

We appreciate the chance to follow up on our previous meeting.  We submitted a follow-up written response after that meeting and we hope that members found it helpful.  Today is an opportunity for us to talk through some of those responses and we would be happy to answer questions on those or related matters.</p> <p>  I will start by noting what members will have noted, that being, since our previous engagement with the committee, there have been further notable interventions in the discussion.  In fact, it seems that not a week goes by without another major intervention in this debate.  Members will be aware of last night's "Claire Byrne Live" programme on RT&Eacute; and the paper being launched today by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  There will be a shared island unit event this week and Ireland's Future is holding a major report launch on Thursday.  We have also seen further proposals emerge around a timeframe and even a suggested date for when it might happen.  In a sense, all of this underlines what we suggested at the previous meeting, that being, the momentum around this debate is remarkable.  However, it raises the question of where the debate will go next.</p> <p>  I will address two of the questions covered in our written response and my colleague, Mr. Bassett, will focus on the other two.  We hope that our written response will be made publicly available so that members of the public can read what we have written.</p> <p>  The first question we have addressed is that of how long the Northern Ireland institutions could or should continue after Irish reunification.  The Good Friday Agreement contemplates a transfer of sovereignty from the UK to Ireland, but it does not expressly address the precise form that a united Ireland would take.  The agreement and its values will shape that discussion alongside other existing obligations relating to continuity of protection.  There are clear provisions in the Good Friday Agreement that are forward facing and the committee is well aware of concerning rigorous impartiality and guarantees around identity, culture, citizenship and rights.  There should be no diminution of guarantees and protections as a consequence of a vote for a united Ireland.  There must be an equivalent level of protection in terms of guarantees, protections and rights in the event of a united Ireland.</p><p>We recognise the significance of shared institutions in the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland as one part of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those Northern Ireland institutions will remain in place unless and until an alternative arrangement is agreed.  We believe this is part of a larger, constitutional conversation that, as committee members know, is ongoing and intensifying at the moment, around the precise form a united Ireland will take with detailed questions around constitutional design.  For example, there are proposals at the moment for a citizens' assembly to focus on some of these and related questions.  That might be a helpful channel for this debate going forward.  Whatever happens in terms of the Northern legislature, executive and judiciary, the approach will need to be consistent with current constitutional arrangements in Ireland or any new constitution that emerges, as well as other relevant legal obligations.  We highlight the sense that this is part of an ongoing, larger conversation about constitutional design.  </p><p> Why focus on securing referendums when important work on reconciliation remains outstanding?  We are aware that this question often comes up and we felt it would be helpful to further clarify our response.  In our view, the work on reconciliation is absolutely essential.  The work is ongoing, and it must continue whatever the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  We take that as a basic starting point.  However, our view is that reconciliation, and debates around reconciliation and a shared future, are simply not assisted or advanced by avoiding hard questions about the constitutional future.  In other words, we do not help the cause of reconciliation by avoiding doing the necessary homework in advance of these referendums taking place. </p><p> We also do not think the current debate is assisted by making reconciliation a precondition to holding the referendums contemplated in the agreement.  In our view, this is not an either-or conversation.  The work of reconciliation will continue alongside the referendums anticipated in the agreement.  Arguably, in our view, making this an obstacle to progress breaches the express terms of the agreement, as does the recently mooted notion that these referendums can be categorically ruled out for an indefinite or set period of time.  That sort of language runs very close to being out of step with the express terms of the agreement.  </p><p> Echoing what we said in our first engagement, and welcoming the chance to follow up today, our strong advice to this committee is against reopening the express terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  Instead, our advice today, as in our first engagement, is that the collective focus must be on the good faith implementation of existing commitments and good faith adherence to the textual requirements of the agreement.</p><p> My colleague, Mr. Mark Bassett, will address the other questions in our follow-up response.  I thank the committee and look forward to the conversation.</p></speech>

One of the questions asked on the last occasion, which I did not get a chance to address in full, was what was meant by external impediment in the Good Friday Agreement.  In our written response, we said that at the core of the Good Friday Agreement and the constitutional arrangements in the UK and Ireland, is that Irish reunification is a question for the people of Ireland.  It requires a vote in support in each jurisdiction but there should be no external or outside impediment.  The report looked at the position of Irish membership of the European Union and came to the clear conclusion that membership of the European Union was not going to be an obstacle, nor was membership of the eurozone.  I always thought that the phrase external impediment typically referred to the Westminster Parliament.  It would not be open to a future British Parliament to disregard referendum votes in both the North and the South.</p> <p>  If one thinks back to previous Irish electorates voting for repeal, Home Rule or an Irish republic, it was dependent on winning support in the Westminster Parliament.  We say that is no longer the case.  There is still a very strong, traditional understanding of the sovereignty or supremacy of the Westminster Parliament in that it can legislate as it sees fit.  Any restrictions on that choice are self-imposed.  Examples are sometimes given that Westminster could legislate to prohibit smoking in Paris or to revoke the independence of colonies.  We say that the reference to "without external impediment" is a recognition by the UK that it would not be practical or realistic for a future UK Parliament to frustrate those votes.  </p> <p>  The other question we addressed in the subsequent written piece was whether or not it has to be a binary question when the referendums are posed in both the North and South.  Does it have to be either Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom or a reunified Ireland?  We say it is pretty clear in the Good Friday Agreement that this is the choice.  It is a binary choice.  Re-partition, independence, the accession of Northern Ireland to another state or indefinite joint authority between Britain and Ireland is not contemplated in the agreement.  If that was proposed, it would require a back to basics approach to the agreement and we think that would be an unwise move.</p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement has formidable democratic authority.  It was endorsed in referendums both North and South.  It has formidable legal and political backing.  There is bipartisan backing for it in the United States Congress.  It is a feature of the Irish Constitution and the UK's constitutional arrangements.  It is in the EU-UK withdrawal agreement and is a matter of EU law as well as the mechanism for self-determination and reunification.  We say that a referendum will be posed in those terms.  It will be a choice for Northern Ireland whether it wishes to join a united Ireland, which is a member of the European Union, or remain as part of the United Kingdom in the Northern Ireland protocol.  That is how we anticipate the vote will be formed.</p> <p>  That is enough from my opening statement, covering what we had written.  As Professor Harvey said, I look forward to continuing the discussion and answering any questions from committee members.</p></speech>

I will ask a couple of questions.  I am wearing a mask because I am deemed a vulnerable person for the purposes of this pandemic.</p> <p>  My question will be very clear.  I fully believe in the concept of Irish unity and a united Ireland.  I am starting from that premise, but will ask our witnesses devil's advocate questions.  Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, GUE/NGL, is clearly stamped on the front of their report.  What is the significance of that?</p><p>It seems from reading it that it is an independent, legal and academic report but what is the significance of the party political logo on the front?

I am here in my capacity as a professor at Queen's University Belfast and Mr. Bassett is here in his capacity as a barrister.  We were commissioned to produce what is an independent report.  Committee members will be aware that we have been working on these questions for a number of years in order to provide clarity on some of the legal challenges and questions around how this process will work.  The independent report that we were commissioned to produce is part of a wider body of work that I and Mr. Bassett have been undertaking in order to inform the growing debate.  The report emphasises the need for planning and preparing for what is coming next.</p></speech>

I do not doubt the integrity of the report and would not dare to question that.  I am asking about the political nature of the stamp on the front.  Professor Harvey is saying that independent research was commissioned and that political views are not expressed therein.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We hope our work is helpful to that debate.  If anybody asks us to write a research report, we are more than happy to engage with them.</p></speech>

The emphasis on a vote is fine but the preparation for that vote is key.  I certainly believe in a united Ireland but the issue that arises is consent.  Getting to a consensual position is critical work, regardless of what the majority may ultimately decide.  We need to bring as many of those who would be opposed to a united Ireland with us and any consensual changes that happen must be very deep and thorough.  Emphasis must be placed on the work of building consensus.  This committee, for example, is open to all but no unionist has come before us, although we did have a very good debate with Mr. Paisley, MP, recently and are hopeful of progress <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the British Parliament and this committee.  We need a full and open debate, commissioned by all of us.  We must be totally inclusive in that debate, although I am not suggesting that the witnesses were otherwise.  We must build consensus on economic, social and political issues, including poverty and education, because if we do not address those issues, no matter what the outcome of the vote, strife, dissonance and upset in communities will persist.</p></speech>

Our work is intended to inform the thinking of all communities on the island, including unionist communities, because there are some very technical questions here that need to be addressed.  I agree with what the Chairman has said and would encourage him and committee members to invite a broad range of voices, particularly from Northern Ireland, who are engaged in this debate at the moment in civic society and elsewhere, to engage with committee and reflect on some of the points just raised by the Chairman.  We will continue to clarify our work but I underline the fact that its aim is to inform the debate for all communities on this island, to make sure that we do not repeat the mistake that was made in relation to Brexit.  We will continue to work in that spirit.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Bassett and Professor Harvey.  It is lovely to see them again.  I am interested to hear what they thought of the debate last night.  I came away from it feeling very positive that we were having a mature debate or discussion about a united or shared island.  We have a tendency to see things in a less nuanced way and not to take the dynamics in the North into consideration but I felt that last night we had a deeper discussion about the reality rather than the perception of the dynamics on our island.  That is a positive move and I would like to see that happen on a regular basis.  I would like to see those voices represented on a regular basis, whether at this committee or in public discourse more generally.  That said, the voice of the SDLP was missing and it would be nice to hear from it today.  I am interested to hear the views of the witnesses on last night's debate.  I am particularly interested in the question that comes up frequently in this conversation, namely, whether there is a conflict or tension between the 51% idea versus our experience of the Good Friday Agreement.  The latter was the culmination of momentum which resulted in a universal decision, or if not completely universal, an overwhelmingly positive endorsement.  Do the witnesses see a tension between those two approaches at the moment?</p><p>Are the witnesses very focused on a timeline, a date and the role of the Citizens' Assembly?</p></speech>

I did not get an opportunity to put a question the last day, so I appreciate the opportunity now to speak in this second round.</p><p>It is almost 23 years since the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people in both jurisdictions on this island.  That is more than a generation ago and much has changed.  Reference has been made to the impact of Brexit, but the political landscape in the North has also changed significantly over that generation.  Twenty three years is a considerable amount of time for dialogue and discussion.  The Good Friday Agreement gave nationalists and republicans the right to democratically and peacefully pursue their objective of a united Ireland.  That is what one does in a democracy.  It is up to anybody in a democracy to win hearts and minds for their perspective, arguments and propositions.</p><p>Senator Currie referred to last night's debate.  One point that occurs to me is that all of the political voices who argued that they are in favour of a united Ireland or argued that they are republicans stated that we need to prepare the ground for a referendum.  We need to do this properly and that is exactly what is stated in this paper.  At the first meeting with Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett their presentation stated:</p> <blockquote> 	In our view the people of this island are likely to be offered a choice about their constitutional future in the decade ahead.  It is essential that when that time comes everyone is clear about the consequences. </blockquote> <p>Their paper argues that we should prepare the ground constitutionally.  In last night's debate I did not hear anybody disagree with that politically but what is missing from this debate is what form that preparation takes.  Is it endless talking shops or is there a structure to the preparation?  For example, is it agreed that we have a Citizens' Assembly?  I note with interest the speech given by Fianna F&aacute;il's Deputy Jim O'Callaghan to the University of Sussex in which he put forward some propositions, for example, that one House of Parliament would sit in Belfast and that there would be regional policing arrangements.  He is putting out some ideas about the form a new Ireland would take.  Today, another Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy, James O'Connor, argued that the three coalition parties should put in place a Minister of State with responsibility for Irish unity.  There is a growing realisation politically that we need to responsibly prepare the ground for Irish unity.  I accept that involves dialogue and discussion.  I call on both Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett to spell out the structures and processes that take us forward.  Everybody agrees that in due course a referendum is inevitable, whether in five years, ten years or other period.  There is political acceptance that it is inevitable.  Therefore, it is very responsible to prepare properly.  What is the process?  Is it by means of a Citizens' Assembly, a White Paper on Irish unity or an all-Ireland Oireachtas committee on Irish unity?  Could the witnesses spell out in clear terms what they believe are the ways forward?</p><p>I accept there are different perspectives in our committee and the witnesses would have seen that at their first meeting.  I invite those who challenged the paper at the previous meeting, who say they are in favour of Irish unity, to comment.  In politics, as with everything in life, whether one is a manager of a football team or running a business, if one says one wants to make something happen one has to have a plan to make it happen.  I ask those who challenge the paper to say what is their plan for moving towards Irish unity.  How do they intend to advance the cause of Irish unity?  Who are they making their case to and in what format?  In what timeline should it take place?  With all due respect, I put that challenge to all those who say they want to see Irish unity.  I would like to hear a dialogue.  This is a great opportunity.  I accept there is a lot more to come.  I hope that the MP, Ian Paisley Jnr., will join us soon to discuss some of his thoughts on all of this.  He certainly indicated recently that he would.  We want to hear more voices, but today is about hearing from Professor Harvey, and Mr. Bassett who is a barrister, as they speak in their professional capacities about their paper and what they think we should do.  I invite other participants to give us their thoughts.  This is a really important dialogue, as was last night's debate.  They are my questions and that is all I have to say.</p></speech>

The Irish Constitution will have to give proper regard to the principle of parity of esteem in its law and we have said that should also extend to EU law.  One of the points is that there will be many residents and citizens of the new united Ireland who will be British citizens.  That status will be based on British nationality legislation but it will continue in perpetuity and it needs to be respected in the new united Ireland.  There are a number of aspects of Irish electoral law in particular, which at the moment are based on Irish citizenship, so a helpful exercise at this point would be to identify what aspects of the Irish Constitution or Irish legislation are potentially in conflict with the duty of parity of esteem with the nation state exercising sovereignty in the North.</p><p> Other suggestions are made such as that work could be undertaken within the European institutions.  Consideration will have to be given to rights of participation in the European Parliament for an enlarged state or in the Council also.</p><p> Another useful exercise would be identifying how the Northern institutions - the Executive, the Assembly and the Northern legal system - will be accommodated, at least initially, and unless and until something else is agreed under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  A useful audit would be to identify if there is a potential conflict between any of the Constitution's provisions and executive, legislative or judicial power and to get ready to show that it is manageable under the current Constitution subject to amendments, which give effect to unification, and, importantly, give effect to the duties and responsibilities that Ireland will assume in a united Ireland.</p><p> The other aspect that could be considered is how the other east-west relationships will be accommodated in a new united Ireland.  We believe for the most part that the provisions are operable in a united Ireland, but it would be helpful at this stage if work was undertaken within Departments in the Republic of Ireland to show exactly how that can be managed.</p><p> In terms of a citizens' assembly, it is suggested as being helpful within the report.  It would be hoped that would build on the success of previous constitutional conventions and citizens' assemblies, draw in a membership from across the island, and make suggestions that would be part of any consultation process in advance of the referendums on unity.</p><p> The other point which is very important is that the preparatory work on the actual choice that will be presented to the electorate in the North and in the South should begin now.  Some thought should be given to the wording or how reunification can be achieved under the Irish Constitution.  Also, thought should be given to how the wording of the question will be posed in the North.  We do not want a situation where we end up with incompatible results or two legal or constitutional systems which are shouting at each other, so to speak, with contradictory results.  There needs to be co-ordination between the Irish and British Governments on how these concurrent referendums will take place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1633" speakername="Niall Blaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021032300002#E00500"><p>I want to say first that my opinions in respect of the report are personal.  Coming from a very republican background, I, as much as anyone in this line, want to see unity of our people and our country, but I am also conscious of how where we have got to was achieved.  With all due respect to the two witnesses, how it was achieved has been missed with regard to their report.  For me, it does not give enough recognition to the background work that was done with regard to the coming together of the Good Friday Agreement.  Incidentally, the Good Friday Agreement was never done with a time limit over anybody's head.  It was a culmination of years of work that allowed us, in the end, to enter a room and get an agreement.  If truth be known, it goes back to the 1990s.  If the question of Irish unity was that easily settled, it could have been done with the Good Friday Agreement, so let us not cod ourselves.  This is not something that will be easily achieved, but the one thing the Good Friday Agreement did have was respect for opinion and an assurance that everyone around the table had their say.</p> <p>  I was taken aback somewhat by the language used in the report and by the witnesses reporting on it.  I believe they are predetermining the outcome of the poll with the continual talk of a united Ireland.  Last night, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald spoke about not putting the cart before the horse.  We all need to step back a little bit.  This is not an effort to attack anybody at this meeting because that is not useful, but we need to be honest about how we approach this issue.  I asked the witnesses several times on the previous day if they had engaged with unionism in terms of communities or political parties and they failed to answer that question.  They danced around it, so to speak.</p> <p>  At the outset the witnesses said they had EU oversight.  What EU oversight do they have?  I do not believe they have any EU oversight.  Their funding was got as a result of a couple of MEPs pulling funds together.</p> <p>  I believe their report is of a strong nationalist view.  That is grand but I believe we need to start getting a view from the other side.  I hope they take these comments from the perspective of me being helpful.  For their report to have better grounding and an understanding all round, they will have to start engaging with unionist communities and politicians because its opinion is too much on one side.  It is not grounded on enough academia.  There is too much personal opinion in it.</p> <p>  I do not want to knock all of the report.  Some of it is represents a useful start but I do not believe the witnesses' report is complete.  I think they could take it further and I would encourage them to do that and make an effort to start engaging with unionism because we need to come at this from a whole-of-picture perspective.</p> <p>  As far as preparing the ground is concerned, the Good Friday Agreement is not complete in all its entity.  That is the first bit of work we need to do because if we do not do that, we do not have everybody around the table.  This committee we sit on is not complete because everybody is not around the table.  If we have learned one thing over the past decades it is that coerciveness does not work.  We need to be inclusive and bring everybody on board.  People like the witnesses are critical with regard to that.</p> <p>  This could be a good report but there is some work still to be done.  That is my point of view.</p><p>Some may be critical of it but there will not be an agreement down the road unless we are more inclusive and show the hand of friendship.  Unless we show that we are all willing to share this island together, there will not be a happy conclusion to this.</p></speech>

I hope it is clear that what we have been stressing today is a need for a wide, deep and inclusive conversation, along with preparation and planning in advance.  Nobody wants a referendum tomorrow or next week.  People want to be ready and that is the spirit of what we are talking about.</p> <p>  We have emphasised very much in our work that one must stick to the Good Friday Agreement and its terms.  Again, I urge the committee to revisit the relevant provisions in the agreement around this.</p> <p>  In terms of our suggestions, we have talked about a Citizens' Assembly.  We have underlined in our work that we need wide, deep and inclusive citizen engagement.  The idea of an all-island Citizens' Assembly is a great one.  The proposal for a joint Oireachtas committee and a Minister is also welcome.  A White Paper from the Irish Government would be incredibly helpful.  Both Governments setting out the parameters of the process would be very helpful.  I would be anxious about leaving this entirely to the Secretary of State.  Both Governments engaging in advance would be helpful.</p> <p>  Ultimately, we are talking about preparing and planning in advance for a proposition.  If a political party claims to be supportive of this constitutional objective, what will its representatives say on people's doorsteps - if we are allowed to do so at some stage - about its proposals?  Ultimately, we are urging the committee to do the preparatory work in order that we have something coherent and credible to say about what the propositions of the Irish State, the Irish Government and those advocating change will actually be when these referendums happen within the next decade.</p> <p>  I appreciate the feedback on the report and we will take Senator Blaney's comments on board.  I highlighted earlier that our report is one part of a larger body of work that we have been doing.  We have supplied the committee with some of that larger body of work.  We will happily follow up on that.  That report is very much focused on the role of the European Union.  We stressed in that report and in other work the need to plan and prepare in advance.  We are aware this is not easy.  However, I started the presentation with paying close attention to the nature of the current conversation.  The level of engagement that is actually happening is striking.  There is a risk that we fail to notice, for example, the level of civic unionist engagement in the current conversation and the level of engagement among those who find some of the old traditional labels deeply uncomfortable but want to have a sensible discussion about the constitutional future.  There is actually civic unionist engagement, as well as engagement in this conversation by people who want to move beyond the old labels.  We need to pay attention to that.</p> <p>  We very much see ourselves as part of that.  In my academic capacity, I felt that what we have been doing is laying the groundwork on some of the more challenging legal questions.  Other work that I have been doing in civil society is very much about engaging with civic unionism and with all elements of society.  For example, a recent event held by Ireland's Future included engagement in the conversation from people from a unionist background.  We should not underestimate or undervalue - it would be almost disrespecting it - the extent to which people are already involved in this process.</p> <p>  We use the language in the report and on the cover of planning and preparing for constitutional change.  We have underlined in our work that the responsible and sensible thing to do is to manage and plan all this.  In a sense, we very much agree with the committee that this should be an inclusive, broad and deep conversation.  It benefits no one on the island, however, if we run away, hide from or use a variety of techniques to deflect from doing the hard work now.</p></speech>

I could not get changed so I am going to keep my camera off.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  I do not have a large number of questions because I squeezed a lot in the last time.  On the discussion of dates, I do not think we are ready.  For the past several decades, our material well-being and day-to-day outcomes in Northern Ireland, let alone the project of reconciliation, are often overlooked and overshadowed by focus on the constitutional issues from both perspectives.  There is a kind of a jam tomorrow conversation generally.  That is not in any way denying or thwarting the conversation that is definitely under way.  It is just a comment on all the stuff that requires to be done, regardless of constitutional outlook, as well as the day-to-day stuff one has to get through as an elected representative.</p> <p>  Professor Harvey suggested May 2023 for a referendum.  Does he think that is achievable?  On the comment about the continuity, or otherwise, of the Northern institutions, it has been the position of both the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in that they would continue.  Richard Humphrey's legal opinion is that there is no sunset clause on them.  Does Professor Harvey see merit in them continuing, both in terms of a kind of a forum through which to manage ongoing issues around equality and so on in the North and to facilitate some of the protections currently there for nationalists?  The outcome of a border poll, one way or the other, does not solve all of our problems.</p> <p>  Does Professor Harvey see any potential in following other forms of devolution that might be prompted by having a Northern Assembly, whether that is opportunities for the north west and Donegal to participate in that?  Does he see devolution being a regional parliament for Cork?  Does he see basically the presence of a Northern Assembly stimulating conversations about other forms of devolution of power, such as an enhancement of the role of county councils?  I noted he said that they are not set in stone.  What vision does he have for them and what conversations might they promote more widely?</p></speech>

At the moment, 50% plus 1 is enough in the North for union with Great Britain.  It is a principle of democracy and equality of democracy that a comparable vote would be enough to ensure Irish unification.  Against that majoritarian principle there are a number of counter majoritarian principles in the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the most important of those is the shared institutions - power sharing in the Executive and assembly.  There is a duty of parity of esteem on the government exercising sovereignty and that has to be taken more seriously by the Irish State.  It probably has been taken seriously by the British State since 1998.</p><p> In the "Claire Byrne Live" programme last night, there were discussions about what should happen to the title of Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste and what should happen to the flag and symbols.  The state in the North is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The flag is the Union Jack.  There is no power sharing in London and a hereditary monarch is the head of state.  It is very important that the shared institutions continue but also that there is an audit of those aspects of the Irish State that could be objectionable and can be amended to ensure that power is seen and the equal protection of rights is given effect.</p><p> In terms of the idea of regional parliaments within the State, I have not detected an appetite for that in any of the legal or constitutional research that I have done.  I will defer to the members of the panel who would know much more about that than I do.  </p><p> Senator Blaney asked about engagement with unionist politicians.  To explain, this report is a legal report.  What we tried to do is identify the relevant applicable legal rules, whether they exist in public international law, EU law, UK law or Irish constitutional law.  We have tried to explain how they are going to apply in the case of a united Ireland.  That is the purpose of the report.  Some of the conclusions are very clear and some of them are contestable but we have tried to set out reasonable suggestions.  This report is one of a series that was commissioned by MEPs, one of which looked at the protection of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in Northern Ireland after Brexit.  Another one looked at the possibility of a special designated status for Northern Ireland in EU law.  This report tried to follow that template in identifying the relevant law and explaining how it might apply in these circumstances.</p></speech>

I will follow on from what Mr. Bassett has said.  A few of the questions were directed towards the idea of dates so maybe I should say something about those.  The spirit in which we have conducted this work is that these referendums are likely to happen, maybe sooner than people anticipate.  In 2019, I made a suggestion around a possible date.  The suggestion was born out of a sense of frustration, which I suspect many members of the committee share.  I had been to one too many meetings where people stood up and said there needed to be planning and preparation but then everybody went home and did nothing.  My view is that very little planning, project planning or homework would get done on the island of Ireland if the date was completely open-ended.  My view, therefore, is that a timeframe is helpful to focus minds to get the work done.  Again, I am not sure how much homework would get done on this island if there was no timeframe for the discussion.</p> <p>  It is notable that Bertie Ahern has followed my lead in suggesting the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  I had suggested the 25th anniversary.  We notice there is a convergence in the debate around the next decade.  Their seems to be an emerging sense that we are in a crucial decade for the constitutional conversation.  As members know, Brexit has dramatically affected that debate.  To emphasise and echo what Mr. Bassett has said, our contribution is to encourage and make sure people do the relevant planning.</p> <p>  On the Northern institutions, we have made clear that the guarantees and assurances continue unless and until alternative arrangements are achieved.  We appreciate, as we acknowledge in our report, that there is discussion on a new constitution and new architecture.  That is why we think there needs to be extensive civic engagement in preparing for that.</p> <p>  On the 50% plus 1 argument, to echo something Mr. Bassett said, we are a bit concerned that people are ignoring or neglecting the assurances, guarantees and protections that are already in the Good Friday Agreement around mutual respect, parity of esteem, equality of treatment and equality in rights.  They will map forward on to the arrangements that we are talking, or they should map forward, and that is why we have talked about the sort of audit we described today.  Rather than focus on the 50% plus 1 conversation - in our view it is 50% plus 1 - we need to spend more time thinking about the guarantees, protections and assurances that will reassure people and provide security, and that are there, in relation to carrying forward the values of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  The devolution conversation - the conversation around the Northern institutions - is profoundly helpful because, in my view, the Irish State is over-centralised.  One of the great positives about this discussion is that it will encourage a wider discussion in Ireland around regional policy.  Many regions on this island have been fundamentally failed, Donegal, for example, through the excessive over-centralisation of the existing State.  If this conversation encourages a wider, deeper and more inclusive discussion about the over-centralisation of the current Irish State, that would be very welcome for people in the north west, for example.</p></speech>

I stress again that I come at this issue as a non-nationalist but someone who is open to debates.  I am engaging in discussions on a speculative basis and without prejudice to whatever view we may or may not take down the line as events and developments unfold.</p> <p>  I caution very strongly against setting artificial timeframes for when a border poll may or may not occur.  The Good Friday Agreement is clear that this is a condition-led rather than date-led process.  We are not at that stage yet but I fully accept that this is a fluid situation and that this may become apparent over the coming years.  That could happen quickly or it could be further off in the distance.  Again, we need to be open-minded in that respect.</p> <p>  There are two parallel discussions.  They are interrelated but perhaps they need to move at slightly different paces.  I respect that Professor Harvey is frustrated that there is not yet sufficient clarity on the precise thresholds for decision-making around invoking a border poll.  I make very clear that I fully accept the rules that were set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  I also recognise that they leave some further questions unanswered so I respect that there is a desire to get fuller clarification in that respect.</p><p>At this stage, I would place far more emphasis on discussing what a potential united Ireland would look like.  From my discussions with people in Northern Ireland, that is probably the more relevant and active debate at this stage rather than the mechanics of it.  That is probably where the most focus needs to be placed in the immediate future.</p><p> There are three different elements that one would, in theory, walk through in trying to advance that debate.  The first is about what loose or fragmented discussions are currently happening.  I appreciate that some are frustrated they are not moving on to more structured discussions more quickly, but I do not necessarily share that frustration.  This debate is still fairly embryonic, and the "Claire Byrne Live" programme from last night reinforces that point.</p><p> Much more can be done to try to crystalise the arguments and engage with a broader range of voices.  Rather than simply having circular discussions, there is a challenge for civic society organisations, and our universities and colleges in particular, to convene more forums to work through some of those issues and talk about some of the grander details, not just on identity issues but matters of public finances, for example, and what would happen with health policy and provision.</p><p> I can also see merit in holding some form of civic forum or citizens' assembly in due course, but I do not think we are at that point just yet.  There is a question as to who would convene and organise any citizens' assembly and how that assembly would be representative.  More work needs to be done before we are at the point of a citizens' assembly being convened.  There is a bigger question because if a question were ever to be put in a referendum, governments would need to be involved in that process.  Those three phases can obviously overlap with one another but they start at different points.  I do not think we are at the second or third points just yet but I acknowledge that, in terms of a logical process, they would be steps in that wider journey.</p><p> It is important to take into account the magnitude of what is being discussed here.  A territory changing from one sovereign state to another is pretty much unprecedented in modern times or even in the past century.  The German reunification is not a like-for-like comparison, given the particular context there.  The enormity of this is important to bear in mind and it is something to work through in a stage-by-stage process.</p><p> I have made this point previously but I will stress it again.  Notwithstanding the wider constitutional and political debates around this matter, there is still significant space for practical North-South co-operation to be taken forward on a range of economic, social, environmental and infrastructure issues.  That may be a precursor to something else or it might just stand on its own two feet, but that is something I would encourage a lot of focus to be placed on in the near term as well.  I am happy for either Professor Harvey or Mr. Bassett to respond to those reflections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021032300002#H00200"><p>I agree with the broad parameters of what Mr. Farry has said.  First, it is absolutely vital that we clarify the process parameters of the referendum.  Mr. Farry will know I have been writing to the Secretary of State to try to clarify that.  It would be very helpful indeed if we knew a bit more and there was more transparency around this process because, as he has rightly pointed out, core aspects of this are condition led so it would be nice to know more about the conditions.  Other questions are being clarified in Scotland at the moment around its referendum process, and we would like more details on that as well.</p> <p>  Second, I agree with the sense that we need to clarify the proposition.  Real work needs to be done on this island about what the proposition is for the new constitutional arrangements.  That is why there has been such a focus on a citizens' assembly as a way to try to move this debate on.  Mr. Farry highlighted the work of universities.  In the majority of universities on this island, somebody or other is doing a project or initiative relating to this question.  There is extensive citizen engagement, which is very noticeable in the North, not just from advocates for constitutional change but civic unionist voices who are beginning to coalesce around what is starting to look like a sort of informal referendum campaign.</p> <p>  There are two aspects to this.  One is the co-ordination of all that work.  There is a lot of work going on at the moment.  How is that being co-ordinated?  Does the shared island unit, for example, have a role in doing that?  Second, and I mentioned this earlier, if people are going to enter a referendum campaign, what are they going to say?  I agree that not enough work has been done on the side of those advocating constitutional change as to what precisely the parameters of that change are.  We have heard every suggestion in the discussion in the past while, from what is basically a continuity Good Friday Agreement to very radical constitutional change involving a new Constitution.  The question I would raise with the committee today as regards taking forward its work is, what exactly is the proposition going to be?  When people are campaigning in this referendum, what are they going to say?  If they have not got an answer to that question, they need to start thinking about how they are going to get an answer.</p></speech>

It is enormously important and I refute some of the comments that have been made about it.  There is real value in it because it raises key questions I have not seen raised anywhere else.  In any papers that are written there are observations and certain editorial stuff, but there is real factual stuff here, for instance, around who has the right to vote and other things.  There are also questions about engagement with others and so on.  I have yet to meet anybody who does not want to prepare or does not recognise the need for preparation.  This question keeps being raised all the time, as if there is a cohort of people who do not see a need to prepare.  We in my party see the need to prepare and understand what needs to be done, whether that be a constitutional assembly, a White Paper, an Oireachtas committee or a combination of all those things.  To move the conversation on, we need to take that question off the table.</p> <p>  I hear what the witnesses are saying about the responsibility of this committee regarding how we are going to carry this forward.  I am glad to have the opportunity to hear their input again today.  Arising from the discussion and recommendations the last time we met - the Chairman will confirm this - we agreed to write to the Secretary of State to ask him to bring some clarity to the matrix and the criteria he was going to use, just as Professor Harvey had written to him in December.  My first question relates to the follow-up letter he sent to the Secretary of State on 19 January.  Has he had any response to that letter?</p><p>I am interested in point No. 40 in the professor's paper that reunification should be presented as a vindication of the Constitution rather than an unacceptable risk to its stability.  Will Professor Harvey speak further to that?  Nobody has the monopoly on this, which Deputy McDonald made clear last night.Nobody owns the questions or the conversation around the constitutional future.  We will all have input.<br/><br/>With regard to the third-level sector, I was very interested some weeks ago to see an article by Fionn&aacute;n Uibh Eochach in the <i>University Times</i>on the role that universities and the third-level sector would play in all of this.  Does Professor Harvey have any suggestions around that?<br/><br/>Reference was made to other platforms.  There is a new online platform that hosts the debate around the constitutional future debate that was prepared by Professor Peter Shirlow from the University of Liverpool, and a group working with him.  Again, I believe this is really informed.  Nobody has a monopoly on the conversation.<br/><br/>Perhaps Professor Harvey could comment on the Secretary of State, on the vindication of the Constitution, and on the third-level sector.</p></speech>

I also thank the Senator for following up by writing to the Secretary of State.  It is very much appreciated.</p> <p>  Again, the aim was to try to elicit some more clarity.  Following on from the Court of Appeal in the McCourt judgment, I am conscious that the Secretary of State has significant amount of flexibility in triggering this process.  My letters were really an attempt to try to get a bit more transparency and a bit more detail as to what precisely the Secretary of State does in this regard, for example, what evidence he relies on in reaching his judgment.  I had basic questions on how often the Secretary of State reviews the relevant evidence.  I believe this would be helpful for everyone on this island because, of course, the right to self-determination belongs to the people of this island.  Clarity would be helpful.  I have had two responses so far.  I have shared correspondence with the committee members and a bit more widely.  The committee members can reach their own conclusions from the responses.  My view is clear.  The response was from a group within the Northern Ireland Office.  The Secretary of State has fundamentally failed to answer the detailed questions raised in my letter.  To my mind this shows a profound lack of respect for the people of this island.  My questions remain unanswered.  I very much wish this committee all the best in having more luck than I had in getting detailed responses from the Secretary of State.  It is very important.  While it is not the only task at the moment, it is one part of the jigsaw.  It is a piece in the jigsaw of moving towards these referendums taking place.  The Secretary of State needs to provide detailed answers.</p> <p>  Before I hand over to Mr. Bassett I will address briefly the Senator's second question.  Universities have a fundamentally important role in this regard.  A remarkable amount of work is currently ongoing such as the work of the ARINS project with the University of Notre Dame.  Reference was also made to the work at the University of Liverpool.  There is work going on at Queen's University Belfast, Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin.  In some senses the preparatory work has started and other people are, essentially, catching up.  This is all very valuable in fleshing out some of the rather technical and boring detailed questions that need to be answered in advance.  I would encourage that this work is continued.  I would also encourage the committee and others to support that work.  There is work to be done, for example, in establishing research programmes to facilitate that.  There is an opportunity to support research, for example, by the shared island unit.  I know it can be a bit nervous about going near the subject but I do not think it needs to be.  The shared island unit can talk about how we share the island now and how we might share it in the future.  Perhaps that unit could support and fund some of the work.  Organisations such as Universities Ireland, which provides a co-ordinating role for universities across the island, could support the work so we are talking to each other and analysing the sort of detailed questions that arise.</p> <p>  Ultimately, I hope the committee is clear today, and from our last engagement, that our work is all about making sure we challenge myths, that we have an informed and evidence-based approach, and that we do the work in advance.  This is bearing in mind what Dr. Farry said about this being a condition-led process and that we are not bounced into a border poll, so that when the time comes the people North and South will know precisely what they are voting for, that nobody is painting false promises on the backs of buses, and that it is a verifiable, credible and evidence-based conversation, whatever the outcome may then be.</p></speech>

It takes in fundamental rights and judicial review from the American tradition.  It has features of parliamentary democracy, which we can see have been taken from England.  A central feature of the Constitution is that it was drafted, adopted and amended with unity in mind.  Some of the most important features of the document are now Articles 2 and 3.  They can accommodate a united Ireland, subject to some specific amendments.  A vote in the North for reunification should be seen as a compliment.  For the most part and in the main, the State has been a success.  There are some aspects of the Irish Constitution that are very much admired in the North.  Participation in the referendums on the repeal of the eighth amendment and on same-sex marriage, and going further back the contribution of the electorate to approving or rejecting European treaties, was not something that was available in the UK with its different constitutional set up.<br/><br/>We must keep in mind that with the UK vision for Northern Ireland we can see the priorities of Britain are very different to the priorities in the North.  The vote for Brexit was not replicated in the North.  The form of Brexit that was chosen primarily by English MPs and the current UK Government could not be replicated on the island of Ireland.  The mitigation of that is the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is nobody's first choice.  Nobody would design this from first principles as the best way.  Northern Ireland is outside the European Union.  There is a lot of unionist unhappiness with the practical outworkings of the protocol.  Next year there will be an assembly election and two years after that there will be a vote on certain limited aspects of the protocol, particularly its rules on the free movement of goods, internal taxation, state aid and so on.  If there is an assembly that votes to reject those aspects of the protocol, we are still left with the conundrum that it is an EU and Irish priority that there is no hard border on the island.  It is a UK priority also.  Articles 5 to 10 that are in the protocol now will have to be amended, but something similar is going to have to come back and it is going to have to get the same sort of outcome.  There were opportunities for less divergence in Britain but there is no political support for that.  The future for Northern Ireland, the vote for union is a vote for being outside the European Union but in a protocol.  As Professor Harvey has said, the task is for those of us who do believe in Irish reunification to come up with something more attractive than what is on offer from the current <i>status quo</i>for the medium-term future for Northern Ireland. </p></speech>

The word "Aont&uacute;" means "unity".  It is our primary goal as a political movement.</p> <p>  One of the interesting issues that came from the debate last night on RT&Eacute; was the fact that most people now accept there will be a referendum.  Even Gregory Campbell accepts that there will be a referendum.  One of the fascinating elements of last night's debate was the fact that the penny has not dropped with the southern Government.  A referendum will be called independently of what the southern Government thinks and the southern Government has no actual role in whether a referendum is called.  It will be called on the basis of whether there is likely to be a majority in favour of unity.</p> <p>  We see a reluctance of preparation among some of the southern political establishment.  We could see a referendum being called for five years' time.  Yet, the southern Government has actually carried out no practical work in preparation whatsoever for that referendum.  That would create a political crisis if it were the case.  It would be similar to the British finding themselves having a Brexit referendum with absolutely no political preparation in advance.</p> <p>  The type of preparation we should be looking at is convergence.  I always look at the Border as a wall with 100 bricks.  Each brick is a point of economic or social divergence.  Each brick is a significant economic or social cost to the people.  It is a difference in cancer treatment or income taxes.  It is a difference in ambulance services or policing.  It is a difference in drug treatment, third level education or road and rail infrastructure.</p> <p>  Some years ago I carried out a report for the then Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the all-Ireland economy.  Believe it or not, it was the first report carried out in the Oireachtas on the all-Ireland economy since the foundation of the State.  I interviewed approximately 100 people from all different backgrounds in the North, including unionists, nationalists and those in between.  Everyone agreed to the logic that if we plan, fund and deliver services together, they would be, by definition, better services and more efficient.  Regardless of whether we look at it through the unity prism, it will make a major difference in the lives of people.  This type of convergence means that on the sunny day when there is unity, there will not be a shock transition since there would have been a gradual convergence on both sides of the island in terms of the economy and society.</p> <p>  Senator Blaney spoke about how we should not coerce people from a unionist background into a united Ireland, and I agree.  We need to attract, convince and persuade people about the benefits of unity.  The Senator's view was echoed by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste last night.  However, they are forgetting that a minority veto is a form of coercion.  If a minority of unionists decide nationalists cannot be part of a united Ireland, that is a form of coercion.  The mechanism we have in a democracy to prevent that type of coercion is one whereby citizens sign up to the democratic will and signing up to the democratic will is at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am amazed that some within Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael seem to be rowing back on that democratic principle.  There is a danger in this, because it suggests there is one rule for the democratic will of nationalists and a separate rule for the democratic will of unionists.  It changes the goalposts mid-flow and guts the majoritarian cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement.  I would caution the establishment parties against going down that road.  We all need to agree to sign up to the democratic will of the people, North and South.  There should be no ifs, buts or other caveats in that regard.</p> <p>  I have a question for our two esteemed guests regarding the issue of a civic forum or new Ireland forum.  My instinct on this is that those of us in Aont&uacute; would like to see a new Ireland forum.  We would like to see a situation whereby all in civic and political society across Ireland are invited to participate in a forum.  The purpose of the forum would be to look at possible areas of convergence that are beneficial mutually to both sides of the community, North and South, and to the rest of the island.  We could then work out what such an all-Ireland would look like.  My concern is that in a citizens' forum many of the stakeholders who exist, especially those on the unionist side in the North of Ireland, would not believe they have a say in exactly the direction we are going.  That is my question.  Should we not look for a new Ireland forum based on the model used by Garret FitzGerald around the Anglo-Irish Agreement?  Under that framework, all those from political and civic society across the island could be invited to discuss how we deal with the worst aspects of Brexit, how we converge, how we create unity of purpose and how we build towards Irish unity.</p></speech>

This is an important report.  It is important to highlight that it is an academic research tool to assist the discussion on the importance of planning and preparing for constitutional change.  There is no doubt that many people have said we need to do more work on this.  That is important to say.</p><p>I believe those in civic society are doing great work on this.  Ireland's Future is an organisation committed to planning and preparing for constitutional change.  It is a rights-based organisation created to protect the civil and religious liberties of all traditions and identities in Ireland in a spirit of mutual respect.  That is the basis of the organisation.  I believe that more work is required from the Government and people within political and elected leadership.  That is important.</p><p>I am keen to get the thoughts of our two witnesses.  We know there is a desire for a border poll following <i>The Sunday Times</i>survey recently in February.  It reported that 51% of the people in the North supported a border poll being held within five years.  My concern is that this does not reflect the State's readiness or willingness to openly discuss the possibility of a referendum.  What more could parliamentarians do to promote productive discussion and conversations on facilitating a border poll and referendum?  Those in civic society, including Ireland's Future, are having these discussions.  Plenty of events have taken place and another is due to take place this Thursday on the economy.  That is the reality.  People want to know.  My family live in north Antrim.  These are the questions they want answered.  They want to know about the impact on health, housing and education and what a new Ireland would look like.</p><p>These conversations are already happening.  They are happening around the kitchen table all of the time.  I welcomed last night's discussion.  It was a very vibrant and healthy discussion.</p><p> The question I want to ask is how we, as parliamentarians, can promote productive discussions and conversations around facilitating a referendum?  I have to say I am concerned, and in saying so I have to highlight the importance of planning and preparing, that at any time, the Secretary of State could call a border poll and we would not be ready.  That is my biggest concern.  That is why it is important for this committee to write to the Secretary of State also.  I hope that is okay.</p></speech>

I know the witnesses have been bombarded with many questions.  It is about the idea of a citizens' assembly.  That is a model which was used and worked quite well here for what were considered contentious items.  Will the witnesses elaborate on how they believe this could work in this instance?  Would it have to happen in both areas, including Northern Ireland?  Do the witnesses foresee this as a model that could work?  We talked about other models, about Garret FitzGerald and different ways of doing things.  Being a person who participated in one of the citizens' assemblies as a presenter, that kind of deliberative democracy provided a great opportunity for teasing things out and pulling things along.  Will the witnesses elaborate on how this deliberative piece could work, including some of the frameworks we have that have been used in the past successfully?  I know this is possibly going over ground which we have already trodden on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021032300002#L00500"><p>I am sorry for missing the earlier part of the meeting.  I had difficulty joining.  I endorse the comments made by my colleague, Senator Niall Blaney, that the debate has to be inclusive.  There is a danger we will not have everyone participating, including people from different political viewpoints.  I want to see a united Ireland, but if we have a minimalist approach, then we will do damage and will put back the day when we will achieve a united Ireland.  We would be denying a large cohort of the Irish people the ambition they want to achieve in the proper circumstances.  Going back to Albert Reynolds's comments in December 1993, when the Downing Street Declaration was signed with John Major on 15 December, on that day, both the former Taoiseach, the late Albert Reynolds, and Mr. Major spoke about the need not to have a minimalist approach.  They spoke generosity being needed on all sides.  It is very important in that respect that we approach this with an inclusive agenda.</p><p>Mr. Harvey spoke about long-term planning, and I totally agree with that.  There has to be an understanding of the other side's position.  The Chairman and I are probably the only two committee members who were Members of the Oireachtas at the time of the Downing Street Declaration and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  At that time, we clearly understood the political message that was given to us by our parties, which was the need to understand the other side's position and the difficulties they encountered in reaching an agreement.  Having talked to Bertie Ahern, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Blair and the late John Hume, and others who contributed so much to achieving the Good Friday Agreement, they were always generous, patient and understanding of the other side's position.</p><p>People speak about citizens' assemblies.  We have elected forums and it is these which have to do the preparatory work on what we all want to achieve in a proper way.  Mr. Harvey mentioned that the Good Friday Agreement provides the mechanism, quite rightly, to achieve a united Ireland.  That is in an international agreement endorsed by the people, North and South, on 22 May 1998.  If we were to have spoken to people in March of 1998 and said in a <i>vox pop</i>on any street in any county in any part of our island that, within a number of weeks, we would have a mechanism to achieve a united Ireland, I do not think the public at large at that time would have thought we would make that progress.  We have the mechanism, thankfully, but we did not have it prior to May 1998.</p><p>Mr. Harvey spoke the previous day about commitments already made.  Did Mr. Harvey or Mr. Bassett, in the course of their work, do an inventory of what has not been done pertaining to the commitments laid out in the Good Friday Agreement and in its successor agreements?  If we are to move successfully to achieving a united Ireland, then we must implement and maximise the potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the successor agreements.  We have seen what a lack of preparation did in regard to Brexit.  Surely, we want a referendum where the homework will have been done and there will not be a mentality on either side that they are being forced into something.</p><p>Mr. Harvey also spoke about the shared island unit and others have a massive role in ensuring the practical co-operation on this island is stepped up.  Institutions on this island do not engage or talk to each other anywhere near enough.  We should focus at the moment on maximising the agreements we have in place, maximising co-operation, and ensuring the &euro;500 million already committed to the shared island initiatives is drawn down and that practical co-operation for the benefit of all the people of this island is advanced.  Momentum is needed to ensure we deliver on what is achievable through those agreements, particularly the Good Friday Agreement, which is an international agreement.  That is an incremental and necessary approach for us to have in place the necessary framework to achieve a united Ireland in due time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021032300002#L00600"><p>I echo my colleague, Deputy Smith, in all of what he said.  I very much welcome this debate.  I would speak about the concept of a united Ireland until the cows come home.  It is something I grew up with and is something which is innate within me.  We need to have this discussion and we need dialogue between all parties.</p> <p>  A majority of members on this committee are very much in favour of a united Ireland.  The elephant in the room is the fact we do not have enough of the divergent voices at this committee meeting.  Referring to what Deputy Smith said, have we fulfilled the Good Friday Agreement?  Last night, Naomi Long made a very valid comment.  To paraphrase her, she said that if there is a divided Northern Ireland, there will not be a united Ireland.  Northern Ireland is divided in terms of flags.  How are we going to bring along people?  We need to bring them along.  We need clear actions and a path forward.  I will jump on that path but we need a correct path.  It needs clear actions.</p> <p>  I echo what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said, that it is about convergence.  How do we work east-west and North-South on converging our island to make it a single island and to make it stick?  A hundred years on, where are we in regard to partition?  We do not want to be 200 years on or 100 years on from a border poll and still be at the top of that hill, and still be divided.  Unionists are still very much a part of this island.  We need to start celebrating a shared history and our shared past.  Going back to my own personal story, the McGreehans landed in Castletowncooley straight after the Battle of the Boyne, when William cleared out north County Louth.</p><p>We came afterwards and plenty of unionists came along with that wave.  We could say that I came with the unionists and with that story.  It is part of my story and we are still living and farming in Castletowncooley to this day.  It is a similar path to that of many people on this island who are very proud of it and we need to embrace it.  We need to look at how we can jump on a path together.  It really does need to be part of a convergence and part of an inclusive story.</p><p> To go back to another Louth person, D'Arcy McGee went to Canada and helped to created much of the democracy there and brought together people in Canada united in diversity.  If this committee were to bring about anything it should be to be very clear that we need to be united in all our diversity.  I welcome the conversation and the debate last night but we need to be very careful that we do not march ourselves up to the top of the hill and say we will go for a border poll but leave many people behind.  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

There are three phases to this, namely, prior to the vote, the vote itself and after the vote.  All of these are fraught with challenges, opportunities and potential difficulties.  The way I see the preparation time and the convergence is that, as members have acknowledged, the excellent academic work is being done.  The part that is missing is political liaison and it is missing big time.  With all our articulation here today, nobody from the unionist community is giving us their views.  This is a huge gap.</p> <p>  The vote is one thing.  The report itemises the difficulties of exercising the franchise in the North compared with England and Scotland.  This is a major issue.  If there is a referendum and it is lost, many people will be in an extremely difficult situation.  If it is passed, there will be the alternative situation and it will also be difficult situation.  How do we jump these fences in the timeline and preparation?  The report has certainly brought about great discussion here today and it has been very welcome.  I know the witnesses cannot address all of these issues.</p> <p>  No report is perfect, not even one with such excellent authors as our guests.  I acknowledge the importance of the report.  The key issue is that we have to bring everybody with us, or as many people as we can.  The idea of 50% plus one will not work for a huge number of people and, therefore, we would be going backwards and not forwards.  We have to get it absolutely right.  I thank the witnesses and ask them to summarise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.437" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021032300002#M00300"><p>Obviously, I cannot address all of the detailed questions raised by committee members but I very much appreciate the comments, reflections and feedback.  We will take them on board in our work.  We are happy to engage further with the committee.  I will start by saying we have underlined in our work that we need to stick to the Good Friday Agreement parameters and framework.  Nobody here wants to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement, and this is our starting point.  The rules are reasonably clear already.</p> <p>  When we speak about sharing the island now and in the future, the Irish State and civil society have the capacity to do two things at once.  In other words, we must think about how we share this island better in the here and now.  Nothing we are saying is contrary to this.  In fact, we think this work needs to be stepped up and the work of the shared island unit on this is very welcome and is to be encouraged and supported.  We also need to think about how we plan and prepare for how we will share the island in future.  This is in the Good Friday Agreement.  We are speaking about the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement today.  What we are speaking about is a normal everyday part of the constitutional framework in the agreement about how we might share the island in future.  We need to address it in this framework and tone and we need to do the preparatory work on this.  The worry, and what inspires a lot of our work, is that there is a bit too much complacency.  There is a bit too much that sounds like prevarication on not wanting to do the difficult homework.  There is a sense of doing it tomorrow or putting it off until next week.  Some of the motivation for the timeframe is slight frustration that while many people do not want to face difficult homework nobody is doing anybody any favours, on the committee or elsewhere, by avoiding the hard work on preparing and planning.</p> <p>  There is another point on civic engagement.  At the centre of many proposals at present is the idea of an all-island citizens' assembly on Ireland's future.  Although a variety of other models have been pointed out, including involving politicians, we are particularly aware that citizens and civic engagement North and South have to be central to shaping this discussion.  It cannot be an elite-led discussion in which, in a sense, professors such as me in a university dictate the models for the future.  I would much rather that these proposals and options are discussed and debated among people and they emerge from the conversation, shaped by the evidence, expertise and comparative experience.</p> <p>  The Oireachtas, as the Legislature, has a vital role.  Nothing is either-or.  We can have a citizens' assembly and we can also have Oireachtas committees working away and doing vital work.  Too many of these discussions are dominated by governments.  We need legislatures to step up here and elsewhere to help in the preparatory task.  The work cannot be taken on alone even by a citizens' assembly.  It has to be done by others.</p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith made a comment on the agreement.  What we are speaking about is central to the agreement.  This is about the implementation of the agreement.  Although we are focusing on the referendums we also need to underline, and I agree, that other parts of the agreement have not been implemented.  I have spent many years of my life working on equality and human rights.  For example, Northern Ireland, the North, this region needs a bill of rights.  This is still not implemented.  It is not either-or.  We can do more than one thing at once.  This is about implementing the agreement in the longer term.  Ultimately, for those on the side of constitutional change it is about ensuring the constitutional arrangements that emerge are successful and work and that everybody is better off at the far end of all of this.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

It is very important that there is engagement from unionism in the debate about what the shared island will look like in future but it cannot prevent the debate from happening.  Those in a position to assist, explain and reassure should do so.</p> <p>  We would very much like to provide an inventory of those aspects of Irish law or UK law that could be criticised as not being consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a little bit of work and we will be happy to submit it to the committee later in the year.  If the referendums are lost, the status quo will remain.  Everyone will have had his or her say and it will have been a fair procedure.</p></speech>

This is the second year of the Covid-19 pandemic in which, of the more than 120 million cases worldwide, more than 230,000 have been in Ireland.  Sadly, more than 2.6 million people have lost their lives, including 4,587 in Ireland, of whom 2,009 have been in nursing homes.  The continuing levels of high daily case numbers remain of ongoing concern.</p> <p>  Nationally and internationally, older people and particularly those in nursing homes have been especially impacted.  Nursing homes are where more than 30,000 of our citizens call home and residents of nursing homes are vulnerable to Covid-19 for a variety of reasons.  Consistent with the learning arising from the pandemic to date, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the expert panel and HIQA highlight that the probability of Covid-19 introduction into these settings depends on the level of Covid-19 circulation in the community.  Ireland has put in place a comprehensive set of public health measures, actions and responses that align with each of the ECDC-advised options to help manage and mitigate this risk to residents of long-term residential care.</p> <p>  Sustained communication and interagency co-operation remain central to the response to Covid-19.  Guidance, personal protective equipment, PPE, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control training, accommodation and financial support have been provided to the nursing home sector, both public and private.  In addition, multidisciplinary clinical supports are in place at community healthcare organisation, CHO, level through 23 Covid-19 response teams.  Fundamental to this is the continued and determined professional care provided by healthcare workers in nursing homes 24 hours a day.  Throughout the pandemic to date, about one third of nursing homes have remained Covid-outbreak free, while many nursing homes that did experience an outbreak managed very well.</p> <p>  While there is much to be hopeful about following the Government prioritisation of vaccination of older people and healthcare workers, the challenges associated with the pandemic will continue for the foreseeable future.  A vaccination effect is being seen, however, and the number of open outbreaks in nursing homes now stands at 68, down from 178 on 21 February.  In addition, this week sees a significant step in restoring meaningful contact through enhanced visiting guidance for nursing homes, whereby each resident can now have two face-to-face visits a week in light of a high rate of vaccination in the nursing home.</p> <p>  Following the recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in May 2020, a Covid-19 expert panel on nursing homes was established to provide immediate, real-time learnings to the Minister for Health.  This panel made a substantial package of 86 recommendations in 15 thematic areas and was published on 19 August.  The Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people committed to progressing these recommendations and established an implementation framework with a priority focus on key short-term public health and protective measures.  This framework includes an interagency implementation oversight team and a stakeholder reference group.  Early progress on implementation of recommendations is evident and a second progress report has been published.  In summary, the areas worth highlighting include assurance of the ongoing HIQA and HSE public health supports and in particular the role of serial testing and Covid response teams, the governance systems put in place by the HSE and HIQA, additional funding for the provision of integrated infection prevention and control measures, the delivery of sustained and intensive education and information campaigns and the establishment and preliminary work of the task force on safe staffing.</p> <p>  A paper reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s actions in light of the key national options in respect of mitigating and managing Covid-19 in long-term care has aligned well to the November ECDC risk assessment, and this paper was published and discussed by NPHET.  In regard to regulation, the Department is in broad agreement with the recommendations of the expert panel and HIQA with regard to the need to enhance the current regulatory frameworks for older people and the need to reform the regulatory model.  Over recent months, the Department has sanctioned additional inspectorate staff for HIQA to support a sustained increase in the frequency of inspections.  The Minister for Health has approved the development of interim enhancements to the current regulatory framework for nursing homes this year, with a view to commencing a longer-term review of nursing home regulation in 2022, and recently requested that HIQA undertake an up-to-date international evidence review of nursing home regulatory models to support and inform this wider review.</p> <p>  In the meantime, the Department is focused on interim enhancements to the legislation through a bilateral project group supported by HIQA.  Detailed work is advancing on legislative proposals that, subject to Government approval, will aim to enhance the enforcement and oversight powers of the chief inspector, including through additional enforcement tools such as compliance notices, obligations for all nursing homes to report key operational data to HIQA and make the data public, exploration of measures to enhance transparency, and increased legal underpinning of infection prevention and control obligations, along with other improvements.</p> <p>  Home care is essential to support older people to live in their homes for as long as possible.  Investment in home support services has increased by 66% since 2017 and more than &euro;666 million has been allocated in 2021 to provide 24 million home support hours to 56,000 people.  This includes 360,000 hours for intensive home care packages.  In addition, the HSE national service plan commits &euro;10 million to the roll-out of the interRAI standard assessment tool and to establish a national home support office.  A programme of work to advance the statutory home support scheme is well under way.  The Government will soon be asked to approve the principle of moving to introduce a licensing framework for professional home support providers, underpinned by legislation, in line with the programme for Government commitment.  Throughout 2021, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is conducting research on behalf of the Department on the projected demand for, and cost of, home support provision across a range of models for the financing of the statutory home support scheme.</p><p>This work will build on projections for the future demand for home support as set out in various reports, including the Department of Health's Health Service Capacity Review 2018, which forecast that a 120% increase in home support services will be required by 2031 if the health system is fully reformed.</p><p> In summary, Covid-19 has highlighted the important need to move to new models of care for older people.  This will involve short and long-term reform across government in order to provide new housing models, new home first care models and where long-term care is needed, that it is provided with innovative designs that can meet infection prevention and control requirements and provide a home for those who need this type of care.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan also fully recognises pandemic learning and the reform requirements, including commitments to commence planning towards a longer term rebalancing of the public-private nursing home mix.  Sl&aacute;intecare provides the overall framework of right care, right place, right time in order to support older people to continue to live in the community in their own homes for as long as possible, thereby participating to their full potential in economic and social life.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.450" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phelim Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#B00300"><p>I thank members for the invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting.  We welcome the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Health.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Mary Dunnion, chief inspector of social services and director of regulation; Ms Susan Cliffe, deputy chief inspector of social services for older persons; and Mr. Finbarr Colfer, deputy chief inspector of social services for disability services.</p> <p>  As some members will recall, in September 2020, HIQA appeared before a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response at which our report on the impact of the pandemic on nursing homes in Ireland was discussed.  We are happy to take any questions regarding this and our experience of the regulation of residential services subsequent to its publication.</p> <p>  In respect of my opening statement, I wish to focus on the background and recommendations of HIQA&rsquo;s report on the need for regulatory reform of the social care sector, published in February of this year.  The report, titled The Need for Regulatory Reform, reinforces the insights we have gained while contending with the arrival and impact of the highly infectious coronavirus, Covid-19.  In particular, the report highlights the impact on citizens living in residential services and has raised a number of questions as to how we care for vulnerable people.  In essence, the practices and models underpinning service provision that were previously acceptable are no longer so.  It is important to note that Covid-19 has not in itself signalled the need for regulatory reform; rather, it has shone a spotlight on an issue that was already in need of urgent consideration.</p> <p>  As a consequence of our experience as a regulator in the sector, HIQA has submitted its views to the Government on how regulations and enforcement in the interim of wider regulatory reform could be enhanced with a view to strengthening key areas related to the pandemic, for example, infection prevention and control, staffing, governance and clinical oversight.  Therefore, our report on regulatory reform should be seen as contributing to the development of a wider social care strategy and national policy, separate and distinct from any immediate or interim requirements related to Covid-19. </p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s report on the need for regulatory reform recognises that social care in Ireland is changing.  The institutional and residential approaches towards the provision of care for older people and people with a disability are being challenged.  Although Covid-19 has highlighted deficiencies in the legislation which regulates social care services, many weaknesses have persisted in recent years, due in large part to the evolving nature of service provision.  </p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s experience of inspecting centres and assessing compliance with regulations and standards has produced a wealth of knowledge on the quality and safety of services.  It has also allowed us to develop insights into how the regulatory framework is serving the interests of people who use and provide services.  This report outlines some key regulatory areas which require a dynamic, all-encompassing national health and social care strategy and policy development.  These include the reform of the Health Act 2007 to take account of the changing landscape in health and social care services; a comprehensive review of the current regulations pertaining to health and social care services in Ireland, and the establishment of a regular review process; the introduction of regulation into other forms of care that are currently unregulated and whose service users may be vulnerable; consideration of the development of a comprehensive, integrated social care policy that considers social care in its totality; and a framework that makes a clear distinction between the purchaser and provider of services along with clear governance and accountability arrangements.</p> <p>  While there has been a justified focus on how we care for older citizens, it is imperative that there are equitable protections for people with a disability in need of social care and support.  Disability service providers continue to explore and develop ways to move citizens currently living in congregated settings into services in the community, in line with national policy.  In September of last year, HIQA published its annual overview report on the inspection and regulation of residential services for people with a disability.  One key finding was that residents living in congregated settings experience a poorer quality of life compared with those who live and receive care and support in community settings.  In developing new residential services, providers have said they want to keep residents within the protection of regulation.  However, the current regulations can be overly restrictive when it comes to the development of innovative new models such as partnerships between other service providers and families to develop individual responses to the care and support of those with complex needs.</p> <p>  HIQA welcomes the Government&rsquo;s intention to make home care available on a statutory basis.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme has outlined the roadmap to transform health and social care provision.  Regulatory reform is necessary to ensure that the services provided have the capacity and capability to deliver care and support that meet people&rsquo;s needs in a manner that offers quality, safety and the protection of people&rsquo;s rights.  There is also a strong argument for the development of an overarching social care policy that sets out core objectives, governance and legislative frameworks across the sector at large.  The development and implementation of such a policy would help integrate diverse forms of social care and serve to complement Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.</p> <p>  HIQA very much welcomes the recommendations contained in the final report of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel of 2020.  It frames clearly the steps which must be taken in order to optimise the response to Covid-19 in care facilities for the elderly.  HIQA will continue to share its knowledge and insights of the sector into the implementation oversight team that was created as a result of the panel&rsquo;s report.</p> <p>  It is HIQA&rsquo;s view that the provision of health and social services should be subject to a regulatory framework which is fit for purpose, adaptable to changing needs and preferences and responsive to risk and concerns for people&rsquo;s welfare.  This may, in part, be achieved by developing a policy that considers social care in its entirety, given that the principal issues are consistent across all populations who use social care services.  HIQA hopes that The Need for Regulatory Reform report forms an integral part of the debate on how we can better care for our citizens into the future.</p> <p>  I thank the committee members for their attention this morning.  We look forward to answering any questions they may have.</p></speech>

It does not always happen.  The first round of questions consists of ten-minute slots.  I call Deputy Colm Burke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#B00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I will open with the issue of bringing public nursing homes up to standard, particularly now because of Covid and the challenges that it has posed.  I understand that 122 HSE public nursing homes were required to meet a certain standard by 2015 and that an extension was granted for six years, bringing the deadline to December 2021.  What is the updated position on those 122 HSE community hospitals or nursing homes?  How many of them will be up to standard by December 2021?  If they will not be up to standard, what proposals are there for dealing with the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#B00600"><p>That is a most important question.  Significant progress has been made through the community nursing programme.  Timings were affected by Covid-19 last year, so some 30% of those identified to be completed, have been completed.  The others are at various stages of development.  It should be noted that in addition, the HSE is examining the current nursing units and their bed supply.  Some &euro;125 million has been provided in 2021 to fund over 1,250 beds in the community.</p><p>The HSE is examining the opportunities for the reconfiguration of a number of beds, taking account of the new model for supporting services in the community and the enhanced level of home care supports this year, amounting to an additional &euro;150 million.  It is anticipated, through that pathway, that about 237 users of the long-stay beds will be provided with care within the community instead.  Therefore, progress is being made.  We can provide a written update on the progress overall if that is helpful.</p></speech>

According to the last set of figures I have seen, there are more than 5,500 people in public nursing homes.  I am not sure how many are affected by not having a suitable physical environment for long-stay individuals.  Maybe we could have a detailed report on that.</p><p>I want to return to an issue I raised in August, or maybe even earlier during the hearings of the Covid committee.  It concerned HIQA and the upskilling of staff.  I asked specifically for information on what occurred between January 2020 and March 2020.  There was an undertaking that I would be given information on preparing staff for dealing with the new challenges.  I never got it.  The last time I saw such information was when I saw it published in the <i>Irish Mirror</i>.  It got the information on foot of a freedom of information request.  My question is on training and upskilling regarding infection control.  A new challenge arose in December last year.  There seems to have been a huge outbreak of Covid in many nursing homes that had not had any outbreak whatsoever in the preceding ten months.  What advices were given to nursing homes once it was identified that there was a new variant of Covid?  What level of contact was there between HIQA and nursing homes in December 2020 and early January 2021?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.456" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phelim Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#C00300"><p>I thank Deputy Colm Burke.  I apologise for any breakdown in communication.  As far as I was aware, the information the Deputy had requested in August had been sent on, but I will check that out.  I am nearly clear in my belief that it was sent through to the Covid-19 committee, but we can get that checked for the Deputy.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Dunnion, who will give the Deputy an update on the preparation and training of staff.  She will also respond on the second part of his question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#C00400"><p>I thank Deputy Colm Burke.  I reassure the committee that all staff employed as inspectors of social services have qualifications in nursing, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy or social care services.  These are the competency requirements at the point of interview.  Thereafter, there is a 12-week induction programme for all newly appointed inspectors that covers all the relevant areas, including the legislative framework, the inspection process and the methodologies.  As Mr. Quinn said, we will certainly ensure the Deputy gets that information requested if he has not received it already.</p> <p>  In the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, the specific training for our inspection staff that has been very targeted relates to the national guidelines from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, in the context of Covid-19 infection prevention and control.  All our staff are trained in that area, and there is ongoing didactic learning and online learning.  There is guidance and there is an assessment framework.  In addition, we have run many webinars for nursing home providers and disability service providers and their staff.  Those webinars covered all aspects of our infection methodology for infection prevention and control.  As Dr. MacLellan said, there has been an increase in our number of inspectors.  We have increased the number by a total of 12 in respect of the nursing home expert panel, and we are currently at the point of induction for many of those positions.  That will increase our inspection activity, with focus on infection control in particular.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we have an internal infection-control training programme.  It is particularly pertinent to the HPSC guidance.  We have had a significant number of webinars, with full attendance from all nursing home providers, on the application of that guidance.</p></speech>

What level of engagement was there in that period?  It is extremely important to address this.  We could have a new challenge next week and it would be a case of how fast we could get the information out to the providers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#C00600"><p>What we saw at the time in question was a completely different response landscape.  With the HSE, we had a formal escalation pathway for any areas we needed to escalate.  We had identified members of the crisis response teams across each CHO area, and we had interaction with all the nursing homes because, as the Deputy knows, reporting of confirmed Covid cases daily is mandated to us.  In the third wave, which was at the time to which the Deputy is referring, we saw enhancements in the responses that were being provided across the community through the CHO areas and we actively engaged and participated in that.  It was a very responsive situation.  We could see that there was significant learning between March 2020 and what happened in December 2020 and onwards.</p></speech>

I introduced a Private Members' Bill on introducing a regulatory framework for home care.  At what stage is the Department on drafting legislation?  When are we likely to see draft legislation?  What is the timeframe for introducing it and putting it into law if we want to introduce a licensing system?</p></speech>

We hope to seek Government approval shortly to move forward with this approach to introducing a licensing framework for professional home support providers.  We have begun the work on the drafting of the legislation.  I am referring to both the primary legislation and the secondary legislation in respect of the regulations that would be needed.  We hope to proceed to stakeholder consultation and public consultation on the regulations in the second quarter of this year.</p> <p>  The third element of the regulatory framework is the development of national standards for home supports providers.  Our colleagues in HIQA are working with us in regard to that.  It will provide the guidance and support for home support providers to enable them to meet their regulatory requirements and to focus on quality improvement in that work.  As Dr. MacLellan said, we hope to progress this significantly this year in terms of seeking Government approval to move ahead with the drafting of the heads of Bills, with a view to having them published, undertaking the comprehensive regulatory impact assessment that would be required as part of that process and then bringing the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity in 2021.</p></speech>

I want to use my time as productively as I can.  I want to start with Mr. Quinn.</p><p>Obviously, if Mr. Quinn needs to refer to his colleagues that is fine but, in terms of a fluid conversation, if Mr. Quinn has the answers, he himself might reply.</p><p> I want to focus in on the powers of enforcement and regulation and the area of accountability when it comes to nursing homes and care homes.  First, would it be the view of Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, that its powers of enforcement are a blunt instrument?</p></speech>

What we have determined over the course of the past 12 years is that our powers of enforcement in the main relate to the imposition of conditions on the registration of registered providers and-or up to cancellation of registration.  Obviously, part of the enforcement armoury includes prosecution, but used always as a last resort.  Within our paper on regulatory reform, we have sought an amendment to the enforcement powers of HIQA to try to bring about some form of graduated approach to improvement within registered providers, for example, that we would be enabled to serve on a non-compliant provider an improvement notice or a non-compliance notice that would provide a staged approach to the enforcement powers that we currently have.  Obviously, we work on an ongoing basis with providers at the point of inspection as well, seeking a positive and constructive response to some of the recommendations that would make.</p></speech>

Essentially, Mr. Quinn is saying that HIQA would want to have the possibility of improvement notices that HIQA could serve.  Would that be similar to what the Health and Safety Authority and the food authority do?</p></speech>

HIQA has the powers of investigation in not only private nursing homes, but all nursing homes.  In terms of the private sector, one of the criticisms that has been levelled at the HSE was that the HSE, as a purchaser of services, did not have sufficient knowledge of the private sector.  I am looking for Mr. Quinn's view on this as the regulator.  Would that be a concern that HIQA would have had?</p></speech>

The fact is the HSE had a limited knowledge of the privately provided elements of the sector simply because the relationship was through the nursing home support scheme and it was mainly a financial arrangement between the nursing home support scheme on behalf of the HSE and private providers on behalf of residents.</p></speech>

However, that knowledge and interaction has built up quite considerably since.  We believe, through our regulatory reform paper, that now needs to be formalised and accountability should sit as well with the purchaser of services as well as the provider of the service.</p></speech>

Would that include looking at such matters as a provider-purchaser agreement and maybe service level agreements to strengthen that level of accountability?</p></speech>

This is something that has come to the fore during the pandemic but it was an issue pre-pandemic as well.  I want brief answers if possible; I merely want to establish the facts.

Mr. Quinn stated at the start that we shone a spotlight on what happened in nursing homes generally.  He quite rightly says that we need a new comprehensive framework of social care and adult safeguarding has to be part of that.</p> <p>  Can I ask the HSE how we have a system where the regulator cannot investigate an individual complaint of abuse or neglect, and where adult safeguarding teams, including social workers, do not have the power to initiate an examination or an investigation?  In this committee and indeed in the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, we dealt with several terrible cases of abuse and neglect.  Thankfully, they were small in number.  The vast majority of nursing homes provided the highest levels of care but there have been cases of neglect and cases of abuse.  It strikes me as extraordinary that we still do not have those powers.  Can I ask the HSE why that is the case?  Can Dr. MacLellan address that point?</p></speech>

On the investigation of individual complaints, as has been outlined by Mr. Quinn, that is not currently within the legislation.  It is, however, a priority for the Department, which is examining how those individual complaints can be investigated, and there is already discussion happening between HIQA and the Department on that.

It is 2021.  Does Dr. MacLellan accept that these were issues for a long number of years pre-pandemic and while Dr. MacLellan is saying we are still looking into this issue, at this point in time neither HIQA nor adult safeguarding teams have the power to investigate complaints of abuse or neglect of individuals?  Is that still the case today?</p></speech>

In addition, it has to be remembered that cases of abuse are criminal matters and also should be subject to reporting to the Garda to be investigated in that way.</p> <p>  The Department is in the process of finalising, and will be going to consultation soon on, a safeguarding policy which will underpin any legislative requirements that are required in relation to legislation for safeguarding teams or for others in the management and assessment of abuse or neglect.  One of the key principles there is prevention to educate and to build the supports that are already there.  Ms O'Neill may want to respond on the safeguarding office and the work there within the HSE.</p></speech>

From previous correspondence Mr. Quinn gave to this committee, I understand that, as the regulator, HIQA wrote on several occasions to the Department and the HSE.  I mentioned that letter in 2013.

Obviously, we want to follow up on all these matters.  Members of the expert panel are present as well, but I did not have enough time to put a question.  I respect the work they have done, but there is a massive amount of work to be done on adult safeguarding, changes to the Health Act 2007 and more powers of enforcement.  All these issues are very important and I echo the call that has been made for a new, comprehensive social care model to be developed and for a more hands-on approach in the relationship between the HSE and private nursing homes.  The out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach, which has been the case, is no longer acceptable.  My last question relates to all nursing homes.  Is the HSE considering or supporting the use of antigen testing in nursing homes at present?  Can anybody from the HSE answer that question?</p></speech>

The safeguarding protective teams in the CHOs respond very proactively to the cases that are made known to us within the legislation and regulation available to us.</p> <p>  On the antigen testing specifically, the guidance on the use of antigen testing is provided to us by NPHET and the antimicrobial resistance and infection control, AMRIC, division.  Currently, there is no proposal for the use of antigen testing in nursing homes.

I understand that NPHET is not necessarily backing it fully at present and that research is taking place, but if a service provider chooses to provide antigen testing, and a number of people have been in contact with me about this, the Covid-19 temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, does not cover it.  Nursing homes are being asked to exclude those costs from any claims they make to the HSE.  Is it the case that we are specifically excluding antigen tests from the allowable costs at present?</p></speech>

The allowable costs are related to the current guidance in place, and antigen testing currently is not recommended for use in nursing homes.  With regard to the recent visiting guidance, significant research and examination by AMRIC and the HPSC were conducted on the use of antigen testing and the available international evidence.  It is being kept under review.  Should the guidance change, obviously eligible costs under TAPS will be considered, but at present the eligible costs under TAPS are aligned to the guidance that is available.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Redmond, might wish to add to that.</p></speech>

The scheme has been set up on the basis of following the existing national guidance relating to public health.  As it is not recommended under the public health guidance, it is not an eligible item at present.  However, if that situation changes, the eligibility of the scheme will be examined.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear about the interest in progressing some of the required legislation relating to home care.  I read the opening statements and submissions and there is mention by both of legislation for the regulation of home care providers and research by the ESRI on how we would finance an increase in the provision of home care in the long term.  I have met a number of advocates for increasing home care services and one of the immediate barriers raised with me is the timely transfer of information and the assessment issues from the service provider, such as the medical facility, nursing homes or the care settings the people are in, to the home care setting.  I presume that requires a review of the home and an assessment of supports.  That would be particularly relevant for people with disabilities, and I have a particular interest in that.  I presume it would need a multidisciplinary team and requires a level of capacity in those settings to carry out that handover moment.  While we have heard a little about the required legislation and the possible funding of it, what actions is the HSE taking now to put structures in place?  What is the capacity among care providers to facilitate the transfer of service users from one setting to another?  It is not the home care setting, but the first step.</p></speech>

It is a key part of the processes that will support any changes in legislation which drive the policy and practice.  It is very important for us in the development of the scheme that we have the supporting assessment process agreed.  There is a well developed proposal on that.  The Deputy probably will be aware of the interRAI as a common assessment framework that can bring a level of clarity and transparency to how individuals are assessed.  In addition, that will be common across the setting where the person could be coming from, perhaps a home, a hospital or a residential rehabilitation or reablement service, and planning to move home.  That integrated decision-making process is a core part of the changes that are happening in the home support scheme, and implementation of the common assessment framework is a key part of that.  Considerable recruitment is taking place with regard to the number of assessors who will have that dedicated function.  It will be an important part of the overall process, an improved process pathway that the Deputy referred to in her question.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions related to what happened in the nursing homes last year.  It makes for sombre reading that 45% of all those who have died in this State of Covid had been in the nursing home setting.  My first question relates to Dr. MacLellan's concluding remark in her opening statement that the HSE national service plan fully recognises pandemic learning and reform requirements, including commitments to commence planning towards a longer term rebalancing of public and private nursing home mix.  There is a disparate mix in nursing home ownership in that 80% is private and only 20% is public.  What does Dr. MacLellan mean in terms of the rebalancing of the public and private mix?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#F00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The HSE is looking at a reform framework for long-term residential care, including opportunities for increasing direct public provision in relation to long-term residential care which will decrease some reliance on the private sector, but also looking at the types of long-term residential care that are being provided.  One of the big learnings we would all take on board is that if we can reduce the number of congregated settings for people to live in that would be helpful in terms of protecting them around infection prevention and control.  The HSE is looking at ideas such as support villages, own-door services and different types of configurations of long-term residential care.  It has committed to that and there has been significant funding put in place to look at new types of intermediate care, rehabilitation beds within the community and expanding home care as well.  </p> <p>  Part of the planning around the statutory home care scheme requires that we would look at care of the older person as a new model such that there will be a continuum of care and it is not the case that automatically the decision is made that a person would go to long-term care or receive home care.  As described by Ms O'Neill, the decision-making will start with the standard assessment tool, which will look at the needs of older people and, in deciding those needs, look to what supports can be provided within the community, moving towards long-term residential care, as needed.  The new home first model is already being tested by the HSE.  The goal will be to reduce the number of people within long-term residential care and the length of time that they would spend there such that the admissions would be appropriate and then to look to the broader provision of both by the HSE in terms of publicly provided long-term care.</p></speech>

In her opinion, was our over-reliance on the private service a factor in the disproportionate number of people who died in this State in nursing homes?  I think a public inquiry-type investigation is needed on this issue, during which might come out in the wash the reason for the catastrophic response in terms of nursing home deaths.  What can be learned from what happened last year to ensure it never happens again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.523" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#F00900"><p>We have significant learning from the nursing home expert panel in regard to the types of causal factors.  One of the particular learnings which has been seen through the work of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the expert panel is that the level of community transmission is significantly important in terms of the level of transmission within nursing homes.  There is a piece of work nearing completion.  It is a recommendation of the nursing home expert panel that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, with HIQA would examine the risk factors and protective factors in the transfer of Covid-19 into nursing homes.  As I said, that work is nearing completion and will be published shortly.  That will be significant and supportive in terms of learning going forward.</p> <p>  One of the other learnings, which we have validated through a number of pieces of work, is that the level of transmission and the level of mortality when looked at proportionally are not similar across the private and public nursing homes, but the proportional balance between private and public is leaning towards the private sector.  We have to acknowledge the significant supports that have been put in place.  The Deputy spoke about the model of care.  The nursing home expert panel particularly recommended a stronger integration of both public and private services going forward.  The HSE and the panel are fully committed to that and work has commenced on how it can be delivered.</p></speech>

In regard to the deaths that took place in nursing homes, what is the breakdown in respect of the private nursing homes and those operated by the HSE?  Is a breakdown of deaths in those settings available?  There was an issue around staffing levels in private nursing homes in particular, in respect of which I have heard some horror stories that I do not have time to go into now.  Is there a breakdown available of the deaths that occurred in private nursing homes and public nursing homes?</p></speech>

The data that is collected as part of statutory notifications from HIQA is around unexpected deaths and so it is not specific to Covid-19.  However, there was a pattern that emerged during 2020 and early 2021 which would be indicative of the impact of Covid-19 within the residential care sector.  I will hand over to my Ms Cliffe who might be able to give the Deputy some further detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Cliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#F01200"><p>The number of unexpected deaths notified to the chief inspector from March 2020 to date is 2,721.  Again, these are unexpected deaths.  The HPSC is the definitive data collector with regard to Covid-related deaths.  Of the 2,721, 413 occurred in the public facilities and 2,308 occurred in the private facilities.  This is broadly similar to the percentage breakdown for private versus public services in the sector.</p></speech>

Can any of them offer some insight on the following issue?</p><p>Some weeks ago, there was a radio interview about the uptake of the vaccine among staff working in nursing homes.  There was discussion around offering prizes and so on to tempt people into taking up the offer.  Has there been any improvement or are there still people resisting it?  Has the AstraZeneca debacle had any impact?  Is there confidence that the vast majority of staff been vaccinated and only a small minority are not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#G00200"><p>On nursing homes, we understand there has been an extremely high level of uptake both among residents and staff.  There may be staff who, for medical or other reasons, have not taken up the vaccine but our information is that there has been an extremely high level of uptake.  Compared with international rates, our healthcare staff have really stood up to the plate in taking up vaccinations in the interests of the safety of the residents and patients they look after.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#G00300"><p>That is very positive.  I recalled hearing that piece which was worrying but it is good to hear there is a high uptake.</p> <p>  Following an earlier question around care of the older person, the new model and needs for older people and support in the community, what would be the ideal timeline for that happening?  We keep hearing about reports and so on but how long is reasonable for this sort of shift to happen?  The HSE is trialling supports in the home.  What is the time line for that and for reducing numbers in homes?  Ideally, what number would this be reduced by?  It might be pie in the sky thinking but what would be a good measure of its success?   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#G00400"><p>We have started and are already progressing moving that model forward.  The level of investment and commitments made in the service plan for 2021 are already starting that significant shift.  We expect the funding provided for significant re-ablement beds and home first would keep around 250 people in the home rather than their being transferred into long-term residential care.  If we see that indicator coming through by the end of the year, it will give us a real sense of confidence moving into 2022 about what can be achieved and delivered safely within the system.</p> <p>  I am not in a position to put a percentage reduction on the number admitted to long-term residential care.  That is something we need to look at internationally and see what a reasonable approach would be.  The average length of stay can be up to three years in long-term residential care.  We would really like to see that reduced.  In some countries, that stay is around 18 months.  I will ask Ms O'Neill to follow up on the HSE commitments and developments.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.534" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#G00500"><p>The year of Covid has slightly complicated what we can interpret from trends.  The home support services have increased by about 20% in the levels provided between 2019, 2020 and 2021.  As we tilt towards an enhanced availability of services and a more enhanced packages of care for people in the home, we should watch what its impact is for the people choosing.  Something we should mention also, in regard to previous discussions here, is that people should have the choice.  People will make choices about going into nursing homes.  When they do, the law is that the contract is between the resident and the nursing home.  How the HSE makes services available and how ourselves and HIQA have oversight is dependent on that law being that the relationship being between the nursing home and the resident.  When a person chooses what it is they would like for their next phase of care, what we want to do, as my colleague, Dr. MacLellan, outlined, is provide a level of choice.  The trends in applications for nursing home care are complicated by the Covid context so it will probably be next year before we can see how the relationship progresses between the proportion of home support and residential care.</p></speech>

What is the reality of this shift?  There will be a cost to it and the reconfiguration of community supports and structures as well as costs to individuals and homes.  There is also something of a culture shift.  Ms O'Neill mentioned choice.  It is obviously not simply a choice between the individual and the nursing home, hopefully there will also be a whole family structure around the individual.  How will people adapt to that?  For many, including my own family, it is an ideal to try to keep people in the home but the reality can be very difficult.  Will this succeed in reality?  It is tied to the commitment from Government because it is an expensive project.  It is very important and worthwhile, and one which I am happy to see, but it will require a huge political commitment and investment.  What is the likelihood of it really succeeding, either from the Government perspective or bringing people with us?</p></speech>

The opportunity to hear families' voices and the voices of individuals will be critical in developing good policy.  There has already been some consultation on that and there is a broader NGO group which Ms Cooney works with on developing the statutory scheme.  That is absolutely critical.  Very important research is being undertaken by the ESRI which has a significant wealth of expertise and experience looking at demand and capacity models.  It would be useful if Ms Cooney could give a short description of that.</p></speech>

The first is on demand for a home care scheme, looking at the parameters that may be involved.  The second is using the ESRI SWITCH model to examine the possible cost of a scheme and taking on board full Exchequer funding and various models that may include user contribution.  A third report is to come out in the third quarter which will examine the cost of non-acute care in the community, including home care and other elements such as long-term residential care and primary care.  That will enable decisions on the financing model.  As Dr. MacLellan and Ms O'Neill mentioned, a large piece of work is being done this year around a reformed model of service delivery.  As part of that, we are testing what might be included in a statutory home care scheme, in particular looking at the data that comes out of interRAI.  As Ms O'Neill said, approximately 130 assessors will be put across the community in the community health networks to get national coverage.  We will examine the data that comes out of that and try to map the needs of our population against that and the services they may require.  It will also examine broader elements, including the clinical governance and other models that may be needed to support this in the community, and look at areas such as the evaluation and the monitoring of the home first approach.  We are also working with our colleagues in Sl&aacute;intecare around the enhanced community care and the roll-out of the community health networks which will provide the architecture and the primary care team that will be needed to support this broader model of care to support older people and other people with care needs in their homes.  A significant amount of work is ongoing this year and we hope to have the evaluation and data throughout this year and moving into 2022.</p></speech>

There was clearly a breakdown of some sort or a lack of co-operation between HIQA and the Department of Health.  That is serious because smooth engagement and synergies are important with that.  </p><p> I will concentrate on younger people in nursing homes.  There are younger people who do not have mental health challenges in nursing homes, which could easily lead to mental health difficulties.  A young person with a physical disability of whatever sort in a nursing home with older people because that is the only care that can be identified for that person is not in a good environment.  I ask Dr. MacLellan how many people under 65 are in nursing homes.  What is the Department doing to eliminate this practice and find more suitable accommodation for these young people?</p></speech>

Those in nursing homes tend to have complex care so there is a need for various levels of support for them.  Our understanding of the number of under 65s in nursing homes is, and I may not be fully correct on this, that it is around 1,300.  My colleague in the HSE may be able to correct me on that.  A number of those placed there are not inappropriately placed.  Particular decisions have been made that they are appropriate placements.  For those for whom care in the community is considered preferable, there has been consideration within the current service plan and some funding has been provided to start examining this year those under 65 in nursing homes and how they can transition back into the community.</p></speech>

Dr. MacLellan is right.  We are basing this on the numbers available to us through the nursing homes support scheme because we do not have sight of the numbers who have an arrangement directly with the nursing home not funded through the scheme.  There are about 1,330 under-65s.  In direct answer to the question, I cannot tell the Senator the numbers who are currently inappropriately placed.</p> <p>  We are working in regard to the funding made available to offer alternatives to those in nursing homes under 65 who are fit to avail of those alternatives.  We are working with the profile.  There are complex cases.  Some 50% of those are over 55 and 85% of the 1,330 are over 50.  If we were to go on age, which could be a place to start, we would target the youngest.  It is a piece of work that is part of the national service plan, NSP, we have agreed with Government with some funding this year.</p></speech>

I would describe all of their placement in nursing homes as inappropriate.  Is there a specific unit in the HSE or the Department of Health working to eliminate this and come up with more appropriate solutions for, in the first instance, that 200 and, moving forward, those under 65?</p></speech>

The work has started.  It is not just an age issue.  It is on the basis of complexity of need.  We want to be careful that being under 65 is not a criterion by itself.  It should be on the basis of need and the care assessment.  We have started that work this year with initial investment which will allow us move a number - probably up to 20 people - this year.  We will continue that as investment is provided.  Obviously, that----</p></speech>

I am dealing with a couple of cases of people whose absolute desire is not to be in nursing homes.  I agree with them that it is not appropriate they should be there.   It is going on for years and is totally wrong.  It is destroying them mentally.  They feel hopeless, that they do not have any future and that nobody really cares.  It needs to be a top priority to take people out of those wrong settings and give them some sort of independent living with the necessary supports.</p></speech>

When we inspect a nursing home, we look to see if the care needs of the resident are being met, including their psychosocial needs.  Where incidents are identified or inappropriate placements are brought to our attention, we engage with the registered provider on that.  We look to see that person has access to an advocate and a multidisciplinary team, including a social care worker, and we look at what the provider can do to increase the provision made to support the person's needs.  They may need access to a personal assistant to assist them to integrate into their community and issues like that.  These issues have been made more difficult during Covid but this is an area we remain focused on and are addressing as we go forward through our inspections.</p></speech>

There are also 978 beds in what we call the voluntary facilities.  These are funded under section 38 or section 39.  Again, just to be clear, these are the numbers of beds in the total 574 centres.  They may not necessarily all be occupied at the moment but if they were full, that would be the total number of residents.</p></speech>

This evidence may come from a resident or a relative whom we meet and speak to during the inspection.  It may come from information we see in a complaints log.  It may come from information we see in a resident's record.  It may come from an allied healthcare professional working in the designated centre.  There is a good reporting process throughout the sector.  This is seen in the almost 15,000 notifications we received in 2020.</p> <p>  Another factor for us can be the absence of notifications.  If we have a centre from which we do not receive notifications it might equally be a flag for us and we would go looking for further information about it.</p></speech>

In the preparation work for going out on inspection, every inspector will review the information we have regarding a centre.  This will include its notifications and any unsolicited information we have received about the centre or any outside information we may have received.  If there is an absence, and some centres may not have had any unsolicited information or notifications, then we will explore that with the provider.

We were doing more than the baseline expectation.

There are some nursing homes where we have had a concern that may have had three, four or five inspections during a given period.  If the profile of the nursing home and the information we had regarding that nursing home mandated an increased requirement for inspections then we have provided and undertaken those inspections.  I agree with the Deputy that the more inspections we have, and the more often people go into nursing homes to carry out the baseline inspections, the better we will be.  This is the position we are moving towards with an increased inspection regime.  We have been allocated additional posts and we have already gone through the process of recruitment.  Approximately seven have come on board and we expect to have brought all the posts on board by the end of the second quarter of this year.</p></speech>

When we were going out, we were inspecting against regulations that we now see had significant shortcomings.  It is not so much the frequency of the inspections but the quality of the tools of the legislative framework against which we could inspect.  This is why we very much welcome this engagement now and are actively engaging with the Department to drive the process of regulatory reform in order that we have more effective tools available to us to drive the quality of care in nursing homes and to increase the impact of the inspections we carry out in these nursing homes.</p></speech>

A small group of people, normally five or six, visited on a fairly regular basis.  We were directed by the authorities based on continuous observance of the situation whatever it was, whether it was a public or private institution.  We usually made decisions on the spot.  In other words, if something needed to be done it was done then or within 24 hours.  If it was not done within 24 hours we called on the authorities to close down the facility instantly.  My point is that it is fine to say we need more legislation but we did not have legislation and we did it just the same.  There was no legislation to allow the offenders, for want of a better description, whether in the public or private sector, to engage in any way and prevent what was required to be done.  We went through an awful lot of changes and brought about an awful lot of changes in that period.</p><p>Is it possible to act with more alacrity when something comes to the attention of the authorities?

An immediate action plan is something we identify during the inspection and bring to the attention of the provider.  We require the provider to address it immediately.  An urgent action plan may take longer and may have a 24, 48 or 72 hour or two-week period, depending on the issue identified.  The vast majority of providers will address an issue such as that when it is brought to their attention.  We have greater difficulty with some providers in getting the necessary changes we have on the centre.  We have to work within the legislative framework available to us when those difficulties arise.  We have faced significant challenges to the legislative framework in the last two years and have undergone three judicial reviews of our powers.</p> <p>  It is important to note the vast majority of providers work with the regulator and are anxious to deliver the best possible service.  When we bring something to their attention, they address it immediately or as soon as possible.  We have to work within our legal framework when there are difficulties.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for Dr. MacLellan.  She referred to 68 open outbreaks, down from 178.  While the decline is welcome, the figure seems somewhat high considering the number of vaccinations that have taken place.  Will Dr. MacLellan describe those outbreaks?  Are they less severe than previous outbreaks?  Are they among residents who have been vaccinated or staff?</p></speech>

Some outbreaks remain of concern and are receiving ongoing support from the Covid-19 response teams, HIQA and across the HSE.  We expect the outbreaks will be closed fairly quickly given the length of time some of them have been open.  We have seen a quick and dramatic drop in the number of open outbreaks.  It is likely due to the vaccination effect and the reduction in numbers of cases in the community.</p> <p>  The other important point to note is that full effect of the vaccination does not come into play until two weeks after the second dose.  It is likely some people who have contracted Covid-19 were at a particular place in the vaccination programme.</p></speech>

Hopefully it will but as we have seen, Covid-19 has a level of unpredictability.  However, the trends we are seeing indicate we will quickly see a reduction in the number of open outbreaks over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

One thinks of one's own mortality at 45 and would like to stay at home while it is safe to do so.  However, illness, strokes, heart attacks and debilitating illness get in the way.</p> <p>  Could a model of small, single-level, clustered community units with a communal area for residents and support, as required, be considered as a model between full home care and full residential care?  Would the Department be interested in such a model or one where people are at home by day and attend such a facility or nursing home by night, with family supervision, if possible?  Much of that depends on supports at home.  Not all families have children.  Could this model be considered?  When will a discussion on future models take place and when will decisions be made on a change in approach?</p></speech>

Its current policy is to see a broad opportunity for the types of housing options that could be supported within the community.  It is important they are set up with the types of supports needed from the statutory home care scheme and elsewhere.</p> <p>  Early last year, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government agreed a policy options paper with the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Jim Daly, on housing options.  An implementation committee for this is up and running.  It is considering joint working across the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Health to examine opportunities to work closely on different types of housing options, potentially within in smaller villages and that provide health supports.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Redmond, has worked in this area and has had the opportunity to see some of those internationally.  I ask him to describe some of that.</p></speech>

It is not just the bricks and mortar piece but the wraparound supports that are required in the community.  We are considering supports such as the support co-ordination services provided through local authorities.  I refer to ALONE in particular and a number of other organisations that provide lower level but important support to keep people at home.  It ranges from meals on wheels to befriending services to check-ins and other important community based supports.</p> <p>  We are doing significant work on how we can increase the provision of meals on wheels, improve the service and expand support co-ordination.  Considerable work has been done on that and the community call in the context of the pandemic and that has given us good insight into the expansion of those services.</p> <p>  We have a programme of work with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on creating the infrastructure of a middle ground between the person's home and the nursing homes.  A pilot project in Inchicore is being developed with a range of stakeholders to find and design a model that will work for the future and to identify how it could be integrated with the home care scheme.  A number of different strands are in development.  As they evolve further, it will be important to bring them all together into a coherent framework around the model of care and type of service we provide into the future.</p></speech>

There are many half-acre sites around the country where granny flats could be constructed and support provided by family members who would look after the individual in their own property.  This would provide security and help with the housing situation.  Many models could be considered in terms of providing supports and the transition between being fully at home and fully in a nursing home setting.  That discussion will be important going forward.</p></speech>

We have brought with us the chair of the expert panel, which has provided us with significant learning across the Covid pandemic, and these are the recommendations on moving forward that have been progressing, so it might be useful if Professor Kelleher had the opportunity to speak about those lessons learned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Cecily Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#L00400"><p>In reviewing this in the first instance, we on the expert panel were very concerned as to what the factors that created risk for development of outbreaks in nursing homes might be.  Clearly, our report is centred on all these things.  The first point to make is that the incidence in the community is a very important driver to risk.  That was true, unfortunately, at the outset of this, when we were dealing with it last spring, and now it has again become very clear that as we have been going through this period, in January and February, community incidence and incidence generally is an important driver.  That is one important factor.  Dr. MacLellan referred earlier to the fact that a report will be published shortly, we hope, which was undertaken jointly between HIQA and the HSE's HPSE and which will look at protective factors and risk factors based on the data that were available.  The international evidence all points us to the fact that this is a very serious, highly contagious infectious disease whose natural history and management were, in the early stages, very important features; that congregated settings are risky environments for a whole variety of reasons related to transmission of risk; and that in the nursing home setting older people and those who have underlying conditions were particularly susceptible.  Of course, there is also the big question of preparedness that was so important then and remains so now.  There are, therefore, a constellation of factors at play here that are very important.  In the first six months of our reviewing preparedness, all the things that required stepping up have been stepped up.  It remains the case, more so than ever, that they should be sustained and that we should have long-term supports in place that would maintain that level of preparedness going into the future.  It was therefore a mixture of factors: the incidence in the wider, general population, the management of the condition, the degree of preparedness in the setting and the fact that congregated settings are inherently risky environments.</p></speech>

We were very clear in our recommendations that we wanted to see an integrated approach to both the public and private sectors in respect of nursing homes.  Our recommendations focused very much on that.  They were very clear on the immediate preparedness response, the importance of having the teams in the community that were up and running and supportive and all the things we have been talking about over the course of the morning, moving towards a new integrated model of care that facilitates choice.</p></speech>

There was the lack of PPE and so on.  Again we are hearing stories in the media of a possible tsunami of cases, litigation cases and so on.  Is the HSE picking up that information?  Has there been any discussions in that regard?</p></speech>

We described them in our report, and many of our recommendations were about addressing them.  I believe services have been stepped up to respond more appropriately since then.  A whole variety of factors need to be addressed, including, for instance, the visitor guidelines, which we have just been made aware of in recent days.  It is therefore very important we would have, as I said, a preparedness into the future but it is required immediately also.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses hear much about long Covid and staff still suffering from long-term symptoms?  Is the incidence of this higher within nursing homes than in, say, the hospital setting or is it on a par, do we know?</p></speech>

I think the importance of the vaccination programme in supporting both the residents and the staff will be very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-03-23a.610" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021032300002#L01100"><p>I thank Professor Kelleher.  There would not be a significant variation between the level of Covid staff leave across the hospital and community sectors.  One thing we experienced at the height of the third wave, in February, was that, on average, an outbreak could result in about 20 staff being on Covid leave.  The good news now in terms of the positive trends that were referred to earlier is that where we have outbreaks, the level and severity, as Dr. MacLellan said, are much lower, so we would be talking about an average of perhaps four staff being on leave.  We will all watch across the system for the impact of what has been termed long Covid.  Certainly, there is both the psychosocial response to which Professor Kelleher referred and occupational health's wider response in terms of continued symptoms and the health sector overall through the chief clinical office.  It is a matter of reviewing what we would envisage is in the response that will be required to that expected long Covid experience.  The other thing about staffing levels, to which the Chairman referred, is that one of the other recommendations arising from the expert panel concerns the workforce planning component for the continued models of care.  That will be a key part of the ongoing work across all the providers.  I just wanted to come back on those two points.</p></speech>

I have had a few IT glitches, but the good old mobile phone is picking up where the laptop failed, so all is good.  I can hear the Chairman and I have been following the debate so I thank him for allowing me in.  I have a few points I wish to put to our panel of witnesses.  I join others in welcoming them today.</p> <p>  A big feature of the first wave of Covid was that GPs were not going into private nursing homes.  It was simply, in their view, too risky to be going into them, offering a level of GP care and then risking transmitting the virus within the broader community.  Of course, there has been a significant ramping up of vaccinations since early January.  I wish to ask our witnesses whether that has improved.  Are the medical needs of people in private nursing homes now being fully met when a GP locally is required to be on site?  Are GPs coming in?  Can they come in?  Is all that being facilitated on site and off site?</p></speech>

Obviously, the GP's direct relationship is with the private nursing home, and there is guidance in place on visits of healthcare professionals to nursing homes and their duties.  One of the real things we saw during Covid was the additional expert support that was needed for nursing homes to support residents, be that geriatrician support, palliative care support or GP clinical support.</p><p>The standing up of the 23 Covid response teams across the CHOs has been a significant game changer in the level of clinical support that has been and continues to be available to nursing homes.  One of the recommendations of the expert panel is that we move to put those teams on a permanent footing within the communities as community support teams and we are at a preliminary stage of considering how we can start that transition phase.  It will provide that there can be a lot more clinical expertise available on an ongoing basis.  That will fit well with the development of the community networks within the community as well.  It will become a much more integrated system across the public and private sectors.</p></speech>

Is there any quarantining happening in nursing homes?  I will be more specific in what I am asking.  I know of a number of cases where an individual may have been discharged from hospital in recent weeks but had not yet been vaccinated for Covid.  Rather than going home, it was deemed necessary that this person would go to a step-down facility, that is, a private nursing home close to the person's residence.  However, the nursing home residents had all been vaccinated.  Therefore, an unvaccinated older person went into a nursing home environment without having been vaccinated.  How is that being catered for within the sector?  That will improve week-on-week as vaccines roll out but are there mechanisms in place to cater for that?  This has caused alarm in cases and people are not aware if there are quarantining or other guidelines in place to mitigate that happening.</p></speech>

That guidance is that any person who is transferring from a hospital to a nursing home should be tested in the few days before transfer.  We do not use the term "quarantining" within the nursing homes but we would say that even if Covid is not detected on that test and even if that person is also asymptomatic, that person should limit his or her movements within the nursing home for 14 days after arrival and that there would be ongoing and regular monitoring of that person for symptoms.  That is the guidance and that has been in place for a period of time, irrespective of and prior to the introduction of vaccination across the nursing homes.</p></speech>

Does it concern the private nursing home sector in particular that as we move towards a model of statutory home care, private nursing homes may be pulling from the same pool of people in terms of employment?  Are there enough care assistants and home carers in our country or about to be trained up in our country to meet the needs of both systems running concurrently?</p></speech>

I would like to point to the fact that through the chief nursing office in the Department, work on the safe staffing framework has commenced.  That task force is in place and it has looked at international models of staffing across nursing homes.  It is examining which model is the closest one that would work in this country and it will look to test that out in this country.  There are two pieces to this.  First is the availability of staff and the strategic workforce planning that is needed there.  Second is the type of staffing model that we want and that we should put in place across the country for the future.  Safe staffing has worked through phase 1 in acute hospitals, phase 2 in emergency departments and phase 3 is under way within the long-term residential care facilities.  It is a welcome development and it will be helpful for the future.</p></speech>

I have heard Dr. McLellan outlining earlier in the meeting that somewhere in the region of 1,300 people in that age bracket are accommodated in nursing homes.  It was broken down in discourse that some were appropriately accommodated and others were inappropriately accommodated.  It is inappropriate for anyone below 65 to be in a nursing home environment and it is injurious to their ongoing mental health needs.</p> <p>  I mention one case in particular which is quite public and has been well flagged in the media and this lady consents to her story being told.  The case in question is that of Jennifer Hynes in County Clare.  She is only about 18 months older than me and she finds herself in Mowlam Healthcare's Ennis Nursing Home.  Ennis Nursing Home is a fine nursing home but it is not fine for her needs.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, has been engaging and helpful in dealing with Jennifer's advocate and in dealing specifically with this case because it is almost a test case in the country.</p> <p>  The problem as I see it in removing someone from a nursing home environment and putting him or her into a more appropriate setting is that the process seems to be HSE-led rather than building around the needs of the individual.  What other barriers does the Department see to unlocking all of this?  The fit for each of these 1,300 people has to be bespoke.  Their needs are separate, apart and specific.  Problems are already showing up in this test case, despite the best efforts of the Minister of State and the staff around her and within the HSE.  There has been a huge effort that we appreciate but the process is about what can be provided rather than being centred around Jennifer's needs.  Are there other barriers that Dr. McLellan can identify that need to be overcome?</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is well made that where somebody is moving it has to be a personalised approach that meets the individual needs of that person in the types of care and supports that can be put in place.  For some people, their care is being provided in nursing homes because it is significant and complex care that needs to be supported.  As we look at the programme of displacement of those with disabilities from congregated settings into the community, it takes a period of time to examine the types of housing and supports that can be put in place that are appropriate and that will meet the needs of individuals as well.  Any type of fast fix for individuals will probably not meet their needs.  It is important that there is a comprehensive review of those needs and then an examination of what supports can be put in place.</p></speech>

Should it be involved earlier in the process?  What I mean by this is that I am aware of a number of nursing homes that have been built and developed perhaps 1 km or 2 km outside of a town or village.  Not everyone in these nursing homes is physically incapacitated.  Many of them need to walk to the village or local shop to buy a newspaper and they cannot do so.  Therefore, they rely on relatives to bring those goods to them and slowly but surely they unintentionally become more institutionalised to that nursing home and they cannot leave its environment because there is no infrastructure to take them to the village.  That is being addressed this week for schoolgoing children.  There is a plan to have schools that are accessible right to the front door and there needs to be something similar put in place for nursing homes.  Is it a deficiency on the part of HIQA that those needs are not identified at the outset when these nursing homes are being developed and planned for and that in many cases they are being developed out of towns and villages where the residents never have a chance of getting to those services that they need to avail of?</p></speech>

There is a significant amount of work under way on population best health needs planning.  This seeks to ensure that we can plan for the future in the types of infrastructure needed and where that needs to be located.  It also seeks to ensure that we plan for ten or 20 years ahead through the national development plans and through other planning so that we can ensure the locations and the make-ups of nursing homes or the types of housing support models meet the needs of those individuals.  I agree that planning for the future and the long-term future is critical.</p></speech>

Some disturbing evidence was heard today about what was happening in nursing homes.  The idea of waiting years for powers to investigate neglect and abuse is concerning.  I hear what the witnesses are saying in that we are in a process that is dealing with that.  There will be recommendations coming from the committee that we need to act on that much more swiftly.</p> <p>  The committee will meet again in public session on Tuesday, 30 March at 9.30 a.m., when it will get a briefing on the administration of the medical card scheme, with officials from the Department of Health and the HSE presenting to the committee.</p> <p>  I apologise again for the glitches and difficulties of a technical nature we have had with the meeting.</p></speech>
