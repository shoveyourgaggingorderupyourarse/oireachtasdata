Deputy Alan Dillon may be joining us late because of parliamentary duties.</p> <p>  I want to begin by welcoming you all to the meeting.  Due to Covid-19 restrictions, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to constitutional requirement that in order to participate in the public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House.  While we hope to return to more traditional meeting arrangements soon, I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure that they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to this committee, and he is joining us remotely.  </p></speech>

This engagement is limited to two hours.  We will meet with the HSE again at the same time next week.  For today's meeting, the HSE has been advised that the areas in which the committee has an interest include Covid-19 procurement and related expenditure, as well as the HSE&rsquo;s integrated financial management statement and procurement system.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials of the HSE: Mr. Paul Reid, CEO; Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. John Swords, national director of procurement; and, Ms Mairead Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.  We are also joined remotely from outside of Leinster House by Mr. John O'Grady, principal officer at the Department of Health.  They are all very welcome.  </p> <p>  Before we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones while not contributing, so that they do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House, as regards references which they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, one of today's witnesses is giving their evidence remotely from a place outside parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  The witness has already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government, or Minister of the Government, or the merits or objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice that they should comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcast and debates services, I ask members to direct their questions to a specific witness.</p><p>Where a question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask that the witnesses responding state their names the first time they contribute.</p><p> I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021091600002#B00200"><p>The HSE's financial statements for 2020 reflect the exceptional challenges faced by the organisation during the year.  Total expenditure in 2020 was just over &euro;21 billion, an increase of more than &euro;3 billion, or 17.5%, compared with 2019.  The key driver for that increased expenditure was, of course, the HSE's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  At the year end, the HSE's operating surplus for the year amounted to &euro;200 million.  In accordance with the Health Act 2004, this surplus was retained by the HSE and carried forward to 2021.</p> <p>  As in past years, the bulk of the HSE's funding in 2020 came in the form of Exchequer grants from the health Vote, amounting to a total of &euro;20.5 billion, including more than &euro;1 billion in funding for capital projects.  In addition, the HSE is permitted to retain employee superannuation contributions, which amounted to around &euro;352 million in 2020.  The main other source of income for the HSE was receipts of &euro;328 million in respect of patient charges for hospital treatment or for long-term residential care.</p> <p>  Just under one third of the expenditure in 2020, or &euro;6.45 billion, related to HSE salary and pension costs.  A further &euro;5.44 billion of grant funding was allocated by the HSE to what are called the section 38 and section 39 agencies.  More than one fifth of the spending, or &euro;4.4 billion, was on various non-acute schemes, including the medical card scheme and the nursing home fair deal scheme.</p> <p>  In Note 1(b) to the financial statements, the HSE has disclosed estimates of the expenditure incurred in 2020 on key items directly related to dealing with the pandemic.  These included purchases of personal protection equipment, PPE, additional grant funding to section 38 and 39 bodies, payments to secure access to private hospitals, additional fees paid to doctors and GP practices, and additional laboratory costs arising from Covid testing. </p> <p>  My report on the audit for 2020 is longer than normal.  In the report, I draw the attention of users of the financial statements to a number of unusual transactions for the year, or to significant matters disclosed by the HSE.  To save time, I will only briefly outline the matters here, but further detail is given in the audit report, and the relevant sections of the financial statements are cross-referenced.</p> <p>  The Members will recall the efforts made, especially at the commencement of the pandemic restrictions, to secure supplies of appropriate PPE.  The HSE spent more than &euro;900 million on the procurement, transport and storage of such supplies.  Much of the purchasing occurred in the early months of the pandemic when demand internationally outstripped supply and prices were abnormally high.  At year end, a significant amount of the material purchased - around two thirds in terms of cost - remained unused and in storage.  At the request of the Minister, the HSE engaged a consultancy firm to carry out an examination of the systems and controls employed in regard to the sourcing, management and usage of PPE items in 2020.  The report on that examination was being finalised around the same time as the audit.  I expect there will be important lessons from that examination on the effectiveness of procurement controls and stock management on the achievement of value for money.</p> <p>  I draw attention to two material charges in the financial statements in regard to PPE procurement that represent losses of value.  First, the HSE has recognised a charge of &euro;64 million in respect of the anticipated obsolescence of around 2.5 million disposable protective suits that were held in stock at the year end, and which the HSE estimates will not be used within their projected shelf life.  The HSE has stated that the suits were purchased when there was a shortage of more clinically appropriate gowns.</p><p>Second, the financial statements include an impairment charge of &euro;310 million, reflecting the change in unit prices between when PPE stocks were purchased, and the year-end.  This represents a 63% write-down in value in the items in store at the year-end.</p><p> The statement on internal control also discloses that advance payments of &euro;81 million were made to ten companies with which orders were placed for the supply of ventilators.  The HSE had not dealt with any of the companies previously.  Some of the orders were fulfilled but following testing, the HSE decided that the ventilators it had received were not suitable for use as intended.  The outstanding orders were cancelled, and refunds were sought.  At the reporting date, the HSE had not received value or refunds in respect of the full amount prepaid.  A provision in the amount of &euro;42.5 million was made in this regard in the revenue income and expenditure account.  My office is continuing to examine the circumstances surrounding the prepayments and the related attempts at procurement of ventilators.  Depending on the outcome of that examination, I may report further on this matter in due course.</p><p> In previous years, I reported that a significant amount of the normal procurement of goods and services undertaken by the HSE appeared to be non-compliant with the relevant procurement rules.  The HSE has undertaken to develop systems designed to monitor and report on this, and has made significant improvements in that regard.  The statement on internal control acknowledges that non-compliance with procurement rules remains a significant issue for the HSE and discloses that the estimated rate of non-compliant procurement in 2020 was 10%.  However, I concluded that this may not be properly representative of the scale of the underlying problem of non-compliant procurement due to the exceptional procurement in 2020 and residual limitations in the HSE&rsquo;s estimation methodology.</p><p> The statement on internal control also discloses that significant weaknesses in internal controls at one of the executive&rsquo;s hospitals resulted in an alleged payroll fraud by an individual staff member that continued over a long period.  The matter has been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The HSE has been rolling out a single national HR and staff records system, and work on this was a significant factor in identifying the alleged fraud.  The HSE is confident that full roll-out of the system will mitigate the risk of payroll fraud in the future.</p><p> As members are aware, in May 2021, the HSE suffered a very serious ransomware attack on its ICT systems resulting in severe disruption to the delivery of services and unauthorised accessing of personal and patient data.  In the statement on internal control, the HSE discloses that internal audits had previously identified weaknesses in the area of ICT security controls and sets out the steps that were being taken to address the concerns identified.  Because the security breach happened after the period of account, it does not impact the financial statements for 2020.  However, it did coincide with and disrupt the finalisation of the audit of those financial statements.  I would like to acknowledge the exceptional effort and flexibility of the HSE&rsquo;s financial team and of my own audit team in working around the disruption and in finding ways to minimise the delay in making audited financial statements available.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021091600002#C00300"><p>I presume the members can hear me okay.  I am grateful for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss the HSE annual report and financial statements for 2020, and other matters. I am joined today by my colleagues: Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. John Swords, national director of procurement; and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.</p> <p>  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and I will therefore confine my opening remarks to the following issues, starting with the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.  Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020, by which time the HSE had already initiated emergency management protocols and had convened its national crisis management team.</p> <p>  We set up several very large work programmes, advancing each one at pace and in parallel.</p><p>In the face of the most difficult market conditions imaginable our procurement team set about ensuring that we had enough PPE and hospital equipment.  From an effective standstill position, we built a national testing and contact tracing service and, latterly, an exceptionally efficient national vaccination programme.  We also prepared our hospitals to meet the additional demand, while safeguarding essential services.  Finally, we entered into agreements with private hospitals and with GPs to support our acute and community services when we were in surge.</p><p> All areas of health and social care were impacted as a result of the pandemic.  The committee will recall that in March 2020, on the advice of NPHET all non-essential surgery, procedures and other non-essential services were curtailed.  This necessary decision was not without consequences for people, but it did allow the health system to care for patients falling seriously ill with Covid-19.</p><p> I am immensely proud of the commitment and the courage shown by our staff during this pandemic.  Any perception that the HSE is slow or reluctant to change has clearly been demonstrated not to be the case.  Our healthcare workers were enthusiastic adopters of new initiatives to protect our patients and the public.  There has been some commentary that Covid-19 masked an underlying resistance to change in the health service.  On the contrary, I believe that it brought out the best in all our teams in terms of flexibility, agility and adapting to change at pace.  Front-line staff in particular bore witness to the tragedy of lives abruptly cut short by this pandemic.  Very sadly, cherished colleagues also succumbed to the virus in the course of helping others.  More than 5,135 people have died in Ireland as a result of Covid-19 and that is a sobering statistic indeed.</p><p> In terms of the financial outturn for 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic placed significant pressure on funding and expenditure during 2020.  The HSE's overall reported income for 2020 of &euro;20.265 billion includes once-off net additional funding allocation of just over &euro;2.3 billion, of which just over &euro;2.1 billion was used to cover 2020 Covid-19 costs, with the remaining &euro;200 million allocated to winter plan funding.  The additional funding has been used across a number of key areas and initiatives, most of which continue to be fundamental to the Covid-19 response, including: testing and contact tracing; GP Covid-19 response; the temporary payment assistance scheme, TAPS, for private nursing homes; the purchasing of private hospital capacity; the procurement of PPE and vital medical supplies; winter planning initiatives and activities; and capital costs in respect of testing centres, step-down facilities and enabling works to curtail Covid transmission.  The HSE's annual financial statements for 2020 record a final audited revenue income and expenditure surplus of &euro;200.7 million.</p><p> A major element of HSE expenditure in 2020 related to the successful sourcing of vital PPE supplies.  The cost of this PPE exceeded &euro;900 million, of which &euro;738 million was charged to the income and expenditure account in 2020.  Included in this charge is a figure of &euro;374 million related to the write-down to net realisable value of year-end stocks, including the write-off regarding future obsolescence of protective suits.</p><p> On the implementation of the 2021 National Service Plan, NSP, the 2021 NSP for the HSE was published on 24 February 2021 with increased funding of &euro;3.5 billion, 21% up on 2019.  This included an additional &euro;1.68 billion for Covid-related costs.  The remaining &euro;1.8 billion represented an underlying increase of 10.6% in core health spending compared to 2020, which is well ahead of the average annual increase of 7.3% received across the years 2016 to 2020.  A total of &euro;1.1 billion of this additional investment will deliver permanent and enduring improvements in healthcare arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p><p> In terms of the summary financial position for 2021, the general Government planning assumptions for budget 2021 was level 3 across the country in terms of Covid-19 restrictions or better, for the full year, and no vaccination programme.  The detailed targets within NSP 2021 were largely set in that context.  The revenue financial position at the end of June 2021 shows a year-to-date deficit of just over &euro;190 million or 1.9%, with a significant element of this being driven by the direct impacts of the third surge.</p><p> In summary terms, Covid-19 and the cost of responding to it has been significantly higher than planned for and this has, to a large extent, caused and been offset by regrettable delays in our capacity to progress with developments to permanently strengthen the health service.  These developments will continue to be progressed to the end of 2021 and into 2022.</p><p> The cyberattack on the 14 May had a profound effect on the delivery of services across the HSE, and coupled with Covid-19, has put further pressure on our efforts to deliver new service developments.  Based on the first six months data and a preliminary view of draft July data, the HSE remains on course to achieve a substantial break-even by the end 2021 on our overall revenue budget.</p><p>Subject to relevant assumptions, this would be the third year in a row that the HSE has operated within or marginally below its budget, having delivered small surpluses in both 2019 and 2020.  </p><p> Service planning for 2022 will be significantly more complex than in previous years.  Services have been reconfigured in response to the Covid-19 crisis and it is as yet unclear in some areas what the effect of Covid-19 will be on the overall capacity levels of HSE services in 2022.  It is likely that many of the initiatives put in place in response to Covid will need to be continued for a variety of reasons in 2022. </p><p> I assure the members of this committee of the HSE&rsquo;s commitment to implementing all aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The board and the executive are united in our determination to realise Sl&aacute;intecare's vision of a single-tier health service and social healthcare system where everyone has equitable access to services based on need and not ability to pay.</p></speech>

I express my thanks and appreciation to him and the HSE staff for their efforts over the past year and a half.  Front-line staff were tested and they stepped up to the plate.</p> <p>  The lead speaker today is Deputy Carthy, who has 15 minutes.  The second speaker will be Deputy Verona Murphy, who will have ten minutes.  All other speakers will have five minutes.  I hope we are moving towards the end of conducting meetings virtually.  I hope we will be able to do better in terms of time in the coming weeks and that people will be present in the committee room.  As our time is limited, I will keep committee members to their time and allow them to come in a second time.  I call Deputy Carthy.</p></speech>

I am going to deal with the issue of procurement but, before I do, I acknowledge that every member of this committee and every member of the public recognises that Covid presented unique challenges.  Normal expectations did not apply but that did not mitigate the need for basic due diligence to be in place.</p> <p>  This committee has asked on a number of occasions when the review of the 2019 procurement will take place and I ask that question again of Mr. Reid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021091600002#E00400"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for his comments, which we will relay to the staff and acknowledge in the context of procurement in general.  We had been progressing the 2019 review in the early stages of 2020.  Subsequently, major elements of our resources moved from procurement to Covid.  Many resources were redeployed to support our front-line activities against Covid.  Our assessment during 2020 was that we would do the assessment on the basis of the figures for 2020.  We have done that assessment and it has been provided in the full report.  We do not have the detail for 2019.  We have made the pragmatic judgment that the best data available to be most efficient were for 2020.  That detail has been provided to the committee.</p></speech>

We want to focus on the detailed findings of the thorough and diligent assessment of 2020.  That informs us better in terms of the big, key challenges we have in procurement.  I acknowledge those challenges.  There are legacy challenges that we are going to address through a range of initiatives.  Our response will be based on the full detail of our assessment for 2020.</p></speech>

We will continue to do so.  The detailed assessment of 2020 that was done was intended to get a better and deeper insight across all services and divisions within the HSE.  The assessment has given us those details.  In terms of baseline activity, we have extracted great Covid-related detail.  We can look at our baseline activity for 2020.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Mulvany, the chief financial officer, to make a brief comment on that matter.</p></speech>

As the CEO has indicated, we could not finish that because of Covid.  We did it for 2020.  We acknowledge the point made by the Deputy in terms of Covid versus non-Covid.  In the analysis for 2020, we have separated out Covid versus non-Covid and have provided those figures, so we would not disagree with the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment that the overall figure of 10% is unlikely to be representative overall.  We have already started the work and planning around the 2021 exercise.  Our sense is that we need to focus on that.  To be clear, going back to 2019 would not be practical but we are also very clear and upfront.  We have lost ground due to Covid.  We have fewer contracts under management and spend under cover now because of Covid and Brexit before it because we diverted our procurement staff as we then did.  We see little value in going back to 2019 because we know we have lost ground since then.  The focus is on what we are doing now, which is planning the 2021 exercise, which we will seek to do in more detail.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, we covered &euro;25,000 and above, which is the norm in the public sector.  We will go below &euro;25,000 in what we are doing for 2021.  It does not make sense to us to divert the limited resources we have to look at 2019.  The aim is to move forward, do 2021 next and build on what we have done so far.</p></speech>

In other words, it was either competitive or it was compliant without the requirement to be competitive.  Therefore, 18% was non-compliant.</p></speech>

As far as I am aware, although Mr. Swords can tell me more, one company is taking legal action against the HSE and there are a number in respect of which we are involved in or considering legal action concerning a variety of items, some of which have already been referenced in the opening statements.

There is a distinction then - we can hear this in the CFO's responses - between being non-compliant and being non-competitive, and that presents a number of particular challenges.  When you are in a process that is non-competitive, I think there is a need for additional diligence, even when we are in the midst of an emergency.  We know that the HSE paid &euro;81 million for 2,200 ventilators.  We are told 1,735 of those were never delivered and none of them was ever used.  Has the HSE managed to recoup any of that &euro;81 million that we paid?</p></speech>

We acknowledge we have significant work to do on our procurement processes overall, and there has been a very significant commitment by the executive team on our board to set out a range of actions, which we have covered in the report to the Committee of Public Accounts so I will not list them off, but I want to acknowledge that upfront.  It is something we are giving a lot of attention to and something the board is very focused on.</p> <p>  Specifically regarding the ventilators and recovery of cost, I will give a little context from my perspective first.  I know the Deputy has covered this in his opening comments, but it is just to put into context what we were seeking, the volume we were seeking and the context in which we had to commit that spend.  We all know that at the start of this we were dealing with harrowing images from across the world that we were all seeing on our screens.  From an ICU perspective we do not benchmark strongly at all by international comparisons with our ICU facility.  We know about the early forecasts, and I have covered in the opening statement the early predictions that if certain public health actions were not taken, there would be up to 40,000 deaths, potentially.  We knew that was the context we were entering into.  Specifically regarding ventilators, what was happening at that time was-----</p></speech>

With due respect, I asked Mr. Reid whether or not any of that &euro;81 million has been recouped.  We accept the context.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  Specifically regarding the &euro;81 million spend, we can give the Deputy the full breakdown.  The CFO will give it to him.  A significant part of that has been recouped so far.  We have covered the outstanding sum of about &euro;42 million in the AFS.  Since then it has decreased to just about &euro;35 million.  We are expecting imminently recovery of another &euro;11 million; we expect to get that very shortly.  That is the current status of that.  Some other costs expended had been recouped as part of PPE supplies instead, but I will get the CFO to give the Deputy a full breakdown of where that stands right now.  We are not letting up on some of this spend.</p></speech>

As was said in the opening statements, by the time of the report in the AFS there was &euro;42 million of that for which we had not got value.  That means there was &euro;39 million for which we had at that stage got value.  We had got either ICU machines, refunds or conversions to other materials such as PPE, so &euro;42 million was the piece we were working on at that point, which was back in May.  Today the figure is just under &euro;35 million, so we have got value for some of the difference.  As the CEO said, there is a further &euro;11 million or &euro;12 million which is imminently going to arrive in terms of value.  The piece of the &euro;81 million for which we have not got value, to answer the Deputy's question, very shortly will be &euro;23 million, and we are pursuing all avenues to get that.</p></speech>

In fact, of the nine parameters, three were deemed high-risk and there was a note in the document - this is prior to purchase - that there was a risk that expenditure of this magnitude would be wasted and that there were concerns about the quality of the machines.

The material safety data sheet the HSE requested and received did not match what was on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's biological register.

That was subject to discussions between the company and the Department.  We await the outcome.  In the interim period, we have quarantined those products.  They will be in use and, bearing in mind the context we were working in, we took in the products to our national standards.

I know this is difficult because we are still meeting virtually.  I thank them and concur with everything Deputy Carthy said regarding the hard work they have done over a long period.

We can come back to it.  The question I have that seriously raises a red flag for me is why none of the ventilators was ever used.  We got 465 and we paid for 2,200.

We did use a significant proportion of the ventilators we had purchased before this from our traditional suppliers also.  Very briefly, I know the Deputy said she does not wish to discuss context but it is important.  First, we did not have sufficient ventilators by any guesstimate of what was forecast to happen.  Second, the Deputy was asking what the individual unit cost prices for ventilators were and there are two points to make in that regard.  There is a range of-----</p></speech>

During the Covid-19 period we had significant extra consultancy costs across a range of different consultancy houses that support the HSE.</p><p>They were for a range of activities we had to put in place in our response to Covid, a range of supports we had to put in place, a range of testing and tracing processes we had to put in place across the country and for our supports in terms of some of the advice for our vaccination programme.  There was a range of initiative supports from a range, not just EY Ireland.</p></speech>

I will begin with a question for Mr. Reid relating to maternity restrictions.  When will there be a return to pre-pandemic access in all maternity units and hospitals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021091600002#L01200"><p>This is something to which the HSE has given a lot of focus.  We want to ensure that we get to very safe levels.  I understand what the Deputy means when she refers to pre-pandemic.  We have set out a total of nine criteria that we believe would bring us back to pre-pandemic safe levels.  They are across three circulars set out by the chief clinical officer.  We gauge and get feedback from the maternity hospitals about their compliance with those nine criteria.  Our feedback is that, predominantly, all of them are compliant with them.  There are exceptional cases where some maternity hospitals have had to have certain restrictions based on the significantly ageing infrastructure they have.  In fairness, some of that would have been what was in place even pre-2019.  We are very anxious and we recently met many of the patient advocate groups.  We fully understand the frustration and hurt caused for women and their partners in terms of some of those visitations.  We are anxious to resolve that to the greatest level possible.  I will always qualify that by saying our clinicians, consultants and midwives have to take precautions for the protection of women and pregnant women.</p></speech>

However, many people are vaccinated now.  The cross-party women's group in the Oireachtas had a meeting with patient advocates yesterday, some of whom were accessing maternity services as recently as two weeks ago.  They have done an extensive analysis of compliance with the HSE guidelines in the hospitals around the country.  They would contest much of what is being said with regard to compliance.  A couple of examples give me concern.  One is neonatal intensive care units, NICUs.  That part of it is a conversation that, perhaps, has not been had as much as the conversations about stillbirths, early miscarriage and that side of the maternity experience.  There is variation in respect of neonatal intensive care units and visiting.  For example, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidelines make provision for that and say that visiting should be facilitated, but they do not say for how long.  Do the guidelines make provision for both parents visiting at the same time in an unlimited way, depending on the severity of the child's condition in the neonatal intensive care unit?  How many neonatal intensive care units are there, and how many of them are providing full and free access for parents whose child is at the most severe level of risk in a NICU?</p></speech>

That is one matter we are very strong on.</p></speech>

When we talk about visitation, that is one of the points of contention.  It is about how much and the quality of it.  We are talking about people who are now largely vaccinated, based on population figures, and staff who are vaccinated.  It is that sort of detail that is really upsetting people.</p></speech>

I am on record as saying that we want to get this to the right level we need.  The Deputy mentioned that the vast majority of the public are vaccinated.  While that is true, we need to understand that there are still risks for pregnant women.  We know that a significant proportion of pregnant women have not been vaccinated.  We are trying to move this forward in a very real way with the support of the advocacy groups.  The Deputy mentioned those.</p> <p>  On the specific issue of times, we would not define those to the level the Deputy mentioned for each of the 19 maternity units.  We would expect the units to do that in a very reasonable way.  We were very clear about what we wanted to see in the NICUs in one of the first four criteria we set out.  We have set out another five since then, but that was in one of the first four we set out.  I am sorry I cannot confirm if it is 19 NICUs.</p></speech>

In respect of the specific infection prevention and control measures we defined at the start of the pandemic for all hospitals, we just reissued last week a guidance document that includes maternity in terms of both infection prevention and control measures and visitations.  We are very anxious to reduce any hurt that has been caused or any impacts on pregnant women and their partners.  We will be consistent and relentless on this.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, the chief operations officer-----</p></speech>

We appreciate there has been a lot of hurt caused by this.  Equally, we rely on all our staff to balance risk every day in terms of centres.  All sides are doing what they can in assessing the risk on a daily basis.  When it comes to visitors in general, we do not antigen test.  We know people who are unvaccinated are still coming to our sites to visit.  That is the reality, unfortunately.  Again, sites are working with people visiting and with patients and their families to try to address that.  To answer the Deputy's question, we are not antigen testing visitors.</p></speech>

It was something that had to be managed in an emergency context and the level of care people received has, by and large, been excellent.  I acknowledge that Mr. Reid has always made himself available to members of the Oireachtas on issues that have arisen throughout the pandemic.  When certain matters arose within my constituency, they were responded to so I have to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  I will focus on non-compliance in procurement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that the HSE is developing systems and is making significant improvements in that regard.  That is to be acknowledged.  I will focus on the more than &euro;40 million that has been spent by the HSE to date across a range of services provided by Ernst &amp;amp; Young, PwC, Grant Thornton, Deloitte and KPMG, both pandemic related and non-pandemic related.</p><p>Does &euro;40 million represent value for money for the taxpayer?  </p></speech>

Regarding his question about value for money for the consultancy costs and Deputy Verona Murphy's questions, we fully respect the role of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Oireachtas in general in holding us to account for all spend.  Regarding consultancy costs, I believe we have got value for money.  It is always something we will go through thoroughly again.  I believe that &euro;40 million out of our total spend of &euro;20 billion is a fair representation of the skills, competencies and expertise that we recognise we do not have within the HSE and that we recognise we need for a period of time to, in some cases, contract for some services or deal with emergency situations with which we have had to deal in the course of the pandemic.  I am always committed to building skills and competencies in-house.  Certainly if we look at what is happening with testing and tracing, we have leveraged all that skill back in-house but we had to engage some expertise to get us there.  It is a similar situation with the vaccination programme and across a range of services.  I believe that we will always continue to search and get value for money to the greatest extent.</p></speech>

What we do not know, and this is what I am trying to get at, is how those individual contracts are managed within the work stream.  We know that individual companies provide different types of services, as per the procurement rules.  However, in terms of the scope of work, what is perplexing me is how Grant Thornton can receive &euro;4.2 million for the year up to March 2021, Deloitte can receive &euro;4.2 million and KPMG can receive &euro;3.1 million.

Please do not throw commercial sensitivity at me on this one because all of the consultancy houses have benefited remarkably from the provision of these services under presumably clear procurement rules.  What we do not have sight of is how many people were seconded or deployed and how that is being managed internally by the HSE in terms of due diligence and managing the contracts and costs.  There is no document anywhere I have sight of that shows me, or by extension, the taxpayer, the dynamics that informed those individual contracts in the public interest and in terms of protecting the "public purse", to quote Mr. Mulvany.  This is an issue to which we need to return.  We need more transparency.</p></speech>

It is something we place considerable focus on in the HSE in terms of what is it is utilised for so that we do not have scope creep.  Some of the consultancy houses referenced by the Deputy would bring a level of expertise, particularly in terms of laboratories and testing, that we did not have at the very start.  Grant Thornton and others would provide a lot of operational capacity that we may not have in-house but I will ask Mr. Mulvany to talk about the detailed reporting level - our assessment of contracts as they are awarded.</p></speech>

Some &euro;38 million for consultancy is disclosed in the annual financial statements, half of which is for Covid and half of which is not.  As Mr. Reid said, our aim is always to have specific deliverables and to get clear weekly details of the hours of individual consultants.  We typically operate from the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework, which sets out four or five tiered levels reflecting the levels of individuals and their different types of qualifications.  I have experience relating to the financial aspects of the private hospital agreement.  We monitor that closely.  In fairness to the company, a certain amount of the work at the start of the pandemic was done either <i>pro bono</i>or at substantially discounted rates.  For the entirety of the time we were dealing with that particular part of the private hospitals, we ensured that the rates were at or, in many cases, below the OGP framework.  They were monitored every week.</p></speech>

The first two contributions by members were absolutely bizarre in not allowing the HSE to outline the context in which discussions took place and decisions were made.  It is akin to two soldiers stepping out of the trenches as the smoke clears, being told they did a great job and invited to sit down so they can be told everything they did wrong.  The HSE officials have not been allowed to outline the context in which they made decisions.  We did not know the biological make-up of this virus.  We did not know how it was transmitted.  We did not know what therapeutics worked or did not work.  We did not know the role of ventilators.  Italian doctors were deciding between people living and dying based on the availability of ventilators.  New York officials were pleading for ventilators from around the world.  Staff around the world were begging for PPE and using bin liners instead.  I will say to public servants across the State that, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would far rather they take risks to improve public services and protect people's lives than be looking over their shoulders for the prospect of "gotcha" moments at this committee.  I do not believe that serves Ireland well.</p> <p>  There will inevitably be lessons learned from the procurement decisions that were made during that period of time.  Should another emergency arise, what procurement protections have been put in place or is it intended to put in place?  Is there a legal or commercial route to procure the outstanding &euro;23 million or are our guests resigned to that being a bad debt?</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague to respond to his last question.  He asked about learnings and I have a few brief things to restate in that regard.  What I knew in February and March 2020 was that the public were scared.  Our staff, healthcare staff and clinicians were scared when going to work.  Decisions had to be made at pace.  I told Oireachtas Members at the time that I would be sitting in front of them in the future and I would be accounting for the things we got right and things we will do differently in the future.  One of the biggest scares we had related to our consultants, nurses and doctors making decisions about who would receive ventilation and who would not.  We did not get to that situation and I am proud of our public service in that regard.  We punched well above our weight and much stronger than many other countries across the world in terms of our procurement of ventilators and PPE.  I was involved in teams who were on calls to China and across Asia on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings in order to procure PPE.  I would get up again, after an hour's sleep, to arrange the logistics and distribution of all of that equipment.  That is the pace at which we were operating and I am proud of the public service in that regard.  Having said all of that-----</p></speech>

The first relates to having a pandemic workforce capacity capability.  We did not have a pandemic workforce capacity capability at the start of this crisis, not only in terms of procurement but also in terms of testing and tracing capacity and a vaccination programme.  That was also the case in terms of the whole range of our acute hospital and community supports.  We have learned and embedded much of that.</p> <p>  The second aspect relates to procurement.  That is reflected in a range of actions that are in the report.</p><p>I will not waste the committee's time by listing them again.  There is a range of actions for procurement that will be put into our procurement plan which will be completed in the first quarter of next year.  We know there are learnings and we are committed to them, both in terms of workforce and procurement.  I ask my colleague to answer the Deputy's question about outstanding amounts owed.</p></speech>

We have fully provided for that.  Effectively, we have charged it to last year.  Any amount of that that we secure is a benefit for the current year.  As we have said, so far, the figure is actually down to just below &euro;35 million.  There is another &euro;11.5 million which we expect to get imminently.  The piece that is still to be worked on is &euro;23 million.  I would not want to give any kind of expectation that we will get all of that, but I can assure the Deputy that we will pursue it and we are doing so through commercial and legal routes.  We have appointed representatives both in Ireland and China to engage with companies.  Where we can get agreements, we will.</p></speech>

Most of those routes, whether they are commercial or legal, are based in China, so obviously there is an issue of complexity there.  We have appointed Chinese representatives to work on our behalf.</p></speech>

I appreciate that there was certainly a context to the events.  That is important to note.  We remember the sharing of ventilators in Italy and we appreciate that ICUs have been hugely under-resourced.  Let us accept that that is the scenario we are talking about.  I think every member of the committee appreciates all of the work done, particularly by those workers in the HSE on the front line.</p> <p>  In relation to procurement, we are being told that a number of legal challenges have been taken.  One such challenge has been taken against the HSE.  What is the nature of that challenge?  I am not asking for a long response; I wish to know what it is about.  A variety of items are being challenged.  Can the witnesses provide us with the details of what four or five of those items are?</p></speech>

That company is not happy with that particular action.  That is the case where a company has taken action against us.</p> <p>  In the other examples, the challenges mostly concern ventilators and the pursuit of what we provided for the amount of money that we have not yet got value for.  I stress that we are, and have successfully so far, adopted commercial negotiations.  However, there is always the potential for these to become legal issues.  The challenges typically concern ventilators.</p></speech>

I believe masks were the only items of PPE that were inspected.  For example, there was an issue with 1 million units that were issued to healthcare settings.  That related to hand sanitisers.  Are there other issues?  We saw all the efforts made, the Aer Lingus flight and all the rest of it, to get the PPE.  I remember that perhaps a week after some of the PPE arrived, people were saying that some of it was not useable.  Is any of that part of what is being challenged?</p></speech>

As the chief financial officer, Mr. Mulvany, has outlined, the main challenges specifically relate to ventilators.  As the Deputy has quite rightly stated, on some of the early initial deliveries, a small number of the total delivery of certain PPE items was not up to the standard we specified and ordered.  We immediately engaged with the suppliers at that time.  For the record, it was one of the biggest orders that any country managed to secure at the time for PPE.</p><p>What was happening on the ground, and this is in some reports, was that as we secured those orders, other institutions and other countries were trying to outbid us on what we had secured.  For the order that arrived on the next flight, we got replacements to the specification for the smaller number of items that were not specified correctly.</p></speech>

There will also be a range of costs next year.  We know we have an immediate range of costs relating to device replacements.  We will have to replace approximately 30,000 devices that are not up to the standard we need on our network.  The ballpark figure for this is a &euro;30 million recurring cost.  The immediate range of costs we have had include infrastructure, vendor support and the range of international support we have had to engage in terms of monitoring.  That amounts to close to &euro;20 million.  We are seeing recurring costs that will be needed for device replacements and for 24-7 monitoring of our network, which we did not have in place.  We do have it in place now.  There are also the legacy networks and servers we will have to replace.  We are awaiting a finalised report from the consultancy group working with us on the impact of the cyberattack.  Ultimately, as I have said, we could see costs of &euro;100 million being incurred in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

It has been a very challenging time.</p> <p>  May I raise the issue of procurement and its management?  A complaint I receive from people working at local level in IT, which relates to all areas of procurement within the HSE, is that those making the final decisions are very much coming from the administration side and that there is a lack of connectivity between the experts on the ground and the decision makers.  That came through in respect of the orders that went through for the ventilators.  Moving on from ventilators but staying with IT, the comparison with hospitals in the private sector indicates the people who are involved in IT are very much involved in the decision-making process.  The complaint is that in the HSE, that connectivity does not exist.  I am wondering what can be done to make sure the people with the expertise have a huge influence on decision-making.</p></speech>

I will try to address the questions, which raise two points.  First, the Deputy just described the classic challenge we all face.  We do want to centralise and strengthen much of our procurement because a lot of what can happen is non-compliant and can occur locally.  There is an ongoing challenge between trying to centralise and keeping local knowledge, but there is frustration over not being able to procure locally.  That is an obvious challenge.</p> <p>  Specifically on our contracts, we engage significantly at local level in obtaining expertise, be it clinical expertise, medical expertise or specific IT expertise, in terms of defining the procurement contract itself.  However, in terms of the issues around IT, equivalent private hospitals and others, and connectivity, we want to strengthen our procurement process through getting the local knowledge but having central oversight and control and a definition of what is procured in a more centralised manner.  That will strengthen our procurement, and that will be part of the corporate plans that the head of procurement, who is here today, is finalising with each of the hospital groups and CHOs and, equally, at national level.  That has to be part of the process.</p></speech>

Their concern is that the decision makers are not the people who have the expertise.  They believe problems will continue to arise, particularly in relation to IT and new equipment, unless the structure is changed so people with expertise in the area are also involved in the decision-making process.</p></speech>

I am conscious of time.</p></speech>

There can always be individual examples of where people were not happy with the input they were able to provide.  We and our procurement teams put a lot of effort into involving experts, including local experts where we can, particularly in respect of the specification process and in respect of the evaluation process of the tenders.  Taking the example of the financial system, which I was closely involved with, we absolutely are continuing to involve local financial and procurement people in specifying and evaluating.</p></speech>

We still have a whole issue relating to files which are manual.  If someone, say in Cork, attends the Mercy hospital, then attends Cork University Hospital for something else and then attends the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital for something else, there appears to be still a paper file in relation to much of that work.  How far forward are we planning in regard to IT in this area of patient records and modernising the whole system?</p></speech>

First, in terms of the infrastructure, there is no doubt from the cyberattack and reports that emerge, we have 2,000 systems across the HSE, not all of which are interconnected.  We have 4,000 servers across the HSE and at least 80,000 devices deployed on that network.  What we must do is look at that infrastructure in a more effective manner.  We must start to put some of that infrastructure into what is called "the cloud" so that we are not naturally exposed to our core infrastructure in the same manner.  As an example, if you take the system deployed for the vaccination programme, it was the one process, the one system and the one service that was not impacted by the cyberattack, because that system was new, it was specified, and it was in the cloud.  Part of that is putting more services, including Office 365, in the cloud.</p> <p>  In regard to patient records and data, we have a whole suite of e-health initiatives, some of which are major parts of Sl&aacute;intecare, that will have to be invested in as part of the strategy for e-health initiatives.  One opportunity we took during the vaccination programme was to get greater information on patient identifiers, single, unified health identifiers for patient records, through that process, and that has helped us hugely.</p></speech>

We need to plan this out.  I accept it cannot be done overnight.  Have we clear targets setting out what needs to be achieved?</p></speech>

In regard to the commissioning of private hospital capacity, and the agreement put in place in 2020 to ensure that private hospital capacity was available to supplement the public system, and a potential surge, can the committee get an overview in terms of how that contract was negotiated and the involvement of the Department of Health?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021091600002#T01000"><p>Yes, I will make some very brief comments on that.  If Deputy Dillon looks back on 2020, there were probably three phases of our procurement and engagement with private hospitals.  The first phase was literally seeking the full capacity of the private hospital system.  That was purely on the basis that we knew we had just over 10,000 beds in the public system.  All forecasts were saying we probably needed about another 7,000 or 8,000 beds capacity.  That was based on forecasts of what was to happen.  That was an agreement negotiated between the HSE and the Department of Health with the private hospital system.</p> <p>  Very briefly, and I will pass over to the CFO, the second phase of it was undertaken on a different basis.  We moved from that first phase of full-secure to a more access to bed facilities to address non-Covid-19 care.</p><p>Equally, the stage we are at is that we have procurement contracts awarded based on certain specialties and activities we draw on now significantly.  I will ask Mr. Mulvany to comment on the original agreement with the Department.</p></speech>

Effectively, it was a very large insurance policy.  In the end, &euro;287 million was spent.  What did we get for that?  A bit like any insurance policy, one should not be unhappy if one's house did not burn down.  We did not need all of the capacity we got but we got access to 2,300 beds and we got 16,000 procedures done in April, 17,000 or 18,000 in May and another 17,000 in June.  Approximately 50,000 procedures went through those 2,300 beds in the three months.  Effectively, it provided us with a safety net.  Thankfully, because of all the other actions of the State, it was not needed at the level it could have been, but that is a good news story rather than a bad news story.  We actually got substantial benefit from it as well as it being kind of a safety net that, thankfully, we did not have to fully use.</p></speech>

We never used more than approximately 45% of the capacity.  Through that capacity, we got approximately 50,000 procedures done.  The context for not using it is that this was an insurance policy and the good news is that we did not have to use it - we did not have to put those beds up to 70% or 80%.  Value was achieved by having the safety net, getting 50,000 procedures through it and having access to the beds.  The good news story was that we did not actually need them because the overall response of the State meant that we did not end up with the level of overwhelmed public healthcare system we could have ended up with.</p></speech>

Has the HSE or the Department given consideration to utilising private hospitals to reduce those waiting lists and for access to treatments and services?</p></speech>

There are a few strands to it.  One of those strands will definitely be how we engage private capacity and utilise it as part of addressing those waiting lists.  We all need to recognise that there is a private health system in place that has significant capacity, capability and skills.  Given the extent of the waiting lists we have, it needs to be about increasing capacity in the public health system and the private health system and also doing things differently.  I will give a very brief example of that.  In Citywest, we built a temporary hospital that is now used significantly for addressing some elements of the waiting lists, specifically and particularly in respect of children's waiting lists.  We see it as being a combination of doing things differently, increasing our capacity in the public system and utilising capacity in the private system.</p></speech>

Obviously, the HSE needed a large facility and needed it quickly.  It fitted the bill in terms of the location and everything else.  Mr. Reid has confirmed that it is still in use as a temporary hospital.  Does the contract for it have a break clause?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.235" nospeaker="true" time="09:30:00" ><p>We see real value from the facility we procured in Citywest.  You are correct, Chairman, that it was originally a step-down facility for hospital beds and an isolation area.  We now have facilities for isolation, Covid testing, a vaccination centre and also some facilities that are clinically led in terms of addressing some of the waiting lists.  From our perspective, the challenge is not specifically the break issue, but more the capacity we have acquired and how we might try to utilise that for the future.</p></speech>

To break it down, the average would be just over 100.  As of now, we have 98 people in the self-isolation facility which accommodates healthcare workers and people who test positive and who cannot isolate at home.  The majority of the people there today are people who are self-isolating; 73 people just need the facility for isolation and then there are healthcare workers.  The number has declined.  It has ebbed and flowed in line with the surges and it has been extremely busy at times.  Again, depending on the level of illness that exists, it sometimes functions as a real healthcare facility in terms of providing care.  We would be absolutely lost without it, given what it has provided in respect of isolation.  Critically, however, it is one of our busiest testing and vaccination centres as well.</p></speech>

It relates to the national ambulance service.  There are situations arising due to what is called "dynamic deployment", which is the term that is used, where a number of ambulances are chasing across the country to emergency cases.  I will give an example.  In Laois, ambulances have been sent towards the Carlow border, but when they are three quarters of the way there they are stood down, which is the term used, and told there is no need to continue as the patient has been picked up.  An ambulance might then be sent to south Kilkenny.  When it is almost in south Kilkenny it receives a similar call saying it has been stood down as the patient has been picked up and it is then sent to County Waterford.  A similar situation arises in County Waterford and it is then diverted to another location.  The 12-hour shift can end without it actually picking up a patient.  Those situations are occurring.</p> <p>  I understand there is a working group examining this, but the situation has continued over the past couple of years.  It has led to circumstances where people have been left waiting.  In one case I had two years ago an elderly person was waiting in Clonaslee, which is 13 or 14 miles from Portlaoise hospital, for over two hours for an ambulance to arrive.  There was a case recently of a serious accident in Portlaoise involving sport, but the local ambulance that was available was in Wexford at that time.  That is what I have been told.  People working in the ambulance crews across the country are raising these concerns with us.  The dynamic deployment is not working.  There cannot be a situation where people are clocking up over 400 km during a shift without picking up a patient.  The old system, where it was completely localised, might not have been perfect but there has to be some local dimension to it.</p> <p>  There is also the point of having to pick up on every call.  From what I am told, it allows the people in the control centres or the response centres to be able to tick the box and say that an ambulance has responded within 90 seconds, as I understand there is a 90-second target, but the problem is that people are being left waiting for an hour, two hours and in excess of two hours, while the ambulances in the area are 50 to 80 miles away.  The system simply is not working.  There have been several situations in counties Laois and Offaly where patients have been left for those long periods of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.244" nospeaker="true" time="09:30:00" ><p>It is putting health at risk.  It is putting huge stress on the ambulance crews.  While I understand that we have to be open to new systems and new ways of doing things, this system is simply not working.  Can Mr. Reid give me any reassurance that the system will get a serious examination?</p></speech>

I fully accept the credentials of the cases that the Chair just relayed.  What I will say, Chair, is that I disagree that the system is not working.  I am happy to facilitate a visit to our National Ambulance Centre in Tallaght, as well as its backup service in Donegal.  I have been in it on numerous occasions.  We have brought administrations from other parts of the world, including the UK.  There is no doubt that the national ambulance system overall is one of the best in class.  I fully appreciate the examples that the Chair has raised.  However, it is not about ticking a box; it is about patient safety driving full deployment and best utilisation, based on the clinical cases that arise, on the availability of ambulances, and on the prioritisation of utilisation of fleets.</p> <p>  Chair, I fully accept what you have just said, none of which is acceptable.  However, I will not accept that the system is not working overall.  It is one of the best in class deployment systems you will come across.  The centre staff themselves-----</p></speech>

They are making huge efforts.  They are highly trained and they are more skilled than they were in years gone by.  I can see those improvements.  We appreciate those improvements.  I am saying that there are problems with the system.  I hear this from ambulance crews, from people who are actually on the front line, and from people who work in hospitals.  I would appeal to Mr. Reid that in the interests of patient safety, senior officials in the HSE and the Department of Health look at the system.  I understand that working groups are looking at this the moment.  That is what I heard and that was reported.  Whether or not it is true, I do not know.  What I am saying to Mr. Reid is that there have been examples in recent times, of which I am aware, in the area and the constituency in which I live, Laois-Offaly.  Patients' health, welfare and, indeed, lives have been put at risk.  That cannot continue.  If there are faults in the system, we should not close down any discussion and say it is perfect.  It is not perfect.  I understand improvements have been made.  However, given the way ambulances are being deployed, some of what has happened is absolutely crazy.  Nobody could stand over it.  It needs to be examined.  I appeal to Mr. Reid, as the chief executive of the HSE, to at least give an undertaking to have those issues examined.</p></speech>

I invite the Chair and any members of the committee who would like to come out and see the National Ambulance Centre, so that they can get a greater insight into what the centre staff are doing, along with the tremendous work that all of our front-line ambulance services do.  Certainly, we will take on board any feedback from here and, indeed, any feedback from any potential visits committee members would like to make.</p></speech>

While I also believe we have ambulance providers and those who deliver as paramedics, etc., who are wonderful people, there is a huge problem in relation to the service itself.  I have reported many incidents from my office but have not received any responses.  These are incidents where there was delay of more than six hours and there has been no explanation for that.  That is in my locality.  I am not interested in visiting the centre but I am interested in getting an answer as to why these things happen.</p><p>I know no service is perfect but I would appreciate if we could collaborate in some way to get that sorted.</p></speech>

First, given that the HSE is going legal in respect of four suppliers regarding ventilators, how many of those have had legal papers lodged so that the legal process has commenced?  Second, reference has been made to the &euro;200 million that was underspent in the budget that has come into this year.  How much of that relates to things like vacancies in the service?  Naas General Hospital in my constituency has vacancies for 50 nurses.  Is this about the HSE being prudent or is it an underspend on resources necessary to deliver the health service?  We have a huge waiting list with 900,000 people and additional waiting lists for things like speech and language therapy.  What is the basis of the &euro;200 million underspend?</p></speech>

On recruitment, we are anxious to and are recruiting significantly.  That was impacted during the cyberattack because we had to cease all applications but since January 2020, we have almost 10,100 extra staff on the books.  This year to date we have recruited 4,400 people and that is separate to about 3,000 people who were recruited as part of the testing and vaccination programmes.  We have a significant budget to the year-end to continue recruitment.  We expect another 3,000 people to be recruited.  We wanted that to be focused on nursing and midwifery, as the Deputy said.  It is a challenging market right now but since January of last year, we are up almost 1,800 nurses and midwives.  We have the budget to the year-end to continue that.  We are conscious of those vacancies and are anxious to fill them.  It is a difficult market at the moment but we have funding.  I will ask my colleague to speak on the &euro;200 million figure.</p></speech>

We always seek to operate within budget.  It is much more a factor of the complexity of trying to plan and estimate, particularly in the year of Covid.  Effectively, some of our services' activity levels were depressed, reducing some of our costs.  We were not able to progress with as many developments because we were responding to Covid and that &euro;240 million outweighed a small overrun of about &euro;40 million on the Covid side.  It was a balance between planning and estimation in the level of uncertainty around Covid.</p> <p>  To clarify, I have not said we have taken legal proceedings against four companies.  That is the number of companies we are engaging with to get back the value we have not yet secured out of the figures that were mentioned.  Our preference is to do that by negotiation and commercial discussions.  We simply are keeping all options open, including those that could become necessary, but I have not indicated that we are taking proceedings against four companies.</p></speech>

It is worth noting that, in our mid-year NSP review, we have reduced that down to 3.5 million additional hours on top of the base budget of 19 million because of the surge.  We have now delivered more than 2 million and expect to deliver the 3.5 million by the end of the year.  On home support, it is worth flagging, although it may already be known to the Deputy, that we have a significant challenge in recruiting home support workers, as do many of the agencies we fund.  It is a serious challenge for us and is impacting on our ability to spend the available budget.  We will have delivered 3.5 million of the just under 5 million extra hours that were funded as part of the NSP.</p></speech>

Before we conclude, I will revert to the issue of the ambulances for a moment, although only briefly because we are up against the clock.  On Mr. Reid's point about visiting a centre, I have no problem doing that.  I am sure that, when I go to a call centre - there is one in Tallaght and another in Ballyshannon - that I will see that it works efficiently, that a response will be given within the allowed time and that an ambulance will be mobilised to go to the scene of the accident or that an emergency call will get a response within the time allowed.  I have no doubt about that.  The system is there.  I do not speak about ticking a box in any sort of glib way.  I am saying that I understand that those response times are being met in the centre but that the problem is in the deployment on the ground.  If somebody is lying seriously injured 15 miles from Portlaoise hospital, for example, and the ambulances from that general area are 50, 60, 80 or 100 km away, that creates a problem.</p><p>It creates a problem if there are several ambulances chasing the same emergency.  That is what is happening.  I have outlined the situation to Mr. Reid.  I hear about these cases from ambulance crews.  These are honest people who are concerned about patient safety.  They will not gain extra pay for letting us know these things.  I hear these things from people working in the ambulance sector across the State.  They are honourable people who give their all.  What I am saying to Mr. Reid is this is where the problem is and we cannot continue to ignore it.  I have been raising this issue in the D&aacute;il for several years and although Mr. Reid has done some great work as CEO of the HSE, I am disappointed with his response on this issue and I will continue to raise it.  Ministers have to take this issue on board as well because human life and health and the well-being of patients has to be paramount.  I ask Mr. Reid to reflect on what I am saying to him.  I am not saying it to score points; I am saying it truthfully based on the knowledge available to me.  I have a real concern, first for my constituents, but also for the wider public across this State.  We have to try to do our best for them.  I thank Mr. Reid for his reply but ask him to please reflect on what I have said.  That is all I ask of him.</p></speech>

The item we are addressing is pre-legislative scrutiny of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill 2020.  To assist us, I welcome, from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Ms Mary Hurley, assistant secretary, and Ms Emma Reeves, principal officer.  Members have been circulated with the briefing and opening statement.  I will first ask for the Department's opening statement and members will then be invited to address questions.  We will probably be okay on time today because a number of members have sent apologies.  They cannot attend as they are on other business.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending remotely within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I invite Ms Reeves to make the opening statement.</p></speech>

I am a principal officer in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and I have responsibility for the project leading to the establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  I am accompanied by Mary Hurley, assistant secretary</p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to brief the joint committee on the general scheme of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill 2020.  The Bill provides for the merger of the Valuation Office, Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland, through the establishment of a new organisation to be known as Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  The Valuation Office, Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland together manage a comprehensive set of property and spatial data.  Combining all three in Tailte &Eacute;ireann will optimise the benefits of land information for the continuing economic and social development of Ireland.</p><p>Combining all three in Tailte &Eacute;ireann will optimise the benefits of land information for the continuing economic and social development of Ireland; provide citizens, businesses and policymakers with ease of access to, and use of, location information, including property and title information, property valuation data, maps and aerial imagery; lead, develop and maintain national spatial information infrastructures; and support better land management.</p><p> The Government decision of 20 January 2015 approved the drafting of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill 2014 along the lines of the general scheme attached to the memorandum for Government and proposed by the Department of Justice and Equality.  That general scheme included proposals to establish a new body called Tailte &Eacute;ireann to effectively merge the functions of Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Property Registration Authority and the Commissioner of Valuation; continue the statutory office of the Commissioner of Valuation; establish an office of registrar of deeds and titles combining the separate offices of the Registrar of Deeds and the Registrar of Titles that had existed prior to the establishment of the Property Registration Authority in 2006; establish an office of chief State surveyor to include the current survey and mapping functions of Ordnance Survey Ireland with the functions of the boundary surveyor, which was an office held by the Commissioner for Valuation; and establish Tailte &Eacute;ireann with a board and chief executive.</p><p> In 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality provided a briefing to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality regarding the 2015 general scheme.  I have provided the committee with a copy of the opening statement provided by that Department at the time and the supplementary brief dated 27 February 2015, which includes additional information on similar mergers in other jurisdictions.  </p><p> On 1 January 2018, ministerial orders transferred responsibility for the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland to the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The general scheme of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill 2020 intends to establish a fully integrated land, property and spatial information services organisation and includes a number of broad changes to the governance arrangements for Tailte &Eacute;ireann from those that were proposed in the 2015 general scheme.</p><p> Tailte &Eacute;ireann is to be established as a scheduled office under the Public Service Management Act 1997, with the chief executive as the head of office.  The role of the board is strategic and advisory.  It will promote high standards of internal control and governance in relation to the provision by Tailte &Eacute;ireann of its services and advise the Minister, when necessary, in relation to policies of government affecting the functions of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  As with the original scheme, the 2020 heads of Bill propose the dissolution of Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority.  However, unlike the original general scheme which proposed separate statutory officers to carry out these functions, the revised heads of Bill propose that all functions previously performed by those organisations will become functions of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> Whereas the original general scheme proposed the continuation of the Office of the Commissioner of Valuation as a statutory office, the revised scheme proposes that the statutory functions of the Commissioner of Valuation will become functions of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  </p><p> The functions of Tailte &Eacute;ireann will be the functions previously performed by the Property Registration Authority, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Commissioner of Valuation.  Tailte &Eacute;ireann will provide a comprehensive and secure property title registration system, an independent rateable valuation system and an authoritative location information and geospatial infrastructure.  These are central to the effective management of the property, planning, agriculture, local government, environmental and construction sectors of the State's economy.</p><p> A project board was established under the chairmanship of the Department.  The project board is comprised of senior departmental officials, officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Commissioner of Valuation and the chief executives of the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  The purpose of the project board is to oversee the establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann as a fully integrated land, property and spatial information services organisation.</p><p>The board is responsible for defining and realising benefits and monitoring risks, quality and timeliness.  A number of working groups are now in train to drive forward the merger.</p><p> This legislation is largely technical and is primarily designed to establish the merged Tailte &Eacute;ireann organisation in the most efficient way.  Accordingly, there are no significant new policy initiatives contained in it.  Rather, in line with similar legislation, the general scheme is focused on the statutory provisions necessary to bring about the merger of the three existing organisations into the new Tailte &Eacute;ireann organisation, the governance of the new organisation when it is established and the carrying out of its functions into the future.</p><p> My colleague and I welcome the opportunity to address any questions the committee may have in relation to the general scheme of the Bill and the establishment of Tailte &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

I am glad we were able to hold this session today.  I am aware that we have received written requests on two previous occasions to commence pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  We had a gap in our timetable, so I am happy to commence it today.  It is very timely to bring three agencies together and optimise many of their functions, particularly given that the key priorities in Housing for All include identifying land and land activation, especially in areas of dereliction and vacancy.  Anything that can assist us to activate land is helpful.</p> <p>  I invite members to ask questions, beginning with Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#D00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  I apologise in advance for stepping out of the meeting briefly.  I have to introduce legislation in the House in the next 15 minutes, but I will come back as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the detailed briefing documents.  There is certainly a kind of a logic to what is being proposed.  I have four specific questions.  One of the concerns, whenever these mergers happen and we hear talk of efficiency, is that sometimes efficiency does not necessarily mean improving the service but means reducing costs, particularly the cost of staff and overheads.  As a consequence of the merger following the passing of this legislation, will the staffing levels remain the same as they are currently across the three agencies?  Will they be reduced or increased?</p> <p>  With respect to efficiencies, one of the big problems with the land registry and one of the Property Registration Authority, PRA, functions, is that it can take up to 12 months to get documentation on the land registry updated.  It is a very slow and sometimes difficult process, and that was before Covid.  Are there plans, as part of this, to improve the efficiency of those front-facing services?</p> <p>  Similar to the issue of staff, I have a question on cost.  Achieving efficiencies often means reducing financial costs.  In terms of budgets, is there an expectation that the current expenditure, as per the Vote, will remain the same?</p> <p>  I will highlight something I think is odd in the Bill, although I appreciate it is not a function of the Department.  It would have made eminent sense to roll a fourth agency, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, into this new body.  In fact, at an earlier stage I thought that was going to be the plan.  I know the PSRA is a slightly different agency, but given that the new body will be the basket for property services and given that the PSRA, in my view, is in the wrong Department, which is one of the reasons it does not do some of the things it should do, was there any discussion with the Department of Justice about the possibility of putting this fourth property-related agency, albeit one that regulates private operators in terms of property services, under Tailte &Eacute;ireann as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.325" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma Reeves" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#D00600"><p>I might start with the staffing question.  There are no plans to reduce the number of staff employed.  The combined organisation will have over 900 staff.  They will have legal, surveying, data analytical, ICT, project management, valuation, human resources and quality management skills and experience.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked about the efficiency of the Land Registry.  The Land Registry deals with all applications received.  He is right that there has been a delay over the course of 2020 and 2021 but, actually, intake has now returned to the 2019 level and current activity is on its way back up.  The number of applications for registration received to date in 2021 exceed the number for 2020 by 14%.  All indicators are that future demand-----</p></speech>

My question is the length of time it was taking pre Covid to process those applications.  Sometimes you would have 12 or 18 months.  My question is more this: once we get out of Covid, will there be an attempt to speed up the process and the timeline between application and when the registration is formally logged on the online system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.328" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma Reeves" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#E00300"><p>The PRA deals with a large number of applications for registration every year.  In 2020, as I said, that intake was about 200,000.  All applications will be dealt with as they are received.  The PRA is making efforts to reduce the arrears, and, certainly, the Deputy is right that the period after Covid will make that more straightforward.</p> <p>  As for cost, T&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann will have its own Vote.  There are no plans yet for that Vote to be established because the organisation needs to be established before the Vote is ready.  That will be next year, and work is under way in preparing for that.</p> <p>  Finally, no, I have not given any consideration to whether the PRSA should have been included in this organisation.  We are satisfied that the three organisations included are the right ones.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#E00400"><p>There were technical issues there with the Fianna F&aacute;il members trying to get a connection.  I can bring them in now or move to Fine Gael if they can give me an indication.  There are still technical problems there.  I will move on to the Fine Gael slot then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#E00500"><p>I thank the Department for the opening statement and for providing the information that was given in 2015.  I found that really helpful.  As one of the newer Deputies, I was not across this issue back then, and it was definitely very interesting to see what it is like in Australia, New Zealand, Northern Ireland and Canada.  I definitely found that that was very good context to provide, so I thank the witnesses for that.</p> <p>  One of the goals that is advertised or listed in what this new legislation will bring about is that it will support better land management.  I would love to learn a little more about that and how these changes and efficiencies will do that.  I wonder whether or not that will be linked into the great work the Land Development Agency, LDA, will be doing from a strategic land management perspective and whether there are any synergies there.  The witnesses have probably covered a lot of this already, but I ask them to give us a breakdown of the efficiencies the Department thinks will be realised through this legislation.  It is great to hear that the staff levels will remain the same.  What efficiencies will we see?</p> <p>  One of the other things I noticed is that the legislation will provide for the establishment of a board.  One thing I would be really keen to know is whether or not gender balance would be taken into account when looking at that board.  This is a topic on which I have brought forward a Bill to make sure we include both genders at the decision-making table.  There are a lot of targets from Balance for Better Business on State and semi-State boards, but it would be great just to get confirmation and a little comfort that gender balance will be taken into account when the board is established.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.331" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma Reeves" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#E00600"><p>The benefits of the merger include a number of areas, one of which is efficiencies.  As a fully integrated single entity, T&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann will be able to streamline its existing services and administrative and management functions into one entity, that is, one body with a single voted expenditure, one chief executive and one board.</p><p>The merger will also provide for a shared culture and ethos in one organisation, rather than in three separate organisations with divergent priorities and goals.  In terms of optimising the land and property information, Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, the PRA and the Valuation Office, VO, together manage the most comprehensive set of property and spatial data in Ireland.  Combining all three will allow us to optimise those benefits for the continuing economic and social development.  Tailte &Eacute;ireann will be a data driven organisation in order that it is best placed to influence the future development of geospatial initiatives within the public sector data strategy.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about efficiencies in savings.  There will be some savings emerging from the fact that there be a single board with fewer members, compared to the current governing boards of OSI and the Property Registration Authority.  There will be some savings in the short term.  As we look to the future, in the longer term there will be future efficiencies and synergies, perhaps in operational areas, and through the exploitation of the combined data sets.  </p><p> The board would be appointed through the Public Appointment Service, PAS, and the State boards section.  Gender balance is definitely something that will be taken into consideration in all board appointments. </p></speech>

Could Ms Reeves expand on land management?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.334" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#F00300"><p>Perhaps I can come in on that.  The Deputy raises an excellent point in relation to land management.  One service that Tailte &Eacute;ireann will be able to provide in a more effective way because of the synergies that can arise from the three coming together is the provision of land information to bodies like the Land Development Agency, LDA, gathering information from many of the State landowners such as the Office of Public Works, OPW, around the country.  Huge work has been done in this area to date.  However, this will enable further mapping, further data management and further synergies to be arrived at.  There will be quite a lot of engagement.  The proposal is that there will be significant engagement with the LDA, which obviously has a big role in Housing For All on the delivery of social, affordable and private housing over the over future years.  The Deputy asks an excellent question.  I believe that this entity will support further the work that has been done in terms of land management, mapping and the future delivery of housing.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  This has been discussed a bit already and as we know, the LDA will be co-ordinating the mapping of State lands for the purpose of housing delivery.  What role, if any, will Tailte &Eacute;ireann have in assisting with the LDA's State land database?  The Ordnance Survey Ireland and Land Registry mapping systems are available online.  Both of them are useful resources and are available to the public, professionals, and students.  I use them myself quite a bit.  Will these services be maintained?  What consideration has the Department given to increasing public awareness of the new State body itself?  Will the LDA&rsquo;s current online mapping of State lands be folded into the database or will any of the CSO data like AIRO?  Because the regulatory impact assessment states that the merger might have an effect on the consumer base, how long will it take the merger to be completed?  Finally, where will the body be located?  Ordnance Survey Ireland is located in the Phoenix Park.  Will there be offices nationwide?</p></speech>

Tailte &Eacute;ireann will provide that data to support the LDA in doing its work.  The LDA will still hold its land mapping function but Tailte &Eacute;ireann will hold and continue to develop the information and the data sets that will support the LDA to do its work.  One of the things that we are quite conscious of in our engagement with the entities is that there is a joined-up approach across the State sector so that all of the bodies are working together.  To be very clear about what Tailte &Eacute;ireann will do, this body is about the integrity and gathering of the data and the registration.  To a certain extent, the work that Tailte &Eacute;ireann will do - and which the three entities do at the moment - will be to provide data which underpins the strategy and the delivery across the board.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised a very good point about what the bodies are doing and whether those services will be maintained.  The answer to that is an absolute &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and there will be additional services.  By joining up and creating an atmosphere whereby that data-sharing can take place, it will be able to provide work to enhance services.</p> <p>  The other piece relates to promoting the work of the new entity.  Again, this is a very exciting opportunity for us to let the public know about the services that are being offered. Obviously, we know that the matter of property relates to every home in Ireland and is of interest to Irish people.</p> <p>  Ms Reeves referred to the project board that is in place.  This board comprises all of the heads of bodies, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and our Department.  The board is addressing these types of issues in terms of communications, what the organisation might look like, how it can be effective and the streamlining of ICT and data systems.  That is one of the pieces of work that is under way with the board, which is getting ready for when established day hopefully happens.  I may have missed some items.  I will pass now to Ms Reeves.</p></speech>

As I mentioned before, there will be more than 900 staff in this new organisation.  These people are located in various places throughout the country. The Dublin office, or head office, of Tailte &Eacute;ireann will be located in the Distillers Building in Smithfield.  The building is under construction.

Hopefully, I will live up to the committee&rsquo;s expectations.</p> <p>  My question is technical in nature.  I have been contacted by a constituent who is in an unusual position in that he works with Ordnance Survey Ireland but is not technically an Irish citizen.  He moved from level 4 to level 5 and there was an initial stall on this because he was not an Irish citizen but the Department of Justice resolved that.  He has been advised that he would need to be an Irish citizen for this new role and he is or was not eligible to apply for citizenship until 25 May of this year, which he has now done.  Obviously, the merger looks to be on track to take place on 1 January 2022.  There is some concern that perhaps the issue with his citizenship will not be resolved at that stage.</p><p>It would be unfortunate for him if he was to miss out.  I will follow up separately in an email to Ms Hurley and Ms Reeves with the details of this gentleman.  He is very passionate about the work he does.  They will be delighted to hear that he is excited about the new plans and is looking forward to contributing to them.  More important, he and his family are very proudly settled in Longford so I am anxious to ensure he does not miss out on what will hopefully be an exciting new journey for this organisation.  I will email the details to Ms Hurley and Ms Reeves and would appreciate it if they could look into it for me.  </p></speech>

Other members have referred to the importance of active land management in terms of delivering housing that is affordable and ensuring there is a pipeline of land for housing that is affordable and within reach of people.  Will Tailte &Eacute;ireann have the ability to have a land price register so there is transparency around what price land is bought and sold for?  Costs are a key challenge for us in terms of housing and housing construction and there is no transparency around land costs for development.  We know how much people laying bricks, plastering and engaging in carpentry are getting paid; how much the materials cost; and how much the homes are being sold for but we do not know what price the land is being exchanged for.  Because of that, we cannot see a full breakdown of costs and where the costs are coming from.  It is worth noting that we have some of the highest home costs in Europe yet our material costs and labour costs are not higher than those of comparable European countries.  Will there be efforts to include a land price register as part of this?  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?</p></speech>

The Property Registration Authority has details of ownership and the folios.  That does not include the price paid for the land at a particular point in time so that will not be something that Tailte will be able to provide.</p></speech>

It does not include any other entities and neither did it envisage any other functions, although the general scheme does allow that if it was decided at a later point that additional functions should be added, that could be done.</p></speech>

There is an issue relating to carrying out the plans around Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  Will they speed up the valuation process?  We are talking about local authorities possibly losing significant amounts in rates due to delays in the valuation of commercial buildings.</p><p>Many of us, particularly those of us who were councillors, are aware of the difficulties local authorities have with funding.  This is something that would need to be addressed.  I imagine the Department will get an element of streamlining with organisation.  I am speaking about major operators, major retailers and serious commercial entities rather than the difficulties that many small businesses have at this point.  Will there be a streamlining of the valuation process?  I imagine there will be in the sense of the sharing of information.  The Department will not be recreating the wheel consistently and constantly, which is probably a difficulty that has led to this decision.</p></speech>

The 2022 budget meetings for local authorities are expected to take place during November.  The local authorities consider the valuation list for rateable properties in their rating authority areas when they are setting the annual rate of valuation for the following year.  The Valuation Office expects to add approximately 3,000 new or revised valuations to valuation lists in the lead up to these meetings.  Valuation certificates have issued recently in this regard and will continue to issue until the budget meeting.</p> <p>  In terms of what difference there will be in the new organisation, we have to remember the functions of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland in many respects will remain individual.  The Valuation Office does need to continue to provide rateable valuations and it will continue to do this.  There are, of course, areas of overlap and these are the areas where synergies may emerge.</p></speech>

The Valuation Office is responsible for valuation, and I get that.  Does the Department see there would be streamlining and a speeding up of the process?  I imagine there would be.</p></speech>

Given all that will be involved in these three organisations together it is vital the new entity would fall under the freedom of information legislation.  That is good to know.  How long does Ms Reeves reckon the entire process will take?  What is the timeline?</p></speech>

Once the legislation has been passed, we will continue work with the project board.  The project board has been in existence for some time.  Working groups have been established to progress the various strands of combining the three organisations.  Some are very time critical in terms of the merger and we are working on them.  The legislation has to come first.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses.  This proposed Bill is a technical measure, as has been mentioned, but it will have the important role of facilitating the amalgamation of the three bodies.</p><p>I will follow up on Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point on the Valuation Office because it pertains to the local authority sector in particular.  Councillors around the country often express frustration with delays in valuing new commercial premises and new buildings.  Thankfully, we have many such premises in the country now arising from massive inward investment, particularly from the multinational sector.  However, local authorities do not get the benefit of that in terms of commercial rates until maybe two years after completion of the commercial premises because of the lead-in times involved.  If a building is finished at a certain point in the year, it cannot be valued and included in the rates system until the following year.  It is important to be able to capture that value as early as possible.  Delays frustrate local authorities at times.</p><p> Will staff be able to move between the three constituent organisations?  Obviously, that will be subject to them having certain skill sets and also to industrial relations issues.  We have heard there will be three entities under one umbrella, so to speak.  Will that allow for the movement of staff or the redeployment of resources to areas where there is a significant workload at a point in the year?  Will that flexibility be built in when the new agency is established?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.365" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emma Reeves" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#K00200"><p>The Valuation Office is a body that has been in operation for a long number of years and its operations are well-rehearsed at this stage.  Valuations are done by valuers and there will be a requirement that that continue.  There is a limit to how people could be moved from one area of work to another.  Valuation would need to remain the work of valuers.  The revision programme is up and running and is working well.  The valuations are being delivered on an ongoing basis.  As I said, they will be issued, certainly for this year, right up until the local authority budget meeting date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-16a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021091600002#K00300"><p>I appreciate that.  Of course valuations have to be done by valuers, but there is significant administration work involved, in addition to the valuations, in getting all the information uploaded to the system.  In the run-up to budget time in a local authority, will it be possible to deploy additional resources to maximise the data that can be inputted and ensure local authorities are not at a loss in respect of rates for a further 12 months?</p></speech>

That is something that happens in large organisations and it should be possible.</p></speech>

I am happy with the Bill, which is technical in nature.  I believe having the three entities in one organisation will be a success.  The ability to redeploy resources where they are needed at points in time throughout the year is an issue that should be raised with the new organisation.  I would appreciate if it was.</p></speech>

As all members have asked questions, I will put some questions.  It makes sense to bring the three organisations in question together like this.</p><p>Combining the land identification and mapping skills of Ordnance Survey Ireland with the building identification skills and knowledge that exist within the Property Registration Authority and the Valuation Office makes a great amount of sense as regards efficiencies.  An issue I have often come across is that it can sometimes be difficult to identify the owner of a building, even for simple requests regarding dereliction or other issues.  You can end up going around in circles trying to find the owner of land or a building.  If this leads to efficiencies, it is to be welcomed.</p><p> I have a question regarding the location in Smithfield where the three agencies are to be brought together.  I know 900 members of staff are involved so they probably will not all be in there.  That in itself will bring efficiencies.  We have been back in Leinster House in recent days and weeks and people meeting one another in person rather than meeting online or being in separate buildings or locations also brings about efficiencies.  The three organisations, in some shape or form, will be located in Smithfield.</p><p> On the make-up of the board, head 10 says that six ordinary members will be appointed by the Minister.  Is it expected that those appointments would require some kind of experience or expertise in the area of land identification or property registration or valuation?</p></speech>

At the moment, they are all in individual locations, namely, Chancery Street, the Irish Life Mall and the Phoenix Park.  It will be helpful to have all three in the one location.  Regarding the skills of the board members, as the board is strategic and advisory in nature, we will be looking for a broad range of skills that will assist the chair in fulfilling the role asked of him or her.</p></speech>

Will that be a designated role of the new body?  We really want to identify areas in our town centres and urban centres where contact with the owners to discuss options regarding planning, change of use or funding that may be available could allow us to reactivate properties to create town centre living that would allow us to make the most of the 15-minute city concept.  Will there be an opportunity or a direct line for local authorities, particularly the officers who deal with dereliction and vacancy, to allow them to liaise directly with this new agency?  Will that be prioritised?  Would it be seen to be beneficial?</p></speech>
