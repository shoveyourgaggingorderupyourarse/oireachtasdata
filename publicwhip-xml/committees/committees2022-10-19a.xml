    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#A00200"><p>I remind all witnesses, members and those in the Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  The purpose of today's meeting is the continued examination of the EU nature restoration target, and resumed pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Veterinary Medicinal Products, Medicated Feed and Fertiliser Regulation Bill 2022.  The committee will hear from representatives of various agri-sector bodies.  All those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and they may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in the context of participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts.  Members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.</p><p>The committee will hear from representatives from the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, Mr. Paul O'Brien, Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan and Ms Edel McAvoy; from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, ICMSA, Mr. Pat McCormack and Mr. John Enright; from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, Mr. Dermot Kelleher and Mr. Eddie Punch; from the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers' Association, INHFA, Mr. Vincent Roddy, Ms Sharon Cosgrove and Mr. Joe Condon; and from Macra na Feirme, Mr. John Keane, Mr. Mick Curran and Mr. Liam Hanrahan.</p><p> As we have five agricultural bodies at the committee meeting today we will take the opening statements as read.  The session will last one and half hours and I want to give the committee members a chance to put their questions to the witnesses and the witnesses a chance to elaborate on the issues they feel are most relevant in this policy sector.  I hope that is acceptable to the farming organisations.</p><p> Deputy Carthy was the first to indicate that he wants to put questions to the witnesses.  As five organisations are present, I ask the witnesses to keep their answers as concise as possible so we can get through as much as possible in the one and a half hours.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#B00200"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their opening statements which are incredibly enlightening and comprehensive.  Taken together they outline the array of concerns the organisations have about the EU nature restoration regulations.  I have a number of questions.  I will ask them all and perhaps each of the organisations can respond to whichever questions are most pertinent to them.  I hope that will allow other members to have an equal opportunity.</p> <p>  In the first instance could the farming organisations give us a sense of what the implications of this regulation are for their members as it currently stands in draft form?  That would be welcome.</p> <p>  Members may or may not be aware a discussion is ongoing about evidence this committee heard last week on the interpretation of Article 9.  It specifically arises, and the context given was the Bord na M&oacute;na rewetting, as regards whether there will be a limit on non-agricultural, or it being capped, in terms of its impact on peatlands.  It has been suggested to the committee that the cap is 20%.  Regardless of how much other land is incorporated, farmers would be expected to make up 80% regardless of what else happens in society.  I am aware that all the organisations have independent advice and guidance and are experienced in interpreting EU law.  Therefore, it would be useful for this committee to get a sense of their interpretation of that article.</p> <p>  The third issue I would like some of the representatives touch on is the aspect of international trade.  There has been an increase in discussions on the implications of trade and how the trade deals agreed at EU level fit into obligations and regulations applied to Irish and European farmers.  In respect of this regulation, which could have far reaching consequences, do the witnesses have any view on how it could be applied in the context of implementing existing and agreeing new trade deals with third countries that do not apply the same level of regulation to peatlands?</p> <p>  My final question is based on the witnesses' knowledge and experience of dealing with EU institutions and EU regulations.  Do they believe this regulation will be implemented in its current guise or what scope can they see for amendments?  Have any of the organisations had contact with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that will be responsible for negotiating the position at Commission level?  If so, can they outline the feedback they received and where they believe this is going?  Considering at least one member state of the EU has already voiced an objection, do the witnesses think it is likely that other objections will follow?  Should the Irish Government lodge an objection to this regulation or is there scope to amend it to address their concerns?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#B00300"><p>I will respond to the Deputy's first and perhaps fourth questions.</p> <p>  Impact assessment is the key issue.  We are asking the Government to make a commitment that some form of impact assessment will be done before it is too late.  It is my understanding that much of this will begin to happen in November.  The first piece will be rolled out in November.  Critically an assessment must be done at national level to fully measure its implications.  We have heard different figures and totals for different types and amounts and of land, but we do not know.  We are unfortunately living in a vacuum.  I suggest the first thing the Government needs to do is assess the impact of its potential.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan, to respond to the Deputy's second and third questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#B00400"><p>I will follow up on what Mr. O'Brien said about the impact.  We have clarity on the drained peatlands.  We have some figures and we understand that is a measure under agriculture.  The issue we are concerned about is under Article 4 which applies to restoration and the wider enhancement and re-establishment of habitats.  That is where we lack clarity about the impact of this regulation and that is why the full impact assessment is essential.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's comment about Article 9 and the cap of 20%, it is also our understanding that 80% of the measure will be the responsibility of farmers who must rewet and restore that area.  In examining the regulations, it occurs to me that we need to move that measure from Article 9 to Article 4 because that is where the wider landscape is considered.  The responsibility for the measure will not then only be on farmers.  One is looking the wider landscape and at letting the member state to determine which areas are best suited to that kind of restoration.  That should be moved out of Article 9 and should not be the responsibility of farmers.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's comments about the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, we met with the environmental committee in the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations, COPA, yesterday.  The farming organisations of all member states are concerned about the implications of this.  Some member states have carried out analysis and found the impact on production and farming goes far beyond what they initially thought it would.  I cannot stress enough that we need to understand the land area and cost involved as well as how it will be managed and resourced at a national level.  If this is a legally binding target and if we miss the target by a small percentage, we are potentially open to a legal challenge.  This cannot be pushed forward without an understanding of the extent of what is required and the costs associated with it.</p> <p>  In drafting this regulation, it was identified that the reason the biodiversity targets were not achieved was that there was a lack of funding and resources.  That was a key reason previous biodiversity targets were not achieved.  It is thought that CAP will fund this regulation.  CAP does not have the ability to do so.  If this regulation is pushed through, we need to see a dedicated funding mechanism for biodiversity and nature restoration and it must be fully costed and understood.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#B00500"><p>I will try not to be repetitive.  Deputy Carthy asked a question about implications for our members.  It will devalue our land.  It has the potential to sterilise.  We saw that in the past with the hen harrier when there was a small incentive under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, but they disappeared after a short time.</p><p>There is a huge fear there, as was alluded to by others.  An impact assessment needs to be done to get a handle on its implication for farm families.  It could undermine their viability.  Ultimately, it could lead to a move away from the land.  One thing that struck me when I was involved in the Food Vision group was when it brought in a department official from Northern Ireland and his one fear regarding biodiversity was that there would be land abandonment.  It is the greatest threat to biodiversity and something to be borne in mind.</p><p> On international trade and this regulation, how concerned are our EU negotiators when they are involved in trade talks with Mercosur countries?  What questions are they asking on the environment?  Are we playing on a level playing field?  These are things I would be extremely sceptical about.  That leaves us at a severe disadvantage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Enright" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#C00200"><p>To follow on from Mr. McCormack's comments, Deputy Carthy asked about the implications for our members.  If you look at history and what happened in the birds and habitats directive, we have members across the country whose land was substantially devalued by the implementation of that regulation.  They have seen their land sterilised and the next generation move away from farming for the simple reason that they could not develop their farms.  That was 15% of the land area in this country.  To be quite honest, the treatment of farmers under that was horrendous.  People were treated very poorly under the habitats and birds directive.  It would not give farmers confidence that they are going be treated any better in the future.</p> <p>  In relation to the 20%, we have concerns about that.  If you read the European Commission's document, it states that these measures should cover at least 20% of the EU land and sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050.  It is 20% up to 2030.  After that, as far as I am aware, there is no limit.  To be fair to farmers out there, they are certainly engaging in environmental issues, but to be quite honest, the way they are being treated at the moment and the raft of regulations coming on them is making it very difficult for farmers to engage constructively with such regulations.</p> <p>  On whether it will be agreed in its current guise, from our perspective, we hope it will not be.  The reality today is that the CAP has effectively been hijacked; it is trying to turn the CAP into an environmental policy.  It is completely underfunded for what is required under environmental matters.  We would say very clearly that if we want to have nature restoration, we need to work with farmers, not against them.  At the moment, the direction in which this policy is going is working against farmers as opposed to working with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I will highlight a couple of issues that came to light in the course of reading the document and engagements we have had with CEJA at European level.  A lot of the focus in this committee in the previous hearing was around peatlands and drained peatlands.  When you delve down into the detail of the document, it references aspects that will affect every single farmer in the country.  I would like to bring the committee's attention to some of them.  The first point mentioned earlier was about restoration of peatlands.  It references, loosely, the word "restoration" on many occasions in the document.  Under Article 4, the only definition that contains a restoration measure is rewetting.  That is the only option there currently for the restoration of peatlands.  There is a piece at the end of the document that refers to Article 12.  It outlines the restoration plans and their implementation.  I bring the committee's attention to a piece on the reporting national governments must do.  It states that an indication of the subsidies which negatively affect the achievement of the targets and the fulfilment of the obligations set out in the regulation must be reported back to the Commission on the occurrence of each reporting period.  I do not know whether our question can be answered but could a negative subsidy mean that if the subsidies we give farmers under the likes of our dairy calf to beef scheme, beef schemes, CAP payments or basic payment are deemed to be supporting agricultural activities, which are not in unison with the objectives of this, put those payments to farmers at risk?</p> <p>  The second point, which is applicable to all farmers, comes as one of the main seven objectives of the overall document around point 3, which outlines to the following issues.  It outlines that in agricultural ecosystems, the overall increase in biodiversity must be measured and there must be a positive trend for the grassland butterflies to farmland birds, but the main point here is the stock of organic carbon in cropland mineral soils, which refers to all cropland soils in the country.  If the trend is not positive for soil organic carbon in all of those soils, what are the implications for all farmers?  If the trend is in the wrong direction, does that mean they are going to be penalised or that they will have to introduce restoration measures that are not defined within the document?</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was around trade.  At the moment farmers in the EU and Ireland are being put through enhanced measures, if that is what you want to call them, in terms of eco schemes and biodiversity to meet the objectives of the Green Deal.  However, we have other players in international markets who are supplying products competing with European products within our market.  We are speaking about putting further restrictions on the ability of agriculture and farmers to produce food, while potentially importing food from third countries which are not keeping pace with us, even with the gap they are at.  That gap is widening.  From the point of view of a farmer producing food in Europe and in Ireland, it does not make any sense for a young person or any farmer in that context to be embracing the measures that are set out in all of these environmental practices and so forth, which are very beneficial, while the EU on the other hand is agreeing trade deals with third countries that will not be implementing the same standards.</p> <p>  Before I ask Mr. Hanrahan to comment, the final point to round off all of the discussions that we will have today is on the importance of securing certainty for young people to enter the sector.  That is something which cannot be lost on the committee or the stakeholders within the industry.  Given the uncertainty around the future in certain sectors and the future in relation to the implementation of some measures in the new CAP and under the biodiversity measures, a serious investigation and assessment are needed on the impact of this on the whole industry and on any measures brought forward and the impact they are going to have on securing a future for young people in the sector, not just in Ireland as it is a problem across the EU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Hanrahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#C00400"><p>To follow on from Mr. Keane's point, first, we need to have clarity around the accurate measurement methodologies for carbon sequestration.  Otherwise, we do not know what we are here to try to set out to achieve.  Second, if it is implemented, we want clarity around the timeline duration and the funding and proposals and what benefits there are for farmers, if any.  Also, any restoration should be carried out through landowner agreement, not designation.  There is a need for clarity on the implications for adjoining landowners and in the case of rewetting land.  It does not just impact our members or the members of the other organisations here; it impacts all of rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Condon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#C00500"><p>There was a reference to moving land out of Article 9 and into Article 4.  That would remove it from agricultural activity, I believe.  Article 4 is not defined as agricultural land; it is defined as habitat.  Depending on how hill land is going to be defined in this restoration directive, it is going to have serious consequences for that land because Article 4 is not about agricultural land, whereas Article 9 is about restoration of agricultural ecosystems.  Article 4 states that there is going to be a re-establishment of areas not covered by those habitats.  That means there will be a reversal of improved hill lands.  Everyone knows that if you improve hill land, it will a costly exercise but reversing it will be extremely costly.  How are those costs going to be met?</p><p>This will be a legally imposed target.  We cannot see a funding stream identified anywhere in this document.  There is plenty of funding for developing ecologists and administrative staff in Europe but we cannot see any funding for the type of cost that will be imposed on farmers to meet this legal requirement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Roddy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#D00200"><p>I thank Mr. Condon for that.  To cover Deputy Carthy's points, on the first question on the implications for our members and for all farmers, we would have major concerns.  We would see it not as just a rewetting and a farming issue of farming.  There is a property rights' issue here if EU legislation can dictate what happens with one's property and if it can insist that one has to rewet it.  This is different from what is happening with the designations because they told one what one cannot do.  This is not only going to tell one what one cannot do but it is also going to tell one what one has to do.  That has clear implications for property rights and we need to be very aware of that.  That is not just with farming.  Once we start to impinge on property rights as regards farmland, we have to ask the question as to where that stops.  We need to be clear on that.</p> <p>  As regards Deputy Carthy's question on international trade, when he asked that question I was thinking about whether we are going to expect farmers to rewet land and take large areas of land out of agricultural use while at the same time trading with Brazil where more rainforests are cut away.  That does not make sense.  Maybe it makes sense to people at EU level if they want to sell Audis or other things to Brazil.  There is that trade side of things.  From our point of view, it cannot and should not happen.</p> <p>  On the implementation of this at EU level, first, when one looks at the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I know we had differing views here on CAP, approximately 70% of what was originally proposed by the Commission was in the final CAP plan.  Approximately, 30% was changed.  What we have to think about here is the 70% that is there, if that is where we end up.  We need to make sure the harder elements are taken out.  I would like to think that this would not happen at all but I am also a realist and I know that maybe we will have to find a landing ground in there.  </p> <p>  As regards the member state, we have asked that this committee turns this down and passes a motion stating it will not entertain it and put pressure back on the Cabinet.  As to whether that will happen, we hope it will happen but I do not know if the committee has the power to do that.  It will be down to what flexibility member states get.  The CAP allowed for a certain level of flexibility.  Will that flexibility be in this as well?  I will finish on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Punch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#D00300"><p>The implications are very serious for farmers.  I point the committee to Article 9(4) which refers to peatlands.  We are talking here about peatlands that have been reclaimed and that are in many cases productive agricultural land.  It has set out that by 2030, 30% of such areas will require restoration measures, of which one quarter will be rewetted.  It goes to 50% of such areas by 2040, of which at least half shall be rewetted, and 70% of such areas by 2050, of which at least half shall be rewetted.  That is a substantial impact.  Then there is the wider story of restoration measures for 20% of all agricultural land, and ultimately all ecosystems, by 2050.  We are talking about a substantial implication for much of the land in the country.  That is the first critical point.</p> <p>  This regulation is full of complexity and ambiguity.  Our concern would be that there has been no engagement with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on this with farm organisations to date.  This is part of a bigger pattern that troubles us whereby grandiose plans emerge from Brussels based on headline figures.  If we roll back a bit, this goes back to the EU biodiversity strategy where essentially a bit of horse-trading at Brussels-level led to a target of 30% of land being designated, one third of which would have strict protection on it.  These kind of ideals are being set at a high level without any understanding even at high levels within the member state.  We have asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine what this means and the truth of the matter is that it is not clear.  When we come back to this particular off-shoot of the EU biodiversity strategy, the proposed nature restoration regulation, we understand the Minister is minded to be supportive of it but we do not know on what basis and what discussion has been held at Government level to justify that particular position.  Our view would be that Ireland should, in the best traditions of EU negotiations, start out with a hostile antipathy to this because this has profound implications.  </p> <p>  Economic impact assessment was mentioned earlier.  That is absolutely essential.  There are financial implications of this, which are quite immense.  One figure I heard was 870,000 acres of peatland.  With land at &euro;10,000 per acre, that is &euro;8.7 billion worth of land potentially transformed from productive agriculture to less productive or non-productive.  This is big money.  The document itself suggests that the administrative costs for this are &euro;14 billion.  If the bureaucrats administering it are going to spend &euro;14 billion, can one imagine what the cost implication will be for our members whose farming activities are going to be totally decimated and whose land is going to be completely devalued?</p> <p>  Our concern is that the history of designation has been a lamentable one where for a long number of years people with designation had no scheme to compensate them in any way for the implications of it.  For example, we had the hen harrier farmers but there were many others as well.  Originally, there were National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, schemes.  They were then defunded.  The agri-environmental schemes were totally and utterly not fit for purpose for the people who had designations.  For those reasons, farmers are terrified of what is potentially coming down the track on this.  The key thing we want to say for a start is that there must be proper analysis of this and engagement between the Government and the stakeholder representatives before we go anywhere.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Carthy's question about international trade deals, an interesting point here is that when the Mercosur deal was done certain caveats were put in which essentially said that countries like Brazil would not do any further damage to rainforests or take further measures that would further damage their climate change situation.  It is interesting that we now have a new piece of legislation, a regulation, coming in at EU level that was probably not foreseen when the Mercosur deal was negotiated.  If one was to try to apply the logic that has been applied to European farmers, one should say that the equivalent in Brazil would be to look at all of the rainforests that were cut down over the past 70 years and tell them they have to restore them.  That would be the equivalent to what is being asked of European farmers for a start.  That is not going to happen because it is not provided for in the Mercosur deal.</p> <p>  The point is that we are hamstringing our farmers more and more in Europe and we have no possible way of putting equivalent conditions on trade deals that have now been signed and sealed although not delivered yet, and there is a long pattern of that.  That is what we would have to say to start with.</p></speech>

Time-wise it shows the complexity of this legislation and the ambiguity and huge concerns around it.</p><p>This evening we are only going to tinker at the edges of what is happening here.  I was talking to the secretariat this evening and when we come back after Christmas I am going to put to the committee that we devote three full meetings to this legislation coming from Brussels.  Then we intend to put a report together at the end of those three meetings because the possible impact of these proposals from Brussels is immense.  I think the onus is on this committee to give it serious scrutiny and put forward a very strong view to our Government of where we think it should go.  I will take two members together to see if we can get the points of view across.  I call Deputy Michael Collins who will be followed by Senator Paul Daly.</p></speech>

I would like to welcome the witnesses today.  I also have serious concerns about the financial implications for the landowners.  Have the organisations been consulted on how this will impact on the stakeholders?  Has an economic impact assessment been done on how much it will cost the farmer?  It is the farmer who is going to suffer.  Maybe the ICSA, the IFA or one of the other organisations might be able to answer those questions.</p></speech>

I suppose I have just one question for the five groups.  It is the ongoing debate.  We are living in exceptional times, as we all keep saying, and we are aware of the war in Ukraine and the whole debate on food security.  There has been much mention here of impact assessment statements but from a food production perspective, and playing devil's advocate, if this were to end up as is being predicted, what impact would it have on European and Irish food security and on forestry?</p></speech>

We have had absolutely no consultation from anybody on this and on what it is going to look like.  As all of the farming organisations have said, we need an impact assessment done immediately because at this stage many of us are flying fairly blind.  We are dealing with big legislation coming from Europe.  We do not know how much our own Departments have fully analysed this, but most certainly the impact assessments will need to be carried out because the financial damage this could possibly do to our rural community and our farmers is absolutely appalling.  That is really the most important thing from that is to say the answer is "No" and "No" unfortunately.  That is something we would like clarified.</p> <p>  On food security, and Senator Daly's question was about food production, if we are actively being asked to reduce our agricultural production activity on a piece of ground, obviously that will have an impact on food production.  This is something that we need to fully analyse.  Ultimately, as an industry, 140,000 farmers are farming and are depending on their income from agriculture.  If we are actively asking them to reduce farming activity, no matter what the figure will be, whether it is 10,000 farmers or 40,000 farmers, we do not know until this impact assessment is done.  If we are asking them to desist from agricultural production, then the only financial mechanism that look to be in place at this moment in time is CAP funding.  We are asking them to actively devalue their land as a result to receive CAP funding.  That is fundamentally flawed in our view.</p></speech>

As regards a cost analysis, as I said in response to Deputy Carthy, we need to see an impact assessment in place because it has a huge impact on the potential viability of a farm for the future generations, or maybe for a period of time where there needs to be an income for both generations in advance of a transfer.</p> <p>  As regards Senator Daly's question on food security and food production both within Ireland and the EU, we have seen over the last couple of years, initially with Covid and then with war in Ukraine, that food security was an issue.  It was the one thing that was scarce on the shelves in our shops and supermarkets.  It would potentially have a huge impact on our ability as a nation, as primary producers initially, to maintain production or output.  It would not be possible.  Given that we are facing two barrels as regards nitrates and the nitrates regulations, this cannot be taken as a single entity.  It would impact our ability to produce.  That would undermine the viability of our processors, whether it is dairy, beef, lamb, etc.</p> <p>  We have huge ambition, a huge target and huge aspiration as regards delivering from an environmental perspective in terms of planting of forestry.  I see this as a complete and utter pick-pocketing of the opportunity to deliver forestry plantations.  It will absolutely cease the planting of land.  I do not know whether or not my colleague, Mr. John Enright, wants to comment.</p></speech>

There is a bigger question here in terms of the economic assessment, which will be carried out on what effect it will have on farmers.  The bigger question, from a rural economy point of view, is that if you take the land area being talked about out of productive capacity, what effect will that have on the wider business circle that supports farming communities?  There is going to be an impact on your local co-ops, your local garage man, your local feed merchant and your local vet, who we will be speaking about later  A figure was mentioned earlier by Mr. Eddie Punch of 871,000 acres or thereabouts having to be rewetted.  That is an area a little smaller than the size of Tipperary.  If you want an impact assessment of the food that is produced out of the county of Tipperary, I think there is &euro;1 billion worth of exports of dairy alone from Tipperary.  In terms of an impact assessment, it is not very difficult to figure out what impact that is going to have on the country as a whole.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact on food and on forestry, and coming back to an earlier question Deputy Carthy asked, in terms of objections raised, I think Sweden and Finland are the only two countries that raised an objection.  The Swedish have carried out an assessment which shows that this will impact on 30% of their land area, from which nearly the majority of their forestry is supplied, and that is one of the major economic drivers in that country.  Naturally, at a time of high input prices and when wood-related products are scarce, they are concerned about that.  Similarly in Ireland, if you are looking at it from a food security point of view, we have no definition or indication as to what soil types are going to be affected or the areas it is going to be in.  Is it going to be tillage, is it going to be dairy or is it going to be beef?  What impact is that going to have not just in this country but in terms of international exports?</p> <p>  There is a huge task to be done by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  To follow up on a comment made in terms of funding, many different funding streams have been mentioned.  I think there are 12 potential funding streams laid out in the document.  However, the only funding stream committed to is &euro;100 billion for the implementation of biodiversity measures.  This may give members an insight into the foresight and support from the origins of this document not just for the agricultural sector but for rural economies if the single line item referring to funding is dedicated solely to ensuring biodiversity measures as opposed to the economic impact it is going to have on landowners.</p> <p>  Mr. Liam Hanrahan wants to make a brief comment.</p></speech>

Mr. Keane alluded to the area that may be taken out of farming productivity but the amount of land that would be affected would be far greater.  The surrounding lands cannot but be affected by this, and that also has to be taken into account.  It is easy enough to multiply &euro;1 billion by whatever you like.  The potential to put farmers out of business here is very serious, including farmers who do not sign up.</p><p>The bill will have an extremely serious impact on rural populations.</p></speech>

Mr. Keane and others have covered food security.  The impact will not only be on food security.  The wider impact on rural Ireland will be devastating and we must be conscious of that.  Most members of the committee are from rural Ireland but we hope other Deputies will recognise that as well.</p> <p>  No consultation has taken place with farming organisations.  It is interesting that the document states a public consultation process took place.  That is listed.  An online survey was conducted between January and April 2021 and 111,000 replies were received.  It is interesting that 97% were in favour of more aggressive EU restoration targets.  The figure of 97% is close to the results of some of Vladimir Putin's referendums in Ukraine so I do not know how much attention we can pay to it.  When we talk about this, we must also recognise that what is being proposed will hard-wire the EU biodiversity strategy into legislation.  It is a massive document and has major implications for us, but no consultation has taken place on that.  It has been sitting there since May 2020.  We have tried to engage but it has been minimal.  It is great that the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss is discussing it at the moment but we are concerned that forum will be seen as the consultation.  The people who really need to be consulted are the representatives of the farming organisations who are on the frontline.</p></speech>

It seems we are being told not to worry any more about generations of work.  Some of this land has been improved by maybe three or four generations and it is good agricultural fertile land today.  People's fathers and grandfathers worked the land to improve it.  It is shocking that 350,000 ha will be defined as in bad condition in Ireland.  The regulation wants to go back 70 years.  How can this be achieved without cutting food production and food security?  Is that to be cut back?</p> <p>  The ICSA is alarmed that no engagement with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has taken place.  There has been some discussion about the biodiversity strategy but none about this regulation on nature restoration.  How can the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications go gung-ho to Europe and support this?  I would like him to study the film "The Field" and Bull McCabe for his homework because that is not a fairly tale.  That is how strongly people feel about land they have reclaimed and improved over the years.  He ought to go and watch that film a few times so he can realise this is how strongly people feel.</p> <p>  Furthermore, the ICSA is concerned that government representative groups are totally left out of the access to justice.  Where is the access to justice for farmers whose land will be taken away and restored or rewetted?  We should all be asked whether the Government is acting in the best interests of the Exchequer in agreeing to a clause that will tie the State up in legal actions for years to come.  It can fund all these NGOs and do all these things but it will tie up the Government for years in litigation.  In particular Article 16 will have to be refused or shot down in its current form.  Ireland needs to put up a big battle against this.  As my colleague said, we cannot take out arable land equivalent in size to Tipperary and turn it back into a bog or bad land.  That is land that has been improved over the past 70 or 80 years by generations of people.  People who do not realise the implication of what they are doing are making regulations.  I saw big drains being closed by flagstones.  That land was first improved by the current farmers' grandfathers many generations ago and now all that work is useless.  People cannot stand for this.  This will cause mayhem.  I will pass over to my colleague Mr. Punch who is better at technicalities than I am.</p></speech>

The member state has to agree a nature restoration plan with the Commission.  This is a complex and drawn-out process, as we all know, where consultation with stakeholders will presumably, or should, take place and will inevitably take place with environmental groups.  Article 16 states that access to justice is specifically for the environmental NGOs.  The Government has to make and implement policy but essentially Article 16 gives a veto, as it were, to the environmental lobbyists to take action against the Government if they are not happy with the plan the Government has put forward and agreed with the Commission or with how it is being implemented.</p> <p>  There has to be a level of responsibility for Government Ministers to say they will not entertain EU regulations that undermine their ability to govern and hand over the process to a one-sided litigious battle where environmental NGOs are given a specific role.  What about access to justice for farmers and landowners?  What about our constitutional property rights?</p></speech>

I am saying that 80% should not be on agricultural land.  It should be decided at a member state level so that we identify the best areas - not the farmland - but we identify and make the decision as to what land is restored.  The responsibility will fall on farmers if it is under Article 9, which is not fair because 80% has to be restored.  If we look at a wider landscape under Article 4, then the member state can choose to reduce the percentage of farmland that would fall under the requirement to be restored or rewetted.</p></speech>

There is probably a pathway to achieving that but definitely moving those significant areas of land into Article 4 is a massive land use change.

Farm organisations will have been involved in the Life project.  My understanding is that is voluntary.  Is every farm organisation still involved in it or are they out of it?  That is a question for every organisation.  We got an email today from an MEP which we were talking about before the meeting started.  There is a dispute about the information we were given from the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations, COPA, and an MEP has written back.  What interpretation do the witnesses have of the 20% because there is a debate going on about that?  Can the 20% come from the State or not?  The other part of that email referred to a difference between restoration and rewetting.  In my opinion, there is not but I would know the witnesses' views on that.  When did the farm organisations become aware of this because it was by chance that we became aware of this so when did all of the farm organisations become aware of it.  What has been done up to now about it?</p><p>Are the farm organisations going to unite with us?  Mr. Dermot Kelleher talked about <i>The Field</i>and I know exactly where he is coming from because people with spades tried to reclaim this land and put in stone shores and then diggers came along and they made it better.  Is there tick-tacking between  farm organisations or is there any tick-tacking with other countries?  We are hear that Sweden, Finland and Holland are objecting to it.  Is there any tick-tacking going on?  Can we nip this in the bud?  My understanding is that it is in its infancy.  Sweden is getting the Presidency and we hear it will lie idle for six months.  Do the witnesses envisage a problem like when you get older and you get the pension?  In 2030, it might be that Bord na Mona's bit will cover it and 2040 is in the distance and you might be retired by then but it is something you are clawing at, it is down the road and it is a ferociously hard thing to keep on top of.  It could be another generation looking after the land in 2040 or 2050.  I am not trying to retire anyone early or anything like that but do the witnesses understand where I am coming from?  It is like a long haul of a battle.  What tack are we taking?  Are the farm organisations going to get more informed about it because other than the papers they have done and what this committee has done, there was not much about it up to the last month?  I have no doubt that we will sit as a committee and put our points across.</p><p>I will await Ireland's response because my understanding is that it has not gone in yet even though the Minister, Deputy Ryan, thinks it has gone in.  I am awaiting that response to see where we are because we are on the back foot.  My understanding is that a big decision like that would take the three leaders to meet and a decision would have to be made at Cabinet because this is the future of an awful lot of farms around the country.  I would like the witnesses to address all of those questions because I will back to them if they are not answered.</p></speech>

I am conscious that other members want to come in, so I am just going to make a few points.  I am reading a book at the moment about the ideas, aspirations and objectives of Davitt's Land League, which contains so many of the reoccurring themes we are talking about.  Last week we had the mushroom production sector in.  I talked to those involved and told them get political.  The next day I did three or four interviews with various journalists about it.  What I meant was that it was about time we got political.  It is great to see the farm organisations represented here because the harmony and the singing off the one hymn sheet does not always happen.  Irish farm organisations need to get political and I say that loud and clear.  For years they were highly organised, highly motivated, highly co-ordinated and the political establishment in Leinster House sat up and listened.  They were a force to be reckoned with.  They were a political organisation but somewhere in all of that, they become slightly watered down.  I see in front of me today a resolve, a strength and the ability and capacity to mobilise a national campaign.  That is when farm politics really matters and I would encourage the organisations to do that.  I just want to say that at the outset.  It is shocking in terms of communication but that in itself somewhat reflects on the political establishment, but that is the reality of it.  It is terrible that no full cost-benefit analysis has yet been carried out on the impact on large and small scale agriculture and on rural populations.  We hear so much about rural Ireland and the political commitment to rural communities but we have been talking about the water extraction Bill and about peat in horticulture, nursery stock, agriculture and in the mushroom sector again and now we are talking about this.  In a matter of days and weeks we are talking about ongoing issues and challenges that are attacking both the livelihoods and sustainability of farm incomes but, more important, of agricultural communities.  I do not need to lecture the organisations as they know this but I just want to let them know we are picking that up on this side.</p> <p>  I have read all the submissions and want to thank all the groups who made them.  Six recurring or common themes kept jumping off the pages of all the submissions and they were as follows.  There is a need for new funding outside of CAP.  The lack of financing has been identified as a key failure in the EU meeting its 2020 biodiversity targets.  The proposal lacks clear and long-term financial support for nature restoration with the majority of this expected to come from CAP funding itself, and there are some issues there.  Restoration can only be achieved if it is not dependent on CAP budget and is funded through a dedicated financial mechanism for biodiversity and restoration.  Long-term restoration requires long-term resources and not short-term measures, and I think we would all agree with that.  It is necessary that restoration is funded through a dedicated financial mechanism.</p> <p>  What I am saying is that we hear loud and clear what is being said.  The organisations should unite, mobilise and bring their cause to community halls up and down this country.  Put the leverage on the politicians, on the political establishment and the main political parties, the tripartite coalition Government, that is in place.  They will have to sit up and they will have to listen but, more important, they will be motivated politically to listen and to respond.</p></speech>

Maybe I will just focus on what is happening in Europe between the other farm organisations.  Yesterday myself and Geraldine O'Sullivan were in COPA-COGECA.  The Deputy mentioned Sweden and Finland but other countries such as Germany and Austria among others are as concerned as we are.</p><p>They are bringing this back to their politicians with so much fear and trepidation about what this could possibly look like for farming incomes and farming practices going forward.  Yes, most certainly the lead is Sweden.  They have already written back to the Commission rejecting the proposals.  We spent time with our Finnish counterparts yesterday and they were very fearful of how this will impact on them.  Among the whole COPA-COGECA family of farm organisations, there is considerable concern.  I will ask Ms O'Sullivan to speak on Article 4.</p></speech>

As part of the sectoral targets in July, when they were setting the land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, they said that before they could set the LULUCF target, there would need to be a land use review.  That was going to take 18 months.  They were to gather all the current information that has been available and that has been worked on.  I think that is what the Minister was referring to as the phase one in the development, that is, in identifying how they were going to set that sectoral target.  That is looking at existing information in relation to our land use, soils and starting the process.  Then it will go into phase two and that is being led by the EPA.</p> <p>  On the Life project, I think Deputy Fitzmaurice is referring to the Burren Life project.</p></speech>

There is lack of clarity on what good condition and favourable areas are.  There are many different terms used within this, including what they mean and the practicality of implementing them on the ground within each of the member states.</p></speech>

I am glad the Senator saw similarities in trends because the challenge is there for all of the sectors we represent.  We will not shirk our responsibilities from a political level.  Equally, I would say to the Senator and to every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas that they have a duty and an obligation to keep our Government, in particular the Minister who will be going to Europe to fight that battle, honest, if that is what the Government decides to do.  It is critical that it does that as we move forward.  From a European perspective, we will certainly be involved with the European Milk Board.  Our Dutch and Danish colleagues, in particular, are being ground to a halt in a similar way to ourselves as regards legislation, bureaucracy and environmental issues.  The word "sustainability" comes up time and again but unfortunately it is environmental and ecological sustainability.  What is lacking right across the board on all occasions is an onus on the economic sustainability and the economic impact that can deliver.  That has a huge social impact on rural Ireland.  Whether it is the church, irrespective of its denomination, sport, irrespective of its code, or the parish council, farm families and the rural economy are driven by the rural output and that output is going to be severely impacted.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  On the first comment on peat soils, people have this impression that peat soils are non-productive.  We have members milking cows, finishing cattle and sheep and growing tillage crops on peat soils.  People do not realise that.  They are making a huge contribution to the rural economy.  People need to bear that in mind when talking about peat soils.</p> <p>  On the phase one of the land use being done, we are aware the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is doing work on land use and designation of soils but it has not provided us with the data behind that as of yet.</p> <p>  On the Life project, as a organisation, we are not directly involved but we would have members involved in Life projects and EIP projects.  These are all voluntary.  They work well and farmers co-operate with them.  Farmers are treated with respect, which is important to say.</p> <p>  On working with farm organisations, our president and I were at the EMB general assembly in April and there was discussion about this land restoration law.  It is one of many different laws that are impacting farmers at the moment.  We have seen what is happening with the nitrates and with climate change.  This is across Europe; there are the same issues in every country.  It seems to be a raft of regulation after regulation, some impacting dairy farmers, some impacting sheep farmers and some impacting everybody.  There are huge pressures on people and there is no appreciation of that.  I think every issue has been covered.</p></speech>

It looks like an attack on rural Ireland by stealth.  There are so many things coming down the pike, attacking rural Ireland.  It seems to me that there are people attacking rural Ireland who do not understand.  It is grand to say it is peaty soils.  There is silage being cut in place that could have been a bog three generations ago but now it is silage ground and is the best of ground.  Where is the definition going to come in?  How many farmers are going to be closed down?  As for the farm organisations in Europe, Mr. Eddie Punch has been in contact with our colleagues in Europe.  This thing cannot be let go through.</p> <p>  It is scandalous that we have a Minister who went out gung-ho and accepted this.  He never spoken to us as a farm organisation.  To my knowledge, the Minister has had no contact with the stakeholders.  That is absolutely shocking given the implications for this country.  There is &euro;14 billion for administration but the farmers will do it voluntarily.</p><p>Honestly, this whole thing is crazy.</p></speech>

Regarding the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the question on phase one, as Ms O'Sullivan said, our understanding would be the sectoral target in the LULUCF.  We are looking at mapping and assessing peat soils.  I know Teagasc is currently doing so also.  This is a requirement under Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition, GAEC, 2.  We had a big battle on that a year ago because, as Mr. Condon referred to, there were proposals at EU level under CAP to take away the agricultural activity on peat soils.  I thank all of the members who supported that campaign.  We got it turned around.</p> <p>  On the Life projects - I know there is a Burren Life project - there are some and they are very good.  We were asked by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to support an application for a Burren-like scheme, the one referred to, I think, in the west and north west.  We were happy to support that because the Burren is quite popular.  When we saw the detail of the proposal when it came out, we withdrew our support because, as was said, it talks about rewetting of peatlands and a number of other things.  Although I know some farmers have done quite well out of it, the other big issue with that particular scheme is the proportion of money that goes to the scheme on administration and environmentalists, as opposed to the money that is going to the farmers.  I think it is &euro;25 million but I could be wrong.  Out of &euro;25 million in total, I think there is something like only &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million going to farmers.  We have problems around that.  I could be wrong on those exact figures.</p> <p>  On the 20% from the State, that is a big issue.  If the State cannot-----</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Condon wants to come in on that.  Our reading is that the 20% will cause major problems for us because if that is the 20%, then the 80% will have to be delivered from private land.  It goes back to the point we made earlier about the 80%.  This is about property rights as well.  That is our read on that.  Perhaps Mr. Condon wants to think about that and come in on it.</p> <p>  We were asked when we became aware of it.  I think it was around early September.  It has been in the pipeline a while when you look at everything else and at what is happening regarding crossland use and the GAEC, 2.  A project was proposed by University of Galway around restoration of peatlands.  That specifically mentioned the removal of CAP payment from people who do not rewet lands.  This went out to Brussels at the time and would have been highlighted in some sectors.  I tried to find it on my phone.  We can share it with the members when we find it.  While it came as a surprise in some respects, there has been development on this over the last two or three years, about which there is no doubt.</p> <p>  On whether we see a problem with this, in that it is down the road, the Deputy is right.  Farmers are going to look at this and see that it is not going to affect them now, and that is a concern.  It is a concern to try to motivate farmers and to recognise the real threat that there is.  Against that, restoration is not something that happens by clicking your fingers.  There is a lead-in time for that, so the fact that targets have been set is a clear problem.  It is not just about 2030 and 2050.  In order to deliver targets in 2030 and 2050, we are going to have to start implementing actions in a year or two years' time.  Farmers are going to see that.  That is the point we need to get out there.  Perhaps Mr. Condon wants to say something.</p></speech>

We believe that the law on rewetting of agricultural land will be a fact.  The scientific evidence on rewetting of agricultural land is also a fact.  According to an expert who gave evidence to this committee, emissions following the rewetting of formerly agricultural land can be very high and could persist for decades after rewetting.  Based on this evidence, an NGO could take a case that its right to a clean environment under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is being impaired by rewetting and that such rewetting of agricultural land is not compliant with prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources under Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Based on those two facts, farmers could be before the courts if they rewet and if they do not rewet.</p></speech>

Similarly, none of the details around what is going to happen regarding that have been imparted to us as of yet.</p> <p>  On the Burren Life project the Deputy spoke about, we have supported EIPs and investigations on that.  We also have some members involved but in terms of wider-scale support, we have not been involved.</p> <p>  On the impact of the 20% to achieve targets, our interpretation of that is quite black and white.  It is very clear within the regulation which states that of the maximum area that is to be rewetted, up to a maximum of 20% can be achieved from peat extraction points.  From our side, unless there is something to the contrary, it is fairly black and white that 20% can be taken from peat extraction points.  Currently, with 80,000 ha under Bord na M&oacute;na, that does not even meet 20% of the overall amount of land they are speaking about.  It is currently 352,000 ha.</p> <p>  We also have serious questions and concerns about Article 12, where it refers to the organic soil carbon content in all carbon soils and that it must have a positive trend.  I am not sure how anybody proposes to do that, when we are currently only doing the research that can tell us how much organic carbon is stored in our soils.  Teagasc has, I think, 15 or 20 different soil towers that are establishing that at the moment.  I am not sure about the timeline.  We have outlined in our document that there is talk of putting this into practice in 2024, to have plans in by the end of 2026 and to come into force in 2027.  The research by Teagasc will not be completed on a large scale even by that stage.  What are we basing the baseline measurement on?</p> <p>  The other question on the measurement implications is on the role other soils, aside from peatlands and so forth, will have in terms of reducing the impact on emissions and habitats.  As was rightly pointed out, how can one be sure that a measure conducted by one farmer does not affect the land outside the ditch?  The last time I checked and drained land at home, water did not know where the ditches were.  If Mr. Hanrahan is doing something on his land, how does it not negatively impact on my land right as well?</p> <p>  On the restoration question, there are no other definitions or references given for what restoration looks like other than rewetting.  That is the only measure mentioned in the entirety of the document.  Where it breaks down is that we must have 30% of such areas done by 2030 and at least one quarter rewetted.  We are going to have to rewet them all to meet that.  That is the reality of it.</p> <p>  On the question of tick-tacking between us and other member states.  We have engaged with our European young farmer partners in CEJA and are meeting them next week specifically on this.  The Swedish, Finnish and Norwegians have serious concerns about this, as do some of our members in eastern European countries, as the implications for frozen soils also come into this.  Obviously, that does not affect us but affects other EU members states.</p> <p>  Envisaging the problem down the line, while Mr. Hanrahan may be a bit younger than me, I have the luck of being one of the youngest members in the room.  The Deputy may be trying to retire others in the room, but I hope to still be farming in 20 or 30 years' time.  That is my ambition.  Having the durability and persistence to stick it out is something we will need to have no matter who is sitting in the positions representing the organisations here today.  Letting something like this slip through is simply not an option.  All doors and accesses to agriculture must be kept open, no matter if they are in this habitats directive or in Bills before other groups proposing measures around access for young people.</p><p>We must all unite behind those to make sure all doors are left open for young people.</p><p> As regards the final question around the environment and what has been sent forward from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, our understanding is that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage also has a role to play here because the habitants and the biodiversity directives fit under the remit of the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  We have not had any engagement or the Department has not reached out to us on any of these points and I am not sure whether any of the members know what engagement has gone on between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications or the Department responsible for implementing biodiversity measures which is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We would love to know what measures and what communications have happened between those three different Departments.</p></speech>

I ask Deputies to keep their questions as brief as possible please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#K00300"><p>I thank the guests for their presentation.  What we are talking about here is massive.  Land use and land use change and, as Mr. Keane just said, it is not just the farms or the lands where it happens, but it is adjoining land as well.  We can basically say we are looking at much of the country here.  My questions arise from the countries that are objecting.  What is our position?  It is not just the D&aacute;il that can object.  The Seanad can object as well and it has a massive role to play here.  We can object on the principle of subsidiarity so we need to look at that and at what is in the regulation and see how we can tie in one with the other.  I have two questions.  The first is around the timeframe for objecting.  The committee members probably think I should know.  Normally it is eight weeks from when the document is presented to the Council, etc.  Can we get clarity about how long we have before these objections have to be in for what we call the yellow and the red card procedure?  Have we missed the boat here?  I certainly hope we have not but I would like to know the timeframe.  If we cannot halt this project so it can be substantially revised or thrown out, which could happen, we then get to the point where there has to be agreement with the Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and there are real opportunities to influence there.  As Mr. Roddy mentioned, 70% of what was in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, proposal from the Commission ended up in the final document and that generally tends to be the way.  It is not without precedent that draft directives or regulations have been completely reversed and that is the kind of territory we are in here.  There is much more I could say but I want to give others a change to get in.</p> <p>  I support what Senator Boyhan said about these being political decisions and we need to know where political parties and Government stand on this.  Most of the people here will know I am quite pro-EU in many ways, and always have been, but when we are presented with something that looks to impact so significantly on land use and land use change, we cannot turn a blind eye.  We have to have definite statements from those who are in a position to examine and investigate this regulation, look at its implications, etc., as to where they stand on it.  I fully share Senator Boyhan's fears and concerns around this legislation.</p> <p>  If history has taught us anything, it is this.  When we designated land before, I am old enough to remember the meetings where it was said there would be no designation without compensation.  I attended those meetings.  We now know where we are and what happened subsequently.  What is the position of the relevant Ministers and the Government?  What sort of timeframe do we have to object to this draft legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#K00400"><p>I am very concerned about the fact that there has not been any consultation with the farm organisations.  This is extremely serious legislation, a very serious regulation, which could result in a potential land-grab so it is concerning.  My constituents and the farm organisations in Laois-Offaly have been very proactive in highlighting this and the fact that the rewetting of peatlands is serious and it also takes away control from the landowner.  Only today, the Chair hosted a good briefing on forestry and we all learnt about the importance of afforestation in meeting our climate action targets.  We are currently behind with that and with meeting the 8,000 ha per year.  That means we are now going to have to plant more forestry.  These environmental NGOs are doing too much dictating and are being funded to the hilt by the taxpayer.  I have called for them to be defunded because it is criminal that they are getting &euro;5.2 billion of funding every year.  Some of those taxpayers are farmers and they are the people these NGOs are punishing much of the time.  I have made no bones about calling for these organisations to be looked at and overhauled.</p><p>You are talking away control from farmers.  There is a need now more than ever for afforestation and a forestry policy and for more uptake on that.  Again, it is the farmers choice, if they want to do that.  These environmental groups cannot have it every way.  My question is on the assessment and the need for analysis, which I fully support.  It is ludicrous to do something without having the fundamental piece such as an assessment or analysis done in advance.  Some member states have done that.  That is great as at least some are showing leadership on this issue but have these states influenced the direction of agricultural policy?  The reason I ask is that I was very disappointed to see that a KPMG report commissioned by the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>on emissions - it was a particularly good report, I might add - was not taken on board.  My concern is if this analysis is done in other member states, we need good examples and evidence of how it is going to influence agricultural policy.  We need buy-in from rural Deputies and we need unity among rural Deputies and Government now more than ever.  I will certainly work with any Deputy who is sensible and pragmatic but we need to make sure we get this right and resist any attempt to instigate a land grab.  I will help in any way I can.</p><p>Mr. Keane referred to Sweden in terms of the analysis and the objections were also mentioned but I would like to see some evidence on how the agricultural policy was influenced.  That is what we need to do in here.  There are more than 12 Green Party Deputies in Leinster House and we need to see action.  Much of the time, rural Deputies, whether Government or not, or those who are Independent like myself, are very much on the one page.  We need unity and we need to resist this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#K00500"><p>I thank all the witnesses and the organisations here, especially Macra na Feirme.  It is grand to see young farmers here who are concerned and who hope they can live out their lives farming.  At one time it used to be a privilege, an honour and an advantage when the farm was given to the young fella that inherited the farm.  It was an advantage for a long time but now it is a millstone around their necks.  If they were to do what their fathers who handed it down to them, did, there is a fair weight on their shoulders to do the same thing in 30 or 40 years' time when they hand it down to their sons or daughters.  That is the worry I have when you hear this kind of carry on about rewetting lands after farmers in our side of the country anyway, including myself, got grants to drain places.  I broke my leg in a drain when a stone fell in on top of it, so I know what it is.  I boil with temper when I hear all this carry on is going to happen.  The result of this could be that farmers will be forced to carry this out.  Like the young fellow said earlier, we will be wondering about what the next fella is doing.  I could bring you to my own field.  The upper part of the field might be drained to catch the water.</p><p>Where will the line be drawn?  In fields like that, are we going to rip them asunder?  Where we have been cutting silage for many years now, we will only have half the field left.  It could be different on better land but I have to talk about my side of the country.  I am on the other side of the hill from Mr. Kelleher.  I took the presenter from Radio Kerry to an elevated point in Kilgarvan and I asked him what he made of what he could see.  In places like Kilgarvan - it is replicated all around south Kerry, down into Ballingarry, which is north-west Cork, and over the other hill into south-west Cork - all you have are a few fields maybe in one corner of the place and the rest of it is all bushes, bog, rock and every kind of misfortune you could ever think of.  There are places you could not even walk through.  I asked him how much of that ground was being fertilised.  Ground that is green is peaty ground.  It is black ground as well call it.  It is reclaimed ground.  Where is the line going to be drawn here?  Those fellas have enough land and are sequestering carbon already.  It is like giving medicine to some fella before the doctor comes.  We are not being told what we are already sequestering.  Before we go one step further, that is what should happen.  We should be told what we are sequestering.</p><p> We have fellas who will not let us cut hedges along the road.  They say we are hurting the wildlife, the birds or whatever, but there is another side to the ditch.  We are not insisting that the hedges have to be cut there.  These are the kind of things-----</p></speech>

All I am asking is that the people of Ireland be treated fairly.  What I see in Kerry is replicated around the country in other counties.  Every fella must look after his own.  Whether Government or Opposition Deputies or Senators, we must all join together to ensure that fairness is meted out.  We are all on the same page as far as helping the environment is concerned but we cannot blame the farmer or drive fellas down into borrows and ensure they will not have a livelihood.  The likes of these young fellas will finish up emigrating or something.  We must all fight this and we must ask for clarity.  There must be a proper debate before we go any further in rewetting land-----</p></speech>

I have been at other meetings but I have been dipping in and out and following proceedings.  It is great to see unity among all the farm organisations on this.  What has been unveiled today is very frightening.  It is not just a rural issue.  If this happens, it will have huge consequences for the whole of Ireland.  We have had incessant rain in Dublin today and I would say there is not a provincial town in Ireland that has not been beset by flash floods today.</p> <p>  The very idea of thinking we could rewet 20% of the country and somehow cope with it is beyond all bounds.  It has serious consequences for large towns and cities.  If you look at our population, there are thousands of people coming into this country on a weekly basis and this has huge ramifications.  God made the land but he only made a limited amount of it.  This is something we have to look at very cautiously.</p> <p>  I was struck by one point in the ICSA's opening statement.  It states that there is a view in government that this can be achieved on a voluntary basis with appropriate incentives.  I am a Government Deputy and I refer people to the comments made by my colleague, the Chairman, Deputy Cahill, who referenced this issue in the D&aacute;il today.  He said it would be inconceivable to allow land on a family farm that has been built up over generations and that has been nurtured and cared for to be rewetted.  For the people who listen in-----</p></speech>

I always listen to the Chairman.  Believe it or not, even though it is probably clashing with "Eastenders", there are a few boffins who listen to these committees.  For people who are not from rural Ireland, it is very important to give some context.</p> <p>  The IFA stated an increase to more than 315,000 ha of peatland would require approximately 157,000 ha to be rewetted by 2050.  That is the equivalent of two and a half times the amount of land we are farming in County Longford at the minute.  It is extraordinary and we need to put it into context to let the non-farming public realise what is entailed.  That is effectively rewetting County Longford.  I know many of the wags on Twitter will say that might not be any harm but the people of Longford are very attached to their bogs and waterways.  It is easy for someone at European level to think these things and that they are great ideas.  There has to be unity among the rural Deputies - I agree with Deputy Nolan in this regard - whether they are in party, in government or Independent.  I take my lead on agricultural matters from my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, and from the Chairman, Deputy Cahill.  Let there be unanimity in the House.  I come back to the point that there is not a view in Government that this can be achieved voluntarily.  We will do everything to ensure that is the message that goes back Europe.</p></speech>

Like other Deputies and Senators, I was dipping in and out of a meeting.  The economic impact this could have on our agricultural entities has not been quantified in so many ways.  We are looking at the co-operative movements, the meat factories and all the way down to the merchants.  If were to bring this forward, the 20% rewetting proposal, it would have a huge economic impact across the rural hinterland.  A real study needs to be done on what that would mean for these entities, for us as a community, for us as a farming community and for west Cork and Longford.  These rural entities would in so many ways be grossly affected.  I do not know where one would go to quantify it.</p> <p>  The big thing here is that the majority of rural people and farmers did not realise this would affect the majority of farmers.  They thought it would affect a minority of farmers.  The majority are going to be tied into this.  That will be the pinch point here.  This is going to affect you, whether you are in dairy, beef, sheep or  forestry.  You are all in the circle here and you are all tied in, with the potential of anything up to 20% or more of your land being rewetted.  What that would mean for you, as an entity, whether you are sustainably farming, is probably negative.  It would probably mean that you will not be in a position to hand on your farm even though, like all of us, you try to build up your farm to move it on.  You do not want to go backwards.  That is probably where this measure is going to go.</p> <p>  We had a session last Wednesday.  These sessions have been really informative for the general public.  For the first time, the public realise what is being proposed here.  Last week's session, in particular, gave an indication of what is on the table.  People and farmers never thought it would come to this.  We need to build on it and we need to get that message out there.  The impact for rural Ireland and not just the farming community is unbelievable.  We have co-operatives that have invested hundreds of millions of euro in stainless steel.  Meat plants and merchants are going to be devastated if this happens.</p></speech>

Could the witnesses give a brief summary of the five observations made?  Deputy Harkin asked a question about the timeframe and the decision-making process.

With regard to Deputy Harkin's question, as we understand it, the fact that Sweden has now written back to the Commission to reject the proposal will slow things down to a certain extent.  However, all of the timelines have been spoken about and we believe the Commission is looking to have this finished by the end of 2023 when each member state is to go back with a two-year lead-in period for how it will enact this.</p></speech>

As a result, Ireland will have two years to enact the policy, which will become law from 2026 or 2027 onwards.  This is an ideal opportunity, however, for us to step back and reflect.  This may answer the questions from Deputy Healy-Rae and Senator Lombard; it is not too late to do a full impact and financial assessment of how this will look for rural Ireland.  The enormity of this cannot be understated.  It is an opportunity for us all.  I have not heard anybody in this room say anything other than that he or she believes these proposals are enormous and will have such an impact that we should all be able to put a green jersey on and work together as a D&aacute;il and Seanad and as farming organisations to try to lessen the impact at farm level.</p> <p>  Deputy Flaherty asked where people would go if they left rural Ireland.  We must consider the enormity of this.  We are all trying to encourage another generation of farmers to come into and continue the business.  However, if farmers do not believe there will be a future for them to do so, the options at that stage are to go to the big towns and cities and rural Ireland will decline as a result.</p></speech>

However, given how recent the proposal is, it has not really had an opportunity to sway or influence agricultural policy yet.</p></speech>

His last comment was about the public realising what the proposal is today.  Does the public realise what the economic effect will be?  Can any of us fully establish the economic effect without an assessment being done?  That would be challenging.  Deputy Flaherty talked the effect that the proposal could have on large towns.  Whether it is dairy or beef, it is processed adjacent to our rural towns, it is the backbone.  In many cases, such processing is the primary employer within that town, the driver of the rural economy in the area and the spin-off for other activity.  Deputy Healy-Rae may have been speaking of my generation when he said that one time it was a privilege to become the farmer whereas now it is a millstone around the farmer's neck.</p> <p>  We have to take seriously the results of the UCD survey on mental health within agriculture.  While all of this debate is going on, we are talking about people's lives, livelihoods and homes and what they, their fathers and their grandfathers have worked for.  With one flash of a biro, this could all be undermined for this generation or indeed for the generations to come.  It is no wonder or surprise that the results were as they were.  It is a sad state of affairs that among the issues, one was the way farmers were being spoken of in the public domain and the other was the legislation and bureaucracy to remain compliant with the various different hurdles that are put in front of us from an EU perspective.</p> <p>  I acknowledge Deputy Nolan's work with us in the ICMSA on the re-wetting of the Bord na M&oacute;na bogland and the effect on the surrounding areas.  She is dead right about forestry and the 8,000 ha.  That is a considerable aspiration and it becomes greater with this set of circumstances.  My colleague, Mr. Enright, will deal with what Deputy Harkin said about the Parliament and the issues there but we certainly need to mobilise as a sector, a nation and a rural economy.</p></speech>

Discussions are taking place with the Parliament and the Council at this stage.  We can talk about doing an economic assessment here in Ireland and we need to insist that the Commission do that, because it introduced the farm to fork strategy without any economic assessment of the impact on rural communities of farmers.  Our Government cannot let it away with that again.  We will have to put the facts on the table with regard to what the implications are for people and rural communities.  Our Government will have to insist on that at European level.</p></speech>

This is a total attack on rural Ireland and moreover on disadvantaged areas in rural Ireland.  Deputy Healy-Rae made a great point because 20% is a kind of a con job.  I know one farmer who rewetted his land and the water would be up over the roofs of all the lads beside me before it would come to me.  Lads on top of hill will drown everyone else around them.  It is grand to say that we should wet so much of the land but one cannot wet a piece of a field or a piece of a farm.  I know of land that has been improved over three, four or five generations.  The land has been improved nearly as far back as the time of the Famine.  We now have a Minister who will go to Europe and accept all of this.  He needs to watch Bull McCabe a few times and memorise how seriously people take to land they have improved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Punch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#M00900"><p>With regard to Deputy Harkin's questions, the subsidiarity question is important.  The EU has referred to this in its document and claims that subsidiarity can be set aside because biodiversity is such a transnational problem that it cannot be solved by subsidiarity.  That should be challenged nonetheless because, while biodiversity is an international issue, it is different between each member state and having a one-size-fits-all strategy here has to be contested.</p> <p>  With regard to some of the decision-making process, as the Deputy knows well, there is a process whereby the European Parliament side of the decision-making has been handed to the ENVI committee in this case and that is significant because there are many people on the ENVI committee who are not sympathetic to Irish farming.  We have representatives and substitutes on the committee but considerable work will have to be done there.  On the one hand, one is off to a bad start if one starts in ENVI.  On the other, it is on a working group which is linked to the Environment Council of ministers of the environment.  That has many implications for how this will go.</p> <p>  Land use came up earlier on.  This whole thing has become considerably complex.  We have, on the one hand, climate targets that are totally focused on emissions and, on the other hand, the land-use change sector and the storage of carbon.  It seems that much of the burden for tidying up the emissions of other sectors is now being visited down on landowners.</p><p>A lot of discussion must be had here about the extent to which farmers are getting the blame for the fossil fuel and energy sectors.</p><p> This is massively complex.  I am not at all satisfied we as farm organisations have the resources to deal with this stuff coming at us.  I am not entirely sure the Department of Agriculture has the resources to deal with it either.  I was told by Department officials they thought some of these measures may be voluntary but who is going to volunteer to sign up for rewetting?  There is also discussion, by the way, about carbon credits and there is work afoot in the EU to decide whether farmers can be given some financial reward for storing carbon, but this is a hugely complex and not widely understood area.  It is quite obvious all the farm organisations here do not have the personnel and resources, and that is in contrast to the huge resources that seem to be available to the environmental lobby at an EU level.</p></speech>

I am appreciate the comments that have been made by members.  Deputy Harkin mentioned the 70% but she also said there have been cases where there has been a redraft and obviously we hope for that.  Most of the other points have been covered so I am not going to stress them.</p> <p>  I have an observation on the back of a point Mr. Punch made.  It relates to what Deputy Nolan said about NGOs.  With Article 16 on access to justice we are creating the ultimate crank's charter and that is a real problem.  Deputy Nolan is right when she says that they have unbelievable funding from the State.  As Mr. Punch said, farming groups - not just us, but also community groups - are left bereft of funding.  I am conscious as well of the McKenna judgment in the High Court around the divorce referendum, which called for equality of funding.  We need to make two decisions.  This committee does not have the power, unfortunately.  We need to take away the funding from the NGOs, as suggested by Deputy Nolan, or we need to fund community groups and representative organisations equally.  We must have fairness and we are not getting it at the moment.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Deputy Harkin asked for our understanding of what is happening in this regard at EU level.  I understand it is due by the end of 2023.  It is going to follow a strategic process similar to the CAP strategic plans, namely, 24 months to form a plan, six months for observations by the Commission and then six months for Ireland to respond to any changes proposed at Commission level.  We understand that the European Parliament agriculture committee has been asked to provide an opinion on it, but the rapporteur on that committee has not yet been appointed.  There is obviously work to be done with Irish representation on that committee to ensure the voices from this room, the Oireachtas and other places are reflected in the contributions from that side of things.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard spoke about an economic assessment and an enhanced environmental assessment, which has been mentioned a number of times.  We have question marks over what exactly is going to be measured in an enhanced environmental assessment.  If there is no baseline for what the environmental footprint or outlook is on peatlands or organic soils now, what exactly is the baseline to be measured from?  What improvement is going to be measured over the course of this period of time?  Until an actual baseline is established, I am not sure what is being assessed.</p> <p>  On the question of an economic assessment, I return to some of the other points we made earlier.  Article 12 of the regulation speaks about the content of the national restoration plans.  There is an irony in here as well.  Article 12(2)(m) refers to an indication that the content of the national restoration plans must give "an indication of the subsidies which negatively affect the achievement of the targets and the fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation".  From our understanding, that puts all payments that support any kind of production on farms at risk.  Article 12(2)(n), irony of ironies, refers to "a summary of the process for preparing and establishing the national restoration plan, including information on public participation and of how the needs of local communities and stakeholders have been considered".  Up to now, there has not been much consideration or assessment of what is going to impact on our communities or on rural people.</p> <p>  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Danny Healy-Rae and others spoke about the need to ensure there are young people left in rural areas.  Many members of our organisation are from parts of the west of Ireland where other environmental measures have taken place, including large forestry plantations that are very important for the environment also.  We are talking about a doubling-up of the impact of these measures on such communities.  I cannot remember the last time a coniferous tree walked into a post office and posted a letter.  Flooding bogs in these areas is going to have a huge impact on the social fabric in these communities as well.  Our members in GAA clubs and many other clubs in these areas are finding it difficult to field teams at under-10, under-12 and under-14 levels.  This is the reality of what is happening in these communities.  As has been mentioned, measures like this will, at the stroke of a pen, impact on our rural communities.  If all of these measures as currently proposed are brought forward, it will be a case of the last person out turning off the lights.  Opportunities need to be created in the sector and not barriers.</p></speech>

I have a few comments of my own and then I will close this session.</p> <p>  I strongly advise against going down the compensation route.  This must be resisted.  The compensation route is definitely a port of last resort.  I have seen it before with designated land.  We were promised good schemes for that land when it was designated and the funding dried up very quickly.  As well as that, the capital value of the land has been completely destroyed.  It probably has less than 20% of the capital value of undesignated land.  It baffled me how it was allowed to happen at the time.</p> <p>  As a committee this is the second session we have had on this.  An awful lot of questions have been raised in this meeting.  We are all fairly ignorant of where this process is at and what we need to do to put the brakes on it and get a bit of common sense to prevail.  The secretariat here will take away from what we have heard at the last two sessions.  We will try to find out exactly where it is in the EU process, what exactly our Government's position is and where the decision-making is at as well.  There is an onus on us in the Government parties to ensure we get accurate information to this committee quickly.  As I said at the outset, we intend to devote a number of sessions to this.  These proposed regulations from Brussels could have huge implications not just for rural Ireland but for our whole economy and we as a committee intend to put a lot of effort into getting a defence of Ireland's position put in place to ensure common sense prevails.  We have seen it with the war in Ukraine and food security, and also with forestry security.  We had a forestry briefing this morning.  There is huge competition as it is for land for forestry.  If this goes ahead as proposed, we can forget about the forestry industry in this country.  It will be over.  That is leaving aside the arable land they will be trying to foreclose on.</p> <p>  Our guests will be in this room again discussing these proposals.  I thank them for their participation this evening.  It was a very worthwhile discussion and it has briefed us well on where the farming organisations are coming from.  I will now suspend the meeting to allow our guests to leave and then we will commence our second session.</p></speech>

There has been a change in Chair.  There is a vote in the D&aacute;il, so I am taking over for the time being.  We have representatives here from the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, IFA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA and Macra na Feirme.</p> <p>  Before we go any further, I must read a note privilege so the witnesses are aware of where they are legally regarding this.  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Since there are no witnesses outside the precinct, we will now move ahead.</p> <p>  We are resuming pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the veterinary medicinal products, medicated feed and fertilisers regulation Bill 2022.  Due to time constraints, submissions will be read by members.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We will go to members.  I will move swiftly to Senator Paul Daly.</p></speech>

Some of them have been here before and we have been dealing with this for the past two years.  The committee did a report on the veterinary medicinal product side.  The fertiliser regulations were added to the Bill and they are coming in together.  From the veterinary medicine side, we did a report previously and even had some of the witnesses in previously.</p> <p>  We heard recently from the merchants, such as the Independent Licenced Merchants Association, ILMA, the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, and the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU.  The veterinarians are in next week and we have heard from the Department.  Today, it is important for us to hear the farmer&rsquo;s advice in how both parts of this Bill will ultimately affect the farmers and what changes they would like see, if possible, within the Bill.  </p> <p>  I welcome all of the opening statements.  Like everyone else who has been here previously, ourselves included, there is nobody arguing about the need to deal with antimicrobial or antiparasitic resistance.  Everybody sees that and is well intentioned that this needs to be done.  It is about the &ldquo;how&rdquo; - the most effective way to do so - without jeopardising farmers&rsquo; incomes and livelihoods.  In particular, two issues seem to have come to the top of our agenda through our previous deliberations.  From the veterinary medicine side, the word we are getting loud and clear from other witnesses we have had in previous weeks is that antiparasitics becoming prescription-only medicines could well be the death knell for the merchants, in particular, and many of the co-ops.  Part of the ambition of the regulation would have been to enhance the availability of veterinary medicinal products, however, we are hearing it will actually have the opposite effect to that.  Already with the antibiotic side of things, the merchants and co-ops will say that the prescriptions are not filtering through to them.  We had people here who put on the record that their sales of intra-mammary are down 90% since they became prescription only.</p><p>It is important to hear the farmers' voice on that.  A number of issues have come up, the most pressing of which is still outstanding.  It relates to the fertiliser regulation part of the Bill.  I refer to the Border issue and how that may be handled.  The Border was also a strong player in our conversations on the veterinary medicines.  The Border issue is linked with the burden on the farmer.  We have heard the potential problems that could be faced by the pharmacists, the merchants, the co-ops, the vets and the Department officials.  We want to hear how this Bill, if it goes through in its current format, will affect the farmers.  What role have the representative bodies played to date?  Have they had much or any consultation with the Department on either of the two topics included in the Bill?  I think I have asked enough questions to keep the guests talking until the other members come back.</p></speech>

If you read through the fine print, you will see there is the potential for a farmer or a farm family to be fined up to &euro;100,000 for a breach of it.  That is a huge fine.  Obviously, I fully endorse the Senator's comments as regards antimicrobial resistance and the need to move it on.  We need to do this in a pragmatic way that will deliver for farm families and deliver opportunity.  There needs to be common sense in the legislation.  The prescription-only status of antiparasitics is a huge issue.  Quite rightly, the licensed merchants were predominantly involved in the co-op movement.  We know from discussions we have had with vets in various different parts of the country that they would be quite happy to see that arrangement stay in place, with the co-ops providing merchant credit, as it is termed.  It can be an issue for farmers at different times of the year if they put in a bunch a cattle and want to dose them and go through that routine.  It may be the date of slaughter before the cash flow would come.  Many of the vets' practices are family businesses.  They want to try to service their members' needs but at the same time they do not want to be carrying the can for the entire agricultural community within that.  As regards what improvements we would like to see, there are significant practical issues relating to the veterinarian being the only one to issue the product.  Such issues may arise in the spring if you arrive in the door of a large animal practice with two or three vets, and one of them is gone out doing a herd test and another is doing a Caesarean section.  They have responsible persons who have issued those products in the past.  We see no reason to change that.  We believe that was working well and there is absolutely no reason to change.  Geographical issues may arise if a co-op does not source a product going forward because there will be a huge issue with travel.  A farmer who lives beside the local co-op could be 30 km, 40 km or 50 km away from their local vet.  There are issues as regards location.  There are other issues regarding putting the sticker on the label.  Very often, the sticker that is put on covers the date or the withdrawal period.  This can be a huge issue.  I ask my colleague, Mr. Enright, to answer the Senator's question about the Border.</p></speech>

I am going to focus on something the Department has to give clarity on and deal with.  When we look at the fertiliser regulation Bill from a farmer's perspective, our concern is that we are almost at a stage where there is forensic checking of what farmers are doing on the nitrates side.  We have serious concerns about the direction that is being taken.  A farmer who makes a very minor mistake could be excluded from the derogation and suffer penalties under the nitrates directive.  We have made a number of very specific points in our submission.  Most significantly, we have asked why a farmer needs to apply to be part of the register.  All the talk about simplifying matters for farmers and giving them freedom to farm is the biggest joke of all time, to be quite honest.  It is getting more and more difficult as we move forward.  To give a simple example, why do I have to register to purchase fertiliser?  When changes were brought in regarding pesticides, I did not have to register for that.  I go into my co-op, give my herd number and get the pesticides required for my farm or whatever I need.  We have made some specific points on that.  Our big concern from the point of view of the register is around the sanctions to be placed on farmers who make minor errors.  It is very easy to make a minor error in relation to fertiliser usage.  If a farmer spreads an extra 10 kg of nitrogen in a year, as per the register, what are the sanctions going to be?  There is huge frustration about issues like that.  We heard earlier about the nature registration law.  There is huge frustration about the raft of regulations being introduced.  I will not go through the specifics of this matter because it is very detailed but if we are to make it as simple as possible for farmers, we have to address those issues.  As I see it, we are setting up a structure that is quite complex.  My real concern is that it will get more complex over time as we move forward.  We need to get clarity and keep it simple for farmers.  There should not be a need or a requirement to apply to be registered.  The Department has all the details of every farmer - his name, address, herd number, cattle details and land details.  Why in the name of God do we have to go and apply for this again?  We need to keep it simpler.  I will not go into the detail of the specific points we made in our submission at this time.</p></speech>

Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#P00400"><p>As an organisation, the IFA is very much in favour of a targeted approach towards the reduction of use of antiparasitics in our farms.  It is in our long-term interests as farmers and as in the interests of society as a whole.  Certainly, we have played a leading role in that.  It is critical in all this debate that this is to the forefront.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that there are some key issues, and they have been touched on by Mr. Enright and Mr. McCormack.  The reality is that this proposal will have a severe impact on competition within the system.  Effectively, we are going to be at the behest of one supplier.  Regardless of the goodwill or otherwise of those suppliers, inevitably they have a monopoly and farmers will ultimately be the ones to lose out.  We will also lose huge economic activity in the broader range of the sector in Ireland.  There has been a growing tendency for corporates to take over veterinary practices around this country.  In many cases, the prices are built on the goodwill of farmers.  In effect, we now have a situation where outside bodies are looking at changing regulations and inflating valuations to be seen to benefit groups that are outside the agri-sector, for all we know.  This is a huge concern in terms of the competition for these products for farmers in the future.</p> <p>  The two-tier supply system on the island of Ireland is an absolutely critical issue and cannot be overlooked.  As somebody who has been the victim of fake and incorrect labelling on imported products, I believe this is an area of huge concern.  It undermines the national effort not only to have a targeted and one-island approach to food production in Ireland and to medicine usage reduction across our State, but also to ensure we can stand over the quality of all our products.  It is our clear view that prescription by qualified persons can be facilitated in the existing regulations.  This would align both jurisdictions, in effect, and allow us to move forward with the one-island approach.  That is absolutely crucial.</p> <p>  Outside of those issues, there are other issues within the Bill that are particularly significant for us.  In terms of the national database in particular, farmers have real concerns that individual farmer data will be accessed and stored in a format that is currently not available.  At this point in time,  the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine cannot use the data to flag herds for inspection but will they be able to hold this position in the future?  We will be in a situation where farmers are being held accountable for the faults and failings of those who are prescribing.  The reality in Ireland today is that farmers cannot access antibiotics unless they are prescribed to them by a third party who is suitably qualified and recognised by the Department.  In this situation we have to ensure individual farmers' data are not going to be used against them.</p><p>In addition, we will have the development of a huge database under the national veterinary prescription system that could be sought for use by outside bodies for the surveillance of agriculture and our farms.  The control and management of this database is a whole new area about which we are extremely concerned.  In particular, when we look at the monopolies that exist outside our farm gates for the purchase of our products, it is very concerning for us.</p><p> Another issue with the Bill that is particularly pertinent is the whole enforcement issue.  It is not appropriate that the legislation would provide a right of entry onto farmlands or farmers' premises without notification or warrant.  It is certainly not something we envisage should be allowed as we move forward.  The reality is that farms are also family homes.  This approach cannot be accepted and must be deleted from the Bill for best use.</p><p> The other issue that is particularly important is that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility to ensure compliance of prescribers and suppliers.  It must ensure this Bill does not turn things on their head and lead to a situation whereby farmers are the ones taking the blame and responsibility for future inaccurate behaviour by the prescribers.  We are very concerned about that for the future.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Potterton, to discuss the fertiliser issue.</p></speech>

An exact definition of the terms &quot;fertiliser product&quot; and &quot;fertiliser manufacturing&quot; should be included in the Bill.  The IFA does not consider it fair and reasonable to treat farmers as fertiliser importers if they buy or purchase fertiliser in Northern Ireland.  We would like clarification as to whether, if farmers purchase fertilisers in Northern Ireland, they will be classified as fertiliser economic operators and professional end users at the same time.  There must be flexibility for fertiliser economic operators, as they are referred to in the Bill, to use the fertiliser database to sell and transfer into the Republic of Ireland.  There are several references in the scheme of the Bill to fines and sanctions in the event of fertiliser economic operators failing to meet their obligations.  If they so fail, our view is that farmers must not be held accountable.<br/><br/>The requirement for the submission of fertiliser product details and quantities owned or held on a premises, either at regular intervals or even in real time, has the potential to become very onerous and overly demanding for farmers.  The IFA has concerns about farmers who may not be technologically literate or good with IT.  Many farmers already employ agents and consultants to fill out applications for payments and schemes on <i>agfood.ie</i>and this will likely extend to the fertiliser database as well.  It will increase administrative costs with little or no direct economic return for farmers.  The statistical returns into the database should be kept to a minimum and should take place within the closed spreading period and away from any major farm payment scheme deadlines.  Further clarifications are needed on what additional details may be required at a future time for submission to the database by professional fertiliser users.<br/><br/>Moving to the processing of information, it is clearly stated that the use of information compiled in the database is to inform policy and control programmes and reduce inorganic fertiliser use.  The IFA is concerned that 2023 will be used as a baseline or reference year to inform this decision-making.  The unprecedented increase in fertiliser prices and widespread predictions of more restricted use and availability in 2023 must be taken into account by the Minister and his officials.<br/><br/>There must be clarification regarding the anonymised data that could be submitted to third parties from the database.<br/><br/>My final point relates to the serving of notifications and notice periods.  Should an inspection of a premises be required in respect of fertiliser, sufficient notice must be provided by officials and entry must be strictly by arrangement only.</p></speech>

He asked what role farm organisations have been playing in regard to regulation.  Since 2015, the IFA has identified the key areas of concern with the regulations as being categorisation, supply routes, the prescribing process and access to antibiotics.  We have continually raised those concerns with the Minister, MEPs and senior Department officials, yet we are still here having to deal with them in this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#Q00500"><p>I will try to address some of the issues that were raised.  Regarding the scope of the Bill and its provisions on veterinary medicines, the number one issue we see concerns the implications around the data that are created, who has access to them and for what purposes.  There is reference in the scheme of the Bill to access to the database being given to "such other persons specified by the Minister".  As we are aware from the conversation we have had since 5.30 p.m., there is a concern this may include various interest groups with non-relevant knowledge of the sector.  The information and data contained within the database could be used against farmers in respect of what they have been doing with veterinary prescriptions and veterinary medicines.</p> <p>  There is an omission in the scheme of the Bill.  It mentions sharing data with the likes of Bord Bia for the purposes of inspections relating to that body's quality assurance schemes.  However, no consideration is given as to what the implications or consequences might be for failure to comply.  Is it Bord Bia that will enforce those requirements or will they be enforced through the regulation itself?  There are similar concerns regarding the effort to move the sector forward in terms of improving the overall health of our herd, which Macra na Feirme has supported for many years and continues to support in the context of this Bill, in order to reduce our dependence on, and usage of, certain medicines.  However, there is no mention within the scheme of sharing relevant information with our national health bodies, whether that be the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, which is developing genetic testing to improve the genetics of the herd, which is a measurable trait genetically verified within our economic breeding index, EBI, and also within the indexes of beef, or the Animal Health Ireland programme, which is charged with reducing the incidence and occurrence of disease within animals.  There is an omission in terms of requirements for sharing these types of data.</p> <p>  The second point raised was around market competition.  There is concern about the burden that is being placed on veterinary practitioners.  A lot of practices around the country are quite small, particularly in rural areas.  Many of our members have noted that veterinary practitioners in some areas now have limited staff who work only certain hours.  We all recognise, however, that farming operates on a 24-hour basis.  The increased burden that is going to come on those practices in regard to labelling, premises-keeping and record-keeping will be a significant additional time requirement.  The overall context to keep in mind when we speak about vets and the supply of large-animal vets into the sector is that there are about 75 vets trained in Ireland annually in the one veterinary medical school we have in the country.  We must bear in mind the age profile of the vets we currently have.  The number who are leaving the sector due to retirement or because they are entering into small-animal practices for various reasons is in the region of 250 to 300.  At the moment, we are exporting people and then importing back the education they have received abroad for four to five years.  There is significant work to do in that regard, similar to the generation renewal point we have made many time in respect of farms.  There is a significant issue that must be addressed in terms of providing places for veterinary practitioners in more than one veterinary college in the country.</p> <p>  The issue of parasite control was raised and the question of the duration of prescriptions for parasites and also for antibiotics.  There is ambiguity as to what should happen in the case of an outbreak of a disease such as cryptosporidiosis, for example, in a dairy or beef herd in springtime.  When there is such an outbreak, as we know, all the animals within the group must be treated, whether or not they are showing symptoms, because the likelihood is they are all going to be infected.</p><p>What would be the application of this proposed Bill regarding the outbreak of a disease like that in a group of animals where the likelihood is that they would all become infected over time?  That is the example relating to cryptosporidiosis.</p><p> In terms of the general scheme, it is noted that everybody taking part in 2023 must voluntarily register.  A number of users of fertilisers are not herd owners, herd keepers or landowners.  They include parks and GAA facilities.  What is the proposition for dealing with those small-scale users?  We have exemptions for small-scale users of pesticides and herbicides.  What is the proposal here in terms of the proposed Bill?</p><p> In terms of the fertiliser Bill being used as a baseline to monitor sales and potentially reduce fertiliser usage over time, we are in a period of high input prices and high fertiliser prices.  This year is an example.  I hear many stakeholders and many people working in the sector championing this year as being a year in which fertiliser sales will reduce.  We obviously support the reliance on that but looking at PastureBase Ireland figures, the average tonnage and across hectares on farms on PastureBase is down between 1.5 tonnes and 1.7 tonnes, which, depending on the farm in which you are operating, is a 12% to 18% reduction of annual tonnage grown.  If you are at optimisation of that, that is a 12% to 18% reduction of your livestock on that farm.  </p><p> In terms of enforcement and creating baselines, it is important to recognise where we have been historically in the context of the baseline established under existing Acts with regard to environmental assessments.  Other environmental targets are set on the baseline of 2018.</p></speech>

I will start at the Border.  I live only five minutes from the Border, so I know a lot about that end of things.  It is just as unrealistic to think that we can have one law on one side of the Border where they can trade with freedom in whatever warehouse, store or merchant's they choose with no problems, while there are restrictions on the other side of the Border a few miles up the road and it can only be done through vets.  This is discrimination against the trade.  Take a responsible person such a pharmacist.  These people have put in years in training and education to get this far.  People put time and money towards this and suddenly it takes a note to destroy their livelihood.  This happened with special needs assistants.  I do not think there were too many pupils in the school the next day and there was a bit of standstill in the country.  We are being treated as the quiet people and it will have to be pushed on us.  Farmers are going to suffer as a result of this.  The Border is a major issue.  We have a problem with cross-Border trading.  The biggest issues here is the availability, competition and price, the number of people it will take out of the areas.  Communities are dying because people have to travel miles.  As Mr. McCormack mentioned, a vet is unavailable when you get there.  You might have a bit of help the day you want to do something.  That is where the problem lies.  Licensed merchants, pharmacists and relevant people in the business are vital parts of it for us as farmers and they must be retained.  Otherwise we will end up with animal welfare problems and they will not come from overdosing; rather, they will come from under-dosing.</p> <p>  The studies we brought to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, were based on a small number of farms.  If it wants to do something practical or relevant and maybe go forward with this, for example, dung sampling, that can be done to get a feel for what is happening nationally and not just on a couple of farms.  We know how relevant this is and that it is not an issue in many cases.  This is a significant thing to go forward.</p> <p>  This proposal has been in front of us for the past number of years.  We have met the Department on different occasions.  We get so far and then it stops.  It is pushed back.  Within the past month or two before the new reset date, we will be called again to a meeting.  This is not working.  Stakeholders are not being treated properly.  It is time for the Department to make the decision to continue as we are under what is proposed, go forward and retain the ability of licensed merchants and pharmacists to prescribe and dispense drugs and dosing remedies to us because that is the only we can move forward with this.  That has always been the ICSA position on this.  We are talking about rural Ireland and a lot of small farmers.  It is alright for the big farmers and possibly the multiples but when you are talking about 20 or 30 farms to make up the numbers, we must consider that.  We are going to look at areas being locked out.  This is of no benefit to any of us so we must move forward on that end of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Punch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#R00300"><p>We have concerns about the database in terms of veterinary medicines.  The general scheme lists a range of different bodies that may have access to it, including Bord Bia.  Not every farmer is a member of a quality assurance scheme.  The Data Protection Commissioner should be asked for a view about whether it is appropriate that there can be such access to this database.  We are creating a fertiliser register as well.  Equally, we must be careful that care is taken and that there is no access to this information for anybody who should not have it.</p> <p>  Under Part 3 of the general scheme, which concerns enforcement, quite draconian powers are given to Department officials to enter premises and so on.  We have a major concern about that because the sad fact is that there have been horror stories in the past with family homes being entered.  We must be very careful that enforcement is proportionate to the risk.</p> <p>  The key point is that we want competition.  The Department has been trying to say that veterinary practices can issue prescriptions and other outlets can supply or dispense but we still do not have a real working model regarding how that would work in practice.  That is the issue.  Reference is made to the human medicines scenario.  I do not think it is exactly comparable.  Ivermectin is a key example.  Because there is such competition, that product has become relatively inexpensive.  We know that many years ago, Irish farmers were paying a multiple of what farmers in other jurisdictions were paying for this.  Competition has been key in bringing the prices down.  However, there is not just competition between the retail outlets, vets, licensed merchants and co-operatives.  There is competition between suppliers of the product.  We would be concerned that this could be decimated.  If you go to a veterinary practice, a cheap ivermectin from one company is available.  If you go to a co-operative, a couple of other companies are supplying another type of ivermectin product, so we have competition not just between the retailers but also between the suppliers.</p><p>If we disrupt that model, we potentially take a lot of those other suppliers out of the market because the veterinary practice only deals with one particular pharma company.  That is a key issue.</p></speech>

In the line of competition, did any of the organisations write to the competition authority about the way they are promoting it at the moment.  What is the witnesses' view?  Every one of them has interaction with the Department.  What is their read on it?  We understood it was progressing well until probably a week ago.  We heard there was legal opinion there for them.  We heard it was there for a week and then we heard it was there for four or five weeks, even though we were told in here it was a week.  We heard the brakes were put on internally in the Department by a few.  Is that what the witnesses read into it?   We have made our views clear.  Where do the witnesses see this going as representatives of farming organisations?</p> <p>  On fertiliser, the witnesses have touched on the northern side of it.</p> <p>  Going back to the animal medicines, we would be for the trained person still being able to do it, simple as that.  A few of us encountered a thing you can get on your phone.  VetPal was the name of it, was it Chairman?</p></speech>

Did any of the witnesses come across that yet?  I do not know where the veterinary bodies are on that.  They might or might not like it.  We will hear that next week.  The Department is not doing a lot about it yet.  These are things that could help resolve issues.  Did the witnesses hear anything on that?</p> <p>  The witnesses talked about next year being a reference year on fertilisers.  Is that what they are getting from the Department?  Will fertiliser be gettable next year?  That is the first thing, before we do a reference on anything.  What are their views from talking to different bodies about that?  Are they for a fertiliser register or opposed to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. T.J. Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#S00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  As we have outlined, the whole area of the cross-Border two-phase implementation of this process undermines, as we see it, the ability of the country to proceed with an all-island approach to reduction of antiparasitic and antibiotic usage and undermines the whole food island concept.  It will be crucial, through the combination of the Northern Ireland protocol, that we operate in one system to ensure we do not have a Border.  Let us be honest about it: there will not be a Border.  Deputy Carthy has plenty of cousins in the North of Ireland, the same as every person along the Border, who will have the opportunity to purchase products at a different rate.  It will totally undermine the position of the farmer in this country.  It cannot be allowed to proceed without uniformity across the State.</p> <p>  The national veterinary prescription system, NVPS, is a critical piece of national legislation that we need to implement to comply with animal health law in Europe.  We need that recording capacity to protect us as farmers and highlight the fact that Ireland has low antibiotic usage on farms and monitors and records reduction in our anti-emetic use going forward.  At the moment we are exposed without that because we do not have clear trade patterns to identify opportunities to promote our country as a low-usage antibiotic system.  The weakness we have is that we are eight weeks from its supposed relaunch and have not been presented with the updated system that was shelved for six months to allow further clarification of the system and allow it to work on farms.</p> <p>  The key issue for us is that the farmer should have the right to take a prescription and fill it where he wishes and to ensure that, where there are multiple prescriptions, the supplier of any of those pieces of medicine can only have visibility of that prescription, not of all his prescription, because that weakens his position in the supply chain.  If, for the sake of argument, I want to buy my antiemetics from my local co-op, naturally I have to buy my antibiotics from my vet and want to get my vaccinations from another outlet, I have to be in a position to separate those out and trade as I normally have done, while retaining the advantage of recording those.  This will be a critical piece of infrastructure for us but it has to operate in a manner which retains competition in the system and protects the right of the farmer to choose his supplier.  </p> <p>  Another issue in terms of that data which has been highlighted on numerous occasions is that as farmers we are becoming very aware that we are the source of valuable data.  Our food is essentially feeding many parts of the world.  The control and management of that to respect the rights and production of the farmer is crucial to ensure we can control that in future.  </p> <p>  On the vacuum in terms of legal opinion which the Deputy has indicated may or may not be there, we are running to a cliff edge.  To be fair to the suppliers in the market, other than the vets at this stage, they are running into a situation where they have to ask whether they stock or not.  It is completely unfair for those businesses to be operating in those circumstances.  We believe that a trained, qualified person, as indicated by the HPRA report, requires a multifaceted approach and multi-supplier level to deal with the issue going forward.  </p></speech>

While it has not been explicitly stated by the Department, in the draft Bill it clearly says it is to inform policy and achieve a reduction in organic fertiliser.  There would have to be concerns about how much the reduction would be.  The database creates a valuable well of information in that regard.</p> <p>  In respect of fertiliser availability, it will be challenged but it likely will be available.  The slight decline in gas prices this week across Europe gives a little bit more hope about European manufacturing of fertiliser, which has been heavily hit in recent weeks.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#S00700"><p>The Deputy spoke about the legal opinion.  The timing of his information or ripple-effect information is similar to ours.  The cross-Border is an issue.  If you turn right going out the gate and arrive into freedom to trade or turn left into complex issues, that would have to be addressed.  In the past, brucellosis was a hugely challenging issue in this country and it took an all-island approach.  From a BVD-eradication perspective, it will be something similar.  As Mr. Maher alluded to, our product is sold around the globe in significant proportions and we need to be in a position to stand over what we have and do.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned the trained persons.  In response to Senator Paul Daly's question, I said it is imperative that the trained responsible operators and veterinary practitioners are in a position to dispense drugs.  For example, at the busy time of the year, if there is a Caesarian, a herd test and two veterinaries out on call, it may not be feasible for the farmer to come back in four or five hours.  As we move forward, therefore, that is imperative.</p><p> The Deputy referred to the availability of fertiliser.  Industry sources indicated to us with some confidence that it will be available up to and including the spreading of first-round silage.  In 2022, we saw panic and inflation set in and we saw where the profits went.  There was a threefold profit increase along the supply chain, which was hugely frustrating given that farmers were paying at an all-time high.  That is the last thing we want as we head into 2023.</p><p> The Deputy asked a question about 2023 becoming a reference year.  The indications to me, as someone who is involved in the Food Vision 2030 dairy group and the beef and lamb group, is that all the talk is about using 2018 at a national level.  I suspect there will not be a reference year for individuals but that it will be linked to the available area of land and stocking density as we move forward.  I fear that, yet again, we will see an imposition on farmers of the requirement for a fertiliser plan, which would cost them significant sums irrespective of their scale.  I issue that word of caution to Deputy Fitzmaurice to be vigilant for that.  I do not see 2023 being the reference year.  I see 2018 being the year in overall use.  It will depend on terms and conditions after that and farming intensity and level.</p></speech>

We had discussions with the committee some weeks ago on the new nitrates action programme and the nitrates derogation.  There are legal limits on the amount of nitrogen we can use on our farms.  A fertiliser register is just another piece of red tape and bureaucracy for farmers and another hurdle I will have to jump as a farmer.  It is a significant concern for farmers from the point of view of penalties, sanctions, etc., and another headache.</p> <p>  From our perspective, we have legal requirements.  The vast majority of farmers are meeting those requirements but, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Department have said it is a necessary requirement.  It is a bit like the nature restoration law.  It is another issue and another cost and headache for farmers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#T00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for the questions, many of which have been covered.  I will not restate some of the points that have been made.  On the cross-Border question, this is a major issue in regard to the operating of the market on both sides of the Border to undermine the system of trade that operates on the island.  It will be a significant issue, not only for farmers and those operating in the Border counties.  It will also have wider implications for costs and trade within the island.  It is mentioned in the Bill that fertiliser is recorded at the point of dispatch but there is nothing to say, in terms of measuring that, when it comes across the Border into a farmer's yard.</p> <p>  In terms of enforcement, a farmer may be using the market tools at his or her disposal to get the product at the cheapest price possible.  At the point of inspection halfway through the year or in a spot inspection later on in the year, the farmer, who has access to the market on a cross-Border basis, may not have registration documentation for some of the fertiliser used.  Where would that leave the farmer in the context of meeting the requirements of the inspection and also the enforcement?  With the stricter rules under the nitrates derogation, that also raises the question as to whether farmers who may be involved would essentially lose their derogation given how strict this is.</p> <p>  On medicines, we have received opinions and information similar to the Deputy received in relation to the legal opinion the Department has obtained.  We are unsure, obviously, what is contained in that but we recognise that the brakes have definitely been put on the development implication and the procedure that was highlighted to us earlier in the summer as to the steps that would be conducted before 1 January.  At this stage, a database must be established that is capable of registering this information.  Similarly, suppliers in the market must, as has been highlighted, have product on the shelf for farmers as well.</p> <p>  We are aware of the development of the app the Deputy spoke about.  We are aware of similar apps that have evolved and been implemented in other markets across the EU and have worked effectively.  There is, however, a role for the Department in terms of certification and validation of any and every form of app that would be used with regard to prescriptions, etc.  We are unsure as to the timeframe in which something like that may become effective or deliver for farmers.  We would welcome any opportunity for that to be developed if it makes the administrative burden on farmers any easier.</p> <p>  On the availability of fertiliser for next year, what we have heard is similar to what Mr. McCormack described.  We have significant concerns about the availability of phosphorus, P, and potassium, K, fertiliser.  The breakdown in terms of the fertiliser make-up could have on-farm implications as well for farmers who are operating within derogation but also outside of derogation, given that some straights may not be available.  Obviously, farmers using more compound fertilisers will reach their ceilings much quicker than they would if they were using straight fertilisers.  That must be taken into consideration in the context of the derogation as well.</p> <p>  The progress we should be trying to make on antimicrobial resistance, etc., will depend on the capability of our analysis to keep up with the demand farmers may have for identification, whether of antimicrobials or any disease risk that might come on farm.  We will need significant laboratory analysis to identify the issues.  We have seen a lack of investment and the attitude of the Department has been to significantly under-resource that sector in terms of forage and laboratory analysis.  We have been looking for increased funding for forage and laboratory analysis for farmers to drive demand for six or seven years, during which there has not been any increased support from the Department.  That support will be needed if farmers are required to test for worm or egg burdens for parasites for anthelmics.  Investment will be needed to support the roll-out of any such measures as well.</p></speech>

We are hearing that fertiliser will be available and there are stocks due to underselling this year with the way the pricing was.  It is affordability we should be looking at for some farmers, especially in the beef and the suckler end.  That is a big issue.</p> <p>  The amount spread has already slowed production in the past year.  Recording it is a mystery exercise, as far as we are concerned.  We need to be reducing bureaucracy and paperwork rather than creating them.</p> <p>  As far as medicine is concerned, we have no more information than the other speakers and members, which is disappointing.  We should have been meeting on a more regular basis to be updated on these issues but we were not given the opportunity.  It is just presumed a decision will be made and we will be told this is it and be expected to row in.  That will not happen and has not happened.  The ICSA and all farmers stand firm in that belief.</p> <p>  We must look at this in another way.  If the right decisions had been made some years ago and derogation had to be applied for, we would not be in this position.  That is the problem with us.  Northern Ireland, which is only across the road from me, has a derogation and farmers there can work away.  There has been a failure by the Department to seek a derogation.  We saw it with harvesting the bogs.  Nobody is taking responsibility for that and nobody else is being penalised on those grounds but it is coming back to penalise farmers.</p><p>We need to look at that one.  We want the Department to come forward.  It is down to a small number holding it back at this stage.  It cannot hold everyone to ransom.  We have been fair at all times and co-operated through all discussions and meetings to bring it forward.  Our industry needs to be looked after.  We also need to look after the suppliers of our product because they are part of it.  There are available dates, as I said earlier.</p></speech>

In respect of the fertiliser regulation, we have had the interactions previously.  While I cannot speak for everyone, the view of this committee is that while the principle of the regulation is good, it is unworkable because of the Border.  The witnesses have outlined the challenges that that will present, as Mr. Farrell will know well, in the Border region where in many instances a farmer's closest merchant may be on the opposite side of the Border.  That applies equally to people on both sides.  There are potential implications for a farmer who does not know the detail of the regulation and happens to buy a trailer-load of fertiliser in one place without realising that that places an obligation on them.  I believe that is unworkable.  We will convey that message.  Do the witnesses have other concerns with the regulation outside that?</p> <p>  Without going into all the difficulties, we have had much discussion on the implications for the licensed merchant sector and the co-ops in respect of the veterinary medical aspect of the legislation.  Have the members of the organisations represented here relayed their concerns?  They have a particular interest in their own livelihoods and futures.  Up to now the responsible person and not just the vets themselves had the opportunity to dispense.  Is that important to the members of the organisations represented here?</p> <p>  I ask for more detail on the data protection concerns, particularly the sharing of data with Bord Bia and the quality assurance audits.  We may need to engage with Bord Bia to try to get clarification.</p></speech>

Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#U00300"><p>I will take the medicine questions.  Our members are extremely concerned because they do not want to buy more antiparasitics.  As I said at the start, the crucial factor for us is to be able to access them at the right time, in the right amount, at the right price.  That is the key issue.  If three suppliers are removed from the network leaving only one, ultimately our farmers are aware that they will be at the bottom of the food chain and totally exposed.  That is a key concern that cannot be ignored.  There is absolute evidence that this will certainly place us in a weaker position in the purchase of antibiotics.</p> <p>  As outlined previously, only a limited number of suppliers operate in the country.  Ultimately, we are concentrating the power in a smaller number of bodies supplying a smaller number of suppliers back to us.  Ultimately, farmers will be the losers because we will have to pay for it.  While the Department's efforts to have a broader approach to dealing with this might be well meaning, changing the address of where one buys the antiemetic does nothing for the reduction and more accurate use of these antiemetics and antiparasitics.  As we have continually stressed, modern technology and science is moving quickly.  Multiple companies are now supplying quick-test faecal egg worm-counter machines that can provide results in ten to 15 minutes for suitably qualified persons to read them.</p> <p>  We appreciate that all bodies will need to step up to the plate.  Money will need to be spent to ensure proper service is provided to ensure a better and more accurate use of the products we have so that we can retain them and ensure they remain effective.  It is in our interest not to overuse but to use properly.  Everybody accepts that we are moving to new world and things cannot operate as they operated in the past.  Things will need to be done differently because we now have greater controls on us and we will need to be seen to be doing the right thing.  That is absolutely in farmers' interests.  We are clear that a practical solution recognising the professionalism of all parties, farmers, vets, licensed merchants and pharmacies, can be worked out on this.  However, there needs to be respect for all people involved.</p></speech>

In respect of purchasing fertiliser in the North, there is an onus on the Department to make farmers aware of the regulatory obligations they may have to declare this.  We have concerns about older farmers needing to do more administrative work online.  While it has largely gone this way with farm scheme payments, this is another thing with no direct economic benefit.  It is another thing for agents to comply with.  It also puts further pressure on consultants and agents.</p></speech>

Effectively reducing the competition will put the viability of licensed merchants and veterinary pharmacies at risk, which will ultimately reduce the choice farmers have when purchasing these products.  Farmers are the end users of these products and if the choice is not there the competition is severely affected.</p> <p>  On the NVPS and the data concerned, the Deputy specifically mentioned Bord Bia, but I wish to come in on some of the other points.  Given the potential for the Department to have access to all this information, it could be used to flag herds for inspection, which would be a major concern.  Data could also be requested by, for example, milk processors or meat processors.  It could be used to categorise herds and, ultimately, devalue the products that farmers are supplying.  That is obviously a massive concern for farmers and should not be disregarded when considering the sharing of data as proposed in the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#U00600"><p>The Deputy asked about our members.  Other stakeholders who appeared before the committee said it could be a loss of earnings for them.  In many cases, the other stakeholders are either co-ops or pharmacies.  Not near as much is going through the pharmacy as was the case.  Given the age profile of farmers with more over 75 than under 35, some of them would be calling to the pharmacy anyway.</p><p>There is a convenience element to it.  That is just one point.</p><p> I pointed out earlier in response to Senator Paul Daly that the majority of farmers are shareholders in co-ops.  They run accounts in them.  Vets, in many cases, are family-run operations.  It is very hard for them to provide the level of credit that may be required if someone is putting in a shed of cattle, dosing them and feeding them to finish.  There is a better chance of getting that credit from the co-op.  That also creates competition.  One of the witnesses behind me alluded to this, and maybe it was meant with no offence.  He said that from now on this will deliver and we will have to do what we should be doing.  It is my belief that since 2012, and the introduction of the dairy audits and the beef audits before that year, we have had great traceability from an animal medicines perspective.  When the audit in its entirety is put together, and fertiliser usage and so on is put in place, we have a unique selling point, which is used by Ornua and Bord Bia.  That must be built upon but it should be done in a practical way that is not going to eliminate or reduce the result for the farmer.</p><p> Regarding the audits, it was said that the information would be available to Bord Bia.  If an audit and inspection is done of my farm every 18 months, that is my information and it should require my permission to use those data going forward.  That is critical.</p><p> On fertiliser, our herd numbers are linked to the animal identification and movement, AIM, system and the single farm payment.  That should be the level of bureaucracy required to purchase fertiliser, rather than this notion of having to register as a purchaser and a user and all that.  All that should be required is the herd number, which is linked to the stock and the area farmed.  It should be made straightforward to reduce the complexity.  In the earlier session I talked about the mental health of farmers.  This is not going to do anything to improve that survey result.</p></speech>

It would be ridiculous.  Our understanding is that the Department already has all the information it requires about farmers.  Why require them to apply to the register?  We are really complicating things here and creating more headaches for farmers.  The sanctions must be clarified as well.</p></speech>

The number one issue that has come back from our members is market competition, as Mr. Maher touched on.  The number of suppliers within the market may become diminished as a result of this.  Mr. McCormack touched on the local merchant, which is convenient, as well as the ability to avail of credit.  There are certain times of year when there is a strong demand for supports for animal health measures on farms, which do not necessarily coincide with times of year when cash flow is strong.  The availability of additional credit through a merchant is something a lot of farmers welcome.</p> <p>  The other aspect that has been raised is data sharing.  The ownership of those data and the freedom the Minister has to administer the database and share it with whoever he or she sees fit to share it with is a major obstacle for our members moving forward, given the interested parties that may require or request access to the data.  Some of that has been touched on as well.</p> <p>  Another issue is access to antibiotics in a timely manner.  Farmers will know that access to intervention in case of disease is one of the most important things in determining the outcome of the disease.  Timely access to medication is important.  We understand that prescription medicines and antibiotics have a five-day period in which the prescription falls due.  Let us take, for example, a cow that comes in with mastitis on a Sunday morning and the farmer is without a prescription.  I am not sure how many vets would thank the few hundred farmers, or even a few thousand, who would be ringing them every Sunday morning looking for a prescription for mastitis tubes.  There must be some workaround to facilitate that within the Bill.  A point was made before about the timeframe within which this is going to be implemented.  Farmers have little understanding about what direct implication this is going to have and little knowledge is being shared with them on it.</p></speech>

As I said, some people are not members of Bord Bia schemes so why should their information not be protected?  It has been custom and practice that quality assurance inspectors have had access to this information from veterinary practices but it is timely, when looking at a new Bill, to question whether that is, in fact, compatible with data protection regulations.  Aside from that, when creating a new database we should question whether it can be used for purposes for which it was not originally intended.  It was mentioned with regard to flagging herds for inspections.  There is a whole area here where it has been assumed the Department has power to use and take advantage of data and information that have been collected.  I am not sure it would stand up to scrutiny in other sectors.  I might be wrong but, on the other hand, if we are talking about a new Bill, we should have a bit of clarity around this.  Farmers at some levels are concerned about access to product.  There is some awareness of it with fertiliser but there are equally a lot of farmers who are not aware that they are expected to have the information about what fertiliser stocks they have on hand on 1 January, or about the requirement to tell the Department what they have left over at the end of this year.  There is a job to be done there in informing people.</p></speech>

I compliment the five farming organisations.  This is our third session examining this issue.  Nearly everything has been said and today has been positive.  The information we have been given is practical and also gives an indication of where we need to go in making sure this Bill is workable.  The terminology used by the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Helen Dixon, and the role she might play, is something that is new to the debate, without a shadow of a doubt.  That is something this committee will probably go back and look at on some level.  There are data here.  The Data Protection Commissioner has exceptional powers, is well able and does exceptional work.  We should ask her view on the Bill.  The level of information required in the Bill and where the information goes is something that is new to the table.  That is an issue we will take on board, given what we have seen here.</p> <p>  We should also engage with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to make sure there is competition in the marketplace.  We have previously seen issues with veterinary practices that were going to be moved on, particularly in the UK, but the competition commission stepped in in the past few months to make sure there is competition in the market.  Competition is an important part of what this is about.  We need to make sure we have competition not alone at the primary level but also at wholesale level, so farmers can have the opportunity to purchase appropriate products.</p> <p>  The timelines are also a huge issue, not just for the farming community but also for the advising community that is involved here.  There is a significant body of work in making sure all the farming community are tied into this scheme in an appropriate timeline.  I am genuinely concerned about whether that will be appropriate.  All the questions have probably been well answered so I will pass on to other members.  After three and a half hours, we have some good information but we probably need to go back and look at how we are going to move it forward.  The data question in particular is one that has to be answered.  It is up to this committee how we will move that forward.</p></speech>

Many farmers in my area are seriously concerned because they need fertiliser to maintain the level of stocking they have today.  Without it, there will be a reduction in their herds.  It again looks like we are going backwards.  We will be in the same situation we were in during the early 1970s, when everyone knew how many cows the grass in different areas could sustain.  One person's grass might be enough for seven cows while another person with a great farm could provide for 17.  We are going backwards.  Farmers did what An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na Talmha&iacute;ochta, ACOT, and other farming agencies told them to in the 1970s and increased their stocking rates.  That is what they are trying to live with now.  Many of them would not be in existence now if it was not for fertiliser.</p> <p>  I have a question on the fertiliser register.  Where was discussion held on it?  Were farming organisations or farmers told why this was going ahead?  It is clear that it is not for the fun of it.  There will be an account of what fertiliser farmers get and what use they are going to make of it.  It looks like it is for the purpose of getting herd numbers down and stopping whatever.  We all know that you can sometimes put out fertiliser only for it not to work.  It may snow or freeze or something else might happen.  You may use a lot more fertiliser in one year than in another.  I am very concerned about this aspect.  I have asked many farmers in my area what this will mean to them and how much fertiliser they will be able to buy.  No farmer knows because they have not been told.  It is not fair on farmers that there has not been some discussion about it.  I cannot understand how this can be introduced in January when nobody knows what they can buy, or if they can get any at all.  We were listening to the farming organisations all along.  The organisations are saying that we will get it up to the middle of the year, and I hope we will, but it is clear that this register is being formulated to block us in some way.  It is not for the fun of it that it is being brought in but to nail us.  </p> <p>  I am very concerned about that because farmers did what they were told all along.  They made their farms more productive and increased the size of their herds.  In 2012 or 2014 the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and told us to produce more milk.  It was the new white gold.  Now, the Government is doing its level best every day to curtail, stop and nail us in every way it can.  What is the need for this register?  Who agreed to it?  Do the witnesses believe it is fair on the farmers in light of the things I have said?  You could use way more fertiliser in a given month of one year than you did the previous year.  I heard the witnesses saying that 2018 might be used as the base year.  We do not know that.  The Government will use whatever year suits its story the best.  I am very concerned about this.</p></speech>

I thank them for their input on this Bill.  We have now been over it a number of times.  I believe we will ultimately arrive at a much better Bill thanks to the witnesses' input.  There are still some tweaks and so on needed.  We will reflect on the witnesses' input today.</p> <p>  I have one thing to share and to ask all of the groups about.  When this comes in, there may be an opportunity to streamline the data.  I know there are reservations about sharing data with the Department, Bord Bia and other agencies but, ultimately, we all have to embrace technology at some stage.  Has anybody from the private sector approached the witnesses' organisations with online portals or propositions to safeguard everybody, including the farmer, the small retailer and the large retailer?  Off the top of my head, there might be a system whereby a farmer was able to go to a central veterinary point online, get his prescription back via his local vet and then select where we wanted to buy the medication.  Has anybody come to the organisations with a proposition like that?</p></speech>

With regard to data control and protection, as farmers, it is critically important for us that the NVPS be controlled and monitored centrally because, once we include and involve outside parties, it becomes more difficult to control and manage the data.</p> <p>  The issue of sanctions was raised and it is worth making one more point to the committee on it.  There are references to sanctions throughout this Bill.  They must be appropriate and reasonable.  If a prescriber fails in his duty, the farmer cannot be held responsible.  The current regulations on veterinary medicines incorrectly sanction farmers if somebody else fails in his or her duty.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure supplier compliance.  It is a small point but the Bill needs to clarify that.  </p> <p>  Farmers are ultimately the end users of the products covered by this Bill and, as a result, they are the ones most impacted by it.  The legislative obligations this Bill establishes will be crucial to farmers.  As I have said from the very start, we are absolutely in favour of a reduction in the use of antiparasitics and of their proper use but the supply chains must not put farmers at a competitive disadvantage in comparison with the current position.  It is critical for us, as farmers, that the Bill is framed in a way that addresses the issues in a positive and proactive way and delivers on the objectives we have targeted, which are the appropriate use of medicines and ensuring we do not end up with a two-phase operation in this country whereby there is one set of regulations operating North of the Border and another set operating South of the Border.  That ultimately looks like the situation the Department is leading us towards if it does not change course.</p> <p>  In respect of the fertiliser sales database, the IFA strongly believes the following key principles should be adhered to: the provisions in the Bill must seek to minimise any additional extra costs and administration being placed on professional fertiliser end users; the Bill must not disincentivise the purchase or spreading of fertilisers at farm level by professional end users; the protection of data and information gathered by the database is of critical importance; and individual farm data on fertiliser usage should be treated with the strictest confidence.  That equally applies to the medicines register.  We have already gone into that in great detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McCormack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022101900002#W00500"><p>In reply to Deputy Flaherty, it is absolutely critical that a system is put in place that minimises the exposure of the end user.  Farmers are normally referred to as the primary producer when discussing things but the term "end user" is used here.  The document specifies that there is potential for a fine of &euro;100,000 or for an invasion of one's home.  That is extreme, to put it mildly.  When Pat McCormack, or anybody else, goes to his local co-op or anywhere else to purchase fertiliser and gives his herd number, the person on the other side should be able to key in that information and find out how much stock he is still allowed to purchase rather than him finding out in six months' time when the fertiliser is all spread that he has spread one 50 kg bag too many of 27-2.5-5 or whatever formulation he is using and that he is now in breach of the various regulations.  There are companies out there that provide apps in respect of animal health and medicine remedies usage.  Perhaps they will come on board but the ICMSA would like to see the obligation on somebody other than the end user, specifically the retail outlets, retailers and providers of fertiliser.</p><p>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae raised huge concerns and rightly so.  He went back as far as the 1970s.  We can come up to 1983 and the introduction of the milk quota and then the abolition of the milk quota in 2015.  In that intervening period, we saw a substantial reduction in the number of dairy farmers.  That was because margins eroded for the primary producer.  The challenge then was to scale up to remain viable.  The challenge now is regulations and the potential for those regulations to make us unviable.</p><p> There have been challenging years in the past and I have no doubt there will be challenging years in the future as regards grass growth.  The Deputy is right; sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  We need a level of tolerance.  Rather than entering a fodder crisis and putting our hands up in the air in the months of July or August, there should be a tolerance where we can do something about it at home on this island nation, which is on the periphery of Europe.</p><p> In summation, we need common sense.  As an organisation, the ICMSA was obviously involved in some of the discussions but the Department seems adamant that the European Commission insists on this as a tool to move forward.  Whether it is fertiliser or medicines, however, they need to be available.  The responsibility cannot be borne solely by the sole trader, in the vast majority of cases, or the family farm unit.  There is enough stress out there on farms without having the bureaucracy of keeping this register or, indeed, the availability of medicines on a timely basis.  We need to see common sense prevail and very often, that is sadly lacking.</p></speech>

I will make some final comments to sum up the main aspects of what we have been discussing from Macra na Feirme's side of things.  The main issues are around ensuring market competition remains in place and is enhanced, which is crucial, and making sure farmers get access to the market.  We must make sure a system is in place that protects farmers, as the end users, from prosecution should other actors within the sector have failings.  There should also be ease of use for farmers to ensure there is no additional red tape or bureaucracy, which affects both older and younger farmers in terms of the burdens of, for instance, data recording or time constraints.  Increased investment and support for laboratory analysis is needed to enhance the ability of services to analyse faecal egg sampling and other laboratory analysis that will support the implementation of the measures.  Also important is the protection of data to secure assurances for farmers that their data are being used and shared with the appropriate bodies.</p> <p>  I will highlight the main core objectives as set out in the EU's own overarching document, which are harmonising the internal market for veterinary products, reducing the administrative burden, enhancing the availability of veterinary medicine products, stimulating innovation of new and existing medicines and strengthening the EU's response to fighting antimicrobial resistance.  We have serious reservations as to whether the proposed Bill will meet any of the first four objectives.  We ask that consideration be given to all the suggestions and proposals put forward this evening to ensure fairness and equity is brought to farmers with regard to this.</p></speech>

The biggest issues here were raised by Deputies Flaherty and Danny Healy-Rae.  I thank them for their questions and comments.  I will begin with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, who spoke about going back to the 1970s and the number of cow buyers or whatever on a farm.</p> <p>  If we look at this over the last few months, and even last night, we attended another meeting on sucklers, we are talking about reduction through organic farming.  Money is put into it through maybe environmental schemes and asking where the cutbacks are.  This is all coming from Europe and different angles.  Is this another part of it?  A greater reduction in livestock is being put on farmers.  We are the enemy every time the television goes on in every direction.  As we said earlier, I do not think this levy and hard press should be put on fertiliser.  It is over-burdening.  As was said, every year is different with supplies at times.  This year was a different year with a drought.  Next year could be a better growing year.  We hear so many different things.  We cannot be limited like that.  We need to have access to the product at all times.  This is where we must have that.  Putting a quota on supply is really creating a reduction in certain events where people cannot feed the animals, which causes welfare issues.  Much more has to be looked at in this Bill.  It could be deferred a bit until it is better thought out or as someone said earlier, tweaked on where it is going.</p> <p>  I want to touch again on the other issues of accommodation and differences in medicines and stuff.  That is our biggest worry.  There is talk about taking the licensed merchants and pharmacists out of it.  The Government is talking about reducing by maybe half or two thirds the number of people in the system who are supplying products to the farming community.  We will be running with a shortfall.  Accessing that is where our problem as farmers will be big time.  We have seen this in energy with power stations being closed.  Now, we are short on power and the Government cannot open them again.  Are we going to look at that?  We have these licensed merchants sitting in closed-up buildings when we are short on supply and we cannot get to them.  We cannot be looking at this happening again.  We want to see this continue as it is until it is better put together and the Department becomes clear on it.  It has to be pushed back down the road until we get clearance on it.  The ICSA is not happy with the position.</p></speech>

They need to be told by their distributor, whether it is Kerry Co-Operative Creameries or another co-operative, before they run out or they will have nothing to spread in July or August in terms of fertiliser, silage or whatever.  Is Mr. McCormack telling me they know how much fertiliser I can have next year?  Is that decided?</p></speech>

A person would not be in a position where he or she would break the law by over-purchasing.  The obligation would be on the employee in the co-operative to look at the screen, type in people's herd numbers and say they can only take 2 tonnes or 2.5 tonnes because they has used their allocation.  The last thing we want is that come next September or October, a Department official goes out to people's farms and tells them they have breached the nitrates directive by spreading an extra 50 kg bag above and beyond what they should have.</p></speech>

The Minister is here today to discuss the following: the key recommendations contained in the joint committee report entitled, The Future Funding of Higher Education; student accommodation; PhD candidate remuneration; North-South cross-Border enrolment and the key recommendations contained in the joint committee report entitled, North-South Student Enrolment in Tertiary Education; and the withdrawal of CORU accreditation for the applied social care course at Dublin Business School.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has been allocated six minutes to ask questions and for the Minister to respond.  The committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I want to remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by making him or her identifiable.  The Minister has five minutes.</p></speech>

I previously said to this committee that neither I nor the Government would be found wanting when it comes to trying to addressing the question of sustainable funding.  In working with this committee to make progress, we really believe sustainably funding higher education has a profound impact for our economy, society and the citizens we all serve.  Therefore, I am pleased to be with here today to discuss our progress in implementing Funding the Future, our policy response to underfunding in the sector.  Indeed, earlier today we had an implementation group meeting where we had a chance to meet with all of the stakeholders.  This is an implementation group which I co-chair with Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins.</p><p>However, it would be remiss of me not to note the work of this committee in its report on sustainable funding.  I thank the committee for sending it to me.  As I outlined in my written response, a great many of its recommendations very happily dovetail with our priorities in Funding the Future,<i></i>particularly the focus on staffing ratios and on quality and how those two important strands inter-relate in higher education.</p><p>The committee will recall that Funding the Future<i></i>went beyond being a direct response to the European Commission's Directorate-General reform review because it also tried to settle the question of the funding model and the funding gap.  It provided a clear and detailed economic assessment as to the funding options presented in the Cassells report.  As was requested by this committee in 2019, the Government ruled out the possibility introducing student loans in the system.  The Government committed to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund.</p><p>In this year's budgetary process - this was an important development, and I hope a welcome one - we also committed to publishing an annual paper in advance of the budget on the cost of living and the cost of education in Ireland.  That enables Government, the Opposition, stakeholders and this committee to scrutinise the various options available to reduce the cost of education for students and their families.  The first of these assessments was published by my Department in August and it informed our decision-making in the Estimates process.  I am sure we will have a chance to get into the detail of Funding the Future as we work through the questions.  I will take my comments on as read, other than to say we are providing significant additional funding this year that will see a significant increase in staffing in the sector, which is important; a reduction in the staff-student ratio; and an opportunity to build capacity in the technological universities in regard to that.  There will also be funding that will enable joint programmes to be co-designed across further educational training and higher education.  This is a really key aim.</p><p>In terms of student accommodation, I want to be very clear on it.  I have been pretty upfront about this and I do not think the current student accommodation strategy is fit for purpose.  Much has changed in the world since it has been in place and we need to develop another one.  The last thing we need to do is to start writing that now.  The first thing we need to do is to look at the universities that have planning permission and to get building.  That is what my Department is working on.  It is finalising a proposal, which I intend to take to Government in the next few weeks, that will try to see Exchequer funding for the first time put into helping make student accommodation projects on publicly- or university-owned land with planning permission viable.  As we get into 2023, we will look at replacing the existing student accommodation strategy and we look at the technological universities and others and their capacity to develop accommodation.</p><p>I want to touch on the issue of PhD students.  We had a discussion on it during oral parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il last night.  I committed on that occasion to carrying out a national review of PhD student supports, PhD stipends and how we look after our PhD students in this country.  We have a lot of work to do.  I have been very clear that this needs to be an external review and I would like to share the terms of reference with the committee.  The scope of the review will include current PhD candidates' supports.  This includes: financial supports, such as stipends, SUSI and others; the adequacy, consistency and equity of current arrangements across research funders and higher education institutions, including equity and welfare considerations; the status of PhD candidates and this debate around the student versus the employee, including a review of international comparisons and models; the impact on the funding of research programmes of any adjustments to current rates of support; graduate outcomes for PhD graduates, including return on investment and benefits to the learner; future-proofing supports; and visa requirements and duration for non-EU students, mindful that this is a matter for the Department of Justice and will require collaboration with that Department.  In the coming days, I will announce the external chairs of that group.</p><p>These are requirements and duration for non-EU students, mindful that this is a matter for the Department of Justice and will require collaboration with that Department.  I will announce the external chairs of that group in the coming days but I wanted to share that with the committee.  It is my aim for it to conclude its work in early 2023.  </p><p> On the issue of North-South cross-Border enrolment, I would like to thank the committee for its thoughtful contribution to the question of North-South enrolment in tertiary education in this report, and specifically its series of recommendations.  The Chair will be aware that I have provided under a separate cover a detailed written response to that report and it is a very timely contribution to the question of North-South student mobility.  I am convinced not just of the need to facilitate mobility, but also to ensure that firm foundations of collaboration between further and higher education institutions are protected and enhanced.  There are common challenges facing education systems, North and South, and it is in the interests of all of us on the island of Ireland to ensure that every young person and every person on the island has access to the best possible educational opportunity.  This is vital not only to our shared economic prosperity but to underpinning peace on the island.  I also expect in the coming days to be able to make a significant announcement on the development of all-island research centres which I know is something this committee supports and has an interest in.</p><p> The final issue the committee asked me to touch on briefly and I am sure we will then engage on it, is with regard to the withdrawal of accreditation for the applied social care course at the Dublin Business School, DBS.  I fully respect CORU's role as an independent regulator.  That is right and proper.  I also fully support the regulation of the profession.  It is a good step forward in terms of standards.  There must be appropriate mechanisms to ensure fitness to practise and the protection of the most vulnerable in society, so regulation is being introduced and the system is currently undergoing the transition to accreditation.</p><p> The social care workers register is due to open on 30 November 2023.  This would begin a two-year transition period for existing practitioners to apply to register with CORU.  On 30 November 2025, the title "social care worker" is due to become a legally protected title in Ireland.  My officials are engaging with all relevant parties and will continue to do so.  I have been very clear regarding the need for refunds from DBS to students and a recognition of the difficulties they have encountered.  I also believe we need to look at how we ensure students can continue their studies and how they can transfer where possible to the Technological University, TU, Dublin.  I want to thank TU Dublin for a very active engagement with Quality and Qualifications Ireland and DBS and for all their efforts to work out a solution for DBS students.  I am happy to share more information in the questions. Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

I will go straight for it so in terms of North-South enrolment and the Minister's comments on it.  I welcome some of the Minister's comments but am a bit concerned that he talks about what has already been done.  I acknowledge the good collaboration between some of the institutes, and the research hubs and the development in that regard.  There is still greater potential there.  It is the student mobility part that we have to take very seriously.  I am disappointed and maybe we can have further discussions on why I think we need targets.  It is a bit like increasing female representation in politics if we do not have targets.  I feel we are a quarter of a century after the Good Friday Agreement and it concerns me that we still have such a low number of students going from North to South and South to North.  There is a much wider issue here than education in terms of embedding peace and reconciliation, and increasing the understanding that we need across the island.  I see the way those who are at third level from North and South engage and it does not matter what their constitutional aspirations are.  The engagement that is there and that then spreads out in third level institutes is really positive and something we need to do.  I ask that we look to see what more can be done there with the shared island unit.</p> <p>  I would particularly like to highlight the recommendation around adjusting grades from A-levels into leaving certificate points because that is probably the single biggest barrier to students from the North coming South.  It has become more acute in recent years as we have had grade inflation in this State.  It is something we need to look at further.  We will have a number of witnesses before the committee to discuss this further so I ask the Minister to keep an open mind on it and see what ways we can work together specifically to get rid of some of these barriers.  I know from talking to students and parents from the North that it is easier for someone from the North to go to Oxford or Cambridge than to go to the University of Galway, Dublin City University or one of those.   We have to hear that and try to unblock those things so I hope we will have further discussions on it.  </p> <p>  I welcome the setting up of the review group.  Deputy Harris said in May this year that the funding gap would be closed over the next three budgets.  Is that still the Minister's intention?  </p> <p>  Regarding student accommodation, I want to ask about the links to affordability and how the Minister will ensure it.  If third level institutions were to borrow all of the money they would have to charge roughly more than &euro;12,000 per year to cover the cost of student accommodation as it is at present.  That is not affordable accommodation as I know the Minister will understand.  </p> <p>  We talked last night about the PhD researchers and we need to look at the apprenticeship model to see what we can learn from that and how we can put that into place.</p> <p>  It is very important that each of the CORU students have a place and have a pathway.  There needs to be lessons learned for the future from what has happened to them.  I want to see each and every one of those students have a pathway and obviously be reimbursed.  We have a responsibility, albeit that their education was being provided by a private institute.</p></speech>

I wish to assure her that my position on North-South is not just to list all we are doing and all that we have done.  I genuinely share her view and am more convinced by the day from my engagement North-South, and from my visit to Queen's University Belfast where I gave a guest lecture over the summer months outlining my vision for an all-Island approach to higher education.  It makes sense.  I agree with the Deputy that regardless of one's political persuasion, the community one comes from in the North, on an island as geographically small as the island of Ireland it makes sense to work together just like we are in healthcare.  As I said in my opening statement I also believe it makes sense beyond education.  It makes sense in terms of embedding peace, in terms of getting to know each other and having a better understanding.  There have been a couple of developments.  The Higher Education Authority Act 2022, as I am delighted to now call it because the HEA Bill is now the HEA Act if anyone is wondering, is now the law of the land.  We will move to commence that.  We engaged on Committee and Report Stages on this legislation.  It is a very clear function now for the HEA in terms of the promotion of cross-Border collaboration on higher education.  It is now a function of the Higher Education Authority, very clearly and explicitly in that law.</p> <p>  Second, we are currently carrying out research to try to move beyond the anecdote in terms of student mobility and why people come or do not come North-South or South-North.  I do not mean this in any way regarding Deputy Conway-Walsh's comments because she could legitimately throw it at me too.  We are doing this research through the HEA to try to get under the bonnet as to what is going on in student mobility.  We have the common travel area but why is student mobility somewhat stuck North-South and indeed east-west?  We hope to publish that-----</p></speech>

I will not take too much time on this but there are a number of real actions that we are taking to try to accelerate all-island collaboration in both further and higher education.  In 2023, will see the development of the first all-island apprenticeship, likely in the area of construction.  Construction workers move around the island and it makes sense for the apprenticeship model.  Also in 2023 there should be an all-island approach to medical education.  We are almost there and have a bit of work to do.  There has been a lot of really good work by my colleagues on that issue.  We will likely see this month, if not next month, significant announcements on all-island research centres.  We will talk about that.  As soon as tomorrow I will be updated by officials on the work our Government is doing to advance our commitments on the New Decade, New Approach deal as regards Magee College.  I know this is an important interest for this committee and I will keep it closely informed.</p> <p>  On the &euro;307 million, it is my intention to close this gap as quickly as possible.  I want to see this gap closed ideally in the lifetime of this Government.  That is where the three budgets comment came from.</p><p>It is true, as we have discussed before, that ensuring people had food, light, heat and so on had to take priority in the measures we took in what became a cost-of-living budget.  However, we managed to receive significant investment and I am pleased with how it has landed with the implementation group for Funding the Future.  I will send the committee a note rather than taking up its time on this.  There will be an additional &euro;17.8 million for the universities and specialist colleges to strengthen capacity and resources, including effective staffing and reducing the staff-student ratio.  The technological universities will also receive &euro;17.8 million to strengthen their structural capacity in staffing and posts.  Increased funding of &euro;2.4 million will be allocated to medicine places and I am particularly excited about the &euro;2 million to develop, co-design and co-deliver programmes between further education and training, FET, and higher education, HE.  These are the additional Funding the Future measures and this is what the additional money will do.  I will send the committee a detailed note on that.</p><p> The question on accommodation and affordability is valid.  It is also the focus of our work.  We cannot hand out taxpayers' money and be mute on the issue of affordability.  I cannot get to where we are going immediately because I need Cabinet approval but I intend to go before the Cabinet committee on housing this month.  We will make proposals on how we believe we can help to get a number of projects that have full planning permission unstuck.  That is step one.  We have set up a specific unit in the Department dedicated to student accommodation.  There are a number of ways to slice and perhaps address the issue of affordability.  I will be happy to come back to this committee for its views and input once those proposals are available.</p><p> Regarding the PhD issue, the Deputy referred to the apprenticeship model last night in the D&aacute;il and again in the committee today.  I spoke about whether a PhD student should be treated as a student or an employee.  Different countries do different things.  What is the best model?  The scope of the review is broad enough to cover all of that.  It is clear this will not only be about the appropriate level of stipend.  That is important and it needs to be higher, but we also need to consider what other issues need to be addressed such as terms, conditions and pathways.</p><p> In the interests of time, I can send the Deputy and committee a note on DBS.  The work on this matter is ongoing.  The committee will be aware that a total of 85 learners were impacted by DBS.  It is a private college but I do not say that to wash our hands of the issue.  We want to help.  Of the 85 learners, 15 graduated in 2022 and 2021, 37 were part-time learners and 31 were full-time learners.  The 15 graduates have the option - and I am not trying to speak for them because I take the point that everyone is an individual - to avail of grant parenting provisions to become eligible for the register.  The existing students who have not yet graduated need to see how they can continue their studies.   Both TU Dublin and the Open Training College, OTC, are likely options but conversations are ongoing and we will continue to keep the committee updated about that.</p></speech>

It is fantastic that we have this Department that is driving change and legislation, including the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022 which is ground-breaking legislation.  It will drive funding in the third level sector.</p> <p>  It is great to see the detailed update the Minister gave to the committee.  The &euro;1,000 reduction in the registration fee provided for in the budget is extremely welcome.  Parents and students have been given a deadline of the end of November to engage with their colleges and share their account details.  I will also highlight that the SUSI application deadline is 3 November 2022 for any students who need to apply for that.  The Minister is considering a review of that scheme as well.  Hopefully the double payment will be made in December.</p> <p>  I was at a great event in Ballinasloe on Tuesday.  The brand-new Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, in Athlone is establishing learning gates.  I was not sure what a learning gate was.  It is where students can come together and have a space to learn.  Ballinasloe Area Community Development has a meeting room that students can access.  They can access courses online and study in an environment where other students can also meet.  The technological university will open 11 learning gates in the next few weeks and is even considering opening one in Dublin.  It is phenomenal that we are seeing this outreach.  I want to see campuses and centres of excellence in our regions, especially in Roscommon and east Galway, because that drives regional investment in our areas.  It also drives excellence in academia because it engages and shows there is a focus.  We need to see investment in the regions as well as in city centre locations and to work with different agencies in local areas to promote that.  I am interested in the Minister's thoughts about regional development and how TUS has been able to do that.</p> <p>  Regarding PhDs, it is fantastic to see the review.  Having worked in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, I am aware of the challenges relating to supporting PhD and master's degree students.  The Minister indicated the review will examine the status of PhD students, the stipends - of course &euro;500 has been allocated in the budget - and international comparisons.  Will the Minister provide a timeline?  Is there a country that the Minister thinks manages PhDs best and is the one to look at?  I am looking at the quality we have.  Ireland ranks highly in expertise in many sectors and research areas through its principal investigators.  Those principal investigators drive the funding that comes through SFI and the Irish Research Council, IRC, and then brings the PhD teams to Ireland to deliver and develop excellence here.</p> <p>  The Minister highlighted student accommodation as being one of the Department's key priorities, with a dedicated unit.  I was delighted to hear about a 674-bedroom development when the Minister was visiting the brand-new University of Galway.  Will he provide a timeline for that?</p> <p>  It is wonderful to hear about Funding the Future.  The Minister stated the implementation team had been recruited.  Will he update the committee on any outcomes from that?</p> <p>  I am happy to see the co-design between FET and HE.  In relation to education and training boards, ETBs, I have a few questions about how the Department funds SOLAS which delivers FET and ETBs, but the Department of Education funds the administration and running of those organisations.  Does the Minister have any comments on that?  It can sometimes be a challenge in how we develop the staffing and capacity to deliver these courses, which the Minister stated is crucial, especially on the FET and HE side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101900002#C00300"><p>The Senator covered a lot of ground so I hope she will bear with me.  I thank her for working with me on the Higher Education Authority Bill.  I enjoyed and appreciated her input.</p> <p>  I am pleased we have managed to reduce the student contribution fee by &euro;1,000 on a one-off basis.  I am equally, if not more, proud that we have come up with a proper structure to look at the issue of registration fees and grants in the round from next year.  Senator Malcolm Byrne and I debated this point at different times but I think we have landed in a good place, because we have said everybody will receive &euro;1,000.  That is a cost-of-living measure and like many cost-of-living measures, it is universal and will be paid before the end of the year.  Some 94,000 students will benefit.  From next year, we have made a permanent reduction of &euro;500 and linked it to the SUSI system.  We have introduced an income threshold of &euro;100,000 and a reduction of &euro;500.  That gives me and any future Ministers or Governments the ability to look at the registration fee as part of the overall grant system in future budgets.  That is a good way of doing it as we will not be having separate conversations about SUSI and the registration fee.  We are looking at the system and structure of the cost of education.</p> <p>  One of the good ideas to come out of the Funding the Future paper was a recommendation by one of my officials that we publish an annual cost-of-higher-education paper in advance of the budget.  It has been done by the Department of Social Protection for many years.  Papers on tax and welfare are published.  We had not exactly been forgotten, but we were not up in lights in advance of the budget.  This means that every year the Oireachtas, media, stakeholders and everyone else will get to see, debate and consider what could be done to help to reduce the cost of education, how much it would cost and the best choices available.  That can only be good.</p> <p>  I am pleased that SUSI will issue double payments on 16 December 2022.  That will come at a welcome time for many families and crucially the SUSI grants will rise by between 10% and 14% from January 2023.   Last year and in most previous years, when SUSI grants rose, students had to wait until the following college year.  They will rise from January 2023, which is important considering the pressure people are feeling.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing more about the learning gates and perhaps going to see some of them.  It is a good idea.  The technological universities at their core are about regional development.  They are about bringing access to education into the regions.  They are about moving beyond the outdated concept that all roads from an educational point of view must lead to a big city.  We have had a lot of success in recent years in setting up technological universities.  I thank the committee for its work on this.</p> <p>  Capital investment is badly needed in the facilities. We will have an announcement at the end of this month or the beginning of next month on significant capital funding for technological universities.  Many have applied.</p><p>That will come shortly.  On research, we are making sure there are research-intensive institutions, looking forward to the ring-fenced funding for the TUs that will come through the European Regional Development Fund.  I think it is a fund of approximately &euro;80 million.  The third is a meaty piece of work.  There is a lot of work going on in my Department and with the OECD on academic contracts.  Again, this is not about foisting something on people; it is about engaging and offering the contract so these TUs can reach their full potential.  Now that they are set up, they are the three big things that are important.</p><p> On the PhD review, the timeline is that it will kick off in November and conclude in early 2023.  We need to talk to them first, but I will announce the external chair or chairs of that by the end of the week, I hope, or certainly in the next week or so.</p><p> On the 674 beds in Galway, I had a chance to view the site when in Galway with the Senator for the renaming of the University of Galway.  My understanding is that construction is due to be completed in January.  There is then the fit-out process and all of that, so they will be on stream for the next academic year.  The membership of the implementation group is quite broad but it contains the heads of SOLAS, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, Irish Universities Association, IUA, the president of the Students' Union, the general secretary of ICTU, representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the head of Aontas, representatives from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department of Education, my own Department, IBEC and me and the two co-chairs, Professors Tom Collins and Anne Looney.  I think I have covered all the questions.  I would also like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to Patricia King on her retirement from ICTU.</p></speech>

I join with the previous speaker in congratulating the Minister on the Department and its success.  Some of us were unconvinced as to the necessity of a new Department but it has proven its worth.  It is now a feature and a fixture and deserves to be.  The Minister made a success of it and that needs to be acknowledged.  We share many aspirations about free education, particularly in the area of literacy, which he has done great work on and I congratulate him on that.</p> <p>  On the cross-Border piece, I want to focus on one issue today, if I might, which feeds into the cross-Border discussion.  On teacher training, to put it delicately, there is an issue regarding the cohort of teachers we are training and the qualifications that necessitate their access to teacher training courses.  Barriers to teacher training are placed in front of young people from certain backgrounds. They might be from disadvantaged or Traveller backgrounds or they could be from the North or overseas.  Some of those barriers relate to the Irish language.  This is a difficult one to verbalise because many people feel very strongly about the Irish language, as I do myself; I have a degree in Irish.  I try to pronounce my name to people with great difficulty in every election.  The serious point is that the requirement of the standard of Irish to enter training colleges needs to be challenged.  What we need in teacher training is a diverse population of teachers in our primary schools that reflects the children they are teaching.  It is still a very white, middle-class teaching profession.  It does not reflect a new Ireland or any new Ireland we want to promote.  The Irish language could also be seen as a barrier, particularly in terms of the North.  Would it not work better, considering the new Ireland we hope to engage with, to have people from more disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not have had higher level Irish as an option in their second level school?  They certainly might not have had the chance to go to the Gaeltacht three summers in a row for financial reasons.  Would it not be better to focus on their ability to learn and teach Irish when they are in training college, rather than as a requirement to get into training college?</p> <p>  It is still such a powerful profession.  If someone comes from a minority, be it ethnic or any other kind of minority, particularly disadvantaged children, and if he or she has somebody from his or her community as a learning and educational leader in the classroom, it is incredibly powerful.  While it is not the only barrier, perhaps the Irish language requirement could be tweaked a little, not in any way to reduce the quality of Irish language teaching in the classroom, but to do it in a way that teachers are empowered to teach Irish better when they are in training college, rather than having that funnel exclude some people who may not have had the opportunity to learn Irish at second level.  They could be students from the North or a disadvantaged background or abroad.  How powerful would it be to have somebody who came here as an asylum seeker working as a primary school teacher?  The one reason they probably cannot is the requirement to have Irish entering teacher training college.  It is an issue I have tried to pursue for a long time.  At one point, we had a number of students from DEIS second level schools in my constituency learning Irish and getting grinds in Marino Institute of Education.  That was a solution.  Some managed to achieve the required Irish language level and they became teachers.  We were proud of that, but it is not a long-term fix.  I wanted to bounce that off the Minister, to use this platform to raise it and see if he has any sense of how we could move on that.</p></speech>

I should acknowledge, because it is the truth, that the Deputy was the first Oireachtas Member who spoke to me about the issue of adult literacy.  We have been doing a lot of work on it as a Department, trying to advance some of the issues we discussed.  We now have a national programme office set up to deliver the new adult literacy for life, ALL, strategy, as well call it.  Probably more importantly, flowing from that, we are actively putting in place regional literary co-ordinators.  Key to the progress of this strategy is that it is not a document that resides in Dublin or the Department or an office, but that we empower communities to see what they need to do in their area to roll out literacy initiatives.  For some, that might be through their local sports club or other local organisations.  However, I acknowledge that there is significant work going on.</p> <p>  Before straying, the issue of teacher education still resides in the Department of Education and the initial teacher education unit.  I can certainly refer these views to them and seek a view and engagement from them.  Having acknowledged that it is within their area of responsibility - this is a personal view - but in general, as we try to reform the education system, we should be more concerned about the standards somebody has obtained upon exit of university, as opposed to on entry.  That is not a bad philosophy to approaching this.  We have seen good practice in the likes of Dublin City University, DCU, which the Deputy will be familiar with given his geographic location.  We have seen good examples from DCU where they go out into communities, particularly into socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, to identify potential teachers among young people through local community groups and sports clubs and try to mentor, identify and encourage them to take the plunge.</p> <p>  My Department has the programme for access to higher education, PATH, bursaries, which are access to education bursaries.  There are specific bursaries now in place for members of the Traveller community who wish to access teacher education.  That is a slightly wider point I am making than specifically around the Irish language issue.  I will certainly feed those views back.  In general, and I saw it in my time at the Department of Health, diversity in professions is a good thing.  If our professions are not diverse, it stores up a lot of issues, including the lack of role models and identified people for all communities.  Professor Anne Looney, who is probably well known to the Deputy, is co-chairing our implementation group.  She leads the teacher education initiative in DCU.  I might seek a more informed view from her as well.  I am happy to share that with the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Minister and his officials have achieved an awful lot in a relatively short period, both in terms of what we have achieved with TUs, the higher education Act and some of the funding reforms.  The Minister will appreciate that my job over the next five and a half minutes is not to spend my time praising him but to focus on a couple of the key outstanding issues.</p><p>I will put one question directly, before coming to others.  The Minister made a commitment that the sum identified in Funding our Future - &euro;307 million, which is the funding shortfall for the higher education sector - would be addressed over three budgets.  While I appreciate his point, I think that the &euro;40 million in the budget this year only went part of the way and represented a disappointing movement on the &euro;307 million shortfall.  There are two budgets left, however, assuming the Minister remains in the Department.  That means we are going to have to look at an additional &euro;130 million, or more, in each of budgets 2024 and 2025.  How confident is the Minister that the balance of the sum that has been identified - the shortfall - will be delivered?  How committed is he in that regard?</p></speech>

I am not an island and I am not the entire Government.  It will require the Senator's party, my party and Senator Pauline O'Reilly's party working together to prioritise these issues.  I have had great support from the Taoiseach on this.  I want to genuinely acknowledge that, but it will require a collective effort from the whole Government.  There are a couple of reasons to be hopeful.  One, we need to grapple with the National Training Fund surplus.  I am not suggesting that it is easy; it is not.  If it was easy it would have been done already, but it still needs to be done.  For anyone watching these proceedings, the National Training Fund is an account that employers across the country pay into.  It has a very large surplus, which will amount to over &euro;1 billion shortly.  It is on track to go to over &euro;2 billion in the coming years.  That was always being paid into to provide additionality in terms of skills and training.  That is one helpful suggestion I make to broader government-----</p></speech>

I am not saying it should, though.  I believe it is a pot that needs to be considered.</p> <p>  I would like to mention a second issue that did not get enough of a hearing, although it got a fair hearing today at the implementation group from the sector, which I appreciate.  We all talk about the &euro;307 million, including me.  We are all committed to filling that hole.  We did something else in the budget, however.  If we had not done it, the hole would have grown.  There &euro;307 million in money owed to the sector.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on this.  We got agreement for the first time to fund every new additional student entering college from September at the new higher Funding our Future rate.  Every new additional student who goes into college from September will be funded 25% more in terms of funding to the university than students currently.  As that washes through the system, for want of a better phrase, it means we become sustainable from this moment on.  I said very clearly to the IUA and others that if we had not done that - if we had announced a larger sum for the core funding but not done that - we would have created another problem.</p> <p>  The third thing is that this is year one of implementation; it truthfully is.  It is the first budget we have received for Funding our Future.  Of course, we would all have liked it to be higher but we had to balance it with the cost-of-living pressures for students and their families and the significant investment we put into that.  It will require time to build up our own capacity as a sector in terms of delivery.  There are some key things, as we said at the implementation group today.  We will need to prove that the &euro;40 million makes a real and tangible difference, particularly in terms of staffing ratios, and does not - I am not suggesting this will happen - disappear or go into block grants.  I think it could make a difference of at least half a point in the staff-student ratio this year.  That is a tangible thing.  When we go back to the Estimates discussions next year, we will be able to look at what we did with the &euro;40 million and imagine what we can do into the future.  I will work very closely with the Senator on this.</p></speech>

I will not go through all of them.  I want to raise the question of student accommodation, which remains a critical challenge.  We should be supporting our higher education institutions to develop as much as on-campus accommodation as possible.  This would help to relieve pressure on the wider housing issue.  As the Minister knows, there is a significant cost to higher education institutions to be able to provide such accommodation in a way that will be affordable to students.  The only way that is going to be done at present in most cases is where there are supports made available from the State for the provision of student accommodation.  I know the Minister has indicated support for this.  Will we be able to see that for 2023?  Can we see that in a way which ensures that at the start of the 2023-24 academic year, we may be able to see a level of State investment to support on-campus student accommodation?  Critically, it must be affordable for students to rent thereafter.</p></speech>

Thankfully, it is more than that.  At a Cabinet committee on housing in July, I think, the Taoiseach and I strongly put forward the view that there was a need for an intervention and the Taoiseach provided his imprimatur for this to happen.  Since then, we have been working on developing proposals for how we can unlock or unstick, in the first instance, universities that have planning permission today.  This is not a critical comment on them; far from it.  It has not been viable for them to build.  We will be returning to the Cabinet committee on housing this month and then, ultimately, to the Cabinet to try to press "Go".  I imagine it may be done project by project.  Affordability will be an element.  We cannot have a situation where the State is paying money and is agnostic on the issue of affordability.  I will not read out the entire list of those with whom we are working closely.  I can share the list with the committee.  There are five traditional universities today with planning permissions to build.  If you look at the totality of that, you are talking about a significant number of beds that could be built.  Will all these beds be built for 2023?  Of course they will not.  That is not what the Senator is asking.  If we are to move beyond the annual September crisis around student accommodation, at some point somebody has to take the bull by the horns and try a new model; that is what we are going to do.</p> <p>  The second piece will have to involve the technological universities.  The Senator will be familiar with the position in the south east.  With the exception of the former Waterford Institute of Technology, they have never built a student accommodation bed.  I am not being critical of them because they had not been allowed to do so under the borrowing framework.  We have now clarified under the borrowing framework that they can.  When we met the chairs of the governing authorities, our message to them was to get ready and begin to prepare their plans.  That will be coupled with the new student accommodation strategy.  I expect that in this calendar year, we can make progress on what the policy intervention looks like and that in 2023, we can make progress on delivering some of these projects.</p></speech>

There must be three elements to the research strategy.  First, there must be the structural elements around how we operate research.  Second, we need to address the levels of supports for research students, particularly PhD candidates.  The levels are completely insignificant given what we are expecting of them, particularly where they are living.  The third thing that is crucial to a research strategy, in order to ensure we do not get bogged down in the organisations that run it, is the purpose of research, how we are going to drive it and whether there will be an emphasis on blue sky research.  The Minister may want to speak about his plans for this and if there is a specific timetable on it.</p></speech>

I can send the Senator more details.  The PhD student review is a big part of getting that piece right.  It is a question of how we treat PhD students, how we attract people to the country and how we retain people.  It is an issue about their well-being and welfare and about national competitiveness.  I think the Senator and I agree on that.  He has raised this issue of PhD students quite a lot with me.  This short, sharp review has broad terms of reference but is focused at the same time.  It involves external people.  It will report back early in 2023 and will give us a roadmap to get to a much better place.</p> <p>  We will bring forward legislation in 2023 around what the structures will look like.  As the Senator implied, it is not about getting bogged down in structures - as the title suggests, it is about the impact that those structures will make.  We must be clear that it is about supporting all forms of research, and not just enterprise-related research.  That is something I think the Senator and I share a view on.  I am happy to update the committee on where we are at in the implementation of the strategy.  A number of new groups have started meeting.  We are working closely with the vice-presidents of research across the universities.  It is a strategy that has been pretty well received by the sector, probably because it has been co-designed by it and the experts.  I am happy to send the Chair a detailed note on the implementation of Impact 2030.</p></speech>

It is very worthwhile that the Minister is available to the committee to give us constant updates because it is a new Ministry.  As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, there must be some recognition of our Government partners having pushed for this Ministry in particular.  It has shown its worth, as has the Minister.  Given the limited time, I want to focus on one area the Minister has come here to speak to us about and that is PhD candidates.  We are doing another piece of work at the moment around mental health supports within primary and secondary schools.  One of the things the stakeholder groups have raised with us as an issue is recruitment of those who support.</p><p>We already know through child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, that it is an issue but we have a backlog in this country when it comes to psychological supports in education.  I know the Minister is aware of this and that the working group is also working on it, but there are three types of PhD students going through psychological research programmes and two of those are funded through the HSE.  More recently the students on the counselling programme are also funded since this budget, but the last are the educational psychology PhD candidates.  It is very hard to explain or understand why that is, particularly as they all come to their courses from the same route.  These candidates do 300 hours of work placement, often with CAMHS and some of it with disability services so they are hugely valuable for us, even while they are doing that training.  Looking at the clinical psychology PhD candidates for instance, they are being paid a full-time salary for their work as a PhD candidate.  Only 18 of these educational psychology PhD students are due to graduate in the next year, or possibly in 2024.  Can the Minister explain what the difficulty is in ensuring that kind of equality between all of those candidates given that when they come out, they have the exact same qualifications?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101900002#F00200"><p>I thank the Senator for her comments and for all the work she does in engaging with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on a whole range of issues related to the work of the Department, in Galway but also nationally.  There are a couple of things here.  The points made by the Senator highlight the need to overhaul the system we have in place in terms of PhD supports.  We have been looking at this very intensively particularly in recent weeks but also in recent months.  The situation is that my Department pays stipends through our agencies such as the Irish Research Council, the IRC, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, which are at an equivalent level of &euro;18,500 each.  Some PhD courses do not have a stipend.  Some are paid directly by their institution such as those in the Higher Education Institutions, HEI, but that level is decided by the HEI from their block grant generally.  Then some PhD students are paid through private sources or private funding received by their university.  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Senator, for the health programmes, the HSE and the Department of Health fund to recruit.  The Department of Education is not within my remit but I believe it is considering this for educational psychologists.  I said this in the D&aacute;il last night but the broader point I want to make is that as part of the review, we need to look at the fact that we do not actually have a minimum recommended stipend in Ireland.  There are so many different types and there cannot be a minimum.  I will pose the question as opposed to pre-empting the outcome of the review.  Should there not be a floor for the level of stipend supports for all PhD students in Ireland?  At the moment there is not.  I looked at this in the context of the budget, even those funding schemes within my remit that I can provide financial assistance to, or at least easily provide financial assistance to, are not 100% clear either.  The PhD review we are announcing this evening will be an opportunity to tease through those issues but on the specific point the Senator makes in relation to that relatively small number of students, the responsibility lies with the Department of Education.  My understanding is that it is considering a model similar to that used by the Department of Health.  I will ask officials in the Department of Education as a result of this exchange to interact with the Senator directly.</p></speech>

From our point of view, as a society this means we do not have enough educational psychologists.  It is important to say it cannot be just left with the Department of Education to sort out because this is a specific issue which is funnelling people in a direction and that has to be recognised as a State policy in relation to third level education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101900002#F00400"><p>I do not disagree with that at all.  I am certainly not suggesting it would be and that is why I referenced the body of work that my Department tends to do with this external review about PhD support students, the consistency of those supports and how they are applied.  I accept that 100%.  The Senator touched on another issue on which I will not go into too much detail in case I frustrate the Chair, but it is the issue around workforce planning.  I will be blunt with this committee and say I am really concerned about this.  There have been examples of good practice particularly in recent months.  I am really proud of the work my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and others have done in relation to medicine places.  I can sit here this evening and tell the committee there is a funded multiannual plan to increase medicine places over the next number of years.  Some 60 extra places went in this September.  The deans of the medical schools did great work and I thank them, and the HSE also.  All of that is great but I cannot say that exists in many other areas of the public service and that frustrates and worries me.  As a Minister for some time, I know that funding initiatives can be announced but if there are not people to roll-out these in terms of the delivery on the ground, it will not make progress with waiting times and lists.  I am very passionate about the need to accelerate the engagement with other Government Departments.  They need to see this relatively new Department as a resource and properly interlock with it on workforce planning.  How many speech and language therapists do we need in Ireland and how many occupational therapists and nurses?  It is not only how many we need but how we actually get there together.  I am not being critical.  I have seen exchanges on health committees where people get tetchy when these issues are raised.  This is not criticism of any other Department but we are all public servants here and we need to step up to the plate.  We need to properly plan the workforce.  I do not intend to become pen pals in terms of correspondence between my Department and others in relation to this issue.  It is too serious.  We now have settled the question of medicine and I want to praise the Department of Health for its work on that but we need to now do it in relation to health, social care and disability professions.  I know the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is up for this; as is the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  If I continue in this role, a key priority of mine in 2023 will be the whole issue of workforce planning.  My Department is now engaging at an official level with a number of Departments on this as well.</p></speech>

I know the Minister's Department is very active in trying to come up with solutions.  I met the Chair of the Technical Universities and some of the presidents recently and one of the issues they spoke about was being able to borrow as other universities can.  Will the Minister bring us up to date on that?  I am not sure if that question has been asked already.</p> <p>  Second, what collaboration has the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Housing had with the likes of Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Cork City Councils where some of our bigger third level institutions have real issues in trying to accommodate students?  The financial contribution the Government gave back to students in the recent budget is very welcome but it is being offset by the cost of accommodation.  The students had their walkout protest last Thursday.  You hear of some students living in tents - I do not know but that is the information that is out there.  Can the Minister address those few issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022101900002#F00800"><p>Students and their parents and families are not in any way immune from the real pressures people are feeling in relation to the cost-of-living crisis.  It is palpable.  It is difficult and challenging and we really want to look at practical ways of helping.  That is why we have taken immediate measures between now and the end of the year with &euro;143.5 million of direct financial assistance going to students and their families be that the double Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, payment just before Christmas; the increase in the student grants that will kick in from January; the refund of &euro;1,000 additional funding for the student assistance fund, which can perhaps be viewed as a hardship fund; extra supports for postgraduate students and an additional increase in the PhD stipend.  These are practical measures we wanted to take now to help people and in recognition of the fact that when you look at housing and student accommodation, there are two parts to it.  There is affordability and supply and in relation to affordability some of the measures taken in the budget will genuinely assist.  For the information of the committee, figures as of today show there are approximately 2,065 rooms, what used to be called digs, available for rent across the country.</p><p>These are advertised on student portals and the like.  When I meet students and talk about this I understand it does not work for everybody but it is working for thousands of students.  It does work sometimes for people who have a spare room in terms of the cost of living impact.  We have made a number of changes around social welfare rules to make it easier for people to keep the living alone and the fuel allowances and the pension and rent out the spare room.  While people say there is nothing available on Daft.ie or Myhome.ie I encourage any student or parent to look at the various digs options available.  It is certainly better than some of very difficult scenarios that I sometimes hear of.  That is not me saying that is the long-term solution or an optimum policy.  It is not.  It is getting on with building.  I want to be very clear and I have said this directly to the Technological Universities and will be saying it when I am with the Chairman and Senator Byrne when I am in the south-east on Monday, so let me say it again here.  We are ready to talk and want to talk and are open for business in terms of the Technological Universities and the borrowing framework.  They know this, in fairness, and they are working hard on this.  We will work with them to accelerate and develop any plans they have to deliver student accommodation.  It will be really important for the success of the TUs, Technological Universities, because they are about serving their region but also about attracting people into the region to study and to do that you need accommodation.  I agree with that.</p><p> On the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and his officials for the excellent collaboration between my Department and his.  We are extremely grateful for the work they are doing with us and for allowing us to take learning from some of the schemes they have put in place more broadly in society.  We are interacting with the Cabinet Committee on Housing and we will be back to that committee this month as well on that.  On the issue of affordability I have acknowledged the measures we are taking in the budget to put money back in people's pockets.  The reason we are doing it is because we know people are experiencing rising costs.  I know the Chair did not ask me but I should say, because the Chair and Senator Byrne regularly talk to me on this, the South-East Technological University moving ahead with securing the new site for the Wexford campus is a massive priority for us.  There is funding set aside in my Department and I acknowledge and thank Mr. Enright, the chief executive of Wexford County Council, and the council for the role they are playing to secure that site for us.</p></speech>

I will be parochial and I know Senator Byrne will probably back me on this or if he wishes to come in on it we will have further questions.  After the securing of the site and when funding is sought for the new build of the facility - I understand Carlow and Waterford will be looking for capital investment as well - I am parochial in looking for capital investment for the Wexford site so there will not be any undue delay once the site is secured and once it goes to planning.  I know it is a long road ahead.  I hope the Department will be there and willing to help and not put any barriers in place regarding the funding for the infrastructure and the construction.</p></speech>

There is a great leadership team and governing authority now in place which really hit the ground running in their formal launch on Monday.  I do not mean this in a flippant way but we are not in the business of buying sites and using taxpayers' money for sites for them to sit idle.  We are in the business of purchasing sites and expanding footprints because we buy into the argument and into the compelling vision that there needs to be a modern fit-for-purpose campus in Wexford.  I was really impressed when I visited the campus in Wexford with the Chairman and Senator Byrne and with what is going on there.  I was not impressed with the facilities that people have to work and learn in.  I met some very inspiring students there particularly around the whole area of lifelong learning, people who told me very bluntly and very clearly that they would not have been in higher education were it not for being able to go to the Wexford campus.  We now just need to provide them with a fit-for-purpose campus.</p> <p>  The Chair is also right to indicate it is always good to be truthful in this.  The site was secured and then we get on to the planning etc.  These are processes that take time but these will be processes that we will work with the Technological University to progress as a priority.  These are autonomous institutions, as they remind me, and the governing authority sets out its own strategic priorities.  We will see an expansion in Waterford and I am clear on that.  There are plans for Carlow and there are plans for Wexford too.  Securing and developing the new site and building a modern fit-for-purpose campus on the site are shared priorities of the Government and of the Technological University.</p></speech>

I have been in contact with some of the students in light of the recent budget announcement that all third level students were expected to be entitled to the &euro;1,000 rebate on college fees.  Unfortunately some students in Marino Institute of Education will not qualify for this.  Is there any way that we can solve this issue?  I am not looking for an answer now and I do not expect it as it was not part of the remit of appearing before the committee but if there is anything at all the Minister or his Department can do on this it would be very much appreciated.</p></speech>

I had a very good conversation there with the president, a very impressive individual, about her and her management team's vision for the future of the Marino Institute of Education.  I launched their strategic plan that day.  There is a really important conversation about Marino and where it fits and I say that in a positive way, about where it wants to fit in our higher education landscape and the HEA Act 2022 also gives us opportunities to accelerate those discussions.  We have discussed this in relation to a number of institutions.  I do need to be honest and of course I will meet with Marino and the president and will engage with her on this and other issues.  However for clarity, and it is always important to be clear on these things, the reduction of &euro;1,000 is linked to the payment of a &euro;3,000 registration fee.  There are lots of different students in lots of different scenarios across the country.  The way I think of it in my head and the way I explain it to the public is if you are levied the &euro;3,000 fee you are automatically entitled to the &euro;1,000 reduction.  If you are not, you are not.  That is not to be in any way dismissive but it is just to be truthful.  That is where we started in terms of reducing the cost of education.  We do intend to do more. We are engaging directly with Marino on this and we are assessing the situation.  My understanding is that Marino sets its own rate for non-approved courses so there is an engagement going on with Marino but it is the free fees initiative, the &euro;3,000 fee, that the &euro;1,000 reduction applies to.  Any other fee that is not from the free fees initiative does not currently quality for the reduction.  We will continue to engage with them.</p></speech>

He will know that at the moment we only have University College Dublin, UCD, and from memory there are around 80 places there.  We have a huge shortage so we find ourselves with hundreds of students having to go abroad every year to train as vets.  Meanwhile, and we talk about workforce planning, we have serious situations particularly for large animals in rural Ireland where we do not have the vets to meet the need that is there.  I know there are a couple of new colleges being talked about but could the Minister update us on that?  I also know that there is currently no veterinary college in the North but there is also one being talked about in the North.  I know I have sprung this on the Minister but I would really appreciate it if he could give me an update on it and see how we can progress the proposals that are there.</p></speech>

I am relying on my memory on this because I do not have it in a brief in front of me but I have quite a bit of familiarity with it because I had a very good meeting recently with the delegation of veterinary education leaders from the mid-west.  They came to see me in Leinster House.  There is at least two higher education institutions that I am aware of and I am sure Deputy Conway-Walsh is aware of that are currently looking at engaging with the HEA on preparing for en expression of interest for target programmes including veterinary.  Again, as I implied in an earlier answer, the line department here is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of dealing with vets.  We want to work with it.</p><p>I believe the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has been engaging with this group.  I would like to meet this group as mediators with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.</p><p> This is a personal view.  I am frustrated that, as the Deputy rightly says, every year so many young people leave to go to, I believe, Poland and Hungary to study to become vets.  There clearly is a demand from young Irish students to study veterinary medicine.  I have also heard from a number of colleagues in the House and from vets themselves that there is a particular shortage of vets for larger animals in rural areas.  We are engaging on this.  There will be a process involving expressions of interest through the HEA, which is obviously the appropriate channel.  They are autonomous institutions and need to express interest.  There is considerable activity in this space involving two HEIs in particular.</p></speech>

The Minister previously indicated including supports for part-time students under SUSI.  Has there been progress on that?  The Minister knows of the issue with the designation of the National College of Ireland under the Higher Education Authority Act.  Has there been any progress?  There has been considerable good news this week about UCD's partnership with the European Space Agency.  We have developed links to the European Southern Observatory.  The Minister will be aware that I had a Commencement matter on our membership of CERN.  I ask him at the very least, to commit to doing a cost-benefit analysis on our joining CERN.  The issue of health insurance for international students is still stuck with the Department of Justice.  I would be grateful if the Minister would intervene on that.

Despite being an Irish national, my focus is very much Brussels based and on EU climate and energy legislation.  Thus, I will focus more on the European side today.  I will talk about the cause of the current crisis, the impacts we have seen so far, the potential solutions which have been proposed at EU level and how we see things going forward.</p> <p>  The first matter I will discuss is the cause of the current energy crisis.  It is pretty simple in that it is a gas shortage crisis.  The root cause of the crisis is a shortage of gas in the system.  This is having major contagion effects on electricity prices given that gas is often the price-setting technology for many hours of electricity.  I am oversimplifying, but the electricity price is often just the gas price, multiplied by two and with the CO2 price added on top.  This means that when gas prices become extremely high, as we have seen, we get very high electricity prices.   To put it into context, gas prices are usually approximately &euro;15 to &euro;20 per megawatt hour at the Dutch title transfer facility, TTF.  What we have seen is an explosion in prices.  Prices reached more than &euro;300 per megawatt hour in August and are now at &euro;150 per megawatt hour which is ten times higher than they usually are.  This is not a result of market dynamics but market manipulation and geopolitics. </p> <p>  Other factors have contributed somewhat.</p><p>We had a very hot summer, which means hydro reserves are low.  It also makes it harder to transport coal.  We have also seen low winds.  Concerning nuclear outputs in France, 32 of 57 nuclear plants are not operating at full capacity.  That has posed a challenge, but essentially it is a gas shortage issue.  We get 40% of our gas from Russia; that is about 155 to 170 bcm.  At the moment we are only getting 9% from Russia.  Replacing that gas is a major challenge.  That is the cause; I will now talk about the consequences.</p><p> The consequences have been quite major since this began.  Wholesale energy prices have increased by 532% at EU level and retail prices have increased by 84%; there has been quite a dramatic increase.  I will break down retail and wholesale.  If we look at households, as I said, there has been an increase of about 84%.  It is important to understand that for households, much of the electricity is purchased ahead in forward markets.  Households are not fully exposed to the cost increase.  While customers are already feeling the pinch, they have not been fully exposed.  Some 80% of it is hedged and 20% is fully exposed.  The price increases are only on the 20% that has not been hedged.  We need to be conscious of that - it will come around in a couple of years.  To contrast with Spain, it has a much higher exposure with less hedged electricity, meaning that their customers are feeling the pinch straight away at a higher level than in countries like Ireland.</p><p> The impact on industry has been quite dramatic.  At European level, steel, chemicals and non-ferrous metals have been very much affected.  I used to work in the non-ferrous metals sector in aluminium production for about six years - 50% of that industry has shut down since this crisis began.  To restart an aluminium smelter costs between &euro;200 million and &euro;400 million.  When you close one, it is quite a big deal.  Generally, it does not re-open.  The reason for that is the price increase.  If you are an aluminium smelter in Spain who was paying &euro;30 per megawatt hour two years ago and now you are paying over &euro;300, then you are losing almost &euro;2 million a week.  That puts things into context.  Electricity is 40% of costs for these industries.</p><p> I will now discuss what we have done at EU level.  Two main things have been done: we have the REPowerEU strategy and a series of emergency interventions.  The REPowerEU strategy was published in June as a reaction to the Russian invasion in February.  It has three main pillars, the first of which is to reduce demand.  We are going to try to reduce gas demand by 15% and electricity demand by 10%.  This is quite a challenge.  To put it into context, during Covid-19, when everything shut down, we only managed to reduce electricity demand by 8% to 9%; 10% is a major reduction.  For consumers, behavioural campaigns are the best way to go.  We need to raise awareness among consumers.  For industries, we need to have incentives to reduce their production.  </p><p> The second element is the need for a big increase in renewables.  That is the smart way to go.  The Commission said that we need 732 GW of wind or solar by 2030; these are ginormous numbers.  To achieve that, we need two things.  We need increased permitting and to sort out the bottlenecks in the supply chains.  I am not an expert on the Irish market, but I think both of these also apply to Ireland.  The final thing is diversifying supplies.  We are building more LNG capacity terminals, but these things take time.  We have gotten a lot of LNG from the US since the crisis began, but we will not have enough for this or next winter.  The other thing we have done is come up with a series of emergency mechanisms, the first of which is transferring money from companies to vulnerable consumers.  We need to protect the most vulnerable; that is important.  We also put a cap on the price that can be charged of &euro;180 per MWh.  Our concern is that it is not EU-wide.  One rule is needed for the entire EU.  Different patchworks among member states is not good.  There is also a solidarity tax from the oil and gas sector, which basically says that 33% of their profits should be taxed and redistributed.</p><p> On the outlook, I must be honest and say that this is a big crisis and one we expect to last not just for this winter but also next winter.  Gas reserves are full at 91% at European level, but these reserves were filled with Russian gas.  Next winter, we will not have that option.  We expect two tough winters with high prices.  In the medium term, the outlook is much better.  If we can have a big buildout of renewables like the Commission is pushing for, that will make a massive difference.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I am speaking from a very wet, windy and blustery County Cork.  I will give a short summary of my opening statement.  Ireland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant countries in Europe with fossil fuels meeting just over 86% of our energy supply in 2021, 77% of which was imported.  We are currently spending over &euro;1 million every hour on importing fossil fuels like oil and gas into the State.  The cost of this massive reliance on imported fossil fuels is now reflected in the prices we pay to heat our homes, fuel our cars and power our appliances.  While Ireland&rsquo;s energy and climate policy is strongly influenced by that of Europe, our delivery of fuels like oil and gas is also impacted very much by what happens in the UK.  Ireland&rsquo;s geographical position on the periphery of Europe with no direct physical infrastructure connecting to other EU member states means that while we look to the EU for policy, we must also look to the UK for partnership in energy-related matters, especially in relation to natural gas.</p> <p>  Natural gas is an important fuel in Ireland.  It heats over 700,000 homes and businesses and generates over half of our electricity.  Over the next decade, the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan to reduce the pollution from greenhouse gases means we will use less gas on aggregate - about 40% less - in 2030, but there will be individual days when we will use more, especially when heating and power demand are high and generation from renewables like wind and solar is low.  To understand gas security, it is important to distinguish between a physical interruption, where an importing pipeline is cut off, and a price risk, where gas is available but becomes expensive.  Given our reliance on gas for energy, a physical disruption in supply from the UK into Ireland for any long period of time would be catastrophic, whereas a price disruption, which we are experiencing right now, results in extremely high prices of gas, rather than a physical interruption.  While Ireland is not physically connected via pipelines to Russia, we are connected via prices and we see the consequences of Russian actions in our heating and electricity bills, which are passed through on European and global markets.  The challenge of building gas infrastructure with the objective of enhancing energy security while at the same time reducing gas consumption with the objective of meeting climate targets is a new paradigm for policymakers in Ireland and across other EU member states.</p> <p>  Our analysis in University College Cork undertaken on behalf of the Electricity Association of Ireland shows that renewables such as wind and solar are by far the best way for Ireland to reduce its emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.  They do this because they reduce the use of fossil fuels in power stations, but importantly, they do not replace the need for conventional power stations, which will remain for the next ten to 15 years especially during times of calm weather over north-west Europe.  Decisions on building infrastructure to increase national energy security are complex because they involve value judgments of an uncertain future where large investment decisions must be made with imperfect information.  What is clear is that all options to increase energy security in Ireland must be considered and evaluated, but it is not clear which are most appropriate and which options can be future-proofed to align with decarbonisation goals.  All options for gas diversification and storage take time to deliver - two to three years at least.  In the short term energy conservation in Ireland and across Europe is key to enhancing energy security in Ireland.  A 10% reduction in national energy consumption delivers the same supply benefit as building 4,500 MW of wind, which would be like doubling today's wind capacity in the Republic of Ireland.  While there are certainly external dimensions and risks to energy security such as the war in Ukraine, there are also internal challenges that must be acknowledged, chiefly the lack of agility in planning, permitting, and delivery of energy projects in Ireland.</p> <p>  While Ireland is not physically connected via pipelines to Russia, we are connected via prices and we see the consequences of Russian actions in our heating and electricity bills which are passed through on European and global markets.

I acknowledge the large financial package and measures the Government has put in place to protect families and firms to help them manage this current energy crisis, but we have yet to deliver on a plan to mitigate against it.  We must take ownership and responsibility for our energy production in Ireland while being mindful of our European obligations and we must progress our continued co-operation with our good neighbours in the UK.  Ireland should play to its strengths as a country with large renewable potential.  We must also address weaknesses in planning and acknowledge that it will take decades to deploy these renewable resources.  We must prepare for an energy transition which is taking place against a backdrop of a volatile and uncertain future in Europe.  We must be mindful not to let long-term optimism on the real potential of offshore wind and fuels like hydrogen blind us to the short-term vulnerabilities of our energy supply.  Actions must be taken on national security options such as gas storage and demand conservation in parallel with a massive buildout of renewables and implementation of energy-efficiency measures.</p><p>Action must be taken on national security options such as gas storage and demand conservation in parallel with a massive build-out of renewables and implementation of energy-efficiency measures.  Ireland's energy security challenge is not the future.  It is the present and demands the highest level of political focus possible.  These will be our insurance policies as we transition away from fossil fuels towards the goal of a clean, sustainable energy future.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. O'Donoghue and relates to how this crisis fits into the aims and objectives of the European Green Deal.  Is this a crisis that can be exploited to reach net zero emissions by 2050?</p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Deane about the Irish situation.  The Irish regulatory authority is the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  I have heard it said that perhaps the CRU needs more powers - excuse the pun - especially in the area of reduction of demand, which is what the European Union is endeavouring to achieve with the regulation.  Does the CRU need more powers to deal with this unprecedented crisis?</p> <p>  My third question, on the development of offshore wind energy, is also for Dr. Deane.  How is Ireland doing in that regard?  It appears it is not doing particularly well at the moment.  Is Dr. Deane satisfied that plans are in place to ramp up the production of offshore wind energy?  I will also ask a related question about the European regulation of gas storage capacity.  Dr. Deane dealt with it in his opening statement.  Will he expand on the Irish position on gas storage capacity and what we need to do about it?</p> <p>  The message that both Dr. Deane and Mr. O'Donoghue have delivered is sobering in that this crisis will last this and next winter.  We can take some consolation from the fact that the outlook is a little better in the medium term.</p> <p>  Those are my initial questions.  If either of the witnesses wants to answer all the questions, that is also fine.</p></speech>

The question was what this means for the European Green Deal.  Will it be a step back?  The opposite is the case.  Electrification and decarbonisation will be accelerated but in the immediate short term coal usage will increase this winter.  As regards power reduction, there has been a slight increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector, which is not good but the general trajectory is positive.  We expect electricity generation will be decarbonised by 2040.  We are going in the right direction although coal usage will increase slightly this winter for security of supply reasons.</p> <p>  At European level, the ambition has increased since the Green Deal was agreed in June 2021.  In June 2022, the REPowerEU strategy was issued and that is more ambitious.  We have increased renewables targets to between 40% and 45%.  We have also increased the target for the number of heat pumps and aim to have 20 million tonnes of hydrogen fuel in Europe by 2030.  In reaction to this crisis, we observe more energy independence and increased ambition on tackling climate change.</p></speech>

I do not believe so.  We need to be more agile.  This is not a criticism focused only on the CRU, but rather across all institutions working on energy provision in Ireland, whether they work on planning, processing or permitting.  We need to display a level of agility.  When I reflect on the last crisis, the Covid-19 crisis, and the remarkable job we all did in responding to that, in particular the Government, I note the level of agility and urgency was unprecedented.  We took actions that were commensurate with the urgency of the crisis.  We are not seeing that agility at the moment.  The energy system is a little different as there is much more inertia in the system and permitting challenges are real.</p> <p>  The CRU does not need more power.  Typically, if the CRU demands reductions in the electricity or gas sectors, it yields power through prices.  It sends price signals to consumers and, as Mr. O'Donoghue said, we know those price signals work.  We must acknowledge the pain in those price signals if we want people to reduce consumption.  Whether it is industry, commercial use or residential sectors, some level of burden sharing and pain will be involved.  The CRU has mechanisms at its disposal to exert influence through pricing.</p> <p>  Ireland used to be a leader in offshore wind.  In the early 2000s, Ireland built one of the first offshore wind farms in the world, the Arklow bank.  We were once a leader in this area and unfortunately we are now at the back of the pack.  We have not built any offshore wind farms since.  There is an expectation in the industry that the next offshore wind farm will not be delivered until after 2025 and many believe it will be 2027 or 2028.  That is disappointing when one considers the timeline, the resource we have in Ireland, the crisis, our reliance on fossil fuels and how much we are spending on them every single hour.  I mentioned that &euro;1 million is leaving the State and going to companies around the world, while we have a rich resource on our doorstep and on our shores that we are not quick enough to exploit.</p> <p>  The potential for performance in offshore wind energy is real and the magnitude is massive.  It is not just about producing energy but also about providing meaningful jobs, reducing our emissions, increasing our resilience and robustness as a society and becoming more responsible for our energy production.  The energy production in Ireland for the past few decades has essentially been outsourced to other countries such as the United Kingdom, Norway and the United States.  Those are the countries that produce most of the energy we use in Ireland.  We need to take economic and environmental responsibility for our energy production and the great assets we have are our wind, both on and offshore, and even solar power.  Our agricultural and farming communities also have huge potential to generate energy and as households we all have huge potential to save energy.  In short, our offshore wind story is disappointing.  We were once a leader but we are now at the back of the pack and that is disappointing when one considers the resources available here.</p> <p>  Ireland is relatively unique in comparison with other EU member states in not having any gas storage capacity.  We used to have the Kinsale Head gas field which had the ability to store a limited amount of gas but it was important.  Gas storage would be fundamentally important if there was a physical interruption of gas supply from the UK to Ireland.  We get a little gas from the Corrib gas field, which meets about 25% of our annual gas needs.  Unfortunately, that is dwindling and we will become more reliant on the UK for the transit of gas into this country.  Most of the gas comes in via two undersea pipelines.  If anything happened to those pipelines, it would be catastrophic, especially over a long period.  Gas storage would help to mitigate that risk.  The Government has launched a consultation process energy security to consider the gas storage option and options for liquid natural gas, LNG.  We need to consider and evaluate those options to understand which of them is best suited to Ireland's needs but also to our long-term decarbonisation goals.</p><p>Once we decide which one it is, we need to act with agility.  As Mr. O'Donoghue said, this crisis will not go away over the next couple of years.  It will endure.  We will have a hard winter next winter and Ireland will continue to have that exposure to fossil fuels.  The crisis we are seeing at the moment is an energy crisis, but at its core it is a fossil fuel crisis.  As Ireland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant countries in the world, we need to do everything to reduce our reliance to that exposure.</p></speech>

I am quite shocked to hear this morning that we may expect this to last for another year.  The public will be very disappointed to hear that this crisis is going to last that length of time and possibly even longer.  I have a number of questions.  My first question is for Mr. O'Donoghue.  Many European countries such as France rely on nuclear power as their main source of energy.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue give a brief overview of the role that he sees nuclear power playing in Europe's energy policy, both in the medium and long terms?  Does he think more countries are likely to become reliant on nuclear power due to the war in Ukraine?</p> <p>  The cost of gas is increasing, largely due to the war in Ukraine.  In addition to being one of the biggest exporters of gas, Russia is also one of the world's biggest exporters of uranium.  Uranium prices are likely to go up in the same way that gas has.  I would like Mr. O'Donoghue's view on that.</p> <p>  Ireland is investing heavily in wind energy.  Our Government, under the Green Party, is hoping that wind can become our main source of energy.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue comment on this energy policy?  I visited Derrybrien wind farm last week with a number of my Independent colleagues, including Senator McDowell.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue discuss his views on the decommissioning of Derrybrien wind farm, which is responsible for approximately 1% of Ireland's wind energy, during this energy crisis?  There are 70 turbines there.  They would provide energy for up to around 50,000 homes at this time.  At a time when our Minister for energy is telling us all to have five-minute showers, it makes a mockery of the proposed green energy future to have 70 turbines in Derrybrien not turning.  I would like Mr. O'Donoghue's views on that.</p> <p>  Ireland is investing heavily in wind energy.  Our Government, under the Green Party, is hoping that wind can become our main source of energy.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue please comment on this energy policy?  I visited Derrybrien wind farm last week with a number of my Independent colleagues, including Senator Michael McDowell.  Could Mr. O'Donoghue discuss his views on the decommissioning of Derry farm which is responsible for maybe 1% of Ireland's wind energy during this energy crisis?  There are 70 turbines there. T hey would provide energy for up to around 50,000 homes at this time, at a time when our Minister for energy is telling us all to have five-minute showers and we have 70 turbines in Derrybrien not turning it just makes a mockery of the green energy future we are proposing to have.  I would like Mr. O'Donoghue's views on that.</p> <p>  I believe Dr. Deane is a supporter of small fission nuclear reactors.  I think he spoke about that on Newstalk in June 2021.  Does he think there is a future and a place for a small fission nuclear reactor in Ireland?  I know the Energy Regulation Act 1999 would need to be amended.  As legislators, we have to look at the challenges that must be overcome if we are to adapt to nuclear power.  Maybe that is something Dr. Deane could speak to as well.  What are the challenges we would face as politicians?  How practical does Dr. Deane think it is for Ireland to rely on wind as its main source of renewable energy?  Would it be more or less practical, in his view, to build nuclear power stations or import nuclear power from abroad?  We are already importing some from the UK and from France at this moment in time.  I would also like Dr. Deane's views on the Derrybrien wind farm situation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.257" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#D00500"><p>I thank the Senator for her three questions, which relate to nuclear, to uranium and to offshore wind.  I was quite open and honest when I said that I see this crisis lasting.  I think we need to be clear.  We must communicate to citizens that it is something which will probably last at least 18 months.</p> <p>   The Senator asked about nuclear power and the outlook in Europe.  Nuclear is a very sensitive issue across Europe.  It is very different among member states.  In the past year, we have seen something of a renaissance in terms of the pro-nuclear countries.  Before the election in France, Mr. Macron said that he wants a big build-out of new nuclear plants.  Sweden has recently said the same thing.  A new nuclear plant in Finland was finally inaugurated and opened last month.  I expect there to be an uptake in demand for nuclear, depending on the member state.  We need to be conscious that large-scale nuclear new builds are quite expensive at the moment.  At Hinkley Point C, the strike price was &pound;92.50 per megawatt hour.  I think that was in 2011, although I might have the dates a bit wrong.  It was about ten years ago.  With inflation, that goes to over &pound;100.  That is quite expensive.  The issue we see is that new-build nuclear is quite expensive.  When it comes to base load sources of decarbonised power, you basically have nuclear or hydro power, and hydro power is based on geographical endowments.  Hydro has to be located close to certain geographical endowments.  Wind and solar with battery is another option but, again, that is an intermittent supply which needs to be balanced out.  We expect nuclear to increase in the role.  It is important to understand that electricity demand in general is going to increase dramatically.  We expect an increase in demand by 2050 - it will probably double - which means that even if the share of nuclear in the energy mix stays the same, the quantity of nuclear that we will produce will increase.  </p> <p>  I will speak on small modular reactors, SMRs.  This is a new technology but it has some potential.  I am oversimplifying here but the idea is that it is a bit like an iPhone.  By mass-producing this product - the nuclear SMR - you make it much cheaper.  I was recently at the international electricity summits which were attended by representatives from USA, Japan, Canada and Australia.  There was a big focus on SMRs and the potential we see there.  We have to see how it develops but I think it has a lot of potential.  That is something which is the subject of a lot of interest in the industry.</p> <p>  The uranium market is relatively diversified.  The biggest producer is now Kazakhstan, which has overtaken Russia.  The market is largely diversified.  The only issue is for countries that are reliant on Russia.  Certain plants in eastern Europe are reliant on Russian fuel and on what are called cakes, or nuclear rods, from Russia.  It is hard to transition to non-Russian sources, particularly in countries like Slovakia and in the case of one of the reactors in the Czech Republic.  There is about three years of supply there, but being able to switch to non-Russian sources is a bit of a challenge.  They have three years to find a solution but it is a challenge.  For new builds, however, there are many uranium sources.  That is not an issue.</p> <p>  I am not an expert on the offshore wind situation in Ireland but I would say that offshore wind tends to make a lot of sense.  In Ireland there is a target of 7 GW of offshore wind.  It makes sense to support that strategy.  Many member states cannot go for offshore wind projects.  The two big obstacles are permitting and supply chains.  We need to speed up permitting.  At EU level, we are trying to pass legislation which will basically come with go-to areas for nuclear builds.  This will ensure that projects can only be slowed down for a maximum of two years.  We are in a strange situation because projects take seven to ten years to get planning permission and less than two years to build.  That is not correct.  We need to find a solution there.  The second thing is supply chains.  A lot of the big companies that supply wind components are not doing very well and some are losing money.  I refer to companies like Siemens and Vestas.  We need to find solutions so that we have the components because they are getting very expensive.  That is also linked to raw materials.  The prices of the raw materials we use for windmills - steel and copper, etc. - have gone up.  Although we should definitely go for offshore wind, we need to find solutions to those two challenges.</p></speech>

Respectfully, I cannot answer questions on the Derrybrien project because unfortunately I do not know enough about it.  I know very little about it, so I apologise.</p> <p>  I would respond to the Senator's questions about nuclear power by saying that I am a supporter of any decarbonisation option.  It is not so much that I am a fan of nuclear power, but that I do not like what the science of climate change is telling us.  It is very serious.  In a country like Ireland that is so reliant on fossil fuels, we need to keep our minds open to all options to help us to reduce that reliance, no matter how socially or politically unpopular they may be.  Nuclear is one of those options.  We need to manage our expectations around nuclear.  Traditional nuclear plants like Hinkley Point in the UK, or the large nuclear plants they have in France, would not be suitable for Ireland in terms of its size.  As Mr. O'Donoghue mentioned, there would also be issues in terms of the build-out time.  It would take way too long.  The SMR type of nuclear technology that has been discussed may or may not be suitable for Ireland, but again we need to manage our expectations around that.  These reactors are conceptual at the moment.  They are not commercially available.</p><p>Looking at the different peer-reviewed and scientific literature they may not be available until 2030 or 2035.  That is at least one or two decades away.  That is too far for the current energy crisis.  We should keep our minds open, and an eye on that technology, but it is very far away and again we should not let the long-term optimism of that technology blind us to the vulnerabilities we have in the short term.  We should keep our minds open on that technology, but the technology needs to be proved commercially viable and, more important, to be socially safe before we start looking at it in Ireland.  Wind energy is our greatest strength.  We do not have massive fossil fuel reserves in Ireland.  We do not have large hydro resources as they have in Scandinavia.  We do not have a huge nuclear tradition as they have in France.  What we have in Ireland is lots of weather.  We have lots of wind and reasonable amounts of sunshine.  We have a huge offshore resource.  It is our greatest strength in Ireland, so it makes a lot of sense to tap into that strength.</p><p> In terms of our overall energy supply, wind will do a lot of the heavy lifting in future.  It will get us most of the way there in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, but it will not get us all of the way there.  We need to acknowledge that there will be days, often ten days or even a number of weeks, when wind speeds will be low.  We will have dark periods, whether it be night-time or winter time when we will need to look at some form of strategic or seasonable storage of energy or electricity in Ireland.  There are a number of options such as decarbonised gases like hydrogen, but again I caution that this is a decade or two away.  At the moment we are still 86% reliant on fossil fuels in Ireland.  We need to have a massive build out of renewables before we get to any kind of serious thinking around the strategic need for energy or electricity storage in Ireland.  Our studies in UCC have demonstrated when we simulated lots of different futures on the energy and power system in Ireland that wind can do a lot of the heavy lifting.  However, it is going to need something else to step into the breach when it is just not windy and the weather is not there, particularly across north-west Europe.  I hope those have answered the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Haughey that what they have told us is frightening.  I do not think most of us in the Oireachtas are aware of the scale of what has been outlined.  Mr. O'Donoghue is taking more of a high level European view and, therefore, I want to ask about the REpowerEU plan that was announced to deal with the war in Ukraine and imports of Russian gas.  If we are looking to reduce our demand by 15% but we import 40%, how are we planning to deal with that?  It does not look like the numbers add up.  Are we relying heavily on renewables increasing in the short term?  Are we relying heavily on demand reduction, given it is difficult to calculate how much we can achieve?  I think he said 5% was challenging but doable, which seems like a small amount even at that rate.  Can he elaborate on hedging and how he sees that playing out in the next 12 to 18 months?  I was aware that a lot of the energy was bought in advance, but I think it is still misunderstood as to how that will impact on consumer prices in the next year to 18 months.</p> <p>  I would like ask Dr. Deane about the Irish situation.  According to the figures he outlined, it is quite embarrassing that we still rely on fossil fuels to the level of 86%.  It is even worse and almost negligent that we are still importing those volumes of fossil fuels at the cost of &euro;1 million every hour.  It is disgraceful we are still at that point.  With regard to the Corrib gas field, which I acknowledge is on the decline, is there any other potential there?  What is the short-term solution for gas storage?  What can be done in the next 12 months to try to address that issue?  I was also struck by what was said about there being no mitigation plan against the energy crisis.  We are reacting and throwing money at it, for want of a better phrase, for the next while.  What kind of mitigation plan would Dr. Deane put in place in Ireland?  What should we ask the Minister with responsibility for energy to do in the next 12 months?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#E00500"><p>I thank the Senator.  There were two questions for me.  The first was about the replacement of Russian gas supply and demand, and the second was about hedging.  The Senator's analysis is correct in terms of supply and demand.  Traditionally, we received 40% of our gas from Russia, which was 155 to 170 bcm.  We are now getting 9%.  Approximately 150 bcm needs to be replaced.  It is quite tricky to reduce demand.  With gas we will try 15% and with electricity we will try 10%, but that still will not bring down the curve enough.  We are hoping that a milder winter will mitigate the situation, but we are trying to get more gas in via LNG.  In particular we have the idea of using floating terminals, also known as FSRUs, which are used in certain member states.  For example, there is a joint project between Estonia and Lithuania to at least get minimum gas in for this winter.  It takes a year or longer to build a LNG terminal, but that is something we will try and build out.  However, the Senator's analysis is correct and that is what I am flagging for this winter.  The supply and demand curves just do not match.  The demand is inelastic and hard to reduce.  It is also hard to get new supply on board.  That is the challenge.  We hope that France, which traditionally exported 10 GW of electricity but is now importing 10 GW, will quickly get back up nuclear plants that are currently down.  There is a big push in France to do that.  We hope that the weather is suitable as well.</p> <p>  Hedging is a normal strategy in the electricity sector.  We see from the current crisis that it creates winners and losers.  I will speak both to the consumer perspective and then the electricity producer perspective and will use the example of the aluminium sector in which I worked for six years.  If consumers are hedged and, therefore, have bought electricity for the next 15 years at a set price of &euro;30 per MWh, they are not affected by the high prices now.  They are only paying &euro;30 instead of &euro;500, which is the price to which some hours have gone.  They are making a lot of profit as they are hedged.  From the other side of the coin, if a company is a supplier and has to sell this electricity for &euro;30 per MWh, even if buying it at a much higher price from Russia, then it is losing money and some companies are going bust.  That is how hedging works.  They buy out in the time ahead and it creates winners and losers.  I will give one example from Germany.  A large German company had a long-term contract for Russian gas.  It has to sell its electricity at a certain price to its customers.  The Russian gas, which was at a set price, was cut off.  It then had to buy from the market at an extremely high price, but has to sell to its customer at the agreed price, which is hedged.  It made a huge loss, because it is buying gas from the spot market at an extremely high price but is locked in to sell to its customer at a low price.  The state had to intervene to find solutions to alleviate that problem.  That is how hedging works, and I hope I have explained it well enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Deane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#E00700"><p>I thank the Senator for those questions.  With regard to our reliance on fossil fuel, I agree it is incredibly disappointing and there is a low awareness of that right among the public.  We tell the world we are green and clean, but we are not.  We are one of the most fossil fuel reliant countries in Europe.  The main source of fossil fuel in Ireland is oil, and after that it is natural gas.  As I said, we are now spending an incredible &euro;1 million every hour importing those fuels.  I am reflecting while looking out the window here in west Cork, and when considering the wind and waves and the natural resources we have in this country, it is a terrible indictment.  We could even include farms.  I am looking out at some small farms.  Our small farmers and rural communities have the ability to produce our own renewable gas, particularly farmers who are looking for an exit strategy from farming sectors that are not financially productive.  We could produce approximately 15% of our natural gas needs from our land by 2030, if we put a good focus on it.  Not only would that meet some of our future natural gas needs, it would also help those rural communities and farmers who are struggling.  It would give them different options to use their land for something more financially viable.  It is disappointing and a terrible indictment.  We came out of the previous energy crisis in the 1970s and 1980s and we were approximately 90% reliant on fossil fuels.</p><p> Today we are about 86% reliant on fossil fuels.  What has changed since then is that now we have the technologies.  We know we can produce huge amounts of electricity from onshore and offshore wind farms and from solar farms.  We know we can save huge amounts of energy from our homes and from our transportation system.  It is not that we do not know what to do.  We know what we have to do and we have the technologies.  That is important.  </p><p> To address the question of the idea of a plan, we have put in place some very generous financial measures and means for families that are struggling at the moment.  That is necessary, particularly to ensure that those on the lowest incomes get the highest level of financial protection.  That is a short-term plan and we need to think more in the long term.  We have a number of policy instruments and policy packages that tend to be operational.  We have a national development plan and a climate action plan.  We have different plans around healthcare and transport but what is really needed is an integrated plan to make the most of our energy resources.  Norway for example, has done an incredible job in harnessing the potential of its offshore resources which are oil and gas.  For Ireland it would be onshore and offshore wind.  We must look at how Norway uses that resource, not just to earn money for companies but to improve society.  People are put at the centre of that resource potential.  The resource is used to develop the education and healthcare systems.  This is important because we do not just need an energy plan in Ireland, we need a plan for our wider society.  Energy does not just stop at the end of a cable or at the end of a pipeline.  It comes into our communities; it affects our physical and mental health and affects us in many more ways.  We are seeing those impacts at the moment through high prices right across society.  I would call for a wider masterplan in how we use our natural resources and how we harness that potential.  This is not just to make us energy independent and to move away from fossil fuels, although that is fundamentally important, but also how we can use it to enable other societal developments which are important for us in the same way that Norway has done around its healthcare, education systems and infrastructure.  Looking to other countries for ideas on how we develop those resources is fundamentally important.  It is not just about energy.  It is about people and communities and it is about having a coherent plan that allows everybody to come on board as we move away from fossil fuels.</p><p> On the Corrib gas field, today, this field meets about 25% of our annual gas demand but it is dwindling.  We will become more and more reliant on the physical infrastructure we use to import natural gas from the UK into Ireland.  As I have mentioned, the Government has a consultation process on energy security at the moment.  This process looks at a number of options, such as floating offshore energy which would be State owned and strategic gas storage, either onshore or offshore.  Demand-side measures are also being looked at but we need to temper our expectations.  A lot of those measures will take three to four years or longer to achieve in terms of implementation, permits and delivery.</p><p> In the short term, the most powerful thing we can all do is conserve energy.  I appreciate this is often politically and socially unpopular.  Encouraging people and giving them information on how they can save energy at home, in the office, in schools and universities is fundamentally important.  Unfortunately, some of these ideas get ridiculed within the media but it is no laughing matter for a lot of families out there.  Yes, taking shorter showers is an idea that is often socially unpalatable but electric showers are one of the appliances that use most electricity in an Irish home.  They use between &euro;400 to &euro;500 worth of electricity per year for a typical Irish house.  Empowering consumers, families and communities on options to reduce our reliance on and our exposure to these prices is something that is necessary.  I appreciate the political difficulties of this but we are in a very serious situation here.  </p><p> As Mr. O'Donoghue and I have outlined, this crisis is not going to go away.  The measures we need to put in place will take time but time is not on our side.  We need to act now.  One of the most pragmatic things that can be done, and I acknowledge that it will not be politically popular, is to give people information on how to reduce their energy use.  That increases our resilience in terms of security of supply and it reduces people's energy bills for electricity, transport and heating.  That is fundamentally important.  It should be our goal in the short term until we find a line of sight out of this current energy crisis. </p></speech>

I missed some of the presentations at the beginning.  From what I have heard, I am not sure if that is good or bad.  I have heard enough in the meantime to have loads of questions and if they have already been asked, please ignore them.  I will address the first question to Mr. O'Donoghue.  At the meeting on 25 October the energy ministers will look at a number of measures.  These include a new pricing benchmark to limit prices, joint procurement of energy reserves and the EU supporting energy supplies in Ukraine and Moldova.  I would like Mr. O'Donoghue to elaborate on each of those points, especially on some kind of new pricing benchmark to limit prices.  In regard to joint procurement of energy reserves, are we bidding against one another as it is.  What is the current situation?  There is also talk of a one-off, windfall tax which Mr. O'Donoghue might be able to elaborate on.  My other question is around the European Green Deal.  He spoke about increased ambition on heat pumps and hydrogen usage.  Perhaps that could be elaborated on and the practical steps that could be taken might be outlined.</p> <p>  This is for both of the witnesses.  In the area of farming energy; bio-digesters, small turbines and solar panels, what is the Green Deal saying and doing to promote these?  Dr. Deane said that the challenge for Ireland's energy security is the present not the future.  That is the kind of thing that strikes fear into the hearts of everyone.  Dr. Deane is talking about this winter and the next.  We have already looked at some immediate short-term measures; perhaps the witnesses would like to elaborate on any of those.</p> <p>  I want to go back to the issue of saving energy.  Dr. Deane mentioned earlier that it was unpopular but I actually think that it is not as unpopular as he may think.  From my conversations with people I find that they are interested in how they can save energy.  The crucial aspect is how that information is presented.  If it is presented by Ministers as a means of getting the Government off the hook for policy failure or inaction or whatever word one wants to use, then people are not interested.  It needs to be presented as a solution for families and businesses.  I was in with my hairdresser on Monday and he was speaking about the fact that he is now checking on the immersion.  He is asking how many people are booked in.  He is checking the amount of energy he is using.  He is going around switching off the lights like everyone else, but he is specifically looking at his business, as many households are at the moment, to see how they can save energy because people cannot afford their energy bills.  How the message is delivered is crucial.  I think we delivered it in the most inappropriate way to begin with.  It is really hard to go back from that but that is the responsibility of all of us.  </p> <p>  My second question refers to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities.  Deputy Haughey already asked whether this body needs more power and the answer was "No" but what about the issue of standing charges?  The CRU cannot deal with this issue.  It is an absolute rip-off.  We need to look at legislation so that the CRU certainly has a role to play there.  I would like to get the witnesses' comments on this.</p> <p>  Reference was also made to there being no gas storage facility in Ireland and that if there was an interruption in supply from the UK that it could be catastrophic.  We know that anything can happen.  It is not likely, but we know that it is possible.  As far as gas storage options are concerned, what are those options that can be brought on board as soon as possible?</p><p>What is the shortest amount of time before we have meaningful gas storage options that would contribute?  Do the witnesses have any comments on the LNG terminal at Shannon?  I will understand if they do not.  I was concerned when Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue spoke about the winter ahead.  He said that they are hoping for a mild winter and that France can ramp up its production of electricity.  That strikes fear into me because it seems as if we are in a position where there is very little we can do in the short term.  Will the witnesses share their thoughts on very short-term measures other than saving energy?  As I said, that is crucial and we need to revamp the message we are giving people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.269" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#G00200"><p>I thank Deputy Harkin.  I think there are three questions; the first is about the emergency mechanism discussions on 25 October, the second is about the windfall tax and the third is about hydrogen and heat pumps.<br/><br/>Three things will be discussed on 25 October.  Gas price caps would have made more sense if we had done them earlier in the process.  It is quite technical - the price of gas is linked to the title transfer facility, TTF, which is the hub.  It is a fluctuating price.  Before ten years ago, gas was linked to oil via oil indexation.  Now, it is linked to the TTF hub, which means that when the price at the TTF, which was &euro;15 to &euro;20 traditionally, goes to &euro;300 or &euro;150, the revenues of exporters such as Russia and Norway and, to some extent, Algeria increase dramatically.  Russia has made a huge amount of money since the war began, as a result of this pricing mechanism.  If the price of pipeline gas had been capped early in the process, much of the revenue which accrued to the Russian state could have been reduced.  It would have also helped to reduce electricity prices.  I am referring to pipeline gas.  LNG is different.  Like oil, it is a global market, so the exporter can say no.  With pipeline gas, there was some consumer market power to ask for a lower price.  It would still have been higher than usual, but there was some scope.  Gas price caps make sense if they are well designed and do not undermine security of supply.  This is something that should perhaps have been considered earlier in the process.<br/><br/>Another issue is joint procurement.  In the interest of European solidarity, it is good to have some joint procurement processes.  Traditionally, the European Commission or any European entity is not designed to buy gas.  It is a bit like the position with Covid-19 vaccines - we are not set up for that.  Usually, it is done by companies.  In the interest of solidarity, we need some mechanism to be put in place.  That is being set up now.  I cannot comment on the rush for gas between member states;  I am a member of a European association so I must be sensitive in what I say.  We need to show solidarity.  There are concerns in internal energy markets that some potential go-it-alone strategies by member states could undermine this solidarity.  It will be a test this winter.  It is very important that we stay together.  That applies not just to the purchase of gas but to exports of electricity also.  In the internal electricity market, IEM, electricity flows where it is best to flow.  It is important that it stays open.  If some member states say they are not going to export electricity because they want to give it to their citizens locally, that is not good.  It should be avoided.  It is not something that just relates to Ireland, it relates to all member states.  Some member states are saying that they want to prioritise their own citizens this winter if there is not enough electricity.<br/><br/>The final question was about the new pricing benchmark.  The reference in Europe is the TTF, which is the title transfer in the Netherlands.  People are noting that the prices for LNG are much lower in the Asian market compared to Europe.  They are asking why we are not investigating the use of an alternative benchmark to the TTF, such as the Asian benchmark, and adding a premium on top to get the supply to Europe.  That would entail using the east Asian benchmark, hypothetically, and adding 10% to outbid east Asia.  If a shipment is coming from Qatar and it can go to either east Asia or Europe and it will get 10% more in Europe, that might work for LNG.  It is starting now but will take a few months to set up.  It might make sense.  There was a lot of manipulation between the TTF and Russia, which got a lot of revenue from that.<br/><br/>The second issue asked about was the idea of a windfall tax.  We cannot do a tax at the European level.  As the Deputy will know, tax is the competence of member states and is important for Ireland.  As a member state, we have certain taxation arrangements which the EU cannot touch because it is not an EU competence.  We came up with an inframarginal revenue cap of &euro;180 per <font color="#202124">MWh</font>.  A tax cannot be retroactive.  There needs to be some visibility of where we are going.  The inframarginal tax was a kind of compromise but it is not the ideal solution.  There probably needs to be some redistribution.  There is a solidarity contribution from the oil and gas sector.  It is important to understand that the oil and gas sector are the ones making the real profits, rather than the electricity sector, which is very different.  That is represented in the company share prices.  If you look at the share prices for oil and gas majors, they have really gone up since the beginning of the crisis.  That is not the case in the electricity sector.  It is important to distinguish between electricity and oil and gas.<br/><br/>The other issue was about REPowerEU and hydrogen and heat pumps.  On hydrogen, we have an objective of 20 million tonnes by 2030.  It is very ambitious.  It is a very nascent industry.  We are trying to get 10 million tonnes from Europe and 10 million tonnes imported, particularly from north Africa.  That is the objective; we will have to see how that goes.  We need to get these projects up and running as soon as possible.  We all know that heat pumps make a lot of sense.  Many of the obstacles are at the local and household level.  I do not think as a member of a European association that I am best placed to comment, as the obstacles are more of a local issue.  As Dr. Deane said with regard to savings this winter, it is important that politicians communicate to consumers that anything they can do to reduce their consumption is much appreciated.  Campaigns on behavioural change will help a lot.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Deane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#G00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman and Deputy Harkin.  To pick up on Mr. O'Donoghue's point, the Deputy is spot on.  How we deliver the message and who delivers the message are fundamentally important.  When you step back and think about it, it is about showing people how to reduce their energy consumption, rather than telling them.  That nuance is fundamentally important.  I agree with the Deputy that there is an appetite out there.  It is frustrating, disappointing and a little sad when I see many people in my own community spending a lot of time plugging out things like phone chargers and televisions, which is not very impactful.  For example, if you were to leave the television screen the committee is using to see me on standby for a full year, it would probably use between &euro;5 and &euro;10 worth of electricity, which is not impactful.  Things like tumble dryers, washing machines and home heating are significant areas that can allow us to reduce our energy use, bearing in mind that many of those things are not suitable for the elderly or vulnerable.  They are primarily suited to families who are fit, able and healthy.  This is also part of the messaging in carving out the families that this information should go to and how it can be delivered.  It is fundamentally important.  UCC's analysis showed that just five appliances in our homes use about half of our electricity.  Those are typically things that heat something up or cool something down.  That should be the national focus for families to keep on top of.  We also need to keep an eye on our driving and home heating.  The home heating point should be prefaced by the fact that it is only suitable for families who are fit, healthy and able.  The vulnerable and elderly probably cannot save much more, as they are already struggling and incredibly lean in their overall energy use, which also needs to be considered.</p><p>I cannot answer about the standing charges set by the CRU because I unfortunately do not know enough about it.  Whatever about more powers, institutions such as the CRU, EirGrid, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and local county councils dealing with environmental planning need more people and resources.  When we consider the pipeline of energy projects that are waiting to be delivered and the workforce that has to process them, the two are at odds.  Powers are one thing.  People, or human resources, and increasingly  climate and energy literacy are fundamentally important across the public institutions to ensure the applications for permits can be processed at an appropriate speed for the crisis we are in.  The issue is not so much about railroading through planning decisions quickly - that cannot happen - but about making good decisions fast and a lot of people are needed for that.  In respect of gas-storage options, the previously mentioned consultation on energy security the Government is engaging in at the moment looks at a number of options including State-owned floating LNG and strategic gas storage.  The report states that floating offshore LNG storage is the option that would be the quickest to implement.  It would fully mitigate against a 30-day physical interruption of gas supply from the UK.  However, expectations on that need to be managed.</p><p> Floating LNG is a hot resource at the moment.  As Mr. O'Donoghue will attest, many other European countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Lithuania are looking at options for floating LNG facilities.  Many people are looking at this to increase their gas security diversity, but only there are only about 37 of these floating facilities in the world.  Ireland would have to challenge hard to get access.  Knowing the options is one thing, but how feasible or realisable that option is during the current energy crisis is difficult to understand.  We need to evaluate all the options from floating LNG storage, to offshore exploration, to onshore gas storage, while being mindful that these options are probably deliverable within a window of three or more years.  In the medium term the most fundamental action we can take is to encourage and inform people to take ownership of their energy consumption and help them to understand how to reduce it as much as possible.  We still need to be mindful that will not shield us from the energy crisis but it will blunt the edge of the blade a little.</p></speech>

I have met too many people who feel the responsibility is being put almost exclusively on their shoulders as the Government is unable to take any meaningful short-term measures.  Any message must be definite, "realisable"  - that is the word Dr. Deane used earlier about the floating offshore energy terminals - it must be doable and must have a timeframe.  If people receive both of those messages together it will make a difference, but when people feel the responsibility for most or all of this is being put on their shoulders it is not a good message.</p></speech>

I have been listening attentively to Dr. Deane and Mr. O'Donoghue and I thank them for their solid, if somewhat sobering, presentations as regards the grim reality we are all facing.  I will not delay.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for chairing in my absence.  I call Deputy Troy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#H00500"><p>I  will ask a couple of quick questions.  Considering our dependency on fossil fuels is at 86% and 75% of that is imported, will either of the witnesses indicate, at the time Ireland was permitted to use industrially harvested peat, what percentage of our energy was derived from our peat power stations?  Energy security for Ireland, as both speakers have been at pains to say, cannot be dealt with in isolation.  It is part of the energy security of Europe and while Ireland is wholly dependent on external factors, we have a major opportunity at this time to harness wind energy.</p> <p>  It is disappointing to hear that in the space of 20 years, we have gone from being a leader to being a laggard.  Some of that is down to NIMBYism, some is down to bad policy decisions and a lack of foresight, but given the energy crisis we are now in, what can be done to accelerate the generation of wind energy, especially offshore wind energy?  Mr. O'Donoghue stated that planning and permitting takes seven to ten years while construction only takes two years.  Surely we can do something at a European level to streamline the permitting and planning process in order to speed it up.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that as a country that is dependent on agriculture, 15% of our natural gas usage could be provided with what I presume is anaerobic digestion.  Correct me if I am wrong.  Solar power was not mentioned much today.  Perhaps the witnesses could explain what could be done to incentivise farmers to invest in anaerobic digestion and solar energy.  Mr. O'Donoghue stated the reserves are okay this year at 91%, but most of that is Russian gas and he is concerned about how we will maintain our reserves for 2023-2024.  Does he have any suggestions about how to address that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.277" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Deane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#H00700"><p>I thank Deputy Troy for his questions.  I do not have the figure for peat but I estimate it is likely to be in the low single digits.  Electricity accounts for about 20% of the energy we use in Ireland.  We often confuse energy and electricity.  If we look around our homes, offices and the room we are in at the moment we see that electricity is commonly used to power appliances.  However, outside our homes we see trucks, heating systems and large industry use oil and gas for heating and transport and these are the dominant vectors of energy.  Electricity accounts for about 20% and I estimate peat probably accounted for single digits as a percentage of our overall electricity production.</p> <p>  As the Deputy was speaking I was reflecting on the remarkable transition that utilities such as Bord na M&oacute;na have delivered in the midlands in transitioning away from peat and bringing on new energy sources such as onshore wind, anaerobic digestion and planning for hydrogen and different combustion fuels.  It is a cause of great hope as it demonstrates what can be done when people put their minds to it, there is a strong political focus, society has trust in those utilities and there is a strong social focus.  We should look to the transition in the midlands to give us optimism.  I acknowledge it has not always been easy.  People have encountered many difficulties and much hardship but the transition by Bord na M&oacute;na in the midlands from a solely brown producer of electricity to trying to be one of the largest green producers of electricity and energy, is a good example for Ireland and the rest of Europe about what can be done when we put our minds to it.</p> <p>  I will also bring in the agricultural dimension.  We have huge potential to grow energy, especially from anaerobic digestion as the Deputy mentioned.  We are brilliant at this in Ireland.  We grow silage.  We have large quantities of slurry.  When silage and slurry are put into a metal tank, a renewable gas is produced and that is what we need at the moment.  What farming families and communities need are options to diversify away from elements of farming that are unprofitable.  What is fundamentally important to realising anaerobic digestion is not the technology.  Countries such as Germany and Austria have thousands of digesters.</p><p>It is not technology; it is a strong stable policy.  If we are asking farming families and co-operatives to come on a journey with us to produce energy, the thing they would need most and crave most is a secure, stable and long-term policy.  That would mean that if they are to make this investment from using their land to produce food to using their land to produce fuel in different ways, they would need some element of financial cover because it is a large investment but also something that is necessary.  It is something that is not suitable for all elements of farming but it is something that should be explored and gives farming families options and allows us to be responsible for a lot more of our natural gas production in Ireland.</p><p> Coming back to the point I made in my opening statement, while we need to move away from fossil fuels in Ireland, they are not going to go away overnight.  Moving away from fossil fuels is a two to three decade transition.  We will need fossil fuels in 2020, 2030 and 2035 and producing those from indigenous sources in a responsible and sustainable way is something that is very important.</p><p> On the Deputy's final point about solar, we do not often think about Ireland as a very sunny place.  With the recent advances in solar technology, particularly the reductions in cost, coupled with the increases in electricity and energy prices we are seeing at the moment means, solar makes a lot of environmental, social and economic sense in Ireland.  We recently did a study for the Irish Solar Energy Association where we looked at the potential for residential solar production in Ireland.  We counted the household roofs that could be used in a meaningful way to produce their own electricity and we found that about half of the homes in Ireland are very suitable for solar panels.  For example, if a family in Dublin put six or seven solar panels on their roof, they would reduce their electricity bill by about &euro;400 this year.  They would get a payback on their investment of about seven to ten years but what is really nice about solar energy is that they reduce their energy bill this year by about &euro;400 but they also reduce it for the next 24 years to 25 years because that is the period these panels last.  When we think about the one-off financial measures we are giving to families at the moment, they are practical but giving families the opportunities and possibilities to produce their own electricity is something that will endure and, hopefully, outlast and outlive this energy crisis.  Looking at supporting solar panels for residential development, for farmers and for business is a really good idea.  We do that to a certain degree at the moment through generous grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  From a sourcer's perspective, having a closer look at 100% grant funding for families who are in receipt of a fuel allowance is something that would be very impactful and meaningful not only for those families who produce their own electricity for their homes but also for the wider benefits in terms of jobs and employment in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cillian O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#J00200"><p>I will respond to Deputy Troy's three questions on wind, solar and farming biogas.  On wind, Denmark is a good country to use as an example.  It went very much pro-wind over a decade ago.  I do not know the numbers off the top of my head but I think more than 50% of its generation is wind.  It is a good country to take inspiration from.  I repeat that the obstacles are permitting and supply chains.  On permitting, at EU level we have come with a new proposal to speed up permitting processes.  That is now going through the European Parliament in what is called co-decision.  The idea is that when this is approved, one can hold up a project for a maximum of two years.  There is the principle of an overriding public interest, which means that in designated go-to accelerated areas, the project can only be held up for two years.  We think it would help a lot and we ask for Ireland's support for that as it goes through co-decision.</p> <p>  Solar makes a lot of sense.  The REPowerEU strategy came with a solar power strategy.  We should put solar on rooftops wherever we can and wherever it makes sense we should do it.  Again, there are some supply chain issues with silicone from China and so on but we think we should put solar wherever it makes sense.  Some Irish MEPs, particularly Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, who is based in Brussels, is also pushing solar and we work with his office on that and fully support it.</p> <p>  On farming an renewable gas, the REPowerEU strategy thinks we can have 35 billion cubic metres of renewable gases by 2030.  There is potential there.  More broadly speaking, and in the long term, at Eurelectric we see big potential for a win-win between energy production and farming going forward.  There is a lot of farming land and if we can find a way, a sweet spot, for it to be a win-win for both farmers and energy producers, it will have a lot of potential.  In the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, review, we should integrate the energy dimension for farming and see what can be done there to have energy as a source of income or a win-win for farming.</p></speech>

Not only were the interventions comprehensive, they were absolutely sobering in terms of where we are at.  Some of might have had a general notion that this will be bad for a considerable period of time but sometimes how bad it is going to be just needs to be laid out.  If we are talking about where we are at, and the plans we have had in this State, there was a missed opportunity with Corrib in that we did not have an element of State involvement.  The Scandinavian model of taking some money back, which you could plough back in and be a major player in all sorts of renewables is something we really have to go with.</p> <p>  I am always worried about nuclear.  I get that nuclear is with us in terms of France and Germany and how much of it is used.  I would ask a question about the dangers, and that is accepting we are not necessarily dealing with the Chernobyl-type technology.  I would like to think there are more checks and balances.  However, we had Fukushima and all that needs to go wrong is for everything to go wrong all at once.  We live in a world where that happens more often.  We have always had worries and particular difficulties as regards Sellafield.  I would throw that question out for an answer.</p> <p>  The witnesses have said wind energy is where it is at and that we need to get our house in order.  A significant amount of work has been done lately on that.  There is the wider issue of planning.  The Attorney General is carrying out a review and there may be legislative changes.  There is a need for resourcing.  If there are various points in the planning process, there is not much point in having them unless they are resourced, so people are not held up for a considerable amount of time, whether for small or big projects.</p> <p>  I would add my voice to what Deputy Harkin said as regards the Commission for Energy Regulation, CRU, in that we have to change the rules to ensure the State can buy backup generators, which unfortunately we will not have this year.  We have a particular issue even if we had an endless supply of fuel at this point in time.  The CRU is very good at telling us what it is not responsible for, whether we are talking about communal heating systems, for example, but this may be changing.  There is also the issue with standing charges but that is what it is.</p> <p>  The witnesses, especially Mr. O'Donoghue, spoke about the European Union's proposals and proposals which have been implemented around changes in the energy markets and so on.  We probably could have done something earlier, particularly if we were talking about capping.  It has been said that there has been a lack of imagination in dealing with the reorganisation of the market and how it is orientated, and that is accepting there is a huge number of anomalies.  The witnesses spoke about hedging and so on.  Sometimes people think this can be a very simple process but we really need to deal with that.</p> <p>  The witnesses dealt with the issue of anaerobic digestion.  We need to get our act together on it and on solar.  On one level, we have talked to death about what needs to be done as regards wind, but we just need to get it done.</p><p> I want to ask specifically about geothermal energy because it is being looked at a possible solution in the context of some of the communal heating systems we have in this State that have ended up being gas-powered and utterly inefficient.  People are dealing with huge costs at this point.</p><p> I have 14 other pages of notes, but I think we will just go with that.</p></speech>

One was on nuclear and the second was on whether we need a massive reform of the energy market.</p> <p>  On nuclear, my association is source-neutral.  It is not my job to sell nuclear.  We all know the pros and cons.  That is the decision for policymakers on the basis of engagement with society to make a decision on whether to go for nuclear or not.</p> <p>  Basically, it needs to be broken down. There are four sources of decarbonised electricity &ndash; nuclear, hydro, wind and solar.  There are some other smaller sources, but those are the four main ones.  I understand that, from an Irish perspective, the potential of hydro is quite limited.  If nuclear is ruled out, that leaves wind and solar.  If Ireland goes all out on wind, it will have to have a balancing storage strategy.  It has to be safe.  If Ireland goes all out on wind, how does it balance the intermittency?  In that context, a good discussion is needed.  Is it hydrogen, batteries, hydropower or gas?  This is a discussion that needs to take place in Ireland.  If Ireland rules out nuclear and goes all in on wind power, how will it balance the grid?  That is an important discussion.  I do not know how the discussion in this regard is progressing in Ireland, but it is important that members are aware of that.</p> <p>  Electricity markets generally work quite well.  What we need going forward is perhaps an evolution rather than a revolution.  The issue is the gas market, which is being manipulated.  I do not think we should go for the electricity market when the problem is in the gas market.  That is the root cause of the problem.  There are a few things in the electricity market that will help going forward.  We think consumers should be more active, meaning more prosumers, more demand response and more role for the consumer to be active.  We think also long-term contracts, which are kind of linked to hedging, will mitigate the risk from short-term price spikes.  Those are some changes we can integrate.  There would be a review.  Next year, the reform will take place.  I would just flag, once again, that the electricity market works well.  It is the gas market that is the problem and the contagion effect of the gas market on electricity is what is driving up prices.</p></speech>

It is fundamentally important.  We should again just stress that nuclear is our promise for the future &ndash; it should not be a distraction to our current problems.  In a best-case scenario for Ireland, nuclear is 15 years away.  It is the next 15 months that are fundamentally crucial for us.  It should not become a distraction from the things that we need to do.  If a decision is to be made on nuclear, it will likely be in the next decade, if the technology becomes available.  We have to acknowledge that it is still yet to move from conceptual to the commercial.  It is long way to go yet.  In 15 years&rsquo; time, we will all be much older and much wiser, and perhaps the technology will have progressed.  At the moment, it comes to back to what I said in our opening statement, which is that Ireland needs to play to its strengths.  We have a lot of wind, space and ability to produce energy in Ireland.  We have many clever and smart communities in Ireland who can help us with that.  That is what we need to focus on now in the short term, rather than waiting for a technology that may or may not develop and all the issues that go with that.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the royalties and offshore extraction, I agree with him.  This is an important decision point for Ireland.</p></speech>

One can look at the model that the UK took in terms of oil and gas exploration, or one can look at the Norwegian model.  The Norwegian model, or the Scandinavian model, is interesting because the Norwegian Government took an active, rather than passive, role in partnership.  When a country takes on the role of being an active partner in these projects, it must help to de-risk the projects to some degree.  When a country de-risks projects, it can then demand royalties.  That would mean that the Irish Government will have to have some element of skin in the game, if you will, in terms of helping with the permitting, resource measurement and resource extraction.  </p> <p>  It is an important point for Ireland to figure out at this early stage.  We do not want to end up at a level where we have many wind farms built off the coast of Ireland in ten or 15 years&rsquo; time and we then realise that we have missed a huge opportunity.  Now is the time to have those discussions.  It has to go beyond a policy sphere to the societal sphere and it has to go beyond energy to our wider economy and those families who will be benefitting from those.  It is an important conversation to have at this early stage, rather than later, when it may or may not be too late.</p></speech>

One area I would like to concentrate on is anaerobic digestion.  It is like a second coming for it.  I recall attending the launch of a local machine to great fanfare and hope more than ten years ago.  It is a slow-burner &ndash; excuse the pun.  Is it potentially a silver bullet?  It is being listed as one of the areas of positive attack that the agriculture sector can use to try to meet its emission targets.  Where are we now in respect of it?  If there is a league of EU member states, we are probably way down, I imagine; however, I would like to hear that from the experts.  How expensive is it to roll out?  Is there a good EU comparator?  What percentage aspiration can we hope for?  What size of farm justifies an individual apparatus?  Do our witnesses foresee smaller farms pooling resources and operating as a sort of a co-op?</p> <p>  It has been mentioned that both waste matter, slurry and silage, are important components or ingredients.  Is there any unintended consequence in placing too much emphasis, if you like, on plant-based silage to the detriment or slurry?  Should the emphasis not be on slurry to drive this in case there are any unintended consequences?  The alternative could be used elsewhere in the opportunistic farming environment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Deane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#K00800"><p>I would caution against the use of silver bullets with regard to energy.  There are no silver bullets; it is all hard work.  It is all difficult and it all takes planning.  There are no game-changers.  All of this stuff is difficult.  Again, I will come back to my opening statement.  When a state, such as Ireland, is almost 90% reliant on fossil fuels, we have some big challenges ahead.  However, there are certainly some big opportunities for anaerobic digestion in Ireland.  As I said, by 2030, it could meet about 20% of our natural gas needs. That would be about 6 TWh.  That is actually currently within the climate action plan - to achieve that goal it is about 5.6 TWh, which is significant.</p> <p>  The Senator is right that it needs policy support.  The cost of producing a unit of renewable gas from farmyard slurry and farmyard grass is about somewhere between &euro;70 and &euro;100 per MWh.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue mentioned, when we look at natural gas prices on global markets, at the moment they are probably trading this morning at about &euro;120 per MWh.  At present, renewable gas is competitive with fossil fuels.  Of course fossil fuel prices will not remain high forever, but over the short-term foreseeable future, it will remain competitive.</p> <p>  There needs to be a strong recognition of the sustainability requirements.  It is fundamentally important when producing any type of fuel from farmland, be it meat or renewable gas, that it done in a sustainable way and it fits within the renewable energy directives at European law and also respects biodiversity, bird life and wildlife habitats within the current Irish legislation.</p><p>We have much of the legislation in place so in many ways it is just about enforcing it and making sure that any projects that go ahead for anaerobic digestion respect it.<br/><br/>On the Senator's question on where Ireland is in relation to other European member states, we have one of the largest potentials on a <i>per capita</i>or on a per land area basis but we have one of the lowest realisations of that capacity at the moment.  If we look at that value of 6 terawatt hours, or about 20% of our natural gas in 2030, that is roughly 2% to 4% of the agricultural grasslands that we would need in Ireland.  We are not talking about a vast mono-culture where vast swathes of farming are turned over into anaerobic digestion.  It would be small.  My personal rather than professional view is that it would be more suited to the co-operative-type organisations that we have in many parts of Ireland.  They have a lot of social and community strength and trust.  They also have capital.  These types of investments would not be suitable for individual farmers.  They would be more suitable for groups of farmers, with maybe ten or 12 farmers coming together, pooling their slurry and grass silage to produce renewable gas.  It would have to be a mixture of slurry and grass, or maybe a little more grass, but it is typically a 50:50 mix.  There is too much liquid content in slurry and it would not be strong enough on its own to produce enough natural gas.  Of course, with grass, we need to be careful how it is grown, avoiding as much chemical fertiliser as possible.  There is much very good research done in institutions, such as Teagasc and Devenish Farms, looking at different swards that can be used that would allow the production of more grass by using less chemical fertilisers.  The initial findings of those studies are quite positive.  Not only can they produce more grass, but they also tend to be healthier in terms of the health of the soils and allowing more biodiversity within those swards of grass.  However, I would caution that this is an area where the technology and the knowledge exist but the policy is simply not there to encourage farmers to make that leap of faith.  What would really be a foundation is a strong, stable policy that offers farmers or co-operatives a good and dignified return on their investment.</p></speech>

Obviously, the UK is not in the European Union anymore.  Does the European Union have any kind of relationship with the UK and Norway regarding these matters?  Are there any co-operation agreements or understandings between the EU and the UK and Norway?  Could Mr. O'Donoghue elaborate on the position of the UK energy market if he is up to speed on that?  I appreciate that it is not totally his brief but Ireland is very reliant on the UK and Norway for gas supplies.  How does he see that going forward?  Is that supply threatened, particularly having regard to the politics in the UK at this time?</p> <p>  On Dr. Deane's comments, nobody mentioned data centres here this morning.  Data centres are very much part of our economic model and part of our foreign direct investment strategy.  How do they operate here and are they on board as far as energy saving or energy demand reduction is concerned?  Is the construction and provision of more data centres in the future something that needs to be reviewed?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Donoghue mentioned that there are sensitive discussions regarding the solidarity within the European Union.  It would help in my understanding of what is the supply chain between the UK and Ireland.  I thought that we were almost totally reliant on gas coming from the UK.  How do we fit in, as a European Union member state, with that solidarity?</p></speech>

Norway is part of the internal energy market.  It is part of the EEA.  Norway is fully integrated with our structure, although it is not an EU member state.  The UK is not.  This is an important difference.  We have a very close working relationship with Norway.  The country is our second biggest supplier of gas and we are discussing with it bilaterally the reduction of gas prices.  Norway is also a very important battery for European electricity.  The country has a huge amount of hydropower which acts as a battery or as a reserve.  In southern Norway, electricity prices are very high at present.  Normally, what would be done is that some of that hydropower would be released to alleviate the price increases in the south of the country.  However, the Norwegians are not releasing this hydropower because they are using it as a storage for this coming winter.  Norway is playing a very important role in European electricity security.  There were some internal discussions in Norway with some parties saying that the country should not be exporting to the UK and Europe and that they should have electricity at lower cost.  However, the general consensus among politicians was that the country was fully part of the market and had an important role to play in electricity security.</p> <p>  Regarding the UK, co-operation is now much better.  We have offshore sea co-operation where the UK was excluded for a short time but now it is back in and co-operation is very good.  It is very important regarding energy that we treat the UK as a full member of the Internal Market even though it is not.  On the supply risk from the UK to Ireland, I have to be careful what I say here.  That is a political judgment.  By and large, Northern Ireland and Ireland are one single energy market so I cannot see any incentive from the UK side to cut off or reduce supplies to Ireland.  However, I am not an expert on that situation and someone else would be a better judge, but from my understanding, it should be pretty secure.</p></speech>

There are pros and cons to data centres in terms of their impact on energy and on climate.  We are quite fortunate in Ireland that we have a lot of very ambitious data centre owners, some of the large corporates, for example.  They have very good net-zero targets for 2030.  These are actually more ambitious that our national targets.  It is important to have those people in this country because it creates a policy pull.  They are investing a lot in renewables and different smart technologies.  That is important.  We must also acknowledge the financial contribution that those companies make to the Exchequer and also in terms of digitalisation.  I did not have to come to Dublin today because I can use Teams.  Data centres and the modern digital economy play a fundamental role in enabling a lot of the really positive stuff.</p> <p>  On the cons, any increase in electricity demand is mainly coming from data centres.  This makes Ireland a little bit unusual in comparison to other European member states.  About 14% of all the electricity consumed last year was by data centres.  This year we added on the equivalent of about 200,000 homes worth of electricity usage onto the power grid from data centres alone.</p> <p>  We are going through a number of crises within the energy and electricity sectors in Ireland.  We have a physical crisis within the power sector and we have a price crisis.  The price crisis is very clearly, as Mr. O'Donoghue mentioned, caused by natural gas and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  However, the physical crisis that we have here is our own doing.  It is our own failure to deliver new gas-fired generation.  To help out the power system when the wind is not strong and the sun is not shining, we need to have conventional generation.  That is where we have dropped the ball in Ireland.  The consequence of increasing demand at a time when the ability to produce energy is reducing is not a good strategy.  My view is that there needs to be a pause for reflection until we figure out and resolve the physical crisis that we have in Ireland.</p><p>Once we do that and build the conventional generation that allows us to restore the Irish power system to its needed reliability, adequacy and robustness, the conversation needs to pivot not on how many data centres we have but on the type we encourage and welcome.  Some of the large corporates have ambitious strategies for what they call the 24-7 use of renewable energy, which entails using green power every hour.  Companies that can deliver on that would have a much lower impact on emissions and a benign impact on the power system in Ireland.  To deliver on it, the data centre companies would need not only to invest in renewables, which many of them are doing, but also invest significantly in flexibility on their own side and in energy storage.  If we can carve out a pathway whereby we can attract the data centres into our economy and society and prove the concept can work, the centres will have a benign impact on our emissions and energy system.  To remain relevant in a world in which we all need to reduce emissions, we need to reduce fossil fuel reliance.  Data centres that cannot demonstrate an ability to operate right across the year with as much renewable energy as possible are just not compatible with our national goals.</p></speech>

Geopolitically, it is fair to say that things are not going particularly well for Vladimir Putin.  One of the only games in play that is working for him is the fact that we are facing economic carnage.  We have severe worries at this point about the entire energy sector.  We must ensure Mr. Putin does not get that win and that we keep the show on the road, as was done during the Covid pandemic, societally and economically.  That would maintain necessary solidarity across Europe and even with Ukraine.  There has been talk to the effect that the EU and European Commission have not been sufficiently imaginative or have been slow to the game.  From here on in, what do we need to do that has not been proposed?</p> <p>  I have a question on our weakness in respect of gas storage.  I get the idea that if we are considering gas storage, we must be careful that we do not make an agreement with a commercial entity that locks us in for 40 or 45 years.  We must ensure what we need to do as quickly as possible.  On the wider question, Dr. Deane expressed his fear that, while we could have a green hydrogen strategy, we do not necessarily have the capacity to put it into operation yet.  It is a matter of alternatives in that regard.</p> <p>  Could any of the witnesses respond on geothermal energy?  I brought up the issue of communal heating systems and the difficulties with them, but I am aware that the SEAI and even the Department are considering the feasibility of using geothermal energy as a possible solution to replace the gas-fed heating system.  They are specifically examining Carlinn Hall in Dundalk.  I have a particular interest in the latter but I am just wondering about the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

While my answer will involve a bit of repetition, there are three steps we can take.  The first, and most important, is to speed up the permitting for renewables, particularly offshore wind energy.  There is a 7 GW target for 2030, so the permitting process needs to be speeded up in that regard.  Second, it is important to have a clear storage strategy.  If we are going all out or heavy on wind, we must determine the balancer.  Is it natural gas, hydrogen or batteries?  Third, I would encourage the reduction of demand this winter via behavioural campaigns aimed at citizens.  These are the three things that should be prioritised in the medium term.</p></speech>

In many ways, with this energy crisis it is almost a case of hoping for the best and planning for the worst.  Hope, however, is not a viable strategy when it comes to energy policy, so we do have to plan for the worst.  Again, it means looking internally at our resources and strengths rather than externally at what is happening in Ukraine.</p> <p>  The energy crisis we had in Ireland coming out of the 1970s and into the 1980s was different because we did not have options.  We did not know what to do.  It was very much about oil.  We considered coal and built Moneypoint but the technology required to exploit our renewable resources did not exist at the time.  We have that now.  We are now going through a similar energy crisis, which has exposed our reliance on fossil fuels, but now we are not hostage to confusion.  We know we have technologies to get out of this.  It will take time.  I reiterate Mr. O'Donoghue's point that while we know what we have to do and why, we have to determine the how and the what quicker.  That fundamentally comes back to permitting, licensing and planning.  The time it takes to get energy projects off the ground and implemented in Ireland, and, let us be fair, in many other European states, is completely at odds with the urgency of the crisis we are experiencing.  It is not about making bad decisions and railroading things through; it is about the ability to make good decisions quickly and deliver the infrastructure we need to get out of this crisis.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy raised an important point.  We have spoken a lot today about electricity for our appliances, gas for our electricity and gas for our homes, but just under 1 million homes in Ireland use oil or kerosine to heat their homes.  That is a high level of reliance.  Ireland has one of the highest levels of reliance on oil-fired heating per person in the EU.  Anything we can do to reduce that is fundamentally important, not only environmentally because oil is polluting, but also socially.  We are all exposed when it comes to gas prices but we see the volatility in kerosene prices and home-heating prices and, therefore, any technology we can use on the supply side, be it geothermal technology, air-to-earth heat pumps or sustainable biomass, is fundamentally important, but we also need to consider the fabric of our built infrastructure.  A typical Irish home built before the 2000s probably leaks 60% to 70% of its heat.  Giving people heating systems is one element that we need to consider but we must also make sure the heat stays in the houses.</p></speech>

The building of more data centres would increase Ireland's demand for electricity by at least 40%.  Some estimates suggest data centres could consume up to 70% of Ireland's electricity by 2030.  If we are prioritising our citizens, surely we have to pause the building of more data centres in this country.  That is my view but I would like to know the view of the witnesses.</p> <p>  I understand the position on speeding up the permitting of offshore wind developments and the storage strategy for wind, but what is the backup plan for wind energy?</p><p>Wind turbines only operate about 35% of the time.  They do not operate in a similar way to nuclear plants which operate maybe 92% or 93% of the time.  What is the back-up supply?  We will not have that with wind.  With regard to the behavioural campaign will the EU take an authoritarian role, as such, as it did with the Covid-19 measures?  Will it undertake an advertising campaign like that so that people will know exactly what they should do?  It is unfair that here in Ireland the people have to shoulder the brunt of this.  It is the people who it is going to cost.  I have already seen businesses close down.  We will see much more of that following what we have heard today.  People might get to Christmas and then think if it is worth their while opening next year because they are going to face another year of this.  If the witnesses can answer a few of those questions I would welcome their thoughts. </p></speech>

One is on small module reactors, SMRs, another is on storage and then on behavioural campaigns.  Taking SMRs and storage together, whether Ireland should do SMRs or not, that is not for me to decide.  However, we need to be clear that we need a base load source of electricity going forward and if that is not gas then nuclear is probably the best option.  That is for policymakers to decide.  On storage I agree with what Senator Keogan said.  We need a clear plan to have flexible and storage.  If we go all out for intermittent wind what balances the grid?  Is it batteries, hydro, gas or nuclear?  Those are the things that need to be considered.  It definitely should be looked at and an impact assessment done before deciding if SMRs are the way to go.  That is for policymakers to decide.</p> <p>  On behavioural campaigns, the EU will not be taking a controlling approach on this.  I had a meeting earlier this week, a round table with the US and EU where we discussed various best practices to reduce demand.  The main thing we need is to have awareness-raising among citizens and share information on what has worked.  Smart meters make sense, where people have technologies on their phones so that they know they should not use energy between certain hours.  It is linked to digitalisation.  The more data we have on energy usage and the more proactive the consumer is, the better it will be in terms of reducing electricity usage in peak hours.  That is definitely an important way to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.304" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Paul Deane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022101900002#N00300"><p>In regard to nuclear, we should look at all options to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  We must also be realistic and temper that with reality.  The likelihood of SMRs moving from the conceptual space to the commercial space is probably ten to 15 years away.  As I mentioned we are spending &euro;1 million every single hour on importing fossil fuels into Ireland.  We need to temper our expectations around the future availability of technologies with the reality that they will take time to deliver.  Yes we should look at all options.  However, they should not be a distraction from what we need in the present.  The next 15 months and the next decade are going to be crucial and we cannot continue our reliance on fossil fuels.  We will need backup.  As I mentioned renewables reduce the use of fossil fuels and power plants but they do not replace the need.  In the next eight to ten years that backup is probably going to have to come predominantly from natural gas.  That is why the security of supply of Ireland's natural gas, the storage of natural gas and understanding our accessibility and reliability of our natural gas system are fundamentally important.  We are not going to move away from fossil fuel overnight.  We will transition slowly away from it.  During that transition period we are going to need insurance policies such as gas storage.  We will need to think carefully about our natural gas.  In the long term vision, looking along the same timelines as SMRs, we are getting into the realm of different decarbonised gases such as hydrogen maybe coming on board.  That is probably a conversation for the next decade rather than being useful for this decade.  However, we are going to need backup.  That is clear.</p> <p>  In regard to data centres I am not familiar with the 70% number mentioned by Senator Keogan.  I know some of the numbers from EirGrid show a very strong increase of data centre demand growth into the future.  I reiterate that the conversation needs to change from how many data centres we have in Ireland, to what type.  Data centres that can demonstrate they can use renewables and store renewables to meet their energy needs will have a very positive impact on the energy system in Ireland for having a benign impact on climate emissions.  For that we need to look for leadership with the data centre industry.  We know at a conceptual level how energy can be stored and how flexibility can be moved around but commercially these things are very expensive.  To remain relevant in a society and in the economy of the country that is demanding that everything should be greener and cleaner we probably need the data industry owners to step up to leadership on that issue and deliver some of those very flexible, what we call 24-7 or green power every hour operations.</p></speech>

Everybody is saying the same thing.  We attend many meetings but the clarity of their answers and the scope and breadth of their knowledge is coupled with the ability to share it in a way that I understand.  I thank them for that.</p> <p>  I have one or two brief questions.  What is the possibility of small co-operative windfarms or even individual turbines perhaps on a person's own land?  Are there issues around supply of materials or technology?  You see the odd one.  What is the feasibility of that either for individuals or for communities?  At one time I visited the one in Tipperary and I was impressed with that but it took forever, about ten years, until they could get it up and running.  I am talking about small scale.</p> <p>  The other point is on smart meters.  I just got that installed and I have not mastered the technology yet but there seems to be some concern, and the witnesses may or may not be able to comment on this, that they are not delivering for consumers in the way they should.  In some cases it can actually cost people more.  I am sorry I do not have more detail on that.  If the witnesses do not have more detail I understand that they cannot answer the question.  I have been hearing about that in the media.  Finally on the issue of data centres where Dr. Deane talks about the type of data centre, I hear what he is saying but is he including the idea that they would produce their own renewable electricity?  Is that an important part of it?  If they use renewables then they are hooked into the system, but is Dr. Deane talking about them producing their own?</p></speech>

It varies a lot between member states.  By and large we see member states that are very active with smart meters, in particular I flag Estonia which has a digitalised economy and consumers are hooked up to the new generation.  We see big benefits there.  They have apps, they react to when prices are low and when prices are high.  We had a recent meeting with the CEO of Eesti Energia who is in charge of energy in Estonia.  He was giving advice to many EU member states on how they have done in Estonia.  It is a good model to follow.  Maybe there are some hiccups of which I am not aware but by and large smart meters and more information lead to better decisions from consumers which leads to less usage of energy at the wrong hours.  All things considered they are generally a good thing.  We should definitely promote them.</p></speech>

It is tricky with wind turbines because the capital outlay tends to be large but now, there is the advent of solar power.</p><p>To a certain degree, I suppose for farming communities, anaerobic digestion is a lot more possible.  It is something I would like to see a lot more of.  It allows people to engage with energy production in Ireland.  As I mentioned, most of the energy we consume here is produced in other countries.  Allowing our communities to get involved in that process is something that can only be beneficial.  With the advent of solar, that will probably be an easier pathway that is less financially constraining and less of a financial outlay for many community groups.  In terms of the planning and permitting process, we have now lifted the planning regulations on solar installations for many buildings.  That is something that should allow those things to be fast-tracked.</p><p> In terms of the data centres, yes, we want them to produce and procure their own renewable energy.  As a country, we must take ownership of our energy needs and consumption.  That needs to go from the family level up to the farm level.  Of course, data centres should not be exempted from that.</p></speech>

I asked another question about the wind.  I am talking about individual homes.  I have seen the odd small wind turbine around, although you would not even call them turbines.  Do these have any potential for individuals?  Are they cost reasonable?</p></speech>

Yes, there are big challenges.  Fifteen years ago, we had a solar industry in Europe, particularly in Germany, but now we do not.  By and large, the jobs and the production have gone to China.  In terms of materials, silicone is a very important source for solar.  In general, most of that production is taking place elsewhere.  We are coming with a new raw materials strategy and this is called a critical raw materials strategy.  As we move from a fossil fuel intensive economy to a raw materials intensive economy, our dependence on certain critical raw materials, such as silicone, lithium, cobalt for electric vehicles, etc., is going to shift.  We need to be able to react to that.  I would also flag that much of the energy intensive industries that make these raw materials are suffering a lot under this crisis.  We need to find solutions so that they stay in Europe.  I do not think it is wise to become overly dependent on China for imports of these critical raw materials.  In the last six months, we have seen what an over-dependence on one supplier can do.  We thought we had an inter-dependent relationship with Russia.  It turns out that was not the case.  We have seen what happens when we become too reliant on one supplier.  As we shift from a fossil fuel to a raw materials intensive economy, we cannot let the same mistake happen.</p></speech>

Maybe the witnesses can emailed us.  I have seen wind turbines as well.  I have seen the one wind turbine in a large garden, which is for the family or household.  If at all possible, I would like to hear some expert analysis of that.</p></speech>

They tend to be a little bit louder so good wind speeds and good neighbours are needed.  They tend to be more suitable to rural locations with more open space.  Again, this is because they tend to be a little bit more intrusive than solar panels which are a lot more passive.</p></speech>

In my area, I can think offhand of five or six farm families who have those small wind turbines.  They tend to be farm locations.  Again, that is more a reflection on the space that is needed for these turbines rather than the energy consumption.  Wide open space is needed.  That comes back to the fact that they tend to rotate at a much higher wind speed and a much higher rotational speed, so they tend to be a little bit louder than the larger wind turbines we see around the country.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ulster Bank&rsquo;s director of corporate affairs, Ms Elizabeth Arnett.</p> <p>  As the members know, our phased withdrawal is progressing and we have made sure to keep the committee informed at all stages.  We have committed to a phased, orderly withdrawal to minimise job losses and support all colleagues with training and development, with a preference to deal with strategic banking counterparties, where possible, who can provide customers with full banking services in the Irish market.  We commit to helping our customers move to a new provider as safely and as seamlessly as possible, with plenty of advance notice, and to keep branches open throughout our choose, move, close campaign to ensure customers have access to branch support during their six-month notice period, where possible.  There has been no bank-wide voluntary redundancy scheme in the first half of 2022, and it is highly unlikely that we will see large numbers of redundancy exits this year.  In addition, we have committed to dealing with our non-performing loans in the later stages of our withdrawal, to allow customers who are in difficulty as much time and support as possible to return to a performing position.  We are delivering on all of these commitments as our withdrawal progresses.</p> <p>  Today, I would like to outline the current position and the next steps for our current and deposit account customers, and we are happy to take questions on any aspect of our withdrawal in the discussion and will endeavour to answer them subject to the normal commercial considerations.  We announced our plans for the closure of our current and deposit account customers a year ago, in October 2021.  Six months later, in April 2022, we formally began writing to customers to ask them to choose a new provider, and move and close their current and deposit accounts on a phased, rolling basis, giving them six months&rsquo; notice to do so.  We have been communicating multiple times and in multiple ways with our customers throughout this six-month notice period, and there are a number of channels available to them to close accounts.  We have engaged in significant advertising and marketing campaigns, as have other important stakeholders such as financial service providers, the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  The campaigns have been constant, and one can hardly turn on the radio, open a newspaper or go online without hearing a message about moving to a new provider.  This might seem excessive sometimes but a programme of this scale that requires so many customers and stakeholders to act, requires this level of communications.  Based on our independent research, the communications have worked, and our customers are universally aware of what is happening and of what they need to do.</p> <p>  In addition to our customer communications and in recognition that many other stakeholders external to Ulster Bank would need to play a part in ensuring customers could safely choose, move and close, we commenced a proactive programme of engagement a year ago.  To date, we have held over 1,200 stakeholder engagements, from large-scale roadshow events to regular, one-to-one meetings.  Many committee members or colleagues in their constituency or parliamentary teams have attended some of these events.</p> <p>  Our objective is to ensure we employ all communication channels to ensure customers are aware of the action they need to take and the supports available to them.  I thank all stakeholders for their ongoing support.  While communications are a central part of our activity, it is second only to providing practical support and outreach to customers.  In this regard, we are very proud of our front-line teams and the lengths to which they have gone to support our customers, and I take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank them for that.</p> <p>  By way of example of the sorts of initiatives we are implementing to provide practical support to customers, we have changed our branch hours to allow more time to support customers move their accounts.  We have hosted teams from other financial institutions in our banking halls, so they are on site to open accounts for our customers.  We have a full range of supports for vulnerable customers, details of which we have shared with the committee.  We have carried out additional proactive contact to customers who might need more help, such as those in financial difficulty, older customers, heavy branch users and customers at the end of their six-month notice period.  We have made it easier for customers to close their account in-branch, on the telephone and digitally.</p> <p>  We are already seeing trends that show a significant reduction in reliance on branches for our customers, with in-branch transactions down by 49% and falling each week.  At the same time, other financial providers have made it easier for customers to open accounts and we have seen many initiatives in this regard.  I will not mention any specifically, but we can see from the enormous number of accounts that have been opened this year - on average 12,500 a week - that the supports put in place by other financial providers are working.  In some instances, accounts can be opened digitally in a matter of moments but, equally, for customers who do not want to open accounts digitally there is no significant delay for appointments, with the Central Bank reporting an eight-day waiting period for appointments.</p> <p>  We have also mirrored our process and approach for our business customers, providing them with six months&rsquo; notice to choose, move and close as well as multiple letters, prompts and calls.</p><p>Having a working current account is crucial for businesses to be able to pay their employees and suppliers, receive payments and carry out all their financial duties.  The switching or closing process can typically take longer for a business customer because requirements are often more complex, so I have been engaging proactively with these customers since they received their first letters, and in many cases before then, to ensure they have the support they need.  If a customer does not switch or close a business current account, it could have implications for the business in terms of paying employee wages, paying suppliers and receiving payments for its goods and services.  Ulster Bank is asking employers to communicate directly with employees who continue to have Ulster Bank accounts to remind them to change their details to avoid any disruptions to salary payments.</p><p> We believe we have taken all reasonable steps to support customers to choose, move and close and, to the best of our knowledge, other financial institutions have also taken appropriate steps to encourage customers to choose, move and close.</p><p> As the committee is aware, we have significant outreach to customers, with a focus on those approaching the end of their notice period for current and deposit accounts.  In the past four weeks we have made, on average, approximately 10,000 calls a week, successfully contacting an average of 6,000 customers per week.  In these calls, our colleagues ask customers if they need support ahead of the end of their six-month notice period.  The majority of these customers are telling us that they have taken action or are in the process of doing so, and already have their move well in hand.  Most customers are telling us that they have opened a new account and need to complete the transfer of their transactions.  A small percentage tell us they will now take action, while a very small number of customers have asked us for more time due to personal circumstances.  We have now written to the vast majority of customers who need to close their account, which means almost every customer has begun the six-month notice period, with some more advanced than others.</p><p> Before I go into the detail of what has been happening, I wish to share one of the learnings from the past six months.  When we started this process, we believed the primary metric for success would be the number of accounts that have closed.  However, a far more important metric is the degree to which a customer is reliant on the account.  When a customer has an account with another bank and his or her salary and other payments are going into that account and the direct debits and so on have been moved to it, the customer is no longer reliant on his or her Ulster Bank account.  The customer might never come back to close the account with Ulster Bank, so in such instances we can close the account with no impact on the customer.  What is important is that the customer has safely moved to a new provider and is no longer reliant on Ulster Bank.  Understanding that reliance, through detailed analysis, has helped us to target more effective communication which, in turn, has driven customer behaviour.  For example, members may have heard our adverts targeting customers making nursing home payments or customers in receipt of social protection payments.  We have also highlighted salary payments because nothing says you need a bank account more than if your main source of income is banked there.</p><p> How have customers been responding?  Some customers have gone beyond their six-month notice period and some other customers still have more than five months&rsquo; notice left.  As such, looking at the headline numbers across the entire population will not tell one very much about customer behaviour and the customer response.  Of our personal current account customers who received their first formal notification in April and May, 71% have either closed or materially wound down the level of activity in their current account or left it inactive and dormant, and that percentage is increasing every day.  Since our submission last Friday, 80% of our first set of customers have either closed or are inactive on their accounts.  We have contacted most of the remainder of these customers as a final reminder and most of them are reporting that they have opened a new account elsewhere or are in the process of moving their payments to a new account.  Broadly, this trend is emerging in the other tranches of customers and we are not seeing anything in the numbers that at this stage would change that trend.  This is evidenced in a number of ways.  For example, 171,000 Ulster Bank accounts were in receipt of social protection payments at the start of the year.  This number has dropped by more than 80% to approximately 30,000.  Since we submitted our report, it has dropped to 28,000.</p><p> What happens now?  From the outset, we committed to an orderly and phased withdrawal of the bank from the Irish market.  This commitment is more important than ever as we commence the process of freezing and closing accounts.  Therefore, in line with our commitment, we will take a considered and careful approach to account closures.  We will continue to assess external, operational and other factors to ensure that the right number and type of accounts are progressing to the account freezing and closing stages.  As a reminder, our closure process has an additional step built in.  Customers have six months&rsquo; notice to choose, move and close.  On or after the six months, the account is frozen for 30 days and then moves to closure.  This is an important interim step and, for some customers, may be the trigger to ensure they are no longer reliant on Ulster Bank.  We will also take time to understand the account profile and what impact, if any, freezing the account will have on the customer.  That will determine the point at which an account moves forward into the closure process.  Ultimately, all accounts will move into the closure process, but in the initial round of closures we will take a very precautionary approach.</p><p> What does this mean for customers at the end of their notice period?  As some customers are past or close to passing their six-month notice period, a number of things will happen.  These will be dependent on the needs of the customer.  If a customer needs more support, which may or may not mean more time, we can provide that - the customer just needs to let us know.  If a customer is still reliant on the account after the six-month notice period is over, we will try to make contact with the customer again to ensure he or she has all the requirements needed to complete the move to a new bank and service provider.  We will not freeze or close the customer's accounts at this time but it is essential that the customer continues the process of moving to another service provider.  According to customer feedback and independent research, most of these customers have a bank account elsewhere and are in the process of moving, so we believe they are on the way to completing the process.</p><p>If we freeze an account on which a customer is still reliant, we can temporarily reverse the freezing of the account for a short time once the customer contacts us.  If a customer is no longer reliant on an account but it is still open, with no activity or a low level of activity, the customer can expect the account to be frozen and closed on or after the six-month notice period.  This precautionary, careful and controlled approach means that where a customer is reliant on the account, we can tailor the closure to the customer's individual requirements, and the overall closure of accounts is managed to maintain an orderly process for customers, the industry and other key stakeholders.  Right now, we have a temporary pause in the commencement of this activity to accommodate the additional social protection payments announced in the recent budget.  Even though more than 80% of customers in receipt of a social protection payment have taken action on their account, there are some who have not done so and they have the potential to be the most vulnerable.</p><p> We will start the process of freezing and closing accounts in a controlled and careful way on or after 11 November, beginning with customers who we believe are no longer reliant on their account.  We will take a planned break in freezing accounts for Christmas.  During this break, accounts that have already been frozen for a month will continue to close unless the customer contacts us, and we will continue our outreach to customers reliant on their account during that time.  We will recommence the programme of freezing and closing accounts in the new year, so it is important that customers realise that once their six-month notice period is over, their account will be in line to be closed, but there is help available if they need it.</p><p> It is important to remember that Ulster Bank is closing.  We need to provide certainty for our colleagues as to when they can expect to leave the bank so they can plan for their futures, and we need to be clear to customers that it is in their best interests to be with a new financial provider that can support their needs into the future.  We have endeavoured to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken to support customers to choose, move and close.  We will continue to do so throughout this process.</p><p>I thank the members for listening and am happy to take their questions.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to address this committee.  I am accompanied today by my colleagues Dermot Kieran, chief financial and products officer of the bank, and Darragh Lennon, director of retail distribution.  We look forward to a constructive discussion regarding the closure and switching of current accounts and related issues as KBC exits the Irish market.</p> <p>  A number of key milestones in relation to the planned orderly exit of KBC have taken place since we last met with the committee.  The agreement relating to the sale of performing loan assets and deposits to the Bank of Ireland Group received approval from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on 24 May 2022, after which we ceased accepting new applications across all products.</p> <p>  We have also been informed that the Minister for Finance has instructed that the ministerial order confirming his approval of the transfer to Bank of Ireland be drafted.  Subject to the completion of the remaining procedural steps, the transfer is anticipated to take place in early 2023.</p> <p>  We have started communicating with our customers on the next steps associated with the transfer of products to Bank of Ireland.  As part of this communication, we have provided customers with a comprehensive product guide outlining clearly what is happening across all products and the actions required of customers in each case.  When we last attended this committee in May of this year, I expressed our determination to protect the interests of our customers and staff to the greatest extent possible as we conduct an orderly exit from the Irish market.  It has been and will remain a key priority for KBC Bank Ireland to support our customers at every turn and to communicate effectively with them, ensuring they have all the information they require, understand the actions they need to take, and have sufficient time to take those actions.</p> <p>  KBC current accounts are not part of the transaction with Bank of Ireland, which means that customers are required to move and close their current accounts.  Managing this process has been an important priority for our team and we have dedicated significant resources to ensure the process is as smooth as possible for our customers.  I am happy to report that, in partnership with our customers and supported by our dedicated staff, we are making good progress and account closures are tracking materially ahead of plan.  I would like to now provide members with an update on that progress.</p> <p>  As outlined previously when we attended here in May, we estimated, based on our data and analysis, that 52,000 of the 130,000 total number of KBC current account holders may need to open a new account or move to a new provider.  Today, our estimates show that the 52,000 figure is down 25% to 39,000.  I can also confirm that 55% of all current account customers have now received account closure notices, and these notices will continue to be issued into the first quarter of 2023.  Priority customers, including those in a vulnerable position, non-digitally enabled customers, and people over the age of 65 were prioritised from the outset to give them sufficient time to transfer their accounts and 95% of that group have received their notifications.  Of this prioritised group of 4,400 customers, only 700 remain with an active account today.</p> <p>  There has been a 110% increase in current accounts with a zero balance, with an overall reduction of 26% in current account balances since May.  The number of direct debits is reducing at a rate of 3,000 per week.  Another key indicator of activity is the level of social welfare payments being made into current accounts.  This has decreased by 32% from May to September, with just 8,500 accounts remaining in receipt of social welfare payments.</p> <p>  We can confirm that 10% of current accounts have been closed by customers since May, which is above our projections.  The first wave of account closures, which consists of inactive current accounts, will commence in December 2022.  The closure process will proceed from that point onwards in four-week cycles, continuing until August 2023.</p> <p>  As previously communicated, 90% of all customer service queries are handled through the contact centre and 97% of active KBC current account customers are digitally enabled.  KBC has increased by 65% the staff dedicated to serving customers in the contact centre and by 25% in our operations centre since the announcement of the agreement with Bank of Ireland, ensuring that strong service levels are maintained and the average call waiting time for talking to a colleague in the contact centre in KBC remains less than 30 seconds.</p> <p>  We know that a digital first approach to banking is preferred by our customers and this is supported by our recent research which found that 81% of KBC customers surveyed prefer to close their account digitally.  In November, KBC will be able to support customers to close their current accounts via the KBC app.  Our hubs, which are not traditional bank branches as they were primarily designed for sales and not for operations, are used by a small number of our customers for support and they will remain open to support with switching or closing until after customers have transferred to Bank of Ireland.  Based on our customer data, we expect that those current account holders who are more likely to want to visit a hub, will have already closed or switched their current accounts before the closure of any hubs.</p> <p>  We have a dedicated care team for customers who may need some extra help and support during this time.  Our care team has lots of experience supporting customers with different needs and continues to support vulnerable customers through the current account closure process.</p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank KBC Bank Ireland staff who continue to go the extra mile in servicing the needs of our customers in what is a challenging period for them also.  A successful engagement process with the employee council, which represents staff interests, culminated in that body securing a redundancy package that compares very favourably in the sector and we continue the principle of consulting and communicating on an ongoing basis with staff directly. </p> <p>  On the subject of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, or TUPE regulations, and the transfer of staff to Bank of Ireland, I can confirm that the TUPE consultation with Bank of Ireland concluded in July and that all eligible staff have been communicated with directly regarding the transfer of their role and how their employment terms and conditions have been protected.  It is still too early to state the number of employees who will transfer to Bank of Ireland, as they are entitled to waive their TUPE rights up to the point of migration in 2023. </p> <p>  In conclusion, I believe we are making good progress on the subject of current account closures and account switching where we continue to place the interests of customers at the centre of the process, providing every support we can in doing so.</p><p>As stated, we are also heavily focused on the well-being of our staff and we will continue to engage with them to ensure that their best interests are protected as we continue the orderly wind-down of the bank.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions the committee members may have.</p></speech>

I want to dig a bit deeper into all of that.  I might focus, given the limitation of time, on Ms Howard in relation to Ulster Bank to see where it is at this point in time.</p> <p>  I welcome some of the statistics that Ulster Bank brought to the committee.  The key message here is for people not to delay but to engage, to close their accounts and to open an account in another financial provider before the deadline.  There was an extension of the deadline and the deadline is now 4 November for those first tranche of letters that were sent out.  My first question is how many letters were sent out in April that now have a deadline of 4 November?  </p></speech>

The figure is 51% that have actually closed.  We have got 24% where there are either no transactions going through the account, where there is a nil balance or where there is a very low number of between one and five transactions in a 30-day period.</p></speech>

It was closure of accounts and now it is little activity.  She speaks about between one and five transactions.  However, one transaction that defaults could be a major one.  Breaking this down, 51% have closed and their deadline is now two weeks away.  It will be two weeks from Friday, but 51% have closed.  Of the 49% that remain open, how many of them have a nil balance and no activity?</p></speech>

I want to get some statistics, however, because none of these numbers were in Ms Howard&rsquo;s opening statement.

We deliberately looked at deposit accounts, for example.  They might have just done a transfer from one account to another.  With a current account we have taken out anybody who might be getting a payment of more than &euro;125 per week.  We did that because we think that might be salary.  Therefore, they are probably using the account.  We have also removed any customer who might be getting a Department of Social Protection payment.  The accounts we are freezing are deposit accounts and if it is a current account, there is no activity or between one and five transactions in the last 30 days but typically, these are not main banked activities that are going through those accounts.</p></speech>

We know there is less reliance for a grouping of customers and we know there is heavy reliance for some customers.  The heavy-reliant customers will not enter into the freezing and closing process at this point.  We are, however, continuing to contact them to have conversations with them as to what is going on.  They have had six months&rsquo; notice and there has been a very public campaign.</p></speech>

Is it one&rsquo;s electricity bill, mortgage, mobile phone bill etc.?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Arnett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101900002#F01000"><p>Let me address that.  An active current account could have 70 or more transactions in a month.  If we think of all the times people use their current accounts to tap for a coffee, pay a mortgage or whatever, an active current account on which they are fully reliant will have a high number of transactions.  If a person's number of transactions is between one and five, it is not unreasonable to assume, primarily because customers as well as independent research are telling us, it is very unlikely to be that person&rsquo;s main bank account.  What defines reliance here, for example, would be where a person has a bank account elsewhere.  That person would be less reliant on Ulster Bank.  If a person has payments, salaries or a Department of Social Protection payment going into that account, that person is more reliant.  Let us face it, unless there is something going in, it is very hard to make payments out.  If payments are not going into that account and into another one, again reliance is even less.  If the balance is extremely low, a person will not pay the ESB or electricity bill out of that.  Again, the reliance is even less in that case.  However, we accept there is a qualified judgment on our part in relation to those numbers of transactions, which is why we have the additional step of being able to reverse the freeze within 15 minutes if the customer states they are still reliant.  However, at that point we have the conversation with the customers as to how much support and time they need and whether we can get them an appointment in the other banks.  We invite them into our branch where we have Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB in the banking hall and ask whether we can get it done for them.  That is a very important step to get attention for customers who, bear in mind, have had six months&rsquo; notice and any number of contacts.  Rather than jump straight to closing the account completely, irrespective of the numbers, we have introduced this step.</p> <p>  We have done two things for customers who are reliant on their account and have two sources of data on that.  We have been talking to those customers and they are telling us they are banked elsewhere.  We have also researched separately to verify that fact.  We know that 80% of the customers who are heavily banked have a bank account elsewhere.  We know 96% of them know their account will be closed and 91% are telling us they will take action within the next four weeks.  What we have seen over the past two weeks in terms of the changes on the numbers of accounts that are opened and closed, that are not reliant, that have no balance, or that are heavily reliant actually bears that out.  We want to avoid a situation where we are closing accounts where customers are reliant on them.  However, we have told customers that if they leave the account, we will close it for them.  We have said that we would do that and we need to finish that process for customers.  However, the objective is to make sure there is no reliance on the account.  If there is reliance, we can reverse that very quickly and engage with the customer.  We need to keep the momentum going in terms the overall journeys for customers.</p></speech>

I would say we will be in the region of around 1,000.  Based on where we are today, that is not an unreasonable assumption.  These are customers who have no inbound payment, very low or no balance and have had the full notice period.  If any of those 1,000 is still reliant, even if it is one transaction going in, although it will not be an inbound payment form the Department of Social Protection, and if they are telling us their reliance is still there, we will then have the conversation with them.</p></speech>

As Ms Arnett said, as every day passes, we are seeing customers reduce the activity on their accounts.  We are managing that and, as one would expect, looking at it very closely.  In the past two weeks it went down 34% in terms of just high-active customers.  All of the sudden, they can see the deadline is coming, which is what the research told us, and they then actually reduced the activity on their account substantially.  That could be moving their salary, direct debits, standing orders or point of sale on cards &ndash; all sorts of transactions.</p></speech>

We are only talking about the April ones.  If you were sitting down to do this, you would hope these numbers would be very different.  Ms Howard said Ulster Bank will not freeze roughly 4,000 accounts because there is some level of activity and it will probably freeze 1,000 of them.  That is one third of all accounts the bank issued the letters for in April.  That is a lot of accounts.</p></speech>

However, what we expect to happen from current trends is we will see they are just taking a little bit longer.  As a week goes by, they will reduce again.  We can see this every week.

First of all, in October of last year, we reached out to about 1,000 of them where we felt they might need support because of heavy reliance on their overdraft.  In recent weeks, we have sent a text message to about 30,000.  We do not think they have heavy reliance or that they are in financial difficulty, but it is just to see whether they were sorting out their accounts with another provider and whether they needed any support or time.</p> <p>  On the insights on where we are, we have about 58,000 customers with an arranged overdraft and we have seen that reduce significantly.  What we have seen as they have opened accounts elsewhere is they have got an arranged overdraft with another bank.  They are good for the credit.  They are not the problem or the ones we need to be concerned about.  We also have about 39,000 customers who have an unarranged overdraft.  Typically, that is somebody dipping in and out of an overdraft within a month and for less than &euro;100.</p> <p>  In terms of the customers we are concerned about and on the question of what happens if they have not cleared their overdraft when the six-month period comes to an end, we will write out to them.  Obviously, we are contacting them all the way throughout.</p><p>We will write to those customers again at that time to see if they need a further 60 days either to clear the overdraft or to contact us if they require additional support.  As the committee will be aware from previous conversations about us helping mortgage customers, for example, we have 200 specialist staff whose job is to help customers in financial difficulty to see if they can restructure the debt.  It might be the case that some customers need to restructure that debt as a reducing loan.  It might be that they need help with refinancing but-----</p></speech>

However, as a result of the budget, there was a range of additional double payments across the months of October and November.  We paused to understand the number of accounts that will be impacted.  In the meantime, we have developed the capability to extract recipients of payments from the Department of Social Protection as we go.  The challenge is that if customers have never received a payment from the Department of Social Protection, we do not know that they are in receipt of a one-off emergency payment.

We have reviewed approximately 400 cases of very vulnerable customers and power of attorney is an issue that often arises.  Where we can and where we are very confident that there is not a customer safety issue or a question of financial vulnerability, we can work with - it would be wrong to use the word "bypass" - the customer and his or her family, and the other bank, to ensure we are moving the money into a single name account, into the other bank, without having to go through the costly process of attaining power of attorney.  Equally, we have found customers where power of attorney would have been granted in the UK.  We will obviously not make the customer go through that process here.  We are taking a pragmatic approach but customer safety is at the heart of it.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked more broadly about other supports for customers who might have difficulties.  One of the issues we came across related to residents in nursing homes.  There are approximately 600 nursing homes, private and public, in Ireland, and we have given them the direct contact details of somebody in our local branch or our local area manager, who will work with any patient of a nursing home who needs additional support.  A local person can go into a nursing home and resolve the issues.  We have a customer support line, which is open seven days a week and which has received approximately 8,000 calls.  We have had contact with approximately 70,000 vulnerable customers.  We have done a large outreach to the stakeholders, including Safeguarding Ireland, etc., that represent vulnerable customers.  They have been helpful in giving us a practical compass as to how to respond to customers without putting obstacles in the way, while also maintaining the absolute integrity of the financial safety and security of the individuals in question.  Our colleagues on the front line in our branches have been trained.  As I said, representatives of other financial institutions have come into our branches.  That has worked quite well in putting branch users in contact with-----</p></speech>

BPFI recently issued a guide for vulnerable customers in which these types of issues have been addressed.  Where possible, a very practical approach is being taken.  However, there are some fundamental and underlying issues that require a very close eye to ensure the protection of customers.</p></speech>

I have questions for the representatives of both institutions but might start with Mr. Jansen to give Ms Arnett and Ms Howard a break.  Their interactions with Deputy Doherty were intense, even as an onlooker.  I thank him for his forensic analysis.  I want to pick up on the point Mr. Jansen made about the fact that the estimates are now different to the ones that were made in May, when KBC stated that 52,000 customers would need to open a new account and close their KBC accounts.  That figure has now come down to 39,000.  Mr. Jansen mentioned that fact, but I would like an explanation as to why that estimate has changed.</p></speech>

The balances of those accounts have gone to zero and the activity in those accounts has gone.  The number has reduced from 52,000 to 39,000, which is a positive thing.  We are four months into a 14-month process and the number of customers we see as needing another account or needing to undertake significant switching activity has reduced by approximately 25% in those first four months.  We are seeing good traction every week, as Mr. Jansen mentioned in his opening statement, around the moving of direct debits.  That number is dropping by approximately 3,000 per week and we now have approximately 135,000 direct debits attaching to any of our current accounts.  That is down from well over 200,000 when we started this process.  Overall, from an underlying activity perspective, we are seeing customers actively moving their accounts.</p></speech>

I will ask the following of both institutions.  Engagement with utility companies and third parties in the whole area of direct debit switching is something that has come up quite a bit.  While people may have switched their accounts, they are having difficulty switching over their direct debits with various utility companies, which I will not name.  What engagement have the banks had with the utility companies and other entities over direct debits?  How can we speed up the process?  It is one thing to move an account but if a direct debit does not move over, as Deputy Doherty alluded to, that is where the difficulties arise.</p></speech>

We are very conscious of the fact that our withdrawal put a lot of emphasis and pressure on other stakeholders, other banks and the direct debit originators because a customer cannot fully complete the journey without the support of those stakeholders.  We started a very early process of engagement across the industry.  We were all involved in that.  We brought in what we considered the top 20 direct debit originators, including the large utility companies, the telephone service providers and the insurance providers, to inform them of our plans and the number of accounts coming through.  We have, by and large, seen a very positive response from those service providers, making it much easier for customers to change their details online or over the phone, and just having the information to hand for customers.  In the past four weeks, BPFI hosted a session with direct debit originators to attempt to check how things are going.  Direct debit originators that started early are further ahead in their engagement, it would be fair to say.  Those are more in the energy provider space.  I think those companies are more tuned in.  Perhaps that is unfair because it would imply that others are not, but those companies engaged with us on these issues from a very early stage of the process.</p><p>We have seen a huge decrease in the number of direct debit transactions across the board, not just in the early tranches.  We have seen the levels come down.  We have not come across any situation where it is prohibitively difficult for customers to make the changes.  If customers do have issues, we raise them directly through our engagement with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, which is engaging with the direct debit originators.  There is nothing I can point to that could be described as a blocker in terms of the issues and concerns.</p><p> Initially there was a concern that if everybody used the switcher process, it might be a challenge for direct debit originators, but we are finding that most customers are driving the process themselves, with about 10% using the switcher process and using it effectively.  One of the concerns we have is that customers who do not close their accounts may not fully conclude their direct debit processes.  They might assume we are going to close the account but the direct debit will not get taken from the account.  There could be unintended consequences if an account is left open, so we are watching those sorts of things to make sure that does not happen.</p><p> In terms of payments in, the big one according to our engagements is the Department of Social Protection.  As I said earlier, we are about 85% of the way there, but as we move on in that process, we are going to see more and more vulnerable customers who have not made the change and we are going to work very closely with the Department to resolve that with them.  We have exchanged data and the Department is contacting customers directly whose notice period is coming to an end.  The contact from us and from the Department is proving to be very effective.  Over the weekend, for example, another 2,000 accounts moved on.  It is a work in progress and the broader external communications campaign supports all of that.  In the later tranches, we are seeing customers starting to make changes earlier in the journey.  We just need to stay on it and be there to support customers as much as we can.</p></speech>

We started our formal letter campaign six months ago and almost every customer has now been issued with his or her six months' notice.  Those who have not have been written to separately.  It has been orderly although I absolutely accept that customers had to go out of their way to get new bank accounts.  That time and effort is absolutely appreciated, but as we sit here today, more than 50% of our customers have either closed their account or have started to wind it down considerably to very few transactions. On the question of whether there is a problem with direct debits, the data show they have reduced by more than 50%, our standing orders have reduced by more than 55% and our point of sale transactions have reduced by just over 50%.  All of the indicators are telling us that over 50% of the customers have either completed the journey of choosing a new bank, moving and closing or are well on the way to completing it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101900002#H00400"><p>Our direct debits have gone from about 1 million to under 500,000.  We had 440,000 standing orders and now we have 200,000.  The point of sale transactions have gone from 12 million to 6 million.  These would include things like people tapping to pay for a coffee and so on.  All of our indicators tell us what we are also hearing from our customers and from independent research, which is that customers are well on the way.  In terms of accounts being opened at other banks and in terms of customers having closed or wound down their accounts, we are at over 50%.  It has been orderly and we want those trends and the momentum to continue.  We want to continue to do this in an orderly fashion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Darragh Lennon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101900002#H00500"><p>To add to that in relation to the direct debits, we are engaged in similar industry initiatives.  I will not run through them again but what we have seen is that when direct debit originators proactively communicate with their customers, that is very effective.  When they approach their customers, point out they are paying a direct debit from a KBC or Ulster Bank account and ask them to take action, that is very effective.  We have seen that with the Department of Social Protection in particular, which has conducted a really strong campaign with customers.  We have seen our social welfare payments dropping by 35% in the first four months of our programme, which is very positive, and 90% of what we have left are child benefit payments.  That is a positive as well in that the likelihood of vulnerability is lessening as we get through those.  Some of the bigger utilities have done great work in terms of contacting their customers directly and asking them to close their accounts.  When they do that, it definitely has a massive and positive impact.  We are encouraging that through the BPFI groups, which meet every two weeks, and through our own engagements.  We did an industry briefing where we brought all of the direct debit originators together two weeks ago.  We are trying to share our plans with them so that they understand when these letters are going to reach customers and when the closures are going to hit next year.  We are trying to keep them as well informed as possible so that we can make sure, as Ms Howard said, that this is a very orderly process.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has been clear in its instruction to the industry.  If, for example, a customer misses an insurance payment because of a mismatch in terms of moving accounts, there will not be a break in cover for that customer.  Equally, if there is a missed payment on a loan because that payment got lost in the system during the changing of accounts, customers will not be automatically added to the credit register.  These are important measures to make sure customers are protected as they are transitioning.</p></speech>

In her opening statement on behalf of Ulster Bank, Ms Howard said the bank is "committed to dealing with our non-performing loans in the later stages of our withdrawal, to allow customers who are in difficulty as much time and support as possible to return to a performing position".  What kind of engagement is the bank having with those people?  I am concerned that those whose loans were already non-performing prior to the enormous increase in the cost of living will potentially be finding it even more difficult at this point.  What is the plan for those non-performing loans if they remain non-performing at the point of closure?</p></speech>

The decision to leave non-performing customers until later in the process was very deliberate.  We were working very hard with those customers through case clinics to see how we could get them onto a performing basis, and that was very successful.  What we wanted to do was get them reperforming so that they would be in the sale, either to PTSB or to AIB, in line with the transactions we have agreed.</p></speech>

We put them to the end of the process because we knew we had hundreds of customers who were reperforming and it was very important we kept them reperforming so that they would go to either AIB or PTSB and not into a non-performing loan sale.  We have done that as far as possible.</p></speech>

What is going to happen to them?  What impact will it have on those customers in terms of paying back their loan and their credit rating?</p></speech>

We have said we will endeavour to do that towards the end of next year.  Those customers whose loans are non-performing still have their protections in place today but that time will come.  We have tried to help as many customers as possible to reach performing status but those who cannot get back to that status will ultimately form part of a non-performing loan sale.</p></speech>

Some of my constituents have had their loans sold on and they have received very threatening letters from companies and so on.  Those letters did not have any legal standing.  In one particular case, such a letter arrived a week after a member of the person's family was buried.  I am quite concerned about this.  Ms Howard said protections remain in place, but what does she mean by that?  How will this affect people's credit rating?  What protections can Ulster Bank provide to these people if it sells off their loans in a non-performing loan sale?</p></speech>

That should include the way and manner in which customers are approached, regardless of who the provider is.  On the credit rating, if somebody has reached a non-performing loan status it is going to impact their credit rating.  We are very open with customers about that, which is why we have spent time with specialist people to try to get customers into a re-performing position.</p></speech>

I thank the officials.  The crucial point from me is the reality we see when we are dealing with constituents whose non-performing loan is sold is they are not dealt with in a respectful manner.  They are sent letters that can be really upsetting.  I am very concerned about how that is going to impact on people, especially given the situation at the moment with the rising cost of living, inflation and all of that.  I would love to talk about it more but unfortunately I have to leave to go to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests and thank them for coming before the committee.  What did it cost NatWest or Ulster Bank to close down?  There was a cost, I assume.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  I am not being difficult.</p></speech>

It would be helpful to us, so the question stands.  There had to be a cost to either NatWest or Ulster Bank.  Who funded it and what was it?  That is one question.  Second, there was obviously a cost to customers due to disruption of service, closure, trying to meet deadlines and so on and so forth.  Third, we all heard about the time we were encouraged to seek alternative services, which we essentially had to do ourselves.  Nobody from any of the banks said we have decided to transfer your account, if it necessary and if it is acceptable, to bank X, Y or Z.  In that case it could have been done with the press of a button and no more waiting, queuing, asking questions, bills for outstanding issues and so on and so forth.  Ulster Bank has been helpful in trying to resolve these but it did not stop the gurus in the system from resurrecting themselves from time to time and attempting to exert their influence.  Some of that is going to remain, to put it mildly, in the closure of accounts.  Will the customers all get a closing statement on each account?</p></speech>

Just to be clear, if any customer needs other statements, such as where they have an overdraft with us and want to get one with another bank, then they may need to provide statements to show how their account has worked.  We make it clear to those customers they might want to get three months' worth of statements to take so they can go to another bank.  I will follow up on the point on the closing statements because that should be happening.</p></speech>

New requests for further information have the habit of resurrecting from time to time.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty raised overdrafts.  Some customers have traditionally had overdrafts for years, that they have or have not used as the case may be.  As I did not get the answer too clearly, what provision has been made for these customers when they move to a new bank?  Do they get the same as they did in the previous institution or is it all up in the air and for the new bank to decide on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jane Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022101900002#J01600"><p>It is the responsibility of the new bank to make the decision.  It would have to do that to be in line with the guidelines from the Central Bank.  It is important everybody follows those guidelines to keep customers safe.  If a customer is good for the credit, namely, they have a good financial history with us and can show that, there is no reason they would not get the overdraft limit they have with Ulster Bank or KBC today.  There are some customers - they are the 1,000 I referred to before - we think may need more help but we will work with those customers.  We have reached out to them and asked them to contact us so our specialist people in our collections area can help them if they are in financial difficulty.  The same applies to everybody, really, who has a debt in financial difficulty.  That could be an overdraft, a credit card or mortgages, as we talked about earlier.  With anybody in financial difficulty we constantly reach out and say "come and talk to us and let us see how we can help you".  If somebody is good for the credit, with a good credit rating and no history of defaulting on any debts, there is no reason they would not get the overdraft they have with Ulster Bank today from another bank, but that receiving bank must follow the guidelines.</p></speech>

We have a facility now that if the customer opens their current account with AIB then the overdraft can be moved automatically.  We also have some business loans for smaller businesses moving to Permanent TSB and we have in place a process that makes it easier for the application.  We give the customer a code and it goes into the Permanent TSB system and much of the information flows automatically across.  It does not guarantee the overdraft for the customer because Permanent TSB assesses on the other side but it certainly makes it easier for business customers for those lines of credit.</p></speech>

There is a difference in the interest rate charged in that some replacement banks receiving the accounts say "sorry, we do not do overdrafts but we will give you a credit card".  What they do not say immediately is that credit card will cost you 15%, 17%, 21% or whatever the case may be.  The customer has no choice in the matter.  It is not really replacing the service the customer had with a new one, hence there is a negative from the customer's point of view.  I would have thought particular effort would be made for business and personal account holders to try to continue as they previously were.  I am not talking about accounts that are in disorder, difficulty, stressed or whatever the case may be.  I am talking about accounts in general, accounts that are in good order and whether or not any effort can be made to address those issues because there is a negative from the point of view of the customer if there is only one alternative and it costs between 5% and 8% more.  Why should it be that way?</p></speech>

On the personal customers, I cannot comment, and it would not be right for me to comment, on what other banks and financial institutions do.  However, a customer should not be forced down a particular route, whether it is a credit card or an overdraft.  We all have regulations under conduct to ensure we look after customers.  If a customer has an overdraft and it is the right product for them then that is the product that should be given to them.  All banks must follow the conduct rules to ensure the customers have the right product.  If the Deputy has individual cases it would be appropriate for them to be referred to the particular bank in hand.</p></speech>

It should not happen and I realise it should not but there is a positive for the incoming bank if the customer is moved from an overdraft at 2.5%, 3% or whatever it was to suddenly one of almost 20% and rising.  I therefore ask that be borne in mind and that perhaps in the exchanges the officials have with the receiving banks, they would be reminded of that as well.  All things being equal, we expect to be treated with a certain amount of equality.</p><p>Ms Howard and Ms Arnett have been helpful in dealing with queries that I should not have to raise with them.  They should be dealt with by making a simple call instead of waiting on a line somewhere where if you want such and such a service you, press one; if you want another service, press two; if you want a further service, press three; and so on indefinitely.  I am not saying it is only their bank that does this; many other institutions do it as well.  Eventually, somebody says "Thank you, goodbye."  Representing customers and you tell them that is the response you get, it does not go down too well.</p></speech>

I like this one.  This is an interesting one.  It is where the account does not close despite an indication that it has done so.  There was some little tail-end left hanging in the wilderness still outstanding.  It could be anything.  The customer presumes the account is closed and walks off about his or her business, suddenly to get a bill for a small amount - in one case brought to my attention it was a terribly small amount, like pence or cents - and a fee for late payment.  When I heard that ,I was not moved to mirth because it is the original bureaucrat's idea of walking away and saying, "But you didn't think of this coming."  If unresponded to by the customer after a month, there is another late payment.  Now there is a deficit that has to be paid, a liability that the customer has to pay through no fault of his or her own.</p></speech>

We would not expect the customer to pay.  That is an error on our part and we would reimburse them for that and close the account appropriately.  We will look into it to make sure.  I have not seen any complaints on that but we will check that we do not have that issue.</p></speech>

We have received some customer complaints on that and have rectified that, without any doubt.  I appreciate the comment that we should have worked on that earlier; therefore we have changed that.  Moreover, we are not charging any maintenance fees on accounts since June.  That is a charge we cannot make customers incur.</p></speech>

I would like to know before KBC leaves the country.  I know it will pay and presume it will honour the court decision but I am worried about the time it is taking for the legal advisers to inform the bank to pay the customer.  If it has reached that point and a decision has been made, it means the customer and bank have been through the courts for a lengthy period.  Are there such cases?  Can the witnesses check with their legal representatives to ensure they are clearing their desks in respect of this, the bank is being told in a timely fashion what has to be paid and is, in a timely fashion, paying customers?  I will not raise the particular case but I understand there were a few cases like that.  It had to do with properties in County Kerry.</p></speech>

I wish to see no shortcuts being taken in transferring an account or selling a loan to a vulture fund, without first exhausting every avenue with the customer to see whether the matter can be resolved, in order that there is less and less difficulty for a customer.  I have no trust in the vulture funds.  I wish to be clear about that.  Once a customer gets in there, one starts to lose control of the management of one's property or loan.  It is much better if it is dealt with by the bank in the fair way that you describe.</p></speech>

People are experiencing the fact that they are a politically exposed person and its consequences for the first time, especially politicians at local level who would not have had to go through that when they have had an account with Ulster Bank or KBC Bank.  What is happening with those customers?  Do I take it that when they move to another bank, in spite of having a record with either one of your banks, they then have to go through all of the processes for politically exposed persons?</p></speech>

We did so just to make sure it was on their radar that there is a lengthy process and to give them information as to the sort of documentation that would be required, in order that they did not get caught starting the process when the letter came from us and maybe run out of time.

Deputies Doherty and Durkan mentioned that they have direct debits and payments going through their accounts.  There is nothing wrong, except that this the process is completely new.  My experience having spoken to a number of banks is that they do not really want politically exposed persons, because the Central Bank will ask for that information first and foremost when the banks are examined.  We have become a breed of political animal that no one wants to own.</p> <p>  Will Ulster Bank and KBC Bank confirm that those customers who are marginalised for one reason or another and are finding it hard to cope with the dates, such as elderly people, will be treated fairly?  I ask that the banks reach out to them to make sure that they are covered in their transfer from either one of your banks to the new bank.</p></speech>

Not all elderly customers are vulnerable and I do not wish for anybody to think that is how we think of them.  However, we recognised that elderly customers may have had their bank account with us for a long time and, therefore, changing could be a bigger issue for them.  What we have seen - interestingly - is that our older customers were the first to move and to complete the process.  We have actually seen more of them move than our category of age 25 to 45.  They seemed to take action earlier and more swiftly but, nonetheless, we have reached out to them.  We will have some customers who definitely are vulnerable and older such as customers in a nursing home.  That is why we are reaching out to them in different ways.  There are different types of vulnerability, among which is age.</p></speech>

The general scheme has been referred to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, and the committee is required to report on it by 14 November.  To enable the committee to consider this matter, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Muiris O&rsquo;Connor, assistant secretary, research and development and health analytics division; Ms Bronwyn Conway, bioethics unit; and Ms Caitriona Mason, bioethics unit, Department of Health.</p> <p>  All those in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Connor to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022101900002#A00500"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  I welcome the opportunity to present the Bill to the committee.  I am assistant secretary in the Department of Health.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Caitriona Mason and Ms Bronwyn Conway, from the bioethics unit in the Department.  I would like to outline the rationale behind the introduction of the Bill, before briefly addressing some of its main provisions.  As members will be aware, the purpose of this Bill is to ensure safe access to termination of pregnancy services.</p> <p>  Since 2019, when the termination of pregnancy service commenced within participating maternity units and general practices across Ireland, there have been periodic reports of demonstrations and anti-abortion group gatherings outside facilities providing termination of pregnancy services.  We are mindful of the distress, anxiety and damage to the health and well-being of those subjected to such protests, which risk, in some instances, deterring women from accessing the medical care they need.  This is particularly true considering such demonstrations often disproportionately affect the most marginalised and vulnerable sections of our society.  In light of these incidents and cognisant of their impact on service users and providers, the Minister for Health is committed to delivering on the programme for Government, which promises to "establish exclusion zones around medical facilities".  In furtherance of this objective, the aim of this general scheme and its underlying policy is to protect the right of a woman to access a healthcare service safely, with privacy and dignity, and without facing unsolicited attempts to influence her decision.  It will also protect service providers and their staff in the course of their duties and responsibilities.  </p> <p>  We can all agree that it is in the public interest to ensure that healthcare services, including termination of pregnancy services, can be accessed safely and privately by those who need them, and this is what this general scheme proposes to deliver.  Primarily, this is achieved through the creation of safe access zones.  The proposals aim to establish a 100 m safe access zone around all healthcare facilities that can provide termination of pregnancy services, not just those that currently do, including, for example, all hospitals and GP practices.  This is to ensure that the legislation will not highlight the specific service sites where termination of pregnancy services are currently provided and will allow them to continue in relative anonymity.  Within those zones, conduct which is intended to, or may reasonably have the effect of, influencing the decision of a person in relation to availing of, or providing, services related to termination of pregnancy will be prohibited.  Head 4 sets out a comprehensive, though non-exhaustive, list of such behaviours.  The goal here is to ensure that conduct aimed at impeding access or influencing the decisions of service users or providers within these zones is addressed to the greatest extent possible to allow the legislation to deliver on its objectives.  In addition to these provisions, further protection is afforded by head 6.  This head aims to prevent, repeated behaviours amounting to intimidation or harassment, including campaigns aimed towards healthcare providers, irrespective of where they are committed.  The purpose here is to mitigate against the impact, that could arise from such conduct, on a service provider&rsquo;s choice to offer termination of pregnancy services.  It is also to ensure that the potential provision of termination of pregnancy services is maximised to the greatest extent, and to avoid disproportionate impacts on access to and provision of services geographically.  </p> <p>  However, in advancing these proposals, it is recognised that protecting the rights of service users and service providers must be balanced against protecting the rights of those engaged in legitimate protest.  In balancing the various rights involved, the general scheme restricts specified conduct, but also aims to limit the scope of such restrictions to that which is strictly necessary.</p><p>To this end, head 5 sets out specific exemptions that may apply in the context of prohibited conduct within safe access zones and the corresponding offences.  In doing so, this head also further acknowledges and promotes, on a proportionate basis, the balancing of various human and constitutional rights.  Critically, this head further makes clear that the Bill will not impede, impact on, prohibit or criminalise anything done by healthcare and other staff of the healthcare provider in the normal functions of the healthcare service.</p><p> The proposed legislation preserves the right to protest against abortion and speak out in favour or against it, apart from in the limited areas to be covered by safe access zones.  Additionally, to ensure an appropriate balance between countervailing rights, the Department has engaged with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Data Protection Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties seeking any observations they may have on the proposals.</p><p> In regard to enforcement, it is essential An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be provided with relevant powers to manage and respond appropriately to offences under this general scheme, and these are mainly set out in head 7.  Overall, in keeping with the principle of proportionality, the general scheme provides for a graduated approach to enforcement to ensure that any restriction on rights is minimised.</p><p> Finally, head 8 sets out the penalties arising from offences under the scheme, which have been provided for on an escalating basis, where harsher penalties may apply at the discretion of the court for repeat offences.</p><p> The development of a dedicated, stand-alone safe access zones legislation will comprehensively address, and mitigate insofar as possible, the potential for a person's access to a termination of pregnancy to be impacted or influenced at the point of access.  It will provide additional assurance to healthcare providers that they will be afforded protections should their services become the target of specified conduct that could interfere with their service provision and staff.  In putting these protections in place, the legislation will deliver on a programme for Government commitment.  The Minister is anxious to see the Bill drafted as quickly as possible in order that it can be introduced to the Oireachtas, and the Department will continue to work closely with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in drafting the final Bill, recognising all the complexities involved.</p><p> I thank committee members for their patience and attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to take questions from them on the legislation.</p></speech>

He and his colleagues are all welcome to the meeting.  I reiterate that the committee is required to report on this matter by 14 November, which creates great challenges for the committee.  We have asked for submissions as part of this process.  Many have come in and we are still expecting some more.  It will be a severe challenge for the committee and we will meet later in private session to discuss that.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Durkan.  Will he confirm he is on the precincts of Leinster House?</p></speech>

I welcome our guests and thank them for their contribution to the legislation.  I am in two minds as to its effectiveness.  We have to go back to the original provisions of the legislation, the constitutional provisions and the legislation as published.  It was intended to address the issue whereby a service was available to women who wished to seek that service, at their discretion, under the assumption they could do so without appearing to be the target of anybody who feels they may be breaking the law.</p> <p>  I am not a supporter of abortion for abortion's sake and I do not think most people are, but what is at issue is whether women can access whatever services may require, or men either, for that matter, in all the public hospitals that are listed as providing the service, without being identified.  I foresee a problem in that the legislation, in trying to help, may find itself to be counterproductive.  By virtue of the exclusion zones, the identification of all such hospitals, centres, GPs and so on is going to be obvious to the protestor, and that is going to cause unnecessary pressure.  I do not know how effective the exclusion zones will be, how they will be managed and whether they will be respected.  In the US, they have not been successful; there have been constant pressures and attacks by groups of different mindsets.  As a result, women have been frightened by what has been put before them in the sense of protests, and that is understandable.  I accept what this legislation is trying to do, but I am not sure it will do what was intended.</p> <p>  I am not certain it is a good idea to identify areas where given services, such as terminations, are available because that merely does a favour for those who want to protest, and protesting may not be the only thing they want to do.  It could have serious consequences for the people the legislation is trying to protect.  My views on the subject are well known.  I am not certain, again judging by the experience in the US, which I have studied, that it is a good idea to identify the locations.  It is difficult to protect the people who need to use such services for whatever reason.  I am concerned we will find it is not possible to protect people, in which case the legislation will be seen to be weak and the protestors will achieve victory, for how long I do not know.  Whatever about the ready identification of hospitals and health centres where services under the legislation are available, I do not know how the enforcement of the 100 m ban can be applied, especially throughout the country and at different times.  Instead, I would emphasise the need to ensure that services, as envisaged under the legislation and supported by the referendum, are readily available to those who have a need to avail of them as and when required.</p> <p>  Various reasons have been put forward as to why there should be changes.  Some of the changes proposed might be for the better and others might not.  I was a member of the original committee that examined the issue and I voted for the changes, simply to improve and protect the services available to those who might need to avail of them and to remove any stigma or identification of their situation in order that they could confidentially avail of the services as and when they required.</p> <p>  I will vote for the legislation.  I am merely pointing out what I see as potential difficulties and I would like a response to them.</p></speech>

We are well aware that patients attending any health service and their family members are often at a vulnerable point in their lives and it is vital to afford safety, privacy and dignity to everyone in accessing all health services.</p> <p>  We are aware of the point the Deputy raised about the danger of the legislation being counterproductive.  We do not propose in the legislation to afford the protection of the Bill only to those providing termination of pregnancy services.  The protections will be provided to all health facilities that can provide such services, meaning all GPs and other medical practitioners in maternity hospitals.</p><p>The safe access zones legislation is intended to apply to all those services and thereby not draw particular attraction to GP practices that are currently providing termination of pregnancy services.</p><p> We are conscious the legislation introducing termination of pregnancy services is new and with Covid and so forth, the services are in their early stages.  We are determined to support their roll-out as envisaged as part of integrated care.  The comparisons with America do no hold up fully because of an important policy decision taken by these Houses to incorporate the services within primary care and secondary care.  That in itself offers some protection.  No one can know the purpose of anyone's reason to access a health service so there is some privacy afforded there and we will not make the mistake of zoning in on those services that are currently providing termination of pregnancy services because we want the numbers providing these services to continue to grow as the service rolls out.  I thank the Deputy.  We are very alive to the concerns he raises.</p></speech>

For instance, you cannot take three or four weeks to make up your mind and there are a number of people who by virtue of conscience do not offer the service.  The services that are proposed, legislated for and were the subject of a referendum are very strongly recommended to be made available with anonymity and regular and easy availability so the citizen, who in this case is a woman, may have access to them without being afraid of being identified or pilloried.  That applies to any service that might be sought in a hospital, health centre or wherever else.  There must be a fair amount of anonymity such that if a service becomes a target, or those who want to protest identify particular locations, then the failure to adhere to the constitutional approval and the legislative provisions is in question.  Any impedance, anything that frightens the person seeking a service, for instance, if a person has any illness or ailment-----</p></speech>

It is to ensure the privacy and safety of service users and service providers are protected.  As for accessing services in a timely manner, a key part of that is ensuring availability of these services on a widespread basis as a core part of primary care and secondary care, as appropriate.</p> <p>  Issues relating to the termination of pregnancy Act are currently subject to intensive external review by Marie O'Shea.  She will be looking at all those issues, including the geographical dispersal or current services, the views of service users and providers, the providers' experience of delivering the service in the early phase and any guidance on the extent to which the services are operating consistent with the intentions of, as the Deputy said, the will of the people and the will of these Houses as expressed in the Act.</p></speech>

I support this legislation as it makes its way through the Oireachtas.  If members can be helpful in speeding up that process, we should be, but we must do our job of pre-legislative scrutiny also, as I am sure the witnesses understand.</p> <p>  We received eight submissions and based on my reading of them, they all broadly welcome the heads of the Bill.  That is good.  The HSE submission is interesting.  It supports the Bill in principle but refers to some practical challenges, one of which is the area of enforcement.  However, we have not received a submission, as far as I can see, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Has one been sought and, if so, is it going to come our way?  As was noted, there is a time constraint on our work.</p></speech>

We will meet in private session later but given that a number of organisations have raised practical concerns about enforcement, it would have been better to have the Garda submission.  When we receive it we will have to give it its due attention.  In the list of submissions, the one received from the Pro-Life Campaign is currently unavailable because it is with the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, for clearance.  I assume there are legal issues with it.  Was there a concern that the submission was defamatory?  Is that why it was sent to the OPLA?</p></speech>

My point is we want to hear from all sides but when any organisation makes a submission it must not be defamatory as otherwise we cannot do our job.  I wanted to make that point.</p> <p>  I move to the HSE submission.  I have a number of points to make because the context is important here and some people will ask why we need this legislation.  The HSE submission makes the reasons very clear because it refers to weekly, and sometimes monthly, anti-abortion protests outside maternity hospitals, mainly in Dublin, and also outside GP surgeries.  It refers to the display of religious imagery and messages, graphic images of foetuses and, in some instances, physical and verbal aggression.  No woman or person should be subject to any type of intimidation or physical or verbal aggression from anybody when entering a healthcare premises.  The fact that this is happening on a weekly or monthly basis is unacceptable.  The HSE submission also states some GPs are willing to provide the service but are concerned about potentially attracting protests.  Again, that is a reason we need this legislation.  It also refers to the potential for significant psychological impact on women.  I think we can all agree that if women are subject to harassment and intimidation, it will have a psychological impact on them.  The submission sets out very clearly why we need this legislation, as do the submissions from other organisations.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions on heads 4 and 6.  Head 4 refers to "prohibited conduct".  It seems to be the lesser of the charges.  Persons convicted - it is a summary conviction - of an offence under what would be prohibited conduct in head 4 are liable to a class E fine for a first offence, a class D fine for a second offence and a class C fine for a third offence.  What is "prohibited conduct" in the context of this head?  Will the witnesses summarise that for the committee?</p></speech>

We have benefited greatly from their input and they continue to be available to us.</p></speech>

The point I was making is that we have our job to do, which is to hear from all of those stakeholders.  Given that the HSE and others have raised concerns about enforcement, it is important for us in our work to hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not doubt it worked very closely with the Department.</p></speech>

We absolutely appreciate the distress and anxiety involved.  There is evidence from other jurisdictions where such protest happen on the distress that is felt beyond the incident itself.  It can be a very uncomfortable experience for women trying to access services.</p> <p>  Head 4 relates to the prohibited conduct.  In striking the right balance of proportionality, we are not excluding protest from these zones.  The identification and definition of prohibited conduct is set out in head 4.  It is the subject of ongoing meticulous further development by the Department in consultation with and with the support of the Office of the Attorney General.  It sets out the types of interference we wish to make illegal within the safe access zones.  Interfering or attempting to interfere by any means with a service provider or any person-----</p></speech>

Does that include displaying religious imagery and messages and graphic images of fetuses as was outlined in the HSE submission we got?</p></speech>

It terms of the Department's conversations with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there were media reports that the Garda Commissioner might have concerns about the ability to enforce this legislation.  I am not sure if that is correct and I do not want to do him any disservice.  Mr. O'Connor stated the Department had a constructive engagement with the Garda, which is good.  Are there concerns or what type of concerns were expressed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

There is complexity around the term "curtilage", the perimeter of a facility and around it and operationally, whether someone could know he or she was 100 m from it.</p></speech>

Are the Garda representatives given comfort by what they have seen from heads 4 and 6 that they would have the ability to enforce this measure?</p></speech>

We continue to work with the Garda but what is presented to the committee in the current draft benefits greatly from its input.  In terms of operational terms, the Garda felt the facility to clarify to people that they are breaking the law, that they are in a safe access zone and that what they are doing is illegal, in the sense of a warning, was a further assurance around proportionality, as was the assurance during an interaction that on being informed of his or her action being illegal, such a person was then operating intentionally.  The offence then is subsequent to that Garda warning.  That is how we have benefited from interaction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Attorney General is helping to set out the definitions.</p></speech>

I want to see the submission from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would be important in the context of our work but to reiterate the point I started with, it is unacceptable that people are intimidated in any way by going to any healthcare setting.  Given what we have heard from the HSE and our own anecdotal evidence of intimidation, harassment, and abuse, this Bill is necessary and I will be fully supporting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.582" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022101900002#D02000"><p>I welcome all the guests this morning and thank them for their presentation.  I will start by stating I fully support this legislation and certainly most members of the committee will do all they can to ensure its speedy passage when published.  There is no doubt that the current frequency of protests outside healthcare facilities is extremely disturbing and upsetting for people availing of services.  It is worth repeating that everyone in this country has a right to access all legal health services free from intimidation and harassment and that has to be the starting point.  The other aspect of this of course is that these protests have a very chilling effect on the provision of services, both in terms of GP and hospital services.  We have to remind ourselves that we still are at a very early stage in terms of the provision of abortion services on a countrywide basis in that currently, only 413 GPs have a contract for the provision of terminations.  We are still at a point where only 11 of the 19 maternity hospitals provide termination services.  There is a very long way to go and there is no doubt, particularly in rural areas, that the threat of protest does not encourage people - GPs or hospitals - to provide services.  That is why this legislation is absolutely necessary and we need to have it in place very quickly.</p> <p>  I will raise a number of issues with Mr. O'Connor about the heads of the legislation.  First is an issue that came up in feedback the organisation Together for Safety came across, namely, the need to ensure that industrial action is protected at hospitals and at GP surgeries.  To what extent has this been provided for and how does the Department intend to ensure this legislation does not cut across the right to industrial action, which is obviously a very basic right? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022101900002#D02100"><p>I thank the Deputy.  She has summarised the reason for the legislation superbly well and we also are highly conscious, with the service being in its infancy, of the chilling effect.  The actual protests cause harm and distress but we think fear of protests is constraining the roll-out.</p><p>We are conscious of the incompleteness of the roll-out of services but encouraged by the trajectories.  Eleven of the 19 maternity hospitals are currently providing this service and we think there will be two or three more within a year or so.  Likewise, the 413 GPs mentioned are only one eighth of the total number of GPs in the country.  Again, the review by Marie O'Shea will look at geographical dispersion but, without breaching confidentiality, just to reassure us and see what we can do to support the services.</p><p> On industrial action, the Department took a view that protests by staff and the trade union or other related industrial action is not within the scope of prohibited conduct under the proposed legislation.  We feel that it is unlikely that such activities would fall within the scope of head 4(2) as such activity is not intended or could not reasonably have the effect of influencing a person's decision to access termination of pregnancy, to interfere with a person's access or the provision of a termination of pregnancy service.  I can very clear state that it is absolutely not the policy intent to prohibit industrial action within the safe access zones.  We are continuing to engage with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

Is it the intention to have an explicit clause in that section to ensure that industrial action is protected?</p></speech>

The current advice we have is that it would not be captured by the prohibited conduct under head 4.  We continue to engage with the Office of the Attorney General and if an express exemption is needed then it will be put in.</p></speech>

There is no point in having legislation on the books unless it is clearly enforceable from a practical perspective.  One of the concerns to arise is that under the proposed legislation, in order for an offence to be committed under head 4(7), a person must have been previously issued with a warning pursuant to head 4(5).  It is very hard to get one's head around how that would work in practical terms so please talk us through that.  What about record keeping?  Are you saying that in order for Garda to prosecute somebody then he or she must have had a previous warning?  How is it recorded that a person would have had a previous warning so that he or she could then be prosecuted?</p></speech>

There have been a number of comments on this matter and we continue to work with the Office of the Attorney General as to whether that should be "may record" or "shall record".  We are working through that aspect with the Office of the Attorney General as we speak.  The rationale behind the warning is that this is a delicate balance of constitutional rights.</p></speech>

An area of 100 m came into play reasonably early.  It is a distance that people have a reasonable specific sense of and we had to do some boundary.  Discussions with the Attorney General on the refinement of the legislation has raised problems around the term "curtilage", which I had not heard before this piece of work.  Again, that is not commonly understood and makes it difficult for the garda's interaction with an individual.  We are moving to something much more specific now.  It will be 100 m from entrance or egress points for healthcare facilities, which is a distance that is a bit more operational.</p></speech>

I thank the Department's staff for working so hard on this legislation, progressing it and engaging with the Seanad Bill that came through.  It is worthwhile saying at this stage that this is incredibly complex legislation and the Department must strike the right balance.  As much as I want this legislation to be enacted urgently, and we must seek to have this done by Christmas, I am very aware that we must be quite delicate with the legislation and make sure that we do this work correctly.</p> <p>  I want to discuss the reality of enforcement and, funnily enough, I want to talk about the word "curtilage".  Any architect in the State will know the word well as it is very well set out in our conservation legislation.  I have a concern around how we might treat the grounds and decide where 100 m begins, and how the service provider engages on the issue.  Many of our older health service buildings are on land that looks almost institutional so they have gates and a carpark.  So if we set this at the entrance then 100 m will still allow people to be directly outside a hospital, for example.  That is the nature of our estates and healthcare buildings in this country.  It might be worth looking at the definition of curtilage in other legislation but certainly it is meaningful in terms of planning and other issues.</p><p>I would like to talk a little bit about that.</p><p> I would also like the witnesses to talk about the responsibility of the healthcare provider in deciding where the 100 m is, even with the curtilage or the front door.  Are healthcare providers or GPs expected to draw a line on the ground, as when we were queueing for a shot during Covid, or will the Garda take on that role?  Within that, I also have a concern around some of the requirements if service providers continue to see people outside.  I am wary of anything that relies on a service provider to report because, ultimately, the service provider staff might have their own opinions about these issues.  A lot of responsibility would be put on the service provider.  Perhaps we could start with all of these issues around the implementation part of this.</p><p> I am glad that the HSE is talking with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the beginning, groups like Together for Safety have been engaged in this conversation.  There has been a statement from the Garda that we do not need this legislation and I am interested to see whether maybe it cannot be enforced, which is an issue.  I wonder where that change happened.  I am asking all of the questions at once and hopefully the witnesses can answer them.</p><p> I also want to know about inclusive language within the text.  I would like to see a recognition of pregnant people rather than just women.  This affects families and people of every group.</p><p> The Department has outlined this a little bit but I would like to know about the definition of "intimidation, harassment and aggression".  There is a gender issue here.  I believe it came up in conversations with the Garda regarding what people define for themselves as intimidation.  Often it is not engagement in any way.  One does not have to reach out to somebody or offer them a leaflet to intimidate them.  One can intimidate another person just by being a presence.  I would like quite a broad interpretation of that.  Under head 6, is there engagement about persistent harassment on social media for service providers, many of whom are on social media?  I am sorry that I have thrown some tough questions at the officials.</p></speech>

She is correct about where we are at on the detail of enforcement, the reality of enforcement, the perimeters of the zone, and the merits of the term "curtilage" in this instance.  She is also correct about the old facilities with the gate and the drive in and so forth.  On the issue of finding a specific point of entry or exit, it is the entry and exit onto the public space.  Our latest thinking in the old-school gated premises is that it is the gate.  The interface with the public space is the access point.</p></speech>

On the Garda involvement, from early on we got great support from the Department of Justice and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Their input was practical and helpful in exactly the kinds of areas the Deputy has spoken about for the curtilage and the extent to which we can rely on people to understand that.  Garda&iacute; warning and informing people that they are breaching the law and that they are in a zone will also be important.</p></speech>

I am not a legal expert and I am better on buildings than I am on the law, but as far as I know having no knowledge of the law is not a defence for breaking the law.  I am keen that there would be a required noting of the warnings.  That would be helpful.  There is a significant grey area around that when someone is interfacing with garda&iacute;.</p></speech>

Deputy Shortall's feedback was valuable with the suggestion of a centralised log of recordings so that multiple instances in different locations or attempts to be evasive in relation to it would be found.</p> <p>  The issue of gender-neutral language is a complex area.  It was always the intention that a biologically female individual who identifies as a male would enjoy the same rights as a woman for the purposes of the 2018 Act.  This would also be our intention around safe access zones.  There is complexity around deviating from language in other legislation around this.  We are also looking at this.</p> <p>  We are conscious of the issues around harassment, the advice to go abroad, and the interpretation of harassment, but it must be balanced against proportionality and implementability.  As the Deputy will see in head 6, we are reminded that harassment is forbidden in all circumstances to protect providers from the kind of intimidation that could happen quite regularly and that could happen well outside the physical space of the 100 m zone.  The Deputy will be well aware of the various mechanisms on social media that can be used to harass and intimidate service providers.  We will be as broad as we can about that harassment, which comes under head 6.  We must be quite refined with the zone and the definition, and we are doing a lot of work to get specific on the prohibitive actions within the zones.  I thank the Deputy.</p></speech>

In line with a graduated approach to policing, there is a discretionary power for garda&iacute; to issue a direction, then it goes into people being arrested, and there are penalties for first offence, second offence and third offence.  These are set out in the heads of the Bill.  I reiterate that this is the subject of ongoing engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

Are we satisfied that we have done enough?  If we bring forward legislation which clearly prevents anyone from protesting or in any way intimidating anyone attending such a facility, the next available option is to go to the homes of medical practitioners but also staff such as nurses or administrators.  Are we satisfied that we have sufficient protection for them if we bring forward this legislation?</p></speech>

That is extremely serious and it does not take into account the number of nursing staff and care assistants who have been assaulted in hospital services.  The IMO is making sure that it is not just what is in the Bill, but that causing alarm, distress or harm would also be included.</p></speech>

Thank you for letting me in, Chairman.  I want to pick up on the last point first.  In January, it will be four years since the legislation to allow women to procure abortion in Ireland was enacted.  Straight away, when it was passed in 2019, there were pickets and protests outside GP surgeries and doctors' clinics.</p><p>The legislation was passed in the spirit of many promises that were given, some of which are still being enacted such as the provision of free contraception and looking at free sex education in schools so that as a whole package, the need for intervention in crisis pregnancy will be undermined but crisis pregnancy will also be able to be dealt with.</p><p> Four years is a long time to have something that was shadowed in the legislation, that is, the provision of safe access zones, not even being close to being passed yet.  This has been said by many Deputies and Senators but the question of urgency cannot be overemphasised.  This will not be passed before January 2023.  I am quite sure of that from hearing what the witnesses have said, which means that four years on, we do not have safe access zones.  That is very worrying.  To repeat what has been said, this has a chill effect on the provision of services.  We have seen this particularly in parts of the west and north-west of Ireland.  We hear accounts of GPs pulling out of delivering the service or being on the list of those willing to deliver because of threats of intimidation and fear.  There was an account of a GP in the west of Ireland whose home was actually threatened.  This GP lived near work and was providing the services.  Threats were made all the time to this person and their family when going to and coming from school and carrying out normal day-to-day things like shopping.  It is really important that a strong signal is sent out that there is an urgency about the legislation.  There is a proposal of some kind of public awareness campaign about the legislation.  Perhaps Mr. O'Connor could talk a little bit about that.  I would emphasise that issue of urgency and trying to get a time from the Department as to when we will see this through.</p><p> There is the question of the right of confidentiality for women who will be seen by protestors going in and out.  Many of them would be in abusive relationships, for example, so they need to keep their own affairs private.  This is all the time under threat when we do not have these safe access zones.  The question of this providing a chill effect to the provision of services is not just something that happens in Ireland.  The World Health Organization recognises this and has done research on it.  I want to really emphasise that.</p><p> One thing I want to ask, which others have also asked about, is the question of industrial relations activity.  Mr. O'Connor can go back over the argument again that it is not perceived to be under that particular heading where industrial relations activity is prohibited.  Sometimes, however, industrial relations activity is unofficial and would, therefore, be perceived by an employer as being illegal.  We need to be careful about this.  It would still be industrial relations activity albeit unofficial and seen as illegal, which may then fall foul of this legislation.   Therefore, we should go back to having the specific clause that excludes any kind of strike or protest activity by cleaners, doctors, nurses or health workers of any sort inside an abortion care setting.  We will be proposing that and we will try to amend the legislation accordingly.  I would love to see it coming from the Department, however.</p><p> I am kind of baffled as to why the Department did not go along with the Bill that was going through the Seanad.  We would have had this much earlier had we co-operated with the Bill going through the Seanad and looked at maybe amending, changing or adding to it rather than taking this length of time.</p><p> I am concerned, as are others, about the definition of "curtilage" and whether a car park or playground nearby or whatever is included in the definition.  I am also concerned about how protests will be controlled.  It is true that protests of this nature do not have to be in your face or all over people shouting and roaring at them.  It can be carrying an abusive or disgraceful symbol or whatever, as frequently happened outside the gates of the D&aacute;il during the course of the debate around the eighth amendment.  We need to get much more clarity on what we are talking about here.  I have one or two more questions but I will come back to Dr. O'Connor on those.</p></speech>

I can assure the committee of the urgency with which the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnolly, regards this.  He has prioritised it in the autumn schedule.  The Deputy is right; it was something initially intended and envisaged to be encompassed within the 2018 legislation.  It ran into complexity and there was an imperative to progress that Bill with a view to establishing the services.  The chill effect is something about which we are deeply conscious.  It is a delicate time in the roll-out of new services, in a sense, and the Deputy referred to issues about the geographical distribution of services.  The particular chill effect that can occur in maybe a rural setting is something about which we are very conscious.  It is part of the intention of the Bill to create a safe environment in which services can be delivered.</p> <p>  The Deputy is so right about people's privacy and dignity.  It can be a very difficult and vulnerable time in people's lives when they need to access medical services.  It is so vitally important for their dignity that their privacy and safety is protected in accessing those services.</p> <p>  We are so immersed in the drafting that we have not thought yet about a public awareness campaign but it is actually a very important thing that we will do.  We will engage now with colleagues who can help us in that regard.  We have some excellent colleagues in the women's health division in our press and communications section so we will take that on board.  I thank the Deputy.</p> <p>  On confidentiality, one of the excellent policy decisions made by the D&aacute;il in 2018 was the incorporation of these services as part of an integrated set of primary care, GP and hospital services.  We do not have the American-style abortion clinic, as such, as a real focal point.  The purpose of any visit by any private individual to a health facility cannot be known.  There is confidentiality.  As the Deputy said, however, absolutely, we do not want people accessing those legally provided health services feeling any discomfort or distress arising from protests in the vicinity of the services.</p> <p>  Our policy intent is clear on industrial relations activity.  We absolutely do not seek to undermine industrial relations activity.  I take the Deputy's point that it is not always official and can be spontaneous and unofficial.  We will absolutely work to ensure that all types of industrial relations activity by any workers are not encompassed or undermined in any part of the country.  We are looking at whether that might be a specific clause or exemption, which might be necessary, or else the prohibited behaviours within the zone will be refined to a place where they can clearly not be presumed to encompass industrial activity.  I hear that the Deputy's advice is to get specific on an exemption in relation to it, however.</p> <p>  We can absolutely see such similarity with the Private Members' Bill in many ways.  We are deeply grateful to Senator Gavan and all the Senators and Deputies who contributed to that.  Members will see it is evident that our current scheme builds on their work in the area in many respects.  However, it is acknowledged that legislating the area is complex and challenging from the perspective of balancing competing constitutional rights.  All the work we are doing now is work that is always necessary with any legislative vehicle.  That Private Members' Bill helped us greatly and we have built on it in the work we are doing now.</p></speech>

We are not reinventing the wheel.  Many countries have safe access zones.</p><p>The World Health Organization, WHO, has done research on this subject.  It is not like we are taking something brand new and we must be terribly careful about it because it is so complex.  It is not that complex.  Once we get the co-operation of all the players involved, especially An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it should not be a complex matter.  We already have, for example, laws like the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, where garda&iacute; can go up to people and tell them to stop what they are doing, not to stand somewhere and to move on.  If the people concerned do not do so, they can then be arrested under the auspices of that Act.  It cannot be so complex that it has taken us so long to do this.  I will finish with that comment, and by repeating, as others have done, that there is an urgency for this legislation to come through.  It sends out such a bad signal and it is having a chilling effect on what is already a fragile service, especially in parts of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I just want to echo what others have said about the urgency of progressing this legislation, especially as expressed in many of the submissions received.  I refer to the frequency of anti-abortion protests in Ireland and the major negative effects this has had on pregnant people.  I might have missed parts of this morning's meeting, and I apologise if I did, because I was in and out.  I wish to talk a little about policing.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on how they envisage that.  Forgive me if I this issue has been raised already.</p> <p>  I agree completely with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith concerning the public awareness campaign.  This is vital.  I was happy to hear the Department will take this on board.  Studies have shown that anti-abortion protests outside clinics have major and long-lasting negative effects on women's well-being and can deter them from accessing medical care.  It is important, therefore, that all stakeholders know what to expect if this legislation is to work effectively.  I am also aware that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has suggested a nationwide awareness programme to inform stakeholders.  I was happy to hear the Department is to take this suggestion on board.</p> <p>  As I said, many of the other questions I was going to ask have been posed already.  I would like to hear a little more about policing because I may have missed that.  I also again encourage the Department to work on the public awareness issue.</p></speech>

Within the general scheme, we have a graduated approach to policing, which has been borrowed from the Covid-19 experience.  This goes back to the central point of balancing conflicting or countervailing constitutional rights.  The general scheme contains powers to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond and to issue a warning.  There are also powers of arrest and prosecution.  As I said, this is a work in progress.  We are continuing to engage with the Garda and the Office of the Attorney General regarding many of these issues.</p></speech>

This point arose.  The Chair is looking at exemption No. 3 under head 5.  The intention here from a policy perspective is that this would exempt the imparting of clinical or medical advice and not ideological advice.  If there is a medical reason someone cannot have a termination, then that would not be excluded.  It is clinical and medical information and advice that we are attempting to exclude in that instance.</p></speech>

It is important to stress again that this involves not just women accessing services but also their partners, friends and family.  The legislation needs to cover that too.</p> <p>  On Garda powers, the question around using "shall" or "may" was outlined and the Department is still deciding on this point.  There is a big gap in this regard.  My concern in respect of reporting is that garda&iacute; work different shifts.  One garda might be working on Wednesday and then a different garda could be on duty on Thursday.  Continuity is an issue if this is going to happen.  I am not sure how to legislate for that, but I assume, regarding the issue of using "shall" or "may", that if the role of the Garda is to take this information, that will strengthen this element.  That is the discussion the Department is still having.</p></speech>

Again, if people at home want to send in submissions within the timescales, we will take on board their concerns or questions on this legislation.  I will go back to the members.  Deputy Cullinane is next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-19a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022101900002#K00400"><p>I want to come back in on a number of issues.  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith when she says that we should not overly complicate this and that there is existing legislation on public order offences that are quite similar.  However, at the same time, we should accept that it is complex.  There was a lot of discussion between the Department of Justice and the Attorney General.  How I would see it is that any legislation is obviously subject to legal challenge.  I think we can safely bet that there are organisations which will challenge this legislation in the courts.   For that purpose, I think it is really important that all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed, and that it is robust.  That is really important.  We do not want a situation where it is challenged in court and a judge decides that it is unconstitutional.  The more that we can be explicit and clear in terms of what the Bill does, and should do, the better.  Ensuring the balance of rights in it and that it is primarily motivated towards helping people and women is the right approach.  I accept that.</p> <p>  On the different submissions we have received, three issues have come up in over half of the submissions, which I think this committee should support.  The first one that has been raised is to recommend the clause to exclude from the ambit of the Bill anything done in the course of industrial action, within the meaning of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  While I acknowledge that Mr. O'Connor has dealt with that, it is something we should do.  The second is to place an obligation on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to maintain a record of warnings, and the language used in the Bill should be "shall" and not "may".  That is important from an enforcement perspective.  When we see the submission from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we will see what it says but I think that is really important.  I have some experience of this in local areas where there has been antisocial behaviour in communities.  It can be quite difficult for local authorities to prosecute in such cases.  The only way they have been able to do it is through proper recordkeeping, whereby a process is put in place where complaints are made and then registered.  Where there are records of persistent complaints, the judge can look at the overall picture, as opposed to one individual case.  That is important, and we should look at the same sort of process there.  That is a second recommendation that is consistent across many of the submissions we have received.  The third concerns inclusive language, which I think we would all agree on.  Mr. O'Connor has outlined practical issues in relation to it but I think we need to come back to it.  If those three areas could be accommodated within the Bill, it would go a long way towards helping us in our work.</p> <p>  I want to come back to the issue of enforcement and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If I were to make a recommendation, and I will, in terms of how we proceed in our work, I think we need to hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I think we should hold a hearing and invite representatives of the Garda in.  We will have a private session later, in which we will discuss our next steps.  For me, that seems to be the most logical approach because at the end of the day, there is broad consensus, as far as I can see, from all of the submissions in relation to the purpose of the Bill and its intent.  I outlined some of the recommendations that have been made to strengthen it.  The one area where we need to get it right is in enforcement, for all the reasons I outlined earlier as well.  I think it is important that we hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and not simply receive a submission.  </p> <p>  Looking at head 7, and the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, just so that people are clear on exactly what is being proposed, it states "A person who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a direction under subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence."  It goes on to state "A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may arrest without warrant a person whom the member has reasonable cause for believing is committing or has committed an offence under the Act."  It also states that if it is felt that a person who is approached by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in contravention of the Act, if it becomes an Act, that person will be obliged to state his or her name and address.  If the person does not, that is an offence.  It seems to me to be quite clear what the powers are.  It then depends on whether An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believes it can actually enforce the powers, which, from the Department's communications, seems to be the case.  However, I believe it is important for us to talk it through.</p> <p>  There are issues in relation to the confiscation of electronic devices and other equipment or material.  There are many explicit areas here where it makes clear what an offence is, which I am pleased about.  However, the more explicit we can be, and the less subjective, the better.  I have a concern about us trying to broaden out some of the terms, such as "harassment".  I get why people would advocate for it but my concern is that if we are too broad, it would be problematic if there was a legal challenge.  I am deeply conscious of that.  We know that there are people who do not want this Bill to progress.  They have their right to do that and are entitled to their own opinions; I am not taking that away from them.  However, as someone who wants the Bill to pass, I want it to be legally sound.</p> <p>  That was not really a question as such, it was more to make the point that this has been a useful session.  I believe we can help and support the Department in progressing this legislation as quickly as possible.  However, I do not think we can do our work and conclude pre-legislative scrutiny until we hear directly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is my sense of it.  </p></speech>

He has offered a very good summary of the key takeaways for us from this session.  They correspond exactly with the messages we are taking away.  As the Deputy said, it is absolutely reasonable to anticipate some legal challenge to legislation such as this.  It is recognised that protecting the rights of service users must be balanced against protecting the rights of those engaged in legitimate protest.  Article 46(1) of the Constitution protects legitimate protest, as does Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights on freedom of expression, and Article 11 on freedom of assembly and association.  We are very conscious of those rights but we are conscious that those rights are not absolute.  We are committed to providing for the safety, privacy and dignity of service users in respect of termination of pregnancy services, and of staff on a more general basis.</p></speech>

It is really important that both the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission have supported the general scheme of the Bill.  They appreciate and accept that that balance has been struck.  Obviously, we do not get the import of what the Attorney General says.  The advice of the Attorney General is for the Government.  Is Mr. O'Connor satisfied that the legal advice that has been given to the Department, either from the Office of the Attorney General or from the Department's own legal section, would withstand any legal challenge?</p></speech>

It is about balancing the instinct to broadly prohibit harassment against the operation and implementability of it.  I think that as we refine the Bill we will be increasingly specific as regards the conduct that is prohibited within the zones.  We will not be going broader.  We will be quite specific.  We will be working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be reassured that they are specifics that will help the Garda in the implementation.</p></speech>

Two questions arise.  When the procedures to date are legal-proofed and the review is advanced, will its legalities be finally checked again, just to be sure to sure?  My information is that the particular procedure followed in the referendum carries with it more than the usual strength and cannot be challenged, except if there is constitutional approval by way of referendum.  Is this true or false?</p></speech>

The primary aim of the legislation was to provide a particular service.  It was very laboriously pursued in the Oireachtas by the special committee.  It was an emotive issue and understandably so.  There are those who want to advance, improve and liberalise it and those who want to trim it back.  The information I have is that the present legislation cannot be challenged in court or if it was challenged, it would not succeed.

They were told this is what the proposal meant and what it would mean in legislation.  They approved it by almost two thirds to one third, which was remarkable.

They are very strong rights that we absolutely respect and seek to promote, other than in the circumstances where they undermine the safety, privacy and dignity with which people can access healthcare services in Ireland.  We are very mindful of these rights.  The constitutionality of what we deliver in the safe access Bill will be dependent on how well we strike that balance.  We will be very specific.  We do not want to prevent or undermine any of the other rights.  We will be quite specific about the behaviours that are prohibited.  They will be focused on the objectives of the legislation.  Any behaviours interfering with or causing distress or anxiety to service users will be forbidden.  Any harassment of service providers will be forbidden.  We absolutely respect the right of all individuals to have their own views and express those views, to protest and to assemble.  What we want is very specific, which is to provide a zone of safety around healthcare facilities.</p></speech>

I suspect I know the answers to them but it is useful to ask them for clarity.  I would like the witnesses to say a word about interaction with representative groups of GPs and nursing and not only regarding the creation of the Bill.  We have spoken about public information.  I assume it would be very important to roll the professional groups into the public information, in order that they themselves know what their rights are.  I am particularly interested in GPs in this regard.  I have spoken to several GPs who are very interested in the Bill.</p> <p>  My next question is about one of the submissions we received.  The HSE submission queried whether particular groups would have the ability to notify care providers that they will protest and thereby get permission.</p><p>I think I know what Ms Mason is going to say here, but I ask this for the removal of doubt.  Is there is any expectation or plan to put a kind of permission framework in place whereby permission could be sought and given?  </p></speech>

There is current nothing in public order there and there is the constitutional right to protest.  Therefore, there may be legal difficulties around a suggestion like that, but there is nothing there at present.</p></speech>

There is a courtesy afforded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at times of major protests, such as in the classic Parnell Square to the D&aacute;il route.  However, that is a courtesy and there is no obligation in law or in protocol to notify of protests.  We looked at that as a mechanism through which we could relay, for example, the intended route across a number of safe access zones, so there is not that infrastructure in place.</p> <p>  On GPs and nursing, we are working most directly with the HSE counterparts in the national women and infants health programme.  We rely in many ways on their regular and routine engagements.  However, we will take on board the points that have been raised here about public information and targeted awareness campaigns for GPs and nurses.  It is helpful advice.  </p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Mythen.  The meeting has been convened to consider Committee Stage of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) (Amendment) Bill 2022.  I welcome the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and her team of officials.  We will now proceed with consideration of the Bill.  As the Minister is present, officials should not speak in public session.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing via Microsoft Teams for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report, to mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce background noise and feedback and to use the raise-hand function if they wish to contribute.  I also ask everyone to ensure their phones are on silent mode or, better again, switched off.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to kick off the debate by giving her opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank committee members for the invitation to join them today.</p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to put the necessary legal framework in place to complete the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, and choirs from RT&Eacute; to the National Concert Hall, NCH.  It will cement the role of the NSO within the NCH, formalising and enhancing the relationship that has been in place since the establishment of the concert hall in 1981.</p><p>Although largely technical in nature, the Bill marks an important step in the journey the orchestra, the concert hall, RT&Eacute;, my colleagues and I have been on for the past number of years.  It is divided into four parts with Part 1 dealing with general provisions, such as the Short Title and definitions of terms in the Bill.  Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, staff, property and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs from RT&Eacute; to the National Concert Hall.  These provisions date from the transfer day, 24 January 2022.  It does so by amending the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015.  Part 3 provides for the integration of the orchestra and choirs into the everyday operation of the NCH by adding a new function for the maintenance and operation of an orchestra and choir to the functions of the concert hall.  It also provides for an increase in the membership of the board from eight to nine members.  The legislation requires this additional board member to have experience of and expertise in the development of orchestras.  The final Part replaces RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s previous function to manage orchestras and choirs with the function of managing a concert orchestra only.  I look forward to going through these in more detail.</p><p>The legislation builds on the commitment of everyone involved to build a stronger orchestra within a dedicated national cultural institution for music.  Critically, the Bill provides a new function for the concert hall dedicated to the development and maintenance of the orchestra.  It also places the orchestra at the centre of the concert hall&rsquo;s corporate governance arrangements by providing for a new board member with orchestral expertise and experience.</p><p>In some ways, the Bill represents the end of one journey &ndash; the transfer of the orchestra and choirs &ndash; but it is also the first step in a much more important journey as we now turn our minds to building and enhancing the symphony orchestra and concert hall to ensure they are fit for purpose in an evolving environment and are at the heart of music in Ireland for generations to come.  The challenge of the past few years has shown us the immeasurable value of music and live performance.  It has certainly cemented my view of the value of the orchestra and concert hall both at the heart of classical music in Ireland and as a place for people to come together and enjoy a shared musical experience.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an tUachtar&aacute;n ag Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann i m&iacute; I&uacute;il:</p> <blockquote> 	Lig d&uacute;inn ceili&uacute;radh a dh&eacute;anamh ar cheol ... na h&Eacute;ireann i ngach cruth a thagann s&eacute;, agus lig d&uacute;inn athcheangail a dh&eacute;anamh leis an gceol, agus an t&aacute;bhacht at&aacute; ag baint le taispe&aacute;ntas beo agus muid ag ceili&uacute;radh &hellip; le ch&eacute;ile. </blockquote> <p>Music is just one part of the wider cultural offering of our national cultural institutions.  In that context, I have tabled three amendments, the purpose of which is to raise the limit of the State&rsquo;s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State, which is required for visiting exhibitions.  These amendments are critical to ensuring our pre-eminent cultural institutions, such as the National Gallery and Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, continue to be able to receive high-value, international loans and exhibitions.  The success of the recent Freud exhibition at IMMA shows the value the public place on having works of such international importance shown here, as well as raising our profile internationally to stand with other national galleries and institutions.  Under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity is limited to &euro;190 million.  This figure is no longer fit for purpose as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago.  I, therefore, propose to increase this limit to &euro;1.6 billion.</p><p>With the provision of State indemnity, our cultural institutions can meet the essential requirements of prominent international institutions and private collectors, thus making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high profile exhibitions.  This will increase the cultural offering available to the public.</p><p>I thank members for their time, and I look forward to their consideration of the Bill and these three amendments.</p></speech>

As things currently stand, under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity shall not exceed &euro;190 million or IR&pound;150 million.  This figure is no longer fit for purpose, as I said in my opening statement, as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor for the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland, since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago.</p><p>The indemnity ceiling was previously temporarily amended by means of statutory instrument.  SI 86/2016 raised the limit to &euro;1.5 billion for five years, primarily to accommodate the five-year loan of the Freud collection to IMMA and the overlap of significant exhibitions at the National Gallery of Ireland.  However, that temporary increase expired on 31 October 2021 and the limit has since reverted to the original limit of &euro;190 million set out in 1997.  This constrained the planning of international exhibitions as the total value of indemnities on works from outside the State on loan to our institutions cannot exceed &euro;190 million.</p><p>Currently, the alternative for our cultural institutions is to arrange for commercial insurance, a significant additional overhead.  Such insurance can cost hundreds of thousands of euro per exhibition.  The provision of a general permanent increase in the statutory indemnity limit under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 is not merely a technical amendment but in accord with policy on risk management relating to the public finances.  The approval of the Government was required and was granted at its meeting on 28 June 2022.  I am, therefore, seeking to revise the ceiling to a limit of &euro;1.6 billion.  The increased figure has been calculated based on the increased values of artworks and artefacts, and the anticipated number of incoming international high value loans planned in the State over the next five years.</p><p>The increased limit would apply to works from outside the State on loan to the national cultural institutions, the Hugh Lane Gallery, the Hunt Museum and the Royal Irish Academy.  With the provision of State indemnity, our cultural institutions can meet the essential requirements of prominent international institutions and private collectors &ndash; thus making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high profile exhibitions.  This will increase the cultural offering available to the Irish public. </p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the proposal to increase the ceiling to &euro;1.6 billion has been sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I hope the committee will agree that this is a necessary intervention, which will ensure the continued success of programming at our cultural institutions and provide an even greater variety of cultural experiences for the Irish people.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 to the Title is to insert the following:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 5, between lines 12 and 13, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;2015;&rdquo; in line 12 down to and including &ldquo;matter.&rdquo; in line 13 and substitute the following:  	&ldquo;2015; to increase the aggregate amount of liability in respect of undertakings given for cultural objects on loan from a person resident outside the State and, for that purpose to amend the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997; to make certain changes to the objects of RT&Eacute; and, for that purpose to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009; and to provide for related matters.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>This amendment contains the changes required to the Long Title so that this title also reflects the amendments proposed, namely, amendments Nos. 1 and 2, to raise the limit of the State&rsquo;s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State.</p></speech>

The staff are to be transferred with the terms and conditions they enjoyed at RT&Eacute;.  Under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, or TUPE regulations, however, such terms and conditions do not include pensions.  The Department engaged the services of a financial consultant in 2021 to advise on the implications of the transfer for transferring employees' pensions and remuneration.  The consultant met with the transferring staff one to one.  Consultation also took place through the oversight and working groups.  Representatives from RT&Eacute;, the concert hall, the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, choirs and the unions were in attendance at the meetings to advance this process.  All practical issues relating to the transfer, including terms and conditions and pension entitlements, were resolved following an extensive process of engagement with staff and staff representatives.  A similar provision to subsections (1) and (2) is included in section 32 of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015, which established the concert hall as a national venue for performance, appreciation and enjoyment of music.  All this was done on the basis of advice from the Attorney General and is essentially an avoidance-of-doubt measure.  There is no impact on pensions.  Very detailed work went into ensuring that none of the individuals' pensions would be affected.</p></speech>

My officials have taken note of the matters raised, which the Department will consider.  As I have outlined, this is a technical Bill that provides for the transfer of functions from RT&Eacute; to the National Concert Hall and provides that legislative underpinning for the transfer of the NSO and choirs from RT&Eacute; to the concert hall.  As I think I said earlier, the Bill presents a important step forward in the journey of both the orchestra and the concert hall and a critical part of the concert hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st-century concert hall.  I look forward to seeing the Bill make steady progress through the next Stages.</p></speech>
