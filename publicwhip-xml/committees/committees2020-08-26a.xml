I am joined by my colleagues from the HSE, Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer, and Ms Niamh O'Beirne, lead on testing and tracing.</p> <p>  Over the past few recent months, we have been focused on restoring various aspects of our health services that had to be suspended in the early phases of Covid-19.  We have also been finalising plans to protect our patients, the public and our staff this coming winter and throughout 2021.  As we have recently seen, we need continuously to assess these plans as we experience increased numbers of cases of the virus, major outbreaks and a requirement for significant serial testing, along with increased demands on testing and tracing.  In the past 14 days, there have been 1,269 confirmed cases.  For context, the equivalent number for the same two weeks in July was 264.</p> <p>  In respect of testing and contact tracing, the committee has requested specific engagement on the State's response to the recent spike in Covid-19 cases.  In the past two weeks, we have triggered our resourcing escalation plan for testing and tracing.  Serial testing is ongoing in meat and food processing plants and we have reintroduced serial testing programmes in nursing homes and long-term care settings for older people.</p> <p>  I wish to inform the committee of the current circumstances regarding testing and tracing.  To date, we have completed more than 750,000 tests.  Last week, we recorded our highest weekly number of tests since April, at 55,000, and we are recording similarly high numbers again this week.  The previous weekly peak was in April, when we tested 60,000.  The median end-to-end turnaround time over the past seven days is 2.2 days.  Last week, we completed 4,949 contact tracing calls.  These statistics give the committee a sense of the numbers we are contending with and the pace at which we are moving.  Setting up these teams is complex and must be understood in the context of our need to make the best use of resources during peaks and troughs of the virus.  It is important to re-emphasise that testing and tracing is a key tool to protect against transmission of the virus.  However, the primary line of defence is the public health measures we must all take all the time.</p> <p>  We are finalising a new model of testing and tracing to set out a more permanent workforce and implement further processes and technology changes.  In respect of outbreaks, testing and tracing works hand in glove with the work of our public health teams.  Throughout this pandemic, our public health teams have adopted a rapid, robust and comprehensive response to prevent, identify and control outbreaks where they occur, utilising the best public health knowledge and science available.  I pay special tribute to all our public health teams who have been working relentlessly for the past seven months.</p> <p>  The national standing oversight committee on cases and outbreaks of Covid-19 in high-risk settings was established by the HSE on 7 August and includes a broad range of cross-sectoral representation.  Criteria for the assessment of meat plant outbreaks, to inform decisions regarding their closure and reopening, have been developed.  This utilises a standard public health risk assessment model, emphasising that blanket measures may not be helpful.  We have also worked with the Department of Education and Skills on similar criteria for responding to outbreaks in schools, which will be a key focus in the coming weeks and months.  While institutional and workplace settings are receiving much attention, our public health departments are also responding to a large number of outbreaks in private households and among family, sporting and social groups.  By 22 August, our public health teams had responded to a total of 2,580 outbreaks since the onset of the pandemic.</p> <p>  As for hospitalisations, while there has been an increase in the transmission of the virus, the indications are that our hospitals have not as yet been confronted with a similar increase in admissions.  There are currently 23 patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 and four in ICU, with three currently being ventilated.  The lower rate of admission may be attributable to the lower age profile of patients that has characterised the resurgence of the disease in recent months.  There is, however, no room for complacency and we have plans in place to deal with a surge in hospitalisations. </p> <p>  We are facing into a very difficult period in our health services.  In an ideal world, the elimination of the virus would make our work somewhat more straightforward, but this is not our reality.  We must live with this virus in a very new way and this requires a carefully balanced approach.  The health services need a functioning economy and society.  Shutting down the economy and society has implications for our health services.</p> <p>  Finally, I again pay special thanks to everyone working in healthcare.  We have witnessed much of what is great about the people who work in it.  We all now need to support them again.</p></speech>

The first speaker is Deputy Carroll MacNeill who has five minutes.</p></speech>

I have a couple of quick questions on his statement.  He talked about the median end-to-end turnaround time being 2.2 days.  Does the complete turnaround time refer to all contacts contacted or contacted and tested?  What does it mean exactly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#D00300"><p>The median end-to-end refers to completion of test, notification of test results and the contact of all contacts.  It does not include the contacts' testing.  Their testing is then scheduled.  They are offered a test immediately; we encourage them all to come forward straight away for their test.  So it is end-to-end to the contacts being contacted.</p></speech>

Of course, there are outliers on both sides but it is important to acknowledge how far the work has come.</p> <p>  I wish to talk now about education, people going back to school this week and next week, and the HSE's engagement with the Department of Education and Skills.  What is going to happen if and when there is an outbreak in a school with a child or a teacher?  I ask Mr. Reid to talk me through what is going to happen.  The Minister said last night that it would become a public health matter.  What happens in such circumstances?</p></speech>

We are gaining more evidence on the behaviour of this virus in educational settings as schools open up in other countries.  That said, it is inevitable that there will be suspect cases, cases and there may even be outbreaks.  That is the price we must pay in order to open schools again, with all of the educational, health and welfare benefits this brings to children.  Public health departments will apply the same principles as they do to outbreaks in other settings and will take a risk assessment approach.  In any outbreak setting, they will look at the individual characteristics of the school, the rates of community transmission, the number of cases in the school and the number of serious illnesses that might emerge - which would be very uncommon and unusual in children - as well as hospitalised cases and ICU admissions.  They will also look at the interplay with the community, the infrastructure of the school and the capability of the school to adhere to infection prevention and control measures.  In some schools, for example, special needs areas may require more intimate connection between people, with unavoidable breaches of social distancing guidelines.  It is not a tick-box exercise but an individual assessment based on a set of principles by public health consultants who have the expertise and experience to-----</p></speech>

Child to child transmission is very low, as Dr. Henry has said, but people are concerned about child to adult transmission and children bringing the virus back into the home or out into the community.  I ask Dr. Henry to talk to us about that.</p></speech>

If this happens in a school in the next number of weeks, how quickly will the HSE be able to engage and respond?  What is the nature of that response and how ready is the HSE?  Obviously there are lots more schools with the potential for outbreaks relative to sporting situations and so on.</p></speech>

We have developed an algorithm working with experts in paediatrics, general practice, primary care and public health.  This algorithm and the pathway were discussed with almost 2,000 GPs in a webinar two nights ago.  It describes the series of actions that will be taken once a suspect case emerges in a school.  As was highlighted by my colleague, Dr. Mary Favier, the other night, it balances the need for continuity in education with the need to identify cases where they emerge with children.  For example, children with sniffles or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms do not warrant testing and can continue to attend at school while those more specific symptoms such as cough, respiratory symptoms, loss of taste or loss of smell do merit isolation and testing.  This algorithm is for GPs and will be communicated clearly to principals in schools to enable them to take the appropriate set of actions should there be a suspect case in school.</p></speech>

I have only five minutes and want to run through a number of questions.  On the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, will the HSE be encouraging or recommending that patients who are travelling to the North for appointments or operations should continue to do so?  What advice is the HSE explicitly giving to those patients?</p></speech>

We have stepped up our services over the last while, which includes NTPF-funded appointments.  Obviously, we are monitoring this as we progress through the current uptick in the virus.  We have started the approach of stepping up all our services, which includes the NTPF services.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Given the unpredictable yet devastating impacts of the Covid pandemic, is the HSE considering a backup plan for the winter months in the event of a second wave so as to allow services to resume as close to normal as possible?  Linked to that question and specifically in respect of cancer patients, if there are future outbreaks of Covid-19 that might be worsened at the height of the winter months, is there any plan to continue cancer services as normal?</p></speech>

We are looking at this plan very differently now because it is not just about a winter plan and what we would normally have to do in winter.  It is about how we and our services cope, how we protect the public, our patients and our staff with Covid virus, and about the level the virus reaches at different stages.  We have done two things.  We have significant funding already in place which is supporting a number of initiatives that we put in place in the early stages of Covid.  We are also finalising plans with the board of the HSE and through Government for a set of funding to see us through the winter and through 2021.  This will involve a range of significant, different approaches aiming to keep people out of hospitals, including the likes of the community assessment hubs that we used during Covid in a very different way to treat respiratory illnesses, to try to filter out the number of people who will need to come to a hospital setting, the number of outpatients that we can have in place outside of a hospital and in our community services, and a range of investments which are the traditional investments in home care packages and our community service and community intervention teams, and the Covid response teams.  This is a range of initiatives that strengthen our community services, reduce the impacts on our acute services but also significantly increase our capacity in the community services.  One further aspect of that response will be our engagement with and utilisation of the private hospitals, as took place throughout the first phase, but in a very different way.</p><p>I am happy to go through how that may look in the future.  It is another support that we would have throughout winter and into next year.</p></speech>

The latest update provided by the HSE is that this process has commenced.  Can Mr. Reid confirm that the process is under way and, if so, can he provide further details on it?</p></speech>

We completed significant mass testing in the meat plants over the past few weeks, and in the first phase when there were outbreaks in meat plants.  Serial testing at meat plants recommenced last Friday.  We completed testing at three meat plants over the last day or so, involving a total of 2,254 workers and some 823 swabs were completed.  That was across the three counties.  The primary focus of the serial testing in terms of meat plants is specifically related to plants that have 50 plus employees.  We will be working through more than 50,000 employees over the coming phases as part of that serial testing.</p> <p>  On serial testing of those in direct provision centres, we are working through that process with the Department of Justice and Equality and its agencies in terms of the data and so on that we will need in advance of scheduling that process.  In terms of serial testing in direct provision centres, there are more than 8,000 people to be tested, comprising approximately 7,500 residents and the remaining being employees.  There is serial testing across 50,000 people in meat plants, 8,000 in direct provision and, also, approximately 30,000 staff and healthcare workers in our nursing homes, which has been ongoing for the past few weeks, with a current phase recently completed.  There is serial testing across those three areas.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions to put to Mr. Reid in respect of which I have only ten minutes so Mr. Reid will appreciate that if his answers are as succinct as possible it will allow me to put many of those questions.  My first question relates to the number of weekly tests being carried out.  Mr. Reid said that the HSE recorded the highest weekly tests since April at 55,000, which we should welcome.  On 26 April, Mr. Reid said that there were confirmed plans to ramp up testing for Covid-19 to 100,000 tests per week and that it was expected that the 100,000 weekly test rate would be reached by the third week in May.  Can Mr. Reid give me the figure for the number of tests carried out in the third week of May?  How is it that we are at only 55,000 and not the 100,000 that Mr. Reid promised on 26 April we would be at now?</p></speech>

Specifically, what I said was that we were ramping up capacity to have a capacity to test 100,000.  That is exactly what we did.  In terms of the determination of what we test, how we approach testing and what areas are serial tested, three things drive outturn, namely, the targeted approach of symptoms that we would be targeting for testing, the level of spread in the community and our approach on serial or mass testing, which is determined by NPHET.  What I did commit - I want to be very clear on this - is that we would be ramping up the capacity to have 100,000, which we have done.</p></speech>

What he said was that it is expected that the 100,000 weekly test rate would be reached, not the capacity to do it but the actual number of tests.  I am not sure whether Mr. Reid misspoke then or whether we just have not reached our target, but given that we had a number of counties in semi lockdown, one of which still remains in lockdown, and that we have higher levels of contraction not just for meat plants but in terms of clusters in some parts of the country I think people would expect to be hitting higher targets.  The 55,000 is down from a high of 60,000.  I am not judging Mr. Reid on my figures because it would be irresponsible of politicians to make up figures, rather I am putting to him what was reported widely in all of the newspapers, namely, that the figure would be 100,000 and it would be the number of tests that would be carried out.</p></speech>

What we were asked to do, targeted by NPHET and overall Government policy, was to develop a capacity for 100,000, which we have done.</p><p>We have built up our lab capacity from one lab in the State for the Covid-19, the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, to 46 labs.  We have built capacity across our swabbing centres and across our contact tracers.  The determination of volume is a function of the cases being brought forward, what the cases determine of the testing.  The HSE are guided by the approach on testing and the recommendations by NPHET based on its information and assessment.</p></speech>

Regarding what that actually means, what is the difference between the average turnaround time for a community sample as opposed to a sample in a hospital or some other setting, which I imagine would have a much more rapid turnaround time?

I will not give the name but I will put to him the content of an email I received from two front-line workers who work in a hospital in Galway.  They have two children, who were in a cr&egrave;che.  Its opening times and their working hours, as front-line healthcare workers, have left them with no option but to remove their children from paid childcare and that they now have no choice but to leave their children with their grandparents, which is not ideal.  They state: "Why is there still no childcare options for front-line healthcare workers that actually work?"  Can Mr. Reid tell them, and others, why we still do not have a childcare solution that they believe works?</p></speech>

From the start, the HSE has encouraged and directed local management to be as supportive as they can, first, through revised rosters to accommodate people in a different way.  Second, we put out a clear call to husbands, partners and spouses of healthcare workers, and to organisations and businesses, that they would work at home and support our healthcare workers getting to work.  We have put practices in place where, if we can find alternative work for our workforce, we will do so and we have done that on occasions.  Obviously, front-line healthcare workers are key for us and we have shown the greatest flexibility we can.  I have been clear throughout this process from the start of Covid that we will demonstrate the greatest flexibility we can.  There is a wider issue in terms of what Government supports may or may not be there at different stages but we have been very clear to give whatever -----</p></speech>

I have a number of questions on screening services.  Before I ask them, I want to point out that I completely understand that a cancer diagnosis comes from going to a GP and being referred on.  However, we also know that screening is important for detection and, therefore, helps.  What is the situation with CervicalCheck, BreastCheck and BowelScreen?  What capacity are they currently operating under in comparison with pre-Covid times?  My understanding is that BreastCheck is still not up and running, whereas some of the other screening services may be operating again.  At what capacity are they operating and how do we ratchet up that capacity?  What additional investment and supports are needed, whether it is physical infrastructure or more diagnostics in the community?  How will we increase capacity in the time ahead?</p></speech>

We launched a plan a few weeks ago to ramp up capacity in our four cancer screening services.  We did this to reassure the public and to encourage anyone with symptoms and a referral from a GP to come forward for screening.  Our services have remained open during the period of Covid-19.  Our key focus for these services is to protect the public and our staff.  Some of the cancer screening programmes are more difficult in that regard.  We have launched a plan which steps up capacity in all of them.  I ask Dr. Henry to provide some specific detail.</p></speech>

We expect that all invitations suspended until that time will have been caught up on by the end of October and that any cases delayed during 2020 will be caught up on by March 2021.</p> <p>  Capacity in all three screening programmes depends on where the screening is done, the nature of the test and how or if it may facilitate transmission of Covid, and the dependencies.  For example, in the BowelScreen programme the test is done at home but the main dependency is the availability of a colonoscopy.  A colonoscopy is a procedure and a service that has a reduced capacity for delivery because of the infection prevention and control measures that are necessary in the Covid environment.  We are aiming to resume that screening programme at the end of September, as with BreastCheck.  BreastCheck was supporting symptomatic breast care services during the first phase of the pandemic and it will be resuming all services at the end of September.  Some 70% of BreastCheck screenings are delivered through mobile vans.  These require repurposing to bring them into line with the infection prevention and control measures required for the delivery of healthcare in a Covid environment.</p></speech>

However, a serious issue has arisen in my constituency as a result of a significant number of deaths in Dealgan House Nursing Home.  The difference between these 23 deaths and all the other deaths in nursing homes around the country is that Dealgan House is the first nursing home which the HSE, through the RCSI hospitals group, took over.  The families are extremely distressed, having lost so many of their loved ones, but they are also extremely angry that they are not getting accountability from their requests to find out on what grounds the HSE intervened to take over the nursing home.  They will not have closure until they have all the facts.  They have spent hundreds of euro on freedom of information requests to the HSE, HIQA and others.  Will Mr. Reid meet these families to ensure they are fully advised of the reasons the HSE went into Dealgan House Nursing Home?</p><p>The families are looking for a separate independent inquiry, but it would help greatly, given those facts which Mr. Reid's organisation has and its record in transparency, if he would meet with them.</p></speech>

Regarding Dealgan House specifically, the Deputy is correct concerning the approach taken by the RCSI hospitals group.  That approach was taken for a range of reasons.  I am not personally familiar with the direct request to meet, but I will arrange some discussions with local management, in the first instance, through the RCSI hospitals group.</p></speech>

I want him to meet with the families.  I believe that he should meet with them and that Mr. Reid has to be accountable.  This was the only nursing home in the country that the HSE went into.  I do not want to harangue Mr. Reid, and I do not intend to be rude in any way, but I think he must meet with the families.  They must get closure.  It is unacceptable what is happening to these families.</p></speech>

The nursing home experienced such a loss of staff in the facility that, given the concerns at the time regarding maintaining safe levels of care, it was deemed appropriate for the RCSI hospitals group to go in and be able to staff up the facilities.  The staff that went in were deployed.</p></speech>

I agree that is what happened.  The families, however, have not been told and have not been given the facts around that decision.  Their freedom of information request has not given them the facts which the HSE obviously has.  The families need to be given these facts because the HSE has to be accountable and they have to get closure.  I will leave that point with Ms O'Connor and Mr. Reid.</p> <p>  I have a different question now concerning testing.  We were told in July that there were 1,300 people in all, I think, who had been identified as needing a test for Covid-19 but who had refused to go for such a test.  The intention of the HSE was to follow that up.  Can we be given the result of that follow-up?  What has happened since?  How many people have now refused testing and what has been the outcome of all that action?</p></speech>

What I was referring to then, and which is still a factor that we strongly encourage and it has got better, was where we make contacts of positive cases.  We now organise a test for them on what is called "day 0", their first test, and then another test on day 7.  What we saw originally was some people not coming forward for their tests.  We obviously try relentlessly to make contact with them and set up appointments for them.  Equally, we do that on day 7.  We have seen an improvement and also regarding those coming forward for the day 7 tests, but it is part of our contact tracing resources.</p></speech>

Somewhere between 70% and 80% of people will show up for day 0 tests, and on occasion it gets closer to 85%.  On the day 7 tests, it is closer to 50%.  Looking at the age profiles, the cohorts who have the most difficulty tend to be the very young and the more elderly.  We are looking at different tests for children, such as saliva tests, to make it an easier appointment to attend.  We have done further campaigns and several press conferences to encourage people to show up for their day 0 tests.</p></speech>

When will that be done?  It is so important for children in particular.  I ask Mr. Reid to revert to the committee with a timescale for that to be done.  As he knows, children are going back to school.  We do not wish to be back here in four months' time and the HSE to still be considering that measure.  It is important that Mr. Reid revert to the committee on that very important issue.</p> <p>  On testing, I dealt with a particular case involving an elderly lady who rang her doctor last week.  The doctor advised that she needed to be tested.  The woman was referred on Tuesday.  She could not go to Kilkenny.  The testing centre in Tinryland, County Carlow, which is in CHO 5, has been closed.  Will the testing centres in Limerick and elsewhere that have been closed be reopened?  The woman was tested at 1 o'clock on Friday.  Today is Wednesday and she has not received her results.  I am aware of other similar cases.  This is what is happening on the ground.  People are being tested.  If the members of a family are tested, they must isolate and stay inside.  They cannot go to work.  It is unacceptable that people are waiting six days to receive results. </p> <p>  I was contacted by a business in County Carlow.  One of its employees contracted Covid and the business did not know what to do.  I rang the Minister for Health.  A person working on the business premises was diagnosed with Covid and had to isolate for 14 days.  The owners did not know whether the business should close or remain open.  They decided to close because they wished to be fair to people.  There are no guidelines to cover such circumstances.  The business was closed for 14 days.  No urgent system of testing was put in place for its employees.  The employees were out of work for two weeks because the business had to close when one employee got Covid.</p> <p>  I refer to counties which border counties Laois, Offaly or Kildare.  I live in Graiguecullen in Carlow town.  There are restrictions in place but the county is not in lockdown.  However, businesses in Graiguecullen and elsewhere in County Carlow, including a hotel, had to close.  There was significant confusion regarding the local lockdowns.  I acknowledge and respect that the witnesses are doing their jobs as best they can, but proper guidance must be given.  People have contacted my office seeking guidance and I had to try to get answers that I could not get. </p></speech>

On the testing centres, we have scaled up the number of centres across the country.  We were dealing with an average of ten cases per day or 50 cases per week and had 29 centres, originally 48 centres, across the country.  We must adapt our centres based on where the virus is and the volume of transmission.  We have stepped back up to 28 operational centres across the country because we have gone from 50 positive cases per week to 600 cases.  That is where we had to step up.  We installed pop-up centres through the National Ambulance Service in recent weeks to directly target communities where the transmission of the virus is potentially high.  We have scaled up our centres in that regard across the country.  The Deputy will appreciate that when we are dealing with maybe ten centres per day, having 48 centres across the country is not the best use of our teams as we try to get services back up.  We must scale services up or down in accordance with the rate of transmission of the virus.</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Henry to address the issue of saliva testing and Ms O'Beirne to deal with the Deputy's comments regarding turnaround.</p></speech>

It is a more acceptable and easier test, particularly for younger children, including those in preschool or primary school.  A group of paediatricians and GPs has examined the issue and recommended it as a preferred test.  The question is whether it is sensitive enough to be applied.  That is being considered by the expert advisory group of NPHET chaired by my colleague, Dr. Cillian De Gascun.  I expect the group to issue a decision on the matter next week.</p></speech>

They are appreciated, as are those of other Deputies.</p> <p>  On the reopening, we published our plan a few weeks ago, at the end of July, which was for the reopening of all services.  The document, which is on our website, steps through the various services and the timeframes for their opening, service by service, throughout this period and through the winter and onwards.  I am happy to share that document again with the committee, if it is useful, but it has been published on our site.</p></speech>

A colour-coded alert system is meant to replace the plan for the phased reopening of the economy.  How will this affect the health service?  Will services need to be shut down or scaled back if we move to a stricter colour-coded alert process?</p></speech>

That is still in the process of dialogue.  Ultimately, however, as we have seen over the past few weeks in particular, while everybody had predominantly been talking about when we might see a second surge, I think the reality is that what we are seeing in the country right now is probably what we are going to be living with for the future with this virus.  We are going to see significant peaks and, we hope, significant troughs very soon and those changes may not always be national.  They could be regional and, in some cases, local.  That is the new reality for us in terms of living with this virus and the transmission we have seen to date.  Therefore, our plans are now not so much around a second surge and a mass scaling up or scaling down.  The focus now is around agility, how we adapt, scale up and scale down, and how we try to get back our services, which I referenced a while ago.  We were very strong in our document that it is all dependent on the transmission of the virus at any particular given time.  We are constantly focused, every week, on where is the level of transmission of the virus and what services we need to adapt.  The focus is not always on the acute services.  In fact, at this time, the services we have had to step up are primarily in community services and particularly in public health teams.  The situation is not quite as black and white as we might have expected at the start of this, where we expected to see surges.  It is probably the case that what we are seeing right now is going to be the reality.</p></speech>

One, we would open some of our traditional swabbing centres.  Two, we would deploy pop-up centres from the national ambulance service, which has been done a significant number of times throughout the country.  Three, we would deploy the national ambulance service into a specific organisation or area, as needed, with paramedics carrying out the testing and swabbing for us.  A combination of those three measures would be our rapid response.</p></speech>

In terms of the target turnaround time for testing of 2.2 days or one day less than in a hospital setting, is there any part of the process we could improve to reduce that time of 2.2 days, either in terms of the collection time, treatment time or the process of communicating the test results?  Is any work being done to decrease that time?</p></speech>

I will try to be brief.  I have always described what we put in place at the start as a rapid-fire wartime model.  We have modified it significantly over the past weeks and months in terms of automation of the process.  An example is the automation of the negative test results that we put in place and that carries on.  Second, there is an automation between our labs and our contact tracing teams with both systems interfacing.  That took 24 hours off the process of handovers to different systems.</p> <p>  Ms O'Beirne is working with us on what I described in the opening statement as a future model.  We are now looking at a more standardized and permanently recruited workforce, both for our contact tracing and our swabbing.  Part of that will be looking at the logistics and the transportation of the swabs from various parts of the country to a lab in order that we can turn them around more quickly.  We are looking at elements of automation, logistics, transportation and a permanent workforce.</p></speech>

During the summer, patients in private hospitals began to be charged for Covid tests.  Can the witnesses confirm whether those tests are processed in labs within those private hospitals, or are they sent to labs commissioned by the HSE?  If so, are those tests processed in the same manner as tests that come from public hospitals or are they given any priority based on the fact that a patient has paid for them?</p></speech>

Will primary care centres in communities be used?  He may have commented on this earlier but I did not hear.  In what capacity can these centres be used?</p> <p>  Every year, there is a push for staff in the HSE, particularly front-line staff, to have the flu vaccination.  Given the winter we are facing, what are the plans to increase take-up of the flu vaccine?  Have mandatory flu vaccinations for front-line staff been ruled in or out?</p></speech>

Then I will ask my colleague, Ms O'Connor, to give some specifics on our community responses.</p> <p>  On the flu vaccine, we are anxious to make a significant increase in numbers.  Last year, it was about 60% overall across the system in terms of flu vaccine uptake by healthcare workers.  However, there is significant variation in that, both on a geographical basis and between hospitals and community settings.  There is a mixed variance in all of that.  That is not a sustainable position as we head into dealing with Covid.  We have discussed this significantly and we will be in dialogue with the trade unions, as well.</p><p>Vaccination is not just good to have at this time, but absolutely necessary in terms of managing Covid.  Some countries have opted for legislation to make it mandatory, but we do not believe such a process would happen quickly enough for us.  Instead, our approach would be a risk-based assessment.  If a local service manager determined that the risk was such that people needed to have the vaccine, it would be deemed a risk factor for the staff to have the vaccine.  Obviously, there will be minor exceptions, but that is the situation we would like to see.</p><p>Vaccination at this time is not just good to have, but absolutely necessary in terms of managing with Covid.

There would obviously be minor exceptions, but that is what we would like to see.  I have been clear that we need a significant ramping up of vaccinations this year.</p><p> What we are referring to for this year is not a winter plan.  Rather, it is largely about managing our services with Covid through winter and into next year.  It will not stop.  We want to put in place approaches that are sustainable into 2021 beyond just February.  I ask Ms O'Connor to touch on these approaches briefly.</p></speech>

The specific initiatives we are considering relate to supporting people in avoiding admissions to hospital and in having timely discharges, for example, our integrated care people for older people and our programme for chronic disease for people who need to attend our community nursing services, occupational therapists, physios, etc.  We are also considering primary care centres in terms of the development of our community health networks.  This core element has been in existence for a while and we are looking to roll it our further.  Having better and more localised integrated care available to the population will involve GPs, community nursing and other allied health disciplines in the community.  Our primary care centres are also key for our community intervention teams and many centres have mental health services working out of them.  The centres will be at the core of what we are trying to do this winter.</p></speech>

It will allow people to put in their details before travelling.  Regarding testing at airports, we are working on reaching a decision with NPHET.  It will be a question of the prioritisation of resources, but we are working through the process with NPHET in terms of timing and how and where testing would be done.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if the witnesses were up front with the committee on the reasons the HSE is not using the full capacity of 100,000 tests per day.  What is the main threat to having that kind of rapid and agile testing and tracing service in place?  Is it a staffing problem?  Is it a funding problem?  What is preventing the HSE from operating a very active, proactive and reactive testing and tracing system?</p> <p>  My second question is on testing in meat plants.  Who is paying for the 50,000 tests?</p> <p>  My third question relates to the flu vaccine and drops for children.

I will ask Dr. Henry to comment on the vaccine.  All of the serial testing and mass testing at meat plants to date has been funded directly by the State via the HSE.  I would like to make one point on serial testing for the committee's information.  Serial testing provides the public with a lot of reassurance.  I fully respect that and we will need to continue with serial testing in various settings.  It represents a very significant cost.  For example, I refer to the serial testing of healthcare workers and in nursing homes during the first phase of the response.  We completed 99,750 tests in a four-week period.  The rate of positive results was 0.13%.  It is a very significant cost and absorbs a lot of resources.  I appreciate that it gives the public a lot of reassurance, but it is not the major tool with which we can protect the public.  I want to state that very clearly.  The major tools are the public health measures we can all take.  I know serial testing provides reassurance to the public but the positivity rate from such testing is low.</p></speech>

I would like to comment on the status of private hospitals.  There are three parts to my response on this topic.  First, I note that as we have terminated the last agreement, we have put a bridging fund in place to see us through until the conclusion of a further agreement.  That is a &euro;25 million fund which has been approved by the Government.  That is being drawn on by various hospital groups for services they provide.</p> <p>  Second, we have issued a tender to all private hospital groups.  It has two aspects in that it is a tender for diagnostics and services.  We are working out our services plan for the winter and for next year in order to determine the funding we will need for that purpose. </p> <p>  Third, we are directly engaging with the private hospital groups on their role and the services we will make use of if we experience a massive surge like the initial outbreak.  The private hospital groups have asked us to engage with them and we are doing so.  I am confident they will do the right thing if such an outbreak occurs.</p></speech>

Delivery is expected in the latter half of October.  Training information and a communications campaign have been developed for healthcare workers who will be administering the vaccine.</p> <p>  In regard to administration, I note that the primary care division of the HSE is negotiating with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on the fee payable for the administration of this vaccine by GPs.  That negotiation is not yet complete but will come to a close shortly.  That will hopefully come to a successful conclusion which will allow us to carry out the plan. </p></speech>

I would like to ask about the situation concerning schools, but first I will ask some questions about quarantine.  The European Commissioner travelled to this State from a non-green list country.  He has justified breaking the 14-day quarantine on the ground of having received a negative Covid-19 test result.</p><p>I think the answer to this question is probably fairly obvious but it is important that we hear it from the chief of the HSE.  The question is this: did he break HSE guidelines by doing so? </p></speech>

It showed an assembly where, I think, prayers were being conducted, with more than 150 students spaced about 1 m apart.  Would the witnesses be prepared to comment on that situation, not with regard to that specific school, but in a general sense.  Do they think it is best practice not to have assemblies of that type?</p></speech>

On the guidance to schools, in fairness to the Department of Education and Skills and the school principals, they are working through a very difficult situation.  The absolute guidance, as they have repeated themselves and as the Minister said last night, is to aim for a 2 m distance throughout the whole school setting.  What I have seen so far is a really strong engagement by principals and schools to implement that.  Obviously, it is very challenging in some schools versus others.  Our guidance would absolutely be to avoid mass gatherings where possible.</p></speech>

My first questions are for Mr. Reid.  I have previously raised with the committee the issue of serial testing in healthcare.  Are there plans to consider random testing or temperature testing of hospital care workers?  As I have said previously, these protocols are in place in factories.  I am not sure why they cannot be implemented randomly in the HSE.</p> <p>  My next question is on congregated settings, particularly in the meat industry.  We have heard about the issue of foreign workers being domiciled together.  The HSA told us it was not within its remit but that it was a public health issue.  Does the HSE have any intention of looking at it or engaging with the meat industry to see how it might be ameliorated?</p></speech>

In some cases we also tested some of the residents.</p> <p>  With regard to the question on meat plants, the national standing oversight committee has been established and I referenced it briefly in my opening comments.  There is multi-agency representation on it, looking at the various aspects that have arisen from our assessments of meat plants.  A number of State agencies are involved and I will not go through them here.  They have examined and assessed a wide range of issues that emerged with regard to the organisation of plants, and how social distancing spacing can be operated.  The industry has engaged quite well and very responsibly with us.  There are also issues with regard to shared transport to work and shared accommodation.  In some cases, there is shared accommodation and shared transport involving multiple plants.  The national standing oversight committee is looking at a range of issues.  One of its specific terms of reference is to look at the basis of legislation for the various agencies with regard to enforcement.  This is progressing quite well.</p></speech>

I know it was covered previously but perhaps the thinking has changed.  Can the random testing of healthcare workers in community hospitals be considered?</p> <p>  With regard to diagnostic tests, a number of weeks ago, representatives of the DAA and the Department with responsibility for transport were before the committee.  The Department suggested looking at a protocol whereby people would get a Covid test before they flew into Ireland.  The suggestion was that diagnostic testing is available outside of Ireland that could be done within a matter of days.  Is Mr. Reid aware of these tests?  Will he update the committee on other diagnostic tests that are being looked at outside of the PCR test?  The saliva test was mentioned.  Are there others?</p></speech>

Antigen testing does not hold as much promise at present.  As more evidence emerges, we know that antibody testing is more useful in determining population exposure or the exposure of particular risk groups but not the current level of infection.  The mode of the PCR test is a nasopharyngeal swab which, of the different types of swabbing available, presents the most sensitive measure.</p><p>As was alluded to earlier by one of the Deputy's colleagues, we are looking at the version of this that would be easier for children, which is salivary retesting.  That has to be determined by the expert advisory group.</p><p> On NPHET, the expert advisory group is always considering new and emerging evidence from other healthcare systems on modes of testing in the three broad categories mentioned and the mode of carrying out tests.  At this point in time, August 2020, PCR by nasopharyngeal swabbing is our preferred mode of testing as is the case throughout most healthcare systems in the West.  We are constantly monitoring new evidence and proposals that are coming to us from other healthcare systems.</p></speech>

In March and April, the focus was rightly on flattening the curve.  Everybody co-operated with that.  At the height of the pandemic, there were 879 patients in hospital,160 of whom were in ICU.  It appears that great work was done by everyone.  I sympathise with anyone who lost their life and the trauma people went through.</p> <p>  However, our objective now is confusing.

That is better again.  People are rightly concerned as to why we have a lockdown, in particular in one county.  The pub industry has been closed down, despite it having no part to play in spreading the virus.  There has been damage to the economy and mental health as well as other side effects, such as people who are waiting for a plethora of procedures.  Can we now have a clear timeline or roadmap out of the current situation to try to help our economy to recover, address people's mental health, assist those going back to school and all the other issues?  I ask for some clarity around that.</p></speech>

He referenced the number of hospital cases being low, thankfully, and we want to keep it that way.  We now face uncertainty as we have seen a rapid increase in the transmission of the virus among those below the age of 45.  I understand that 75% or, in some cases, 80% of the positive cases are now in those aged under 45.  Our concern is community transmission and the impact on other groups.</p> <p>  I would make the point that nobody is immune to the virus and some of its impacts.  Younger people may think they will not suffer from it.  There are extreme cases where people had really bad illnesses as a result of Covid.  Our specific concern is the spread of transmission further in the community and among vulnerable groups, particularly older people.  We want to protect our hospitals in that regard.</p> <p>  Our colleagues in NPHET will come before the committee later.  The measures taken at different stages are recommended by NPHET, based on the best knowledge it has at the time and which it has communicated to Government.  From our perspective, I understand the concern.  From a health service perspective, the impact of lockdown is key and we know it is significant.  It has a significant impact on the health service and recovery, as well as on the public in terms of our services being constrained or, in some cases, shut down.  Some of the mental health impacts can be very significant.</p><p>I think we are all trying to find an approach that keeps the economy and our society going and can keep our health services going and, equally, protect our public.  As I said in my opening statement, that is important not only for the health service and for us in protecting it but also for the way we are seeing the virus transmit at the moment.</p></speech>

I compliment the community in Golden, in my county, where an incident broke out two weeks ago in Walsh Mushrooms.  I got a phone call from Kate Killeen of the HSE, whom I thank and who kept me informed.  The Army, the Garda, the Ambulance Service and everybody else rolled in and did the testing on a parish site.  This can be contrasted with the rumours abounding about a plant in Cahir for weeks, finally admitted last week, and then testing being done privately.  Now Mr. Reid has just told another Deputy that the tests are being paid for by the HSE.  We could get no information on this, and there was no phone call from the HSE.  It had no information.  We could get no information yesterday or all weekend on the number of tests.  A number of shops, including excellent ones in our wonderful town of Cahir, had to issue statements to deny rumours of incidents on their premises.  There were huge mixed messages, and the treatment of a community in Tipperary was different from that of a big business there.  We value those businesses, but the question is of special treatment, and now we find that the HSE is paying for the tests anyway.  Was there control over those tests?  How come we could not get the answers until very late?</p><p>I wish to ask briefly about St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir, a wonderful community hospital that was taken over to deal with Covid.  When will it go back to its former use?  There are three hospice beds there for elderly people and people in their last days.  They need those beds.  They are not being used.  I would like a definite date for when it will go back to its former use.</p><p>Why were the meetings ceased?  At the start of this outbreak we all, party and group leaders, were briefed once a week by the HSE.  We have not had a meeting for two months.  Why the secrecy, and why are we not being engaged with?  We are expected to support the HSE in all the work it does, and we have done so, but we need a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  We have to have information.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Reid.</p> <p>  I will ask a very quick follow-up question to Deputy McGrath's point.  He pointed out that there are 22 people admitted to hospital as of today and there were 800 people in hospital at the peak of the pandemic.  I notice that in Mr. Reid's introductory statement he said, "This lower rate of admission may be attributable to the lower age profile of patients that has characterised the resurgence in the disease in recent months."</p><p>It is, however, also an international phenomenon that has been experienced in the United Kingdom and right across the western world.  Is it being studied or are there any other explanations for it other than it may be attributable?  Is the HSE happy to attribute it to the lower age profile or is this being studied?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#T00200"><p>I might take that question.  There has been much observation internationally, as the Chairman points out, of the lower rate of hospitalisation and some suggests this represents a change in behaviour of the virus, but the virus has been sequenced in Swiss studies and the overall diversity of the virus has not changed.  There is no new variant and there is no development of some less severe mutation.  The most likely explanation for this trend we are seeing internationally is as follows: we know the virus has a steep age-dependent rate of illness and mortality.  The more testing one does, particularly in younger  people, it will result in an imbalance between tests and hospitalisation.  We have seen in this country, as in other countries, a predominant shift towards positivity in younger age groups.  The CEO referenced that 71% of cases in the past two weeks are aged under 45.  It may also reflect that older people are behaving more cautiously and as such are less prone to the illness as they were when we knew less about asymptomatic transition, the mode of transmission of the virus some months ago.  Nevertheless, the big caveat and warning at the end of all that is that there is a lag time between seeding within the community - between open outbreaks in the community such as in some counties or where there is high levels of transmission - and inevitable community transmission leading to older people and vulnerable groups getting the disease.</p></speech>

Confirmed cases numbered 1,269 over the past 14 days and reference was made earlier to the reduction in hospital admissions.  How many of the 1,269 cases were aged over 65?  It would be interesting to know what numbers are over 65.  I know Mr. Reid cannot give it to me today but he might come back to me on it.</p> <p>  I have a series of questions on the nursing homes issue.  When the outbreaks occurred in nursing homes, there was considerable engagement between the HSE and nursing homes.  My understanding is that the level of engagement between Nursing Homes Ireland and the HSE has not been maintained.  Can I get some clarification as to whether that engagement can recommence?</p> <p>  I refer to temporary assistance payments to nursing homes.  As Mr. Reid will be aware, Covid has resulted in considerable additional costs for nursing homes  The Government put in place the temporary assistance payment until September.  Has the HSE made recommendations to the Minister about the continuation of that payment in view of the fact that nursing home payments under the fair deal scheme have not been reviewed for four or five years but they now face additional costs?</p> <p>  The Covid expert panel made recommendations on the entitlement of residents with medical cards in nursing homes to community and medical healthcare services.  Has the HSE currently capacity to deal with that issue?</p><p>One complaint was there was not the access to the supports that nursing homes required when they needed it urgently at the time.  Has that now been revisited?</p><p> What is the current procedure when a person in a nursing home needs to attend an outpatient clinic?  What additional precautions have been put in place?  What changes have been made?  I have a view, which I expressed on a number of occasions, that rather than people from nursing homes coming into outpatient clinics, a member of HSE staff would visit the nursing home, perhaps on a monthly basis, to deal with all the issues arising.  Will the witnesses come back to me on those issues?</p></speech>

In fact it has probably increased in the last few weeks with the HSE specifically.  We talk with Tadhg Daly, who is actively involved, and with Nursing Homes Ireland.  The individual nursing homes have been very involved in scheduling and organising the serial testing all across nursing homes.  Tadhg is on calls with our teams and with Ms Niamh O'Beirne who leads the testing process.  I am on a call with Tadhg tomorrow and our colleagues on the community side are regularly in contact with Tadhg.  I would say that the engagement has not ceased and has in fact probably increased over the last while.  I am happy for it to continue.  I will now ask Ms O'Connor to comment on some of Deputy Burke's other points.</p></speech>

In the work we have been doing to support nursing homes the Deputy will be aware that we established the Covid-19 response teams early in the pandemic and we look to continue those from now on.  It became apparent that the support relates to the clinical oversight in nursing homes and how we support people who require that clinical governance.  It is something we are actively working on and this aspect features in the report we got last week.  The first meeting for the oversight of the implementation of the report happened yesterday.  From our perspective, with regard to people attending outpatient appointments there are agreements around testing for people accessing any of our services in hospitals prior to attendance.  Our priority, however, is to be able to ensure we can provide support to people in nursing homes as they need it.  Building on the learning over the last couple of months and building on the experience of the Covid-19 response teams, which have been proven to be extremely positive, we will continue that to see how we can provide more comprehensive support.</p></speech>

I will take us back to the first days in March when there was an outbreak in a local school in my constituency.  Some of the communications around the early stages were possible because there was a small number of incidents.  Given the reopening of schools taking place, has the HSE looked at the communication strategy for what will happen when an outbreak takes place, as it inevitably will, in a school?</p><p>In my experience, there was much confusion, particularly because of social media and because the information was able to travel so quickly.  In the absence of any statutory decisions on what would happen, all sorts of confusion emerged.  If an outbreak takes place in a school, will all the children have to self-isolate?  Will brothers and sisters have to self-isolate?  Will team members of a local soccer or GAA group have to self-isolate if cases emerge there?  We need to be really clear because a strong communications strategy is really necessary, alongside the public health strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.232" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#V00200"><p>I will answer two parts of the Deputy's question and I might ask my colleague Dr. Henry to comment also.  In the first instance, as the Deputy quite rightly noted, as the virus emerged in February and March the country was scared.  I thank the Deputy and other local elected representatives for their support during that process.  We at the HSE went out publicly and met parents and teams at various schools.  The Deputy is correct to ask how we can manage that situation if there are schools with cases or potential outbreaks in the next few weeks.   The first thing to say is we should plan on the basis that there will be positive cases and that it is likely there will be outbreaks throughout the country in different schools.  That is the most likely scenario we have to work towards and it is the one on which we have been working with the Department of Education and Skills.  We have given the Department clear guidance on its role, on communicating with parents and on our role, which is primarily led by our public health teams.</p> <p>  I will finish with a brief comment because Dr. Henry covered a bit of this earlier.  I know that people have the urge to get a kind of checklist of what will happen in various situations, where boxes can be ticked, but our public health teams largely go in and assess each school, in this case, or organisation on its individual drivers of the transmission of the virus and various other factors.  The primary driver of our communications will be through local public health teams, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and local schools in how they communicate to parents.  The public health approach involves, exactly as Dr. Henry outlined, a range of factors, including the numbers of cases, how rapid is the spread of cases, the impacts of the cases in terms of hospitalisations, what is happening in the community, what is the response of the local management of the school, and how we get reassurance of what measures were taken or are having an effect.  All of that is geared towards not getting to a scenario of shutdowns.  We will be driving a range of processes, public health led by our public health experts, but communication will be directly from the Department of Education and Skills and local schools to parents.</p></speech>

I recall the committee meeting at the beginning of March when we communicated that clearly.  Viral upper-respiratory tract symptoms are very common in primary school children and the vast majority are due to more common ailments.  In communicating this to parents, principals, teachers and wider society, we are trying to strike a balance between the significant health and well-being benefits for children in education, that is, the opportunities this presents to health, such as vaccines and screening for vision, hearing and so on, versus the risk of transmission of the virus.  As I said earlier, the emerging evidence is that child-to-child transmission in a school setting occurs at a lower frequency and is rarer than we initially thought.  What we have to have in place is clear communication to GPs, a clear definition of cases, insofar as we can when one considers all the other illnesses children get at that time of the year, and a rapid testing strategy for those who are funnelled through to testing as determined by a general practitioner.  As I said, we have been working this week with primary care and public health teams to create an algorithm for this purpose.</p></speech>

It is fair to say, unless our guests want to contradict me, that outside of healthcare and residential settings, food processing plants are by far the most likely workplace in which Covid-19 clusters emerge.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  On what basis does testing currently take place in these types of factories?  In other words, is testing random, routine or does it only take place where a case is suspected or confirmed?  Whose responsibility is it to inform the public when confirmed cases emerge from these factory settings?</p></speech>

It is kind of similar to what I just relayed around the criteria for schools.  It would assess it based on the transmission of the virus, the seriousness of the cases emerging from the virus, how local management has adapted to the requests for implementation of certain measures, the capacity of the plant to implement the measures and the capacity of the workforce in complying with the implementation of the measures.  Our public health teams then assess all of that and the nature of the transmission from and into the community.  They address all those factors and determine the testing approach and whether that is mass testing.  We would then assess both in terms of serial testing in conjunction with NPHET.  We have done a combination of both.  We have done mass testing in plants where outbreaks emerged-----</p></speech>

Earlier this week, for example, it emerged that two workers from the ABP factory in Clones had contracted and tested positive for Covid-19.  It then emerged those cases had been confirmed ten days ago but testing was only taking place this week.  Throughout all that period the factory has been operational.</p> <p>  A similar situation occurred in Cahir on County Tipperary where it emerged this morning that as well as the initial cases, there have been 22 further Covid-19 cases.  One can appreciate the absolute anxiety occurring within the counties in which these sites are located because of the experience of Kildare and other counties.</p> <p>  When it emerges that a positive case has been detected in a meat factory, does the HSE consider itself under any obligation to inform the public?</p></speech>

I wish to urge caution from the public's perspective.  There was a really interesting study from the ESRI released this morning.  What we are seeing in the transmission of the virus is that it is not just in meat plants.  In fact, a high prominence of transmission is in various workplaces and largely community, social and home settings.  The ESRI report made a very good point regarding the public's perception of blame in terms of transmission.  I would just put it in the round.  The transmission we are seeing, as NPHET and Professor Philip Nolan will outline later, is quite wide ranging.  Transmission of the virus is across a whole range of sectors and settings.</p></speech>

The executive is to be commended on its work and the efforts made by its front-line and other staff.  My questions relate to the lessons to be learned in respect of County Kildare and the adjoining counties which were put under the first lockdown and County Kildare which is now under a second one.  What were the most important lessons learned and what action has taken place as a result?  To what extent has the HSE identified entirely the sources of the upsurge in Kildare and its causes?  Have they been forensically examined with a view to addressing the issues arising?  To what extent have responses to the issues arising from any investigation been implemented and to what extent are they in place at the present time?  My last question relates to how the lessons to be learned from Kildare can be applied nationally.  Are those lessons being applied nationally?  Particularly in the context of the reopening of the schools, is it possible to apply a formula nationally based on the lessons learned from the Kildare and adjoining counties situation?</p></speech>

On the issue of lessons, the NPHET delegation including Dr. Ronan Glynn and Professor Philip Nolan will give the committee some insights later on but in terms of the transmission of the virus and the actions taken, largely what we were seeing was a mass transmission into the community.  The actions taken and the approaches recommended by Government were directly related to what the analysis was demonstrating in terms of transmission.  One key lesson is that the public health measures are absolutely key.  We have spent a lot of time today talking about testing and tracing and rightly so but I feel the need to really emphasise that the public health measures are our 80% factor in terms of suppressing this virus and mitigating against further transmission.  Testing and tracing can be a 15% to 20% factor; an important one but not the major factor.  The big lesson is and remains the role of the public health measures.  In terms of actions and their impact, I may have picked up the Deputy's question incorrectly but I think it related to specific actions that we would have implemented in the context of the mass testing that we carried out in meat plants and food processing plants.</p><p>Our public health teams will be overseeing the implementation of those actions and the national standing oversight committee would be assessing the whole sector in terms of responsiveness to some of the measures we would have to put in place specifically in respect of that.  I ask Dr. Henry to describe any wider lessons.</p></speech>

Even though we may change, the virus has not.  As I said earlier, the evidence is that the virus has not changed.  It is not less vicious or transmissible.  In an uncontrolled setting the doubling time is a matter of days.  A small number of cases can lead to a rapid escalation if uncontrolled and unmitigated.  What we saw in Kildare and the other counties to a lesser extent was the hazardous effect of open clusters and how they can seed out into the community, hence the measures that have been continued in Kildare.  With an incidence rate over 14 days of 180 per 100,000, that presents a real and immediate threat to widespread community transmission, which is a huge threat to safety, health and well-being and to the continuation of health and education services in Kildare and beyond.  Allowing for the fact that counties are not enclosed structures in themselves, it presents hazards to contiguous counties including Dublin.  The virus has not changed.  It is very transmissible.  Outbreaks whether in meat plants, workplace settings or elsewhere, can seed out into the community.  That is where it is important to emphasise that for a virus for which there is no treatment and no vaccine, those measures which we all know by heart by now are the first and primary line of defence.  When we have outbreaks, rapid identification, isolation of cases and contact tracing represent the second line of defence.  That is the work of our public health colleagues and I pay tribute to their diligence in Kildare and beyond.</p></speech>

The witnesses might provide written replies to the additional questions that Deputy Durkan raised.  I have to move on to the next speaker.</p></speech>

The HSE staff in Kildare I have been dealing with have been very professional and committed.  They have made sacrifices themselves and have been very much on top of all this.  I represent Kildare, which is in lockdown again.  It is effectively the third lockdown because we had the original lockdown like everybody else, a second lockdown and then a third, unlike other counties.  Would it be reasonable to deduce that Kildare has the highest rate of transmission or incidence per 100,000 of population in the country?  It seems to be the most acute hub of incidence right now according to the advice and the fact that we are under lockdown again.  In that context it is reasonable that every effort be made to ramp up testing, to make it available at all corners and to remove any barriers to doing so.  I was made aware recently of an issue arising if a suspect case presents out of hours in Kildare.  A constituent of mine presented last Saturday to the only out of hours health service available in Kildare, which is KDOC.  Unless patients have a medical card, they have to pay a &euro;50 consultation fee.  I confirmed with the Minister for Health on Saturday that the HSE's position is that Covid testing is free of charge.  No barriers should be put in front of anybody presenting for a test.  The principle applies across the country but it is particularly acute when Kildare is the only county in a third period of lockdown and appears to be the epicentre of Covid in Ireland.  I have had extensive conversations with KDOC's management team and they advised me they are aware of the HSE guidance.  My understanding is that there is an operational agreement yet to be entered into or signed off on.  Time is not a luxury that we can enjoy here.  We are into our third lockdown and have ten days.  The clock is ticking to see if we can escape from that.  We do not know how many more cases are transmitting or about to be identified in the community.</p><p>If people are being turned away from test centres because there is a &euro;50 charge for the test and they cannot afford it, that is not good enough.  I can see both sides of the story but heads need to be banged together to get this matter resolved.  I hope Mr. Reid can advise us of good news on the matter this morning.</p></speech>

On the question regarding testing in Kildare, I agree with the Deputy.  We have put in significant resources, including the installation of pop-up centres throughout the weekend of the emerging outbreaks, the national ambulance service, home visits and extended opening hours of a range of centres in the county and outside of the county.</p> <p>  On the specific out-of-hours issue, I was in dialogue with the Minister on it.  I understand the Minister engaged with the Deputy on the issue over the weekend.  There should not be a charge for out-of-hours services for Covid referrals.  There is a national agreement.  The agreement was due to expire but it has been extended and is under discussion in terms of a further extension.  It is expected that will happen.  It is applicable all across the country.  I will ask my colleagues to get under the bonnet in regard to KDoc to find out exactly what the issue is.  At a national level, we have extended the agreement to all out-of-hours services and there should not be a charge.  We have to close out whatever the issue is in that regard.</p></speech>

It is an issue of the utmost urgency because, as things stand, if a patient presents to KDoc out-of-hours services this evening he or she will be charged.  I do not believe that is good enough.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and Mr. Reid also do not believe it is good enough.  That dialogue has to take place with KDoc.  In fairness to KDoc it has put forward operations and lack of agreement as the issues arising.  This issue needs to be addressed as a matter of utmost urgency and I would appreciate if it could be tackled today.</p></speech>

I join with others in commending the work that the men and women from every grade, group and category in the HSE and the broader health service have been doing over the past number of months and continue to do now.</p> <p>  My questions are, as ever, fairly simple.  I ask Mr. Reid to outline how the HSE and the contact tracing personnel communicate with the Border Management Unit in regard to people who travel here through our airports and sea ports in terms of follow-up, which all of the available evidence suggests is scant and rarely happens.  Does the HSE communicate with the Border Management Unit with regard to contact tracing, follow-up or additional testing that might be required?</p></speech>

On the issue of tracing and border management we are clear in terms of the HSE's role, which is tracing and follow-through.  The matter of where people are staying and if they are where they declared they would be is one for a separate agency-body and it is carried out through a separate process.  I will ask Ms O'Beirne to confirm the dialogue and process in that regard.</p></speech>

The second cohort is healthcare workers who need self-isolation as they are returning to Ireland to work.  The care facility does not have residents.  We use it for initiatives such as the drive-through glaucoma testing.  We are working with Children's Health Ireland on other initiatives such as accessing allergy testing for children.</p></speech>

The last time representatives of workers in the meat processing industry were before the committee, they informed us that there was a delay in receiving test results of up to four days.  In the intervening time, a person who was tested went back to work and the line that person was working on subsequently became infected.  I note the figures relating to the median but we also know they are skewed by the healthcare workers who have a very tight and fast turnaround time.</p> <p>  When we spoke to representatives of workers in the meat and food processing industry, I was struck by the lack of information available to workers in their own language.  We know this is a migrant workforce.  Is that information now available or was it always available and somehow magically never made it to the floor of the factories?  If that information is available, in what languages is it available?  How does it get into the hands of the workers who need it?  A person who was tested went back to work, which is obviously not the advice.  I am trying to ascertain how that happened.</p></speech>

I have seen some of the PPE the HSE sourced and has stockpiled in the event that is necessary.  I will not get into the issue of nursing homes as we will have a separate session on that later, save to ask whether the HSE will provide PPE to nursing homes in the event they are unable to obtain it on the open market if there is an outbreak?

Is there a strategic plan for this going forward?  The HSE has done what it had to do, and it has done well in obtaining the amount of PPE required.  Is there a plan in place to have a stockpile of PPE or to manufacture PPE to provide long-term sustainability of supply?</p></speech>

Separately, our strategic plan at the start of this was to work with other Government agencies and Departments to scale up existing indigenous industries to transition them towards PPE manufacture.  We have had some good successes with that in certain line items of PPE, particularly masks, gowns and some gloves.  We are working with other Departments and agencies to scale up Irish industry capacity to produce PPE.

University Hospital Limerick is consistently the most overcrowded hospital in Ireland.  I was informed by the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and by Mr. Liam Woods, a senior member of Mr. Reid's team, that there were plans to scale up the services being provided in tier 2 hospitals to alleviate overcrowding in University Hospital Limerick.  We have not seen any sign of that yet.  Where are those plans?  When will we see an increase in the number of procedures being carried out in tier 2 hospitals such as Nenagh General Hospital, St. John's Hospital and Ennis General Hospital to alleviate the numbers presenting at University Hospital Limerick?</p></speech>

We have been working closely with the various sites to scale up capacity.  It is important to note that in University Hospital Limerick, in particular, we have new capacity coming on stream.  We have the sports arena that opened for a short-term bridging period but we have additional beds opening on the site of the main hospital over the coming months.  That will make a significant difference to that area.  As part of our planning for winter and for next year, we have done an extensive modelling exercise that shows the impact of all of the different proposed investments.  The beds that are coming on stream are expected to make a significant difference in that area.  Clinicians in the area are also committed to looking at what initiatives can be driven in a more integrated way.  That part of the country could be used as an example for good integrated working between community and acute services.</p></speech>

The public health response to Covid-19 to date has been guided by public health data and expertise and international best practice, and has been underpinned by ethical principles, including the minimisation of harm, proportionality, solidarity, fairness and privacy.  The central focus of our response has been to control the spread of the virus in so far as possible to protect those who are most vulnerable from infection, as well as protecting against causes, situations, circumstances and behaviours that can lead to the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>  In the absence of a vaccine or treatment at present, the key to controlling Covid-19 is to adopt a proportionate, dynamic and stepwise response tailored to the evolving epidemiological situation and the wider public health and health service context.  The foundation underpinning this approach has been the wide acceptance of, and buy-in to, the basic but essential public health protective measures, including hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, social distancing, avoidance of crowds and the use of face coverings, where appropriate, by the Irish public.  People in Ireland have shown that they are willing to follow public health advice to protect themselves and others.  We have seen tremendous solidarity and co-operation across society and across sectors in response to this pandemic.</p> <p>  It has now been nearly eight months since the world first became aware of this new coronavirus.  Worldwide, there have been more than 23 million cases, and 810,000 people have sadly died as a result of this virus.  In Europe, while the situation had stabilised in early summer, many countries are now seeing an increase in cases and have had to reintroduce public health measures.</p> <p>  Here, our own public health approach proved effective and by 24 June our five-day average was just six new cases per day.  However, since the beginning of July there has been a gradual change in our epidemiological situation, and by the end of July a large number of cases emerged rapidly in Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  These cases were initially predominantly linked to several large clusters in food processing plants in the region.  There were also several linked clusters in direct provision centres.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, NPHET was monitoring the situation in that region closely and made related recommendations on 30 July and 4 and 6 August regarding the protection of vulnerable groups living in congregated settings; the mitigation of risk in high-risk workplaces; and the continued enhancement and strengthening of the public health, testing and contact-tracing functions in the HSE.  On 7 August, NPHET recommended to the Government that a series of enhanced public health measures should be introduced in the three counties for a two-week period to bring the situation under control and prevent widespread transmission.</p> <p>  The NPHET reviewed the situation on 20 August and advised the Government that the position in Laois and Offaly had improved and the measures did not need to be extended.  The situation in Kildare was different.  While there was a certain level of stabilisation, a high number of cases continued to be reported daily, with cases widely distributed across the county and with incidence rates at several multiples of the national average.  Several facilities were still undergoing mass testing as a result of recent cases and there was evidence of some increasing community transmission in the county.  For that reason, NPHET recommended that the measures in Kildare should be extended until 6 September.</p><p>Separately, on 17 August, NPHET considered the deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country and recommended several public health measures to apply nationwide until 13 September to mitigate against any further increase in cases.</p><p> I am fully aware of how disappointing and frustrating recent events have been.  As a country, we have demonstrated so much resilience, solidarity and resolve throughout this pandemic.  We have set aside our plans and put our lives on hold for many months to suppress this virus.  As a society, we have done that incredibly effectively.  Although we have taken a step backwards, this is not irreversible.  With the continued support and collective effort of people in Ireland, we can stop the rise in cases and protect what must be our three priorities in the coming months: the protection of the most vulnerable in society, the resumption of healthcare services and the return to education for children and young people.</p><p> This is a marathon and I know people are tired.  I acknowledge the enormous and ongoing effort and sacrifice by people in Ireland to help protect each other during this pandemic and I ask them to continue to stay the course with us.  By continuing to work together, by building on the individual and collective action which has characterised our response to date and by supporting each other, we will navigate our way together through the months ahead.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#KK00300"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to update the committee on the work of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, IEMAG, and, in particular, to offer some perspectives on the recent increase in the incidence of Covid-19.  We need to be aware at all times that statistical analyses and mathematical models provide very useful insights but have important limitations.  As such, our input has always been and must always be contextualised within the wider public health expertise available within NPHET.</p> <p>  The strict public health measures put in place between March and June 2020 brought the pandemic under control.  As of 18 June 2020, the date of phase 3 reopening, we were detecting, on average, 13 cases of Covid-19 per day and had a 14&ndash;day cumulative incidence of 5.2 per 100,000 population.  Thereafter, the level of disease continued to decline for one to two weeks such that at the end of June and in early July the average number of new cases per day was ten and the 14-day cumulative incidence was 3.2 per 100,000.  We estimated at that point that fewer than one in 30,000 people in the population had an active infection.</p> <p>  However, from late June onwards, we began to see an increase in incidence.  This appears to have had three components.  First, an increase in viral transmission seems to have begun soon after 18 June, leading to a small, slow increase in cases over the period from 7 July to 20 July.  This is understandable and, to a certain extent, was expected.  As people increased their numbers of contacts and perhaps began to relax a little with regard to hygiene and physical distancing measures, the virus transmitted more easily.  This was associated with an increase in the reproduction number above 1.0, which was clearly flagged to the public in early July.  The public seems to have responded by taking added precautions, as case numbers and the reproduction number decreased again towards the end of July.</p> <p>  Second, a number of large outbreaks in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, as alluded to by the acting Chief Medical Officer, developed in the week beginning 27 July 2020.  These outbreaks were quite explosive, with the virus entering and spreading rapidly within specific workplace settings.  Epidemiologically, this acted as an amplifying event and significantly increased the overall burden of disease in the country as a whole and in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly in particular.  The outbreaks were controlled, and significant community transmission prevented, by the outbreak management actions of public health teams, as well as population level public health measures applied in those three counties, as Dr. Glynn mentioned.</p> <p>  Third, since early August and in parallel with these events, we have seen a wide variety of smaller outbreaks with modest levels of community transmission.  The cases associated with the major outbreaks to which I referred seeded further outbreaks in households and extended families, but separately, and much more widely within the country, sporadic cases led to household and workplace outbreaks which spread between households and in a variety of workplace, social and sporting settings and, hence, more widely within the community.</p><p>The most recent set of public health restrictions to limit indoor and outdoor congregation and mixing between households is specifically aimed at minimising this inter-household spread and keeping community prevalence and transmission to a minimum.  It is my evaluation that these challenges were anticipated and detected quickly and that the responses were timely, specific, proportionate and, in so far as we can tell at this time, effective.  It should be noted, as Dr. Glynn has done, that similar patterns of resurgent disease have been seen in other jurisdictions in recent weeks.</p><p> We are at an important juncture.  The next few weeks will show whether we, as a society, are capable of resuming the most important of our social, economic, educational, healthcare, cultural and sporting activities without spreading the virus between households and into our communities to any significant extent.  They will show whether we are, as the acting Chief Medical Officer has put it, capable of "protecting our priorities while living with the threat of this virus and keeping it at bay".  I would like to record again my appreciation of the team of academic and public service colleagues who support the work of the modelling advisory group, the public health colleagues who work tirelessly to protect us from this virus and, at the same time, provide us with the information that informs our analyses and understanding of the disease, and, like Dr. Glynn, my appreciation of the general public, whose fortitude and solidarity in the face of this crisis are inspirational.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to all our health professionals, as I did during the earlier session with the witnesses from the HSE.  It has been a very trying time during which the focus has been on protecting lives.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, have to be very careful that we put people's health and lives first.  As we head into the cold and flu season, there is some confusion as to whether we are going into a second wave of Covid infections.  The witnesses may have heard the discussion on the radio this morning where we were told that people are not aware that they can ring their doctor free of charge to get information about Covid symptoms and what they need to do if they have them.</p> <p>  I have been dealing with the concerns of local businesspeople over the past few months.  The witnesses referred to the restrictions in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  I live in the Graiguecullen area of Carlow town, which is half in Carlow and half in Laois.  Some businesses in the area have had to close, which was very hard given that we are so far away from the outbreaks in Laois.  I spoke to the Minister about their situation and asked for a buffer to be applied.  If something like this ever happens again, which I hope it never does, there must be better communication with the businesses and people affected.  There are housing estates in Graiguecullen that are half in Carlow and half in Laois and there was huge confusion among the people living there.  When information is given on these types of restrictions, there needs to be clarity on where exactly they apply and consideration should be given to a buffer zone.</p> <p>  My next question relates to testing.  We saw last week that 13,000 tests were done in one day, which, months into the crisis, was the highest number of tests done in a single day.  Are we going to see a ramping up of testing as the schools reopen?  Recent infections seem to be happening in clusters, including in meat factories and direct provision centres.  What is being done in regard to that pattern of infections?  I have had several telephone calls from people asking about what testing is being done at airports, which is a huge concern for me.  I am not aware of any definite cases but my understanding is that people coming in from red zone countries are not self-isolating for 14 days.</p> <p>  I am also concerned about whether we have enough personal protective equipment, PPE, particularly in view of the spike in cases and as schools and hospital services reopen.  It is vital that we have adequate supplies of PPE for front-line service staff.</p> <p>  The most pressing question I have concerns wet pubs.  Like all of us here, I have been contacted by owners of wet pubs who say they will be able to control their environment.  Their businesses are the only ones that have not reopened and many of them do not know whether they will be allowed to open.  In addition, there was huge confusion last week among owners of dance studios and theatres regarding the reduction in permitted indoor numbers from 15 to six.  Several dance studio owners contacted me to say that this new restriction will see them lose their livelihood.  I understand that the witnesses must put people's health first but where we are talking about a controlled environment in which the guidelines can be followed, why was the decision made not to open wet pubs and not to allow dance studios and other businesses to have 15 people instead of six?</p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Glynn will respond to those questions.  I realise there are a lot of them.</p></speech>

Her key question is whether we are on the cusp of a second wave.  I hope we are not but there is no doubt we have seen a deteriorating situation over the past couple of months, if we are being honest, since the start of July.  It is no surprise that we have seen more cases as we have eased restrictions and that we have seen a greater proportion and a greater number of cases in younger people.  All of that is normal and I will take this opportunity to counter the narrative of blame that has been taken up around younger people.  Younger people go out to work.  They run our health service and our education service.  They keep society going and so they come into contact with other people.  By the nature of their lives, we will see more cases in younger people.</p> <p>  That said, we have grown increasingly concerned, overall, at the number of cases we are seeing.  That led to the recommendation of the additional measures last week for the country.  I know there has been some confusion around those measures but, at its heart, we are asking people to cut down their discretionary social contacts.  We understand that is difficult for people but if we do not cut down the number of people that each of us comes into contact with, there is no doubt but that, unfortunately, the number of cases will continue to rise.  If the number of cases continues to rise, it will inevitably lead to more cases in older people and those who are medically vulnerable.  They have to be our central focus in this.  All over Europe we are seeing an increase in cases.  So far, all over Europe we are seeing an increase in cases in younger people without a concomitant increase in hospitalisations in ICU but there is no guarantee that will continue.  If our number of cases continues to rise, we would be concerned about the impact that will have in terms of hospitalisation, admissions to critical care and mortality.</p> <p>  In relation to-----</p></speech>

I know the people of this country are grateful as well.  I have six minutes and that is to include answers so, as much as I appreciate public health and epidemiology are complex and do not lend themselves to brief answers, I would appreciate it if the witnesses could be as brief as possible.</p> <p>  I will be focussing on schools and education, which is one of the biggest issues the public is concerned about at the moment.  We have an underfunded and overcrowded education system.  An example of that is the grotesque sight of an isolation room in a national school in Athlone in a garden shed.  I do not put the blame on the school but on Department of Education and Skills underfunding.  I know the witnesses cannot comment on that.  Because of overcrowded school estates, social distancing is simply not possible in some schools due to a lack of space.  That is the reality at this time.  The implied message from the Department seems to be to carry on regardless.  That is what I am picking up.  If a school cannot achieve social distancing, is it safe for it to reopen?  I ask Dr. Glynn to answer that question.</p></speech>

The guidance around the need for social distancing and the differential needs for social distancing by age group was produced a couple of months ago.  I cannot speak to individual educational institutions but, in short, we understand and internationally it is recognised that, for younger children, social distancing is impracticable.  That should not preclude younger kids going back to school.  We expect and hope from a public health perspective that the vast majority of older children in national school and certainly all children in secondary school should maintain a distance of 1 m from one another.</p></speech>

Many school staff in particular have been concerned.  They have been certified by Medmark as fit to return to work as they are only high risk.  They are upset and worried by this and they feel compromised.  They are also unhappy at the relative lack of recourse.  To be classified very high risk seems to be quite a high bar.  On the other hand, the high risk category is quite broad and it seems to take in everything from mild asthma to cases of leukemia.</p><p>These people have been categorised as high risk and, therefore, are obliged to work.  Should a more differential approach be taken to high-risk individuals in the context of schools?  Is it safe for all those categorised as high risk to mix with dozens of people every day?  Should the high risk bracket be expanded to encompass more students and teachers who are vulnerable?</p></speech>

If 40 people are in the outpatient department of any hospital in this country for an ear, nose and throat clinic or a respiratory clinic, each of them will be treated individually and differently based on his or her individual circumstances.  This must be the approach to children, teachers and carers who have underlying health issues.  It is not possible for me to make an overall proclamation.  It is a matter between the individual and his or her GP and the occupational health service.</p></speech>

She outlined what would happen in an instance of a symptomatic child or staff member in a school.  Many of the answers pivoted on the GP being informed, after which the issue would fall on what she termed "public health".  Parents would prefer to have a much clearer idea, though.  Dr. Glynn could give a detailed response, so perhaps he will provide a written answer on who should isolate and what the considerations are.</p> <p>  For now, I will ask a more direct question.  If a child receives a negative test result, is it safe for him or her to return to school immediately?  According to Dr. Mary Favier, if a child has sniffles or is sneezing and is otherwise well, he or she can attend.  Coughing was not commented on, though.  Many children are asthmatic or have other respiratory illnesses and coughing occurs frequently outside of Covid cases.  Where children are frequently coughing, should they refrain from attending school and isolate?  Greater publicity for some of these issues is needed.

I will provide an overall written answer.</p> <p>  Dr. Favier commented on the issue of coughing at least in the press conference the other evening.  There will be children with coughs as part of underlying conditions, but at issue is the onset of a new cough.  On any given day over the next number of months, if a parent or carer has a particular concern, he or she needs to act with an abundance of caution in the first instance and keep his or her child at home.  If concerned, he or she should contact the GP.  That will lead to busy GP practices, but it is better to be sure and safe, keep the child at home in the first instance and have clarity and confidence before sending him or her into school.</p></speech>

I assure them that the whole country is listening and learning from the way they present the facts.</p><p>I wish to ask some questions about the number of people not turning up for testing.  This morning, the HSE told us:</p> <blockquote> 	We refer people for day 0 tests and day 7 tests.  Somewhere between 70% and 80% of people will show up for day 0 tests, and on occasion it gets closer to 85%.  On the day 7 tests, it is closer to 50%. </blockquote> <p>Some 50% of people not turning up is a high figure.  We were not given it in July when I asked the same question.  Will the witnesses comment on this, please?  I acknowledge that 98% of all tests are negative, which is reassuring, but it is also a reason to ensure that those who do not turn up actually are tested.</p><p>This is a particularly important question in the context of recent public commentary.  The reason it is of particular important is that, of course, we are proponents of testing and want people to turn up for their day 0 and day 7 tests.  That is absolutely vital.  We are looking at alternative testing modalities that might be less uncomfortable than the traditional test we are using at the moment, particularly for the day 7 test.  However, the result of that test does not change what people need to do.  If someone is a close contact of a confirmed case, he or she needs to restrict his or her movement for 14 days.  We want more people to come forward for testing.  What is more important than anything is that if people have symptoms, they must not take the traditional approach of waiting to see how it goes for a couple of days but, instead, come forward immediately, put their hands up, contact a GP, identify themselves as having symptoms and get a test.  That is the way in the first instance that we will control the spread of this disease and protect individuals and their families.</p></speech>

What happens in such cases?  How are they followed up?  Is this group different from those who have been in close contact with a confirmed case?  Are there two different figures for these cohorts?</p></speech>

I believe the information given this morning was that 80% of the people identified as close contacts come forward for the day 0 test, but just 50% come forward for the day 7 test.  My message is that a negative test result does not mean a patient does not have the virus.  It simply means the virus was not detected at the time the test was taken.  The test is merely one additional tool in our armoury to control the spread.  It does not change the clinical outcome or change what individuals need to do.</p></speech>

I understood from earlier comments that the HSE was trying to identify these people.  Does it correspond to a particular cohort?</p> <p>  I have spoken to someone involved in contact tracing.  This person is aware of a small number of people who do not turn up because their presence in the country might not be regularised.  I want to stress that it is a small number.  Does the Department have any evidence of that?  </p></speech>

Our public health colleagues in the HSE have identified two trends.  The first is that younger people and, conversely, much older people are less likely to come forward for the day 7 test.  Second, there is a cohort of people who do not want to come forward for testing because of the potential economic implications for them.  We made specific recommendations in that regard through NPHET a number of weeks ago.</p> <p>  To respond to an earlier question, the test and consultation are free.  Beyond that, we must ensure anyone who has to self-isolate or any contacts of confirmed cases who must restrict their movements have no fear for their employment after the 14 days and, indeed, that they will be given adequate compensation for the 14 days they are off work.  Economic circumstances simply should not be a barrier to people coming forward and getting tested.</p></speech>

I also thank Dr. Glynn for the attention he has given to Kildare.  We have had a few conference calls in the past few weeks.</p><p>Of course, Professor Philip Nolan is well known to me as president of the local university.</p><p> I represent Kildare, which is in its third lockdown, given the initial lockdown, the localised lockdown and now the second localised lockdown.  That has had a devastating effect on the local economy but also on the public at large.  Confidence and morale is at a significant low at the moment as people try to grapple with the effects of this, and it is psychological as well as economic.  People are prepared to get on with it and to do with the right thing once they can understand it, buy into it and support it.</p><p> I have listened to the testimony of both witnesses and they have both spoken about the importance of the workplaces and the clusters that have emerged in recent weeks.  One of the questions that I, as a public representative in the county, have been asked repeatedly and will be asked again this evening when I meet with the Kilcock business association, given Kilcock has had just one case in two months, is why the entire county is in lockdown when it appears to be confined to a few workplaces.  I have asked this question of many people, including the acting CMO at a conference call last week, and on many other occasions during the last few weeks.  The answer I was given, which I believe because I believe the public health advice, is that the entire county has incidences, there are cases everywhere and it has spread beyond those initial workplaces or clusters.  However, we really need to demonstrate that to drive buy-in and get public support and acceptance for the measures.  People will follow the logic and follow the evidence for themselves if they have it.</p><p> We need to make that data available.  This is something I have called for, as did the Taoiseach in yesterday's radio interview when he agreed it should be made available.  We should make available microdata at electoral district, ED, level, while ensuring it is not low enough to embarrass anybody in terms of GDPR but is high enough for people to understand whether it is in their town or townland.  A set of figures was made available on 12 August and that was the first set of localised figures since June, so there was a two-month gap, and ED level figures have not been made available since 12 August.  Effectively, if we go back as far as June, we have one date for which localised figures are available, and nothing before or since.  This is a live issue, not an academic issue, an esoteric issue or something we can resolve in a fortnight's time.  Kildare is in lockdown today, businesses are struggling today, the people are struggling today and we do not have figures for today, for yesterday or for tomorrow.  I understand the Government is in entire agreement.  The Taoiseach confirmed that to me and also confirmed it in a radio interview yesterday, and I do not think there is anyone who disagrees, yet the information is not there.</p><p> I am not sure who is best placed to answer that question, perhaps Dr. Glynn.  However, can the data be made available as a matter of urgency?  I believe it would drive public support for these measures if people could see what the situation is in their own towns. </p></speech>

On the Deputy's point, the figures for Kildare have been given every single day over the past number of weeks and for Laois and Offaly for the two weeks in particular.  What I would caution is that for many EDs there have been fewer than five cases, and many of those cases are families, extended families and family clusters, so we need to be careful about what we give out at a point in time.</p> <p>  More broadly, it is accurate that the number of cases in Kildare in particular was driven by these clusters in meat processing facilities but the people who work in those meat processing facilities live, socialise, travel and interact with people all over the county.  I have said previously that the county boundary is crude but we had to take some crude measure.  As we heard earlier, the cases were not confined to Kildare and we have seen cases in Carlow and Wexford, for example, linked to the issues in Kildare, thankfully at a lower level.  However, in broad terms, we had to pick a geography.</p> <p>  As we said previously, and as the WHO has said, at times we have to move fast at the enemy at the cost of perfection.  I would put my hands up and say that but, in saying that, when we make these decisions, we have a set of data in front of us at a point of time and we have to make recommendations and decisions based on the potential for what might happen over the following days.</p> <p>  To go back to our meeting on 7 August where I made those recommendations, on that day there had been 150 cases in Kildare in the previous 14 days but 128 of those had arisen in the previous seven days, so we were very justified at that point in moving quickly to prevent community transmission.</p><p>To echo the Deputy's words, I acknowledge in particular the work and buy-in of the people in Kildare, notwithstanding their anger and frustration about what has happened.  Their actions have prevented widespread community transmission and the situation there continues to improve.  I will ask Professor Nolan if he wants to come in on this.</p></speech>

My first question is for Dr. Glynn.  Many people with underlying conditions and parents of children with underlying conditions have contacted me.  They are worried about being constantly left out of the roadmap and other announcements.  In particular, I am thinking about a mother from Athy whose daughter has Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome and two of whose sons are on the autism spectrum.  They are not alone in feeling left out.

Can we have an assurance that a section of each roadmap and announcement of changes will consider the needs of, and include a section directed specifically at, people with underlying conditions?  Obviously they are in a very bad situation at present.</p> <p>  My next question is also for Dr. Glynn.  Many parents in Kildare are fearful of sending their children back to school this week, during the county-wide restrictions.  They feel their children are being used as part of a big experiment.  They want to see how things go.  I agree that children need to return to school.  Will Dr. Glynn comment on the likely effect of the return to school on case numbers?  What can he say to assure parents that their children will be safe?  They need reassurance.</p> <p>  My next question is for a Professor Nolan.  Many people in Kildare are very angry at being unable to leave the county.  They accept that it is for essential reasons but they are angry that the food processing plants have reopened.  They feel they are being punished for what they see as the sins of the meat factories.  What measures are in place to ensure the food processing plants do not jeopardise Kildare as its emerges from the current restrictions on 6 September?</p></speech>

I do not believe there has been any set of recommendations that NPHET has made or a set of measures that has not specifically referenced those who are older and those who are medically vulnerable.  In relation to Kildare, Laois and Offaly, I made specific reference to this group the day before we met to consider the measures because I wanted those children and adults to take particular care.  Last week, a similar set of statements was made about the country more generally.</p> <p>  With regard to children, I fully understand there is anxiety and concern among parents nationally and, of course, in particular in Kildare given the set of circumstances but, as I answered earlier, thankfully we have not seen a greater level of community transmission in Kildare than we have in the rest of the country.  The profile is very similar to the rest of the country.  The wider profile of Kildare has improved again over recent days.  International evidence suggests that children spreading Covid to other children in schools is relatively uncommon and that schools are not a key driver of community transmission of this disease.  We know from our own data in Ireland that to date fewer than 3% of children in the country under 14 years of age have been diagnosed with Covid and of these, only 42 have been hospitalised to date.  Of course there will be cases, and these cases have arisen in recent weeks throughout the country, but the key to minimising the harm that comes out of these cases is for us all to act together and quickly.  To come back to my earlier point, if people have concerns, they should keep their child at home and contact their GP in the first instance.  I will hand over to Professor Nolan, given the time.</p></speech>

Have any particular lessons been learned from the spike in Kildare and the adjoining counties, for example early detection of the sources of the virus?  Have all cases been sufficiently identified in order that there can be a rapid reaction in the event of recurrence?  Given that schools are reopening, are the witnesses satisfied that adequate measures are in place to deal with any matters arising in the event of there being an upsurge in any particular location or in general?</p> <p>  My last question concerns the country at large.  There was a huge, and very worrying, surge in Kildare between the first and second week of the lockdown in Kildare and the immediate area.  Have the causes of that been identified?  Have measures been, or are they likely to be, put in place in order to deal with that in a manner that can be replicated nationwide?</p></speech>

The two lessons that have been learned are that if we react quickly we can bring the disease back under control.  That is what the Kildare, Laois and Offaly outbreaks showed.  The second thing they show is that if there is a very large outbreak the risk of diffusion into households and communities is higher than if there are smaller outbreaks.  There was a greater volume of cases and spread into household settings in Kildare than in Laois and Offaly.  In response to an earlier question, this could have happened in any county in the country.  Most counties in the country have the kind of workplace settings that are capable of amplifying this disease.  Quite a lot has been learned within those settings.</p> <p>  For the reasons Dr. Glynn alluded to earlier, in terms of the reopening schools there is a level of assurance.  It is very unlikely that if a child were to bring a disease into a school he or she would spread it to another child.  It is then unlikely that the child would bring the virus home and spread it back into his or her home.  We need to remember that adults moving around in society, in workplaces and other settings, are more likely to transmit it between households via adult-to-adult transmission.  In no way is it is an experiment.  It is a carefully judged prioritisation of what we need to get back to, having done a very detailed risk assessment.</p></speech>

Naturally, we have a special interest in the situation in Kildare because it is the location in which we reside.

My first question is directed to Professor Nolan.  We saw the significant outbreaks in food processing plants, particularly meat factories, over the summer.  What other sectors, workplaces or venues is NPHET monitoring particularly closely for potential outbreaks of the virus?  It seems to me that we may have other workplaces or social settings where there is particular danger of an outbreak occurring due to the nature of human contact in those settings.  It would be good to know where those dangers lie.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#SS00300"><p>I will make a very brief comment.  I think Dr. Glynn, as a public health specialist, would be better placed to comment on some of that.  There are particular circumstances that apply in industrial settings, where there might be chilling, high airflow and so on.  Leaving those factors aside, any high-contact workplace, as one might call them, represents a risk of transmission.  We have seen and continue to see smaller outbreaks - smaller because the workplace settings are smaller - in a very wide variety of settings.  It is simply a matter of emphasis.  Public health colleagues would concentrate on the fact that any workplace where people are required to come together and work closely represents a risk of transmission.  Therefore, if an index case appears in such a setting, they move quickly to try to understand whether transmission has occurred within that setting.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is that public health colleagues have a very clear picture in their heads as to which workplace settings are higher-risk and which are lower-risk.</p> <p>  I wish to make one other brief comment, though, which is that there are also high-traffic situations, such as in the hospitality and service industries, where people are not necessarily congregating but the staff are exposed to a high traffic of people past them.  This is a situation in which not only do we want to watch for transmission but the employees need to be very careful in their preventative measures, and the patrons of those services need to respect the fact that those staff are also front-line staff.  The patrons needs to be exceptionally careful not to transmit the virus in attending a restaurant, bar, hotel or whatever else.</p></speech>

I have three questions for Dr. Glynn, but perhaps he could also address the one about particular workplaces that might be vulnerable.  I will go through the three questions and he can take them all together.</p> <p>  There is a particular risk of outbreaks in congregated settings such as schools and meat factories.  As NPHET considers the broad use of low-sensitivity, low-cost, rapid, frequent antigen testing, does Dr. Glynn accept that frequency and rapidity of testing may be more important factors in outbreak detection than high sensitivity?  Should blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients be considered as a treatment for infected people who have been hospitalised?  Third, the latest Government advice is that people should avoid using public transport where possible.  According to the Garda, road fatalities have increased by 9% over the past year, and 27% of those who died were walking or cycling.  Has NPHET weighed up the costs to society of more deaths through road collisions and increased air pollution, as more people are encouraged to drive, against the benefits of increased isolation?</p></speech>

If a pandemic does anything, it shines a light on those in our society who are most vulnerable, and this pandemic is no different.  The work my colleagues in the HSE and public health are doing now is just on a greater scale in respect of vulnerable groups: Roma, the Travelling community, those living in direct provision and those living in residential care facilities.  Infectious diseases impact these groups disproportionately, and we need to continue to do all we can to ensure that these groups in particular are protected as we navigate our way through the coming months.  That is why at all times when I talk about where we are going with this, I say this is one of the three priorities on which we must focus.</p><p>As a society, we all have a role to play as individuals in keeping transmission of this disease low so that those who are less fortunate than ourselves are protected from community transmission and the effects it will have on them if they become infected.</p><p> In relation to antigen testing and blood plasma, I would say that all new technologies and interventions, including testing and diagnostic screening treatments, are being kept under review.  We are open to all of them.  At present we are looking at new forms of testing to complement our existing nasopharyngeal swab and polymerase chain reaction, PCR, tests and we will continue to do that.  We are constantly looking to improve our surveillance, whether through waste-water surveillance or other methods.  This is an evolving situation.  We are learning, but we do not want to rush something through that is not ready or will have unintended detrimental consequences in terms of our ability to manage this.  We are absolutely open to learning, changing and evolving, but we need to do that in a considered way.</p><p> In relation to the avoidance of public transport where possible, the effect on air pollution is not one of our considerations in the first instance given that we have recommended this for such a short period of time and that wider use of transport more generally would have been down so much for such a prolonged period of time.  Of course, I understand that our recommendations have an impact, but when we make recommendations the intention is that if those recommendations are effective, they will only be implemented for a short and targeted period of time to protect public health in the first instance.</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.  They have the toughest job in the country and it is not going unnoticed.</p> <p>  My first question is to Dr. Glynn.  I have been in regular communication with my colleague, Senator Wall, and, indeed, residents from Kildare.  Can Dr. Glynn envisage any scenario over the next couple of days, if the numbers continue to go down in Kildare, that prior to this weekend there could be a lifting of the restrictions in Kildare?  I understand there were five new cases yesterday.  Can Dr. Glynn envisage that happening or will they continue until 6 September?</p></speech>

If a point comes where we feel we can lift them, we certainly will lift them.  We are fully cognisant of the impact of these measures.  What we really want to do is get Kildare back aligned with the rest of the country so that we have one set of measures for the country as a whole, with one set of messages that everyone can adhere to nationally with a common set of aims and objectives.  As soon as we can, we will.</p></speech>

As Dr. Glynn stated recently, and as Mr. Paul Reid said in the first session this morning, we will be living with this virus for a time to come and we will have to come to terms with how we will deal with that.  What work is NPHET doing in relation to the restrictions on air travel at present?  I speak as someone who represents a constituency with many airport workers who are fearful for their jobs.  I suppose what came to light this week in the public consciousness is that those who travel into the country, even if they have a negative test, must still restrict their movements for 14 days.  Where do we go from here?  It is unsustainable.  What systems can be brought into place to bring travel back to some kind of normality?  Can Dr. Glynn give any hope to the industry in that regard?</p></speech>

We have a particular lens through which we view these matters.  I fully accept that the Government needs to make decisions based on a wider set of priorities.  From my perspective, I do not see a scenario where we will have widespread travel over the coming months.  Of course, NPHET will continue to evolve and look at the situation.  We are looking at the situation but over the past 14 days alone, we have had 69 travel-related cases in this country.  Every one of those cases can lead to further cases.  For now, unfortunately, our message remains the same.</p><p>I know it is not a message that people will welcome or want to hear but it does remain the same: everyone should avoid non-essential travel.</p></speech>

If this was to be implemented would it be useful in any way in changing the advice or is a person just as well getting a test at a local test centre as opposed to the airport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#UU00300"><p>The test we have is an excellent diagnostic test when used under clinical supervision where one has a high suspicion that a person has the disease, with a one in 100 chance or a one in 500 chance of having the disease.  When one gets down to screening, however, it is a very poor test.  It will miss a lot of cases and will come up with a lot of false positives if there is only a one in 20,000 chance or one in 10,000 chance that the person has the disease.  This shows the limitations of testing.  A negative test does not necessarily prove the person does not have the disease.  If the risk is low, sometimes a positive test can be false.  We need better testing technologies and better testing regimes.  Certainly, from the research and literature on what we know, strict self-isolation or restricted movements will always be part of a travel regimen.  This is what protects from the spread of the disease.  We may be able to improve testing regimens that can shorten the time or change the nature of the time but realistically, in the long term, we are going to be living with restrictions on movement, perhaps alleviated somewhat by a better testing regimen.  Right now we are not in that place.</p></speech>

Is NPHET aware of, or does it have any understanding of, the worries of many pregnant women around the public health advice and messaging for Covid-19 and its impact on women in pregnancy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#UU00500"><p>We are absolutely aware of that.  There is no group that has not been impacted by this.  I know that maternity hospitals in particular have had to bring in measures that significantly impact on the experience of pregnant women and their partners.  Of course we are conscious of it.  Again, the key to alleviating the impact on pregnant women, or on any other group in our society, is for everyone to do their bit to keep this low.  The lower we can keep this disease in our society the greater the level of freedom we can all enjoy and, hopefully, the less the level of worry and anxiety that will pervade amongst us.</p></speech>

Last week the deputy chief scientist of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control spoke on RT&Eacute; Radio One.  Having analysed the data he was getting from various member states he said that movement between the countries does not seem to play a major role in transmission.  He stressed the need for local measures around testing and tracing.  Do the witnesses disagree with his assessment?</p></speech>

There were more than 2,000 cases on Saturday and 40% of their cases in recent days have been attributed to travel abroad.  While Germany is in a different position, and this is based on an article from this morning, we can only speak about our own national experience.  At one stage during the summer, when numbers had gotten really low, 20% of our cases were travel related.  Currently it is 5% with 70 cases.  To my mind the numbers speak for themselves.</p></speech>

I frequently struggle to try to figure out what our national strategy is with Covid-19.  There are calls for different approaches and so on, but I assume there is a general approach that is about minimising the rate of the virus.  Clearly, the whole test and tracing regime is a key element of that.</p><p>We discussed that earlier with representatives of the HSE.  In the early months, we spent a long time trying to get the testing and tracing system to capacity.  By the time it was at capacity of 100,000 per week, the case numbers were very low.  It seems there is now a certain degree of struggling to ramp up testing again to meet the increased numbers.  I asked Mr. Paul Reid this morning about the approach that is being taken and why, if there is a capacity of 100,000, the HSE is not using that full capacity for both reactive and proactive testing.  He informed me that the HSE's approach to testing is determined by NPHET.  Perhaps Dr. Glynn will answer the question as to why it is that NPHET is not seeking to maximise the capacity that is currently there.  Intuitively, one would think that is the right step to take.</p><p> My second question concerns the availability of data.  It is unsatisfactory that we have to keep asking for data, all of which should be open source.  I refer in particular to the electoral division figures, that is, the rates per electoral division.  NPHET released figures on 12 August and the previous occasion was 12 June, although many of us had to battle to try to get our hands on those figures.  Why is NPHET not releasing those figures regularly and in real time, rather than an accumulative figure that causes a great deal of hassle for people trying to work out the current figure and the current rate per electoral division?</p><p> My third question relates to travel.  I have been tracking the figures that NPHET has been citing in its letters and I have noted the point it has been making about raising alarm bells about the fact that there are significant numbers of travel-related cases relative to those of actual travel cases, which might result in the passing on of the virus to family groups and other settings.  NPHET seemed to be ringing loud alarm bells in that regard for a period but in its recent letters, it has made virtually no reference to figures for travel or cases indirectly related to travel.  Why is that the case?</p></speech>

That said, we have on a number of occasions reiterated our recommendations and I think our position is very clear in respect of travel.  To the Deputy's specific question, of the 69 cases that were travel related over the past 14 days, 20 were imported cases, with the remainder having been acquired through contact with imported cases in the country.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's second question, I fully accept that the dashboard needs to be updated more regularly.  Significant work is ongoing in that regard and from the end of this week, it will be updated and will continue to be updated much more regularly, including by giving a breakdown by county for the previous 14 days, as opposed to just a total figure overall for the pandemic to date-----</p></speech>

We are precluded from giving information at that level for instances of five cases and under.  The Deputy will appreciate that in many electoral divisions or areas throughout the country at the moment, there are household clusters.  There will be electoral divisions where there is a household cluster and we have to be very careful about giving out that information - indeed, we are precluded from giving some of it.</p> <p>  That said, I am more than happy to look at how we can provide more information.  I fully agree that the key to maintaining public acceptance and buy-in to this is information and data.  The more we can give, the more we will give.  I will commit to that.  Professor Nolan might wish to come in on that point.</p></speech>

There is both active testing, in other words, people who come forward because they are symptomatic, and proactive testing, that is, tracking down the contacts of those people and being proactive in terms of screening in areas where we think there is a risk of disease or a risk of major consequences if the disease breaks out.  Even though it may reassure people, it is pointless and a waste of resources to start using the testing capacity in some broad-brush sense.  Testing capacity ramps up as disease ramps up and ramps down, quite frankly, as disease ramps down.</p></speech>

This includes all healthcare workers in nursing homes and, as I am sure the Deputy heard this morning, all workers in high-risk meat processing facilities around the country.  That is a level of proactive testing very few, if any, countries in the world are currently undertaking.  That notwithstanding, we have a capacity over and above that and that capacity will be vital over the coming weeks and months.  It is vital also that it is protected and ready to go when it is needed for those who are symptomatic, parents who are concerned and children who have symptoms and need to be tested.  Let us be clear, the 100,000 capacity will be required over the coming months but there is no benefit in using it for the sake of it at this point.</p></speech>

Over the next few weeks, almost 1 million people will return to some sort of educational setting.  That is a huge logistical headache for everybody involved.</p> <p>  My first question is on a comment made my Dr. Michael Ryan of the WHO, who said that school reopening should not become a political football.  On purely medical grounds, is Dr. Glynn confident, as the acting Chief Medical Officer, to facilitate the full reopening of all schools in the context of the current figures?</p></speech>

That does not mean there will not be clusters and that we will not have issues over the coming weeks.  However, after six months of children having no schooling and all the societal, social, mental and well-being impacts that has had on them, weighing that up against our experience with children in Ireland to date, the experience internationally where schools have reopened, all the measures schools in Ireland have put in place to protect our children, the work that teachers and principals have done around the country, and the ability of parents individually to make choices and to act responsibly over the coming months, we are fully supportive of our education system fully reopening at this point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#WW01100"><p>What we have seen over the past number of weeks is a rise in the number of cases generally in our communities around the country, the vast majority of which have been in households.</p><p>It is no surprise that children living in households where there is a case have themselves being identified as cases and that is entirely consistent with the picture internationally.  The key reassuring point to make to parents and carers who are particularly worried is that the vast, vast, vast majority of children who are diagnosed with Covid-19 will have mild, if any, symptoms and our experience in Ireland to date bears that out.  We have had 274 cases in children up to four years of age and 507 cases in children up to 14 years of age to date.  Just 42 have been hospitalised and thankfully just two have been admitted to critical care units and again, thankfully, we have no deaths.  I am not saying that some children have not had a negative outcome or a negative course as a result of this but again, we need to weigh up all of the risks and benefits when we make recommendations and decisions around this.</p></speech>

My last question relates to other countries.  As mentioned earlier, some schools in Germany, specifically in Berlin, had to close because of outbreaks.  Teachers, pupils and parents want to be assured that if there is an outbreak here, as happened in certain countries in Europe - hopefully it will not happen here - we will have no hesitation in shutting schools down in accordance with public health guidelines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.408" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#XX00300"><p>I want to say something and Dr. Glynn may want to expand on it.  We have seen an increase in cases in children, not transmissions.  Children are getting it from adults but there is very little evidence of child to adult transmission outside of the household, where it does occur, and very little evidence of child to child transmission.  We had 100 cases last week in children.  We will see 100 cases next week and the week after and they will be back in school.  It is really important not to overreact when cases are detected in school.  It is really important that we give public health colleagues the space and respect to allow them to manage any given school cluster or outbreak differently.  In no other walk of life and no other branch of medicine does one expect the full plan to be set out in advance.  We do not ask cardiologists what the plan will be if I have a heart attack next week.  It depends on the type of heart attack and it depends on a whole lot of co-morbidities.  It is exactly the same with schools.  The appropriate reaction to an outbreak in a school depends on the nature of the outbreak and the setting.  We simply have to trust public health colleagues, because they have not let us down before, to properly manage those outbreaks rather than ask them for a specific, precise protocol in advance.  There are broad protocols and principles there but we cannot say what is going to happen in any given setting this week.  We just do not know.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Glynn and Professor Nolan for their attendance here today.  My first question is for Professor Nolan and relates to the testing that was done in the meat factories, which was akin to screening and which turned up a high level of asymptomatic cases.  Were these, in fact, false positives that were recorded as asymptomatic cases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#XX00600"><p>No, I have no concern that they were false positives because the setting they are in is a high-prevalence setting.  The disease was clearly there and that gives one confidence that the positives were true positives.  It is only when one is screening large numbers of people who are very unlikely to have the disease that there is a concern about false positives.  The proportion of asymptomatic people, which was 59%, mirrors the experience internationally.  When one goes in and tests everybody in a large workplace setting, one finds that at least half of the cases are asymptomatic.  That was the case in the recent set of outbreaks in meat factories, with 41% symptomatic and 59% asymptomatic.</p></speech>

I am specifically referencing the rural wet pubs, some of which are in areas where there is absolutely no evidence of Covid around and yet they are locked down.</p><p>Is there anything on the horizon or can Dr. Glynn offer any hope or support to those businesses that they might have some regional reopening policy?</p></speech>

We recommended those measures because as of yesterday, we have seen cases in all bar one county over the past 14 days.  As Professor Nolan alluded to earlier, within counties and within a particular community area, people work, travel and socialise.  It is difficult to say that any one region in the country is devoid of disease and even if it is today, it may not be tomorrow.  On the pubs, as I have said previously, we absolutely recognise the impact this has had on small family businesses around the country and on communities that rely on their local pubs as a key social point of contact for people.  However, we have to be clear about what our priorities are.  For the next few weeks at least, our priority has to be the reopening of our education system, ensuring that goes smoothly in the context of a set of measures that are already in place for the country around reducing congregation.  I absolutely commit to keeping it under review both nationally and on a regional basis.  I reiterate that we are fully cognisant of the impact this is having on the industry.</p></speech>

Has NPHET engaged in any way with the pharmaceutical companies involved or some of the promoters to see that if these vaccines get past phase 3 trials and achieve early approval, we will be able to get some of them for the Irish population?</p></speech>

As I reflect on the Deputy's previous question, I think I probably misunderstood it.  When I speak about imported or travel-related cases, I speak about cases that have come from overseas, not travel across the Border.  None of the 69 cases I referenced would be directly related to that.</p> <p>  On vaccines, we have been actively involved in a process at European level for a number of months.  There were some announcements around that last week.  As part of the European process, we are actively engaged with a number of manufacturers around vaccines.  Ultimately, of course I am the first person to want a vaccine and vaccines so we can move on from this but we need safe and effective vaccines.  Speed cannot trump safety or effectiveness.  We are engaged so that when a safe and effective vaccine becomes available we will be able to procure it.  Precisely when that will be remains a little bit uncertain.  I would agree with the Deputy in that given the unprecedented level of research and work that is ongoing, I would be optimistic and hopeful that we will have news on vaccines over the coming months.</p></speech>

There have been a lot of illogical situations in terms of our handling of the Covid-19 crisis.  I earlier mentioned that we set out to flatten the curve, and we did.  Why is NPHET victimising one particular segment of our economy, namely, pubs, without any evidence?  Who came up with the guideline that if a person has a &euro;9 meal, he or she is safe for 90 minutes?  It is totally unfair.</p> <p>  On the return to school, many of our national and secondary schools reopened today and leaving certificate students will get their results this weekend.  Our children have been through an awful time and we all want them to return to school.  How is it logical that national and second level students up to 18 years of age can sit together in a classroom for six or seven hours while the D&aacute;il is required to meet in the Convention Centre at an enormous cost of &euro;25,000 plus per day?  I have had this debate with the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee.  We have asked that the D&aacute;il be allowed to return to its Chamber.  The advice is that we could do so at a 1 m distance but NPHET is insisting on a 2 m distance.  Where is the logic in that?  There are many things that do not make any sense.  I wish Dr. Holohan and his family well.  I understand that some time ago his advice was that mask wearing was of little benefit and that there were question marks around it, yet we are now enforcing the wearing of masks.  There is no logic to what is being done, from start to finish.  </p> <p>  I know of a young man who was out last Saturday night fortnight and met a person who had attended a party the previous night at which there were a number of people who were infected with the virus.  I am speaking about a cluster area in Cashel in Tipperary.  The young man rang his employer on Monday morning and his employer told him to stay at home and to go to his doctor to get a referral for a test.  He was tested on Monday at 4 p.m. but he did not get the results until 5 p.m. on Friday.  As I said, the area in question is a hotspot. This young man was not asked for details in regard to the other people at the party and, as such, there was no contact tracing.  The process is a mess in many ways. </p> <p>  Reference was made to a specific number of tests and contact tracing.  It is not happening.  The system is not fit for purpose.  The mixed messages are unfair.  It was unfair that the young man I mentioned had to miss a week's work and it was unfair to his employer as well.  There was no follow-up, by telephone or otherwise, in regard to the people he met who were infected.  There are some very dubious issues around the process.  We need clarity but we are not getting it.  We also need a roadmap in regard to what we are aiming to do.  I know we are aiming to beat the virus.  Flattening the curve was the big objective and we did that.  </p> <p>  I support an earlier speaker who said that we have taken the focus way from hand-washing and hygiene to mask-wearing.  Mask-wearing was supposed to be not safe.  It was frowned upon at the start.  Why do we keep changing the goalposts?  How are we to get the public to keep supporting us in this situation, including the continued lockdown of pubs?  I thank the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, for not imposing a lockdown on Tipperary, as happened in Kildare and so on.  We cannot afford it.  It cannot be sustained.  </p> <p>  As I said, there are too many mixed messages and illogical decisions, including, as I mentioned earlier, the &euro;9 sandwich which allows a person to drink in a pub while wet pubs cannot open.  That does not make any sense.  I ask the witnesses to respond to as many of my questions as they can and to reply to me in writing in regard to those questions they cannot answer today.</p></speech>

It said that restaurants, in the traditional sense of what we understand is a restaurant in this country, should open.  On masks, we have a choice.  We can send out a set of messages and stop looking at the evidence as it evolves, never change our position, never learn and stick with what we have or we can learn, evolve and build on the knowledge that emerges in the context of a virus that nobody knew about it six months ago and a pandemic that nobody in the world has had to deal with, in terms of its scale, in our lifetimes.  Yes, things will change but we all - doctors, politicians, the media and every organisation in this country - have a responsibility, if possible, to stop talking about mixed messages.  The most important messages have not changed since the start of this pandemic.  We need to wash our hands multiple times a day.</p><p>We need to stay physically distant from one another to stop giving this virus the opportunity to spread from one person to another.  We need to avoid crowds.  We need to decrease congregation.  We need to practise respiratory etiquette.  As soon as there is a symptom, we need to contact our GP and isolate to protect ourselves our families and our loved ones.</p><p> The evidence on face coverings has changed.  We have evolved with that evidence.  Yes, we were not convinced about it at the start, and one of our key concerns at the start was that people would put undue emphasis on face coverings at the expense of other measures.  As the Deputy alluded to in the question, some people have done that which is why it is so important that in all the maelstrom that everyone is talking about and everything that is going on around us, that those key basic messages keep getting put out because it is those basic things that, if we all do them collectively and individually, will prevent us from having to take much more restrictive measures that no one, least of all ourselves in NPHET, want to have to recommend.  </p></speech>

NPHET may have had the benefit of it some time earlier.  With respect to mask wearing specifically, it said the quality of evidence was low and it concluded: "There is an urgent need for more research, particularly high quality studies that provide direct evidence on the use of face masks by healthy people in the community."  The director of the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine addressed the committee two weeks ago.  He said there was no evidence whatever that masks did any harm but neither was there any high quality evidence that they were beneficial.  Does NPHET share the belief that there is a need for research on the benefit of masks or is it happy that there has been sufficient research on it?</p></speech>

The evidence that supports their utility is good but not of the kind of very high standard that we would require for an intervention that might cause harm.  I am certainly more than satisfied that the evidence available to us now supports exactly Dr. Glynn's position that in addition to all the other things that are more important, these are a very useful adjunct in circumstances where we cannot maintain the 2 m-plus physical distancing that we might otherwise like to.</p></speech>

First, on meat factories and plants, there is a village in my constituency, Watergrasshill, with a meat factory where there were 120 cases some weeks back.  I seek clarity on the HSA inspections.  They seem to be mostly pre-announced rather than random inspections.  Why is that?  Will that continue?</p> <p>  Second, on buses, Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned the return to school during the week.</p><p>NPHET's advice has changed in the past seven or eight days to recommend that face masks should be worn on buses by certain students.  Could that decision have been made much earlier?  It has caused confusion in bus and coach circles whereby people are scrambling to organise buses.  I am looking for clarity on how that decision was made and on whether it could have been made earlier.</p><p> The guidelines for social gatherings in private homes are clear, as are the gatherings for gyms.  However, there seems to be confusion about gatherings that might take place in community settings.  Are those gatherings still subject to the rule on having six people at an indoor gathering?  I am referencing the likes of Lamaze classes, antenatal classes and meetings of that nature that occur in a community setting.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor made specific reference earlier to dance classes.  Could groups such as that be split up?  Do dance schools come under the remit of education guidelines or are they considered to be community events?  I would like clarity on that.</p></speech>

What we did was we clarified the position and simply said that teenagers on school buses should do what they currently do if they get on any other public transport, which is to distance and, of course, to wear a face covering.</p> <p>  On the numbers attending gatherings, dance classes should have a maximum of six people.  What was the Deputy's first question?</p></speech>

My question is for Dr. Ronan Glynn.  I thank him for all the work he has been doing on behalf of the people.  Helpfully, on 19 August, he recorded a video on social media in which he outlined where the majority of the 1,200 cases that had emerged over the previous 14 days were from.  He identified that 360 came from meat plants, 90 from direct provision centres, 40 were linked to construction, 200 to community transmission, 200 were under investigation and 3% were travel related.  How many of those cases were attributed to sporting activities and, in particular, how many were attributed to spectators at sporting activities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.449" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#BBB00900"><p>We do not categorise cases specifically related to sporting activities but a key part of what we categorise is the proportion of cases that arise as a result of close contact with another confirmed case.  In the days leading up to 19 August in particular, we had seen that the average number of contacts of cases who had been involved in or attending sporting activities had risen to nine, which was the highest number of close contacts for a given category of case.  We have had cases and clusters related to matches, albeit a small number.  However, I have been at pains to say that while one organisation came out and characterised this as a recommendation specifically targeted at that organisation, it was not.  We simply sought to decrease congregation in as many settings as possible so that congregation could proceed in the settings that are a priority, whether that is schools or our hospital system, for example.</p></speech>

I just want to get to the facts that the recommendations are based on.  Cinemas can remain open but attending an outdoor event, whether it is 50 people or 70 people who are socially distanced, is not permitted.  Is there any evidence that people had contracted the virus as a result of close contact with an infected person after attending a football match, a soccer match or any other sporting activity?</p><p>Is there much of an issue in that respect or is it just a case of being overly cautious?</p></speech>

Those have been linked not only to sporting activities but to other forms of socialisation.  We have also had issues regarding people from different households travelling together to and from events and work.  The set of recommendations, therefore, was targeted at decreasing congregation in the round, so that congregation could continue in the areas that are most important.  Vitally, that was also done so that all sport could continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#CCC00500"><p>I appreciate that, but again I am just trying to ascertain the data backing up a decision like this.  It is a major decision.  There is now full restriction on going to a local GAA championship match, regardless of the numbers.  We are talking about large open spaces, but regardless of people travelling alone to matches and taking all the precautions, they are forbidden from doing that under the current guidance.  While there may be clusters in respect of sporting events, we are conscious, if we take the GAA as an example, that about 90,000 people are training every week and matches are taking place, as they are in soccer and other sports.</p> <p>  There may be clusters but on the issue of spectators, on which the decision was taken, is there evidence to suggest a concern in that area?  I say that because what frustrated many people, as Dr. Glynn stated, was that 500 of the 1,200 cases emerged from direct provision centres and meat plants, yet all sports spectators were banned from attending matches.  Can Dr. Glynn confirm the guidance from Sport Ireland which stated that parents and-or guardians are entitled to attend under-18 sporting events if their child is playing?  Is that the recommendation in respect of NPHET and can Dr. Glynn elaborate on that guidance from Sport Ireland?</p></speech>

If we congregate indoors, the risk of transmission is high among adults.  If we congregate closely outdoors and do not maintain physical distance of 2 m or more, the risk is moderate to low.  The big issue here is not about spectatorship.  This is about congregating in numbers greater than 15 outdoors, particularly where people from different households are freely mixing.  The very purpose of the recommendation is to allow important activities, such as participation in sports or schooling, to continue.  I say that because every contact between two adults that carries the risk of viral transmission carries that risk.  The whole purpose of the recommendation is to prevent indoor and outdoor congregation that fosters mixing between households that would spread the virus between households.  It is not targeted at any activity but at open mixing between people from different households.  The Chairman is correct that the risk is lower outdoors, but it is not negligible outdoors, particularly where people understandably let their guard down.</p></speech>

These measures are aimed at decreasing mixing between households so we can stop the virus transmitting and thereby protect the essential parts of the economy and society that we need to keep functioning, including sporting activity.</p><p>On the specific point raised by Deputy Doherty, I have confirmed previously that our recommendations are guidance.  We wish to be pragmatic.  We understand the importance of sport.  If a parent or carer needs to attend a training session or match for the purposes of child protection or guardianship, there is no issue whatsoever with that.</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of small rural pubs which may have already been raised.  One pub in 15 is open and serving food.  In one instance, people are travelling from approximately ten different parishes to the pub.  Would we be better off if small pubs in rural areas were allowed to open such that people would not be travelling to pubs in such numbers?  It would reduce the level of risk.  Has that been considered?</p> <p>  A seroprevalence study involving 5,000 people was to be carried out in Sligo and Dublin.  Have the results of the study been determined?  Are they available?  I understand it was started more than two months ago.</p> <p>   Following on from that issue, in Denmark testing has been incorporated into the blood donation programme such that donors are tested.  As blood banks here collect donations all the time, has consideration been given to such testing in order to get a feel for tracking the virus across the country?</p> <p>  Have the consequences of the long-term effects whereby many people cannot get access to healthcare, such as cancer care or orthopaedics, been looked at?  How can the provision of care be fast-tracked in areas where there are significant backlogs in accessing the treatment people require?</p></speech>

An excellent seroprevalence study has been carried out.  It shows an overall prevalence of antibodies of approximately 1.7%.  The prevalence is higher in Dublin, which was the epicentre of the original pandemic, at approximately 3%, and lower in Sligo, at 0.6%.  The study shows two things.  It shows that very few people in this country have been infected with the virus and, as such, there is no level of immunity to protect us, which is why we are utterly reliant on the public health measures to protect us through the winter and into next year.  The second thing it shows is that our modelling and surveillance system is excellent and that we picked up one in three cases all the way through the pandemic.  Allowing for the fact that half of those cases will be asymptomatic, that is what we would have predicted in our most optimistic estimation of how good our surveillance system would be.</p> <p>  With regard to the earlier discussion, we need to remember that we are talking about large numbers but that we also need to think about the small numbers and we need to think about our reproduction number.  With regard to all individual cases, whether the person in question is a spectator at a match or goes to a restaurant, if that person infects more than one other person, we are in long-term trouble.  The whole objective of what may seem like disproportionate measures to prevent people congregating is literally to prevent that situation occurring in the context of all those separate individuals in their households.  We need to keep our national reproduction number below one.  Sadly, the only way to do that is to reduce people's level of social mixing such that they only attend the things that are priorities and do not engage in things that are not priorities.</p></speech>

I would say that the single greatest thing that can contribute to addressing the backlogs that have arisen is that we do not go into reverse with this disease and that we keep the levels of infection under control such that the levels of service that have resumed can continue in the vein that they are currently operating and, we hope, can operate to a greater extent over the coming weeks and months.  However, that is contingent on the levels of the disease remaining stable.</p><p> I take this opportunity to recognise the work of healthcare professionals generally, who, in effect, bounced from managing a pandemic to immediately trying to resume services and get things back up and running.  They are now facing into a winter which will have its own challenges, including the need to address backlogs and, potentially, the need to address any rise in cases in hospitals linked to Covid.  That is why it is so important that we continue to do what we are doing.  Everyone here knows the capacity our healthcare system has.  Everyone understands how stretched we are in this country versus many other countries.  In response to many of the earlier comments, I would say that when people sometimes wonder why NPHET makes recommendations that seem entirely disproportionate, it is because we are trying to protect our healthcare system and its priorities and ensure that people who are waiting for essential appointments can have those appointments and that they are not further delayed as a result of a diversion of resources to manage Covid.</p></speech>

From the very outset of the crisis, there were some in society who wanted there to be more restrictions and, at the other end of the spectrum, there were others who believed the response was an overreaction.  NPHET has charted a very sensible middle course between those two positions.</p> <p>  In recent phases, we have moved from a situation where activities were possible or not possible because of social distancing requirements to a situation where we seem to be saying that some activities are desirable or not desirable based on social mixing.  That has led to some confusion and I do not think we have had that conversation with the Irish people.  For example, I was told about a situation in a holiday setting where a restaurant was open with social distancing of 1 m but an outdoor seating area where music was being played, and where distancing of up to 3 m was possible, was closed.  It would seem to be far safer to have people eating outdoors with greater distancing but there was not an understanding of the rules by the operators.  We need to revisit the discussion around why decisions have been made and clear up the confusion as to whether it is okay if there is distancing of 2 m and not okay if there is not.  We need to look again at how we are communicating why some activities are desirable and others are not.  The discussion around GAA matches and other outdoor games is one of the areas where clarity is needed.  We do not want those activities to go ahead because they involve mixing households, even though distancing of 2 m may be possible.</p> <p>  My next question relates to organised sports events in indoor facilities.  Guidance from Sport Ireland talks about multiple pods of six being allowed where sufficient space is available in reference to dance classes, athletics classes and so on.  Will the witnesses clarify what is meant by "sufficient space"?  In a standard school hall with pods of six, what distance would be needed between those pods?</p><p>My final question is about schools.  There will be outbreaks in schools.  We heard earlier from the HSE that they have a plan for that.  Very early on, the first outbreak was in a school in my constituency and the information was circulating more quickly than the public health authorities could respond.  I ask that everything be done to name local clusters because they are already known by parents.  The rumour mill works very fast and I ask that everything be done to have as much transparency as possible when those outbreaks take place. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.479" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#FFF00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will make a wider point in response to the first part of his question.  In many ways, the communication challenges we are facing now are much more difficult than those we faced months ago because we simply closed everything and so it was clear to everybody what they should and should not do.  As we try to get more nuanced and try to be as proportionate as possible, we will get things wrong and some of our communications have not been, and will not be, as crystal clear as they should be but we will continue to work on that.  Ultimately, as I replied earlier to Deputy Mattie McGrath, the key messages have not changed.  We want to decrease discretionary social contact between people so that the important elements of human contact can continue as we try to navigate our way through the pandemic.  From that perspective, it comes back to the basic measures that we speak about so regularly.</p> <p>  I wish to make one small point of clarification.  We want matches to go ahead and we want training to go ahead.  We understand there are risks associated with that.  We understand there will be cases and clusters arising as a result of that but we weigh that up against the potential loss of those activities in terms of mental, social and physical well-being.  We made recommendations to reduce other elements of social contact so that those activities could continue.</p> <p>  With regard to organised sports activities, I have not seen Sport Ireland&rsquo;s guidance but, ultimately, it comes back to people using judgment and understanding that they should be 2 m apart, where possible.  If there is a group of six, it should not interact with another group of six.  It is about limiting contact between households.  If there are six people from six different households and one of them is a case then our public health teams, who have been working incredibly hard over the past number of months, have six different households to contact trace and follow up with.  If the other group comes into contact with that, suddenly we have 12 households, we potentially have 12 workplaces and different school settings.  All of that has to be contact traced and followed up.  The less we congregate and mix between households over the coming weeks, the greater the chances of the current measures having an effect.  </p> <p>  We are concerned about the ongoing increase in cases.  If this continues, we will run into trouble in terms of hospitalisations and critical care.  We have only had 90 cases among people aged 65 years and over in the past two weeks.  That is a key reason we have not seen cases in hospitals and critical care units.  That simply will not continue if the increase in cases continues.  We are being given an opportunity by the dynamics and the profile of the cases at the moment, in that the disease is spreading largely among younger people.  We have been given a window of opportunity to take measures, individually and collectively, to stop this before it gets worse.  I urge people to please continue to follow the basic public health advice, never mind all of the confusion that surrounds it - cut down your contacts; cut down the number of people to your home; try to meet up with fewer people, if possible; wash your hands; wear a face covering; and avoid crowds.  They are the simple measures.  They have not, and will not, change over the coming months. </p></speech>

I heard that, according to him, he had sent his report to Dr. Glynn.  I asked the then Minister, Deputy Harris, to examine this-----</p></speech>

I asked the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to investigate this matter in early June.  Will Dr. Glynn examine Professor Cusack's report, please, and undertake a swift process to determine why Kildare suffered so disproportionately?  I had believed it was because we had more nursing homes than other counties, but that was not the case.  There is some reason for Kildare suffering disproportionately.  During the peak, 67 people were transferred from hospitals to nursing homes in north Kildare without testing.  I would appreciate if Dr. Glynn investigated the matter.</p> <p>  My second question is on testing at Naas General Hospital.  The focus is on the meat factories currently, but it is important that we not take our eye off the ball.  The Taoiseach stated that weekly testing of employees in meat factories would commence before moving to fortnightly testing.  After a positive case being identified in Naas General Hospital, I am surprised that we are not testing our healthcare workers and other hospital staff more regularly.  Such testing had not started in Naas up to the day before yesterday.</p> <p>  Will testing be available for high-risk teachers?  I spoke to the Minister for Education and Skills yesterday and asked whether it would be advisable to keep such teachers for remote learning.  What is Dr. Glynn's opinion on this matter?</p> <p>  At a health briefing for Kildare's elected representatives last Friday, Dr. Glynn stated that NPHET had certain recommendations concerning employees in meat factories.  In terms of contact tracing and the number of people living at the same address, has NPHET engaged the environmental health officer?  As of a Kildare County Council meeting last week, the environmental health officer was not looking at homes where many people were living.  Will Dr. Glynn start with these questions, please?</p></speech>

We continue to engage with him.  After Dublin, Kildare has had the highest number of cases at almost 2,200, representing 8% of cases to date.  This is part of the explanation.</p> <p>  I have given an answer on the issue of high-risk teachers.  We cannot proclaim or provide a blanket approach.  Each individual has a unique set of medical and other circumstances that mean the approach for him or her must be tailored.  People need to engage with the occupational health service in the first instance as well as their employers.</p> <p>  Regarding Naas General Hospital, my understanding is that there was a very small cluster of cases there a couple of weeks ago and that everyone who needed to be tested in respect of that cluster was tested.</p></speech>

I have been listening to the language Dr. Glynn used about how concerned he is and the window of opportunity that is before us.  It is very important and timely that he is here to reiterate the message and its simplicity about physical distancing, not mixing households etc.  It is the simple message that has applied all along.</p> <p>  Dr. Glynn has been working on the front line of this crisis for the entire period we have experienced it.  He has had to communicate lots of very different and complex messages.  What messages and communication channels has he found to be most effective in reaching people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.494" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#HHH00200"><p>From the very start we have tried to communicate as openly and effectively as possible.  Communication is paramount in a pandemic.  People need to know what they need to do and what the situation is.  We hold press conferences reasonably frequently, twice a week at the moment.  Social media clearly plays a role, but the most effective element of communication over a number of months has been the consistency of the message from our political representatives, media organisations, sporting organisations, community organisations, the public sector and private business.  Everyone was on board with the simple messages.  I fully understand why those messages have been diluted and many have stopped providing those messages, but we really need to get back to providing those messages.  Social media has a very significant role to play and we will try to up the game in the coming weeks in that respect.  I fully accept that some people feel we are not providing enough information and we will endeavour to provide more.</p> <p>  Given the current rise in cases, we are at a very delicate point.  The measures we took last week are absolutely premised on public buy-in and understanding of the rules around gatherings of six or 15 people and the need to avoid congregation.  We need everyone across society to communicate that message if it is to be effective and to prevent us having to recommend further measures.</p></speech>

We are at a most difficult phase, with rising numbers and more complex information.  There is a certain fatigue among people.  There is a general wish to move on but of course that is not possible in so many different ways.  Dr. Glynn's presence here today is very important.  I know how busy he is and I thank him for attending.  There is an opportunity for a reset concerning where we are and how we move forward.  That will depending on how successfully we manage to communicate this message.  I am not just talking about those of us in this room, but all of civil society, including the bodies Dr. Glynn has mentioned, such as sporting organisations and businesses.  We are at a most nuanced and difficult phase.</p> <p>  The last time Professor Nolan was here we had the opportunity to speak just after the committee hearing about the virus itself and its evolution.  Obviously it is a novel virus and we have very little information about it, but even during that first 12-week period Professor Nolan's group was acquiring more and more information about its behaviour and evolution.  Can he update the committee on the science of the virus?</p></speech>

Viruses mutate all the time but this one is not doing so to any great extent.  The first piece of news is that any change in the behaviour of the disease in the population is due to the behaviour of the population and not the behaviour of the virus.  We are also learning about the circumstances in which the virus is transmitted.  It transmits very strongly in households, where the attack rate is between 20% and 30%.  That is probably lower than one would expect.</p></speech>

We are understanding the circumstances in which the virus is transmitted.  The risk in a household is high and the risk in schools is lower.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#JJJ00200"><p>It is precisely that.  If I pick it up at work and bring it into a typical family household, the chances are that one in two or one in three people in that household will pick it up.  If I bring it into an atypical household, let us say a group of college students living together who would not necessarily be as intimate as a family, the chances are somewhat lower, so the attack rate is 10% to 20% in that case.  The important message is that we can prevent transmission of the virus.  It is not inevitable; it is not magic.  It spreads by close, sustained contact, and if we just put that distance between each other and are careful about our hygiene, we can prevent its transmission in households, and we can certainly, by not congregating, prevent its transmission between households.  They are the kinds of things we are learning, along with the special circumstances in places, such as meat factories, which seem to particularly promote the transmission of the virus.</p></speech>

As counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly were locked down, we heard from Meat Industry Ireland and the HSA, and they confirmed that 39 meat plants had been inspected, of which 30 inspections were pre-announced.  The day after it was announced that we, as a State, were not in a position to move to phase 4, Dr. Glynn pointed out there had been 47 cases in meat plants and four clusters, and that was the most recent of a large number of clusters.  We have had no clusters in any hospitality business yet, in one weekend, there were 6,000 inspections of licensed premises, of which less than 0.5% showed any lack of compliance.  Is Dr. Glynn happy that that aspect of the State's response was proportionate to the risk?</p></speech>

I hope that everybody recognises the need to wash their hands and to avoid congregated settings and places that are busy.  I am asking whether 39 visits to meat plants, when there has been cluster after cluster after cluster in this State and in many other states across the world, is proportionate, given there were 6,000 visits to licensed premises in one weekend and there have been no clusters in any of those.  There have, of course, been ten outbreaks in licensed premises in the UK, all of which are open whereas ours are closed.  I am asking whether that is proportionate.</p></speech>

Enforcement and visitation is one element of that but it is just one element.  Ultimately, it comes back to human behaviour.</p></speech>

I will move on to the next question.  The affected areas order was made in respect of every area of the State on 7 April.  Has that been reviewed in respect of any area of the State since then?  It was made on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer.

We were told about outbreaks in bars in Spain and the United Kingdom, when we decided we would not open ours.  If Dr. Glynn is aware of these figures from Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, presumably the health authorities in those countries are also aware of them.  Beyond the fact that we have a really bad health system in this country, can Dr. Glynn explain why our approach has been to limit travel whereas those countries have not limited travel, or at least travel within the European Union?  They have, of course, brought in very stringent testing and quarantining for people coming from outside European Union, which we have singularly failed or neglected to do.  Their approach has been very different from ours.  Will Dr. Glynn explain this?</p></speech>

I said that it was not from a definitive or scientific publication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#KKK01800"><p>I agree.  While Dr. Glynn has been answering questions I had an opportunity.  I very much appreciate all of the questions he is answering.  His advice is key not just to the State's health response but also how the economy functions at present.  The Robert Koch Institute, which is one of the primary institutes looking at this in Germany, very much backs up the figures Dr. Glynn cited.  I am not disputing the figures.  I am saying if the figures are correct and Dr. Glynn knows about them and is making decisions here based on them, then surely the health authorities in those countries know about them.  I am wondering why they are arriving at very different decisions.</p> <p>  Is it not the case that our health system is quite bad but if we continue on the road we are on economically, we will not be able to fund the health system we used to have, much less the health system we so desperately need?  This may not be a consideration for Dr. Glynn.  I am not saying it is not a consideration for him but he is a health official and he is doing a very difficult job, and I acknowledge this, but his primary responsibility is solely for health.  As Mr. Reid acknowledged earlier, we also have to be able to fund our health system.</p></speech>

What I would say is that of course health is my priority but I also fully recognise that public health and our public health system are absolutely contingent on a functioning economy.  If the economy is unduly affected by this, it will affect our health system.</p><p>That does come into our considerations.  That is precisely why, for example, we moved so quickly on Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  It is why I am so concerned about cases at the moment.  We do not have magic bullets for this disease and we are entirely reliant on solidarity, co-operation and individual and collective behaviours to keep it under control.  Otherwise we will not have a choice but to go backwards with stronger measures.</p><p> I am the last person who wants to have to recommend measures that will have a further impact on the economy and people's lives, which is why I am asking all parts of society today please to double down again on their behaviours and messages to their families, members of their organisations and anyone they come into contact with.  Let us all be upfront about our role in this and ask our friends and families to do their bit.  It is only by all of us together being vocal and honest and saying that people have to wash their hands and do the right thing that we will keep this under control.  If we do not do that, it will, unfortunately, have impacts for the economy whether we like it or not.</p></speech>

The expert advisory group on nursing homes recently reported to the Department.  Are any of its members being appointed to NPHET?  Anecdotally I have heard, very regrettably, about a lot more suicides than I have for a considerable period of time.  This is during the summer before we head into a long, dark winter.  Are there any representatives of psychiatry or other mental health representatives being appointed to NPHET which is, essentially, the decision-making body for our State?  Largely, elected representatives are following the health advice.</p></speech>

As the Chairman knows, the Government intends to publish a future framework over the next short while.  We intended to review and update its membership, but given that the framework is due to be published in the next fortnight it is prudent to wait and review that framework and NPHET's role within it and ensure that our membership is appropriate to our role following the publication of that framework.</p></speech>

How much have we increased our ICU capacity by since the initial lockdown in March?  It seems to be an international trend.  From what I understand, Dr. Glynn said the only reason for that is because elderly people have not contracted the virus up to now and once they do we will see an increase.  Am I correct in summarising his position?</p></speech>

Our original epidemic was seeded by travel.  It would be worth our while to look at the population density map of Europe and see how different Ireland is from much larger European countries and the potential of the disease to spread very quickly from one outbreak in one part of the country very rapidly to all of the parts of the country.  That is why counties that may be green for weeks on end can suddenly turn red because of an outbreak in another part of the country.</p> <p>  I can confirm, from our analysis and the analysis provided by Dr. Glynn and others, two reasons why we are seeing fewer hospitalisations.</p><p>One is that we are detecting more cases that we would have missed in the past.  Asymptomatic cases that would not have come to our attention in the past are now being tracked, traced and isolated.  They are very unlikely to be admitted to hospital.  Going back to the early stage of the pandemic, however, people aged between 20 and 39 had between a 2% and 5% chance of being hospitalised, and every second person aged between 70 and 80 was hospitalised.  We also know-----</p></speech>

What the history of the pandemic shows us is that if there is a high level of disease in the community, it spreads to older people.

The committee heard earlier today from the HSE, the acting Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Glynn, and Professor Nolan about Ireland's operational response to Covid-19 and the prevalence of the virus in our country at this time.  I will take this time, therefore, to update the committee on Ireland's approach and the priorities from now until Christmas.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, Ireland and countries across Europe locked down as Covid spread relentlessly through our communities.  Around the world, tens of millions of people have been affected and hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives.  Many lives have been lost here in Ireland as well, and we mourn every single one of them.  It has been a very difficult year for everyone and absolutely heartbreaking for those who have lost family and friends due to Covid-19.</p> <p>  Staff across the healthcare system have worked tirelessly to prepare an already overburdened health system to cope with Covid-19.  The people of Ireland worked every day and sacrificed much to comply with the lockdown, keep essential services running and flatten the curve.</p> <p>  As countries across Europe began to open up, Covid-19 started to spread again.  Countries across Europe are now acting to suppress the virus and here in Ireland we are doing the same.  The first chapter in our fight against Covid-19 was focused on flattening the curve.  The country was locked down.  Schools and colleges were closed.  Businesses were closed.  Much hospital and community care was stopped.  People isolated by staying at home.  Sports, arts and community activities were cancelled.  This approach did flatten the curve but, as we all know, it came at a considerable cost.</p> <p>  We are now in the second chapter of the fight against Covid-19.  From now until at least Christmas, our focus will be on suppressing the virus to allow us to reopen society and schools, colleges and health services and to protect jobs and those who are most vulnerable to this awful virus.  Because we know more about the virus now, it has been possible to bring in localised measures where cases grew locally and to bring in national measures as necessary to limit the suppression of the virus through targeted national measures.  Because tens of thousands of tests are being done every week, it has been possible to act quickly and suppress the virus as it tries to move, once again, through our communities.</p> <p>  Last week, we learned something very important.  Thanks to the amazing efforts of the people of counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, we know that localised measures can work.  Without doubt, the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly have saved many lives.</p><p>They have saved lives in their own community.  By helping to suppress the spread of the virus around the country, they have saved lives all over Ireland.  For that we owe them a debt of gratitude.  We know that measures that avoid lockdown by seeking out and minimising the situations in which the virus spreads are what we now want to use.  That is the approach we are using across Ireland.  It involves targeted measures to suppress the virus while keeping as much of our society and our economy open as possible.</p><p> In the Department of Health we are preparing for the winter.  A comprehensive winter plan is being developed with many measures already in place.  As has been the case since the first day Covid-19 arrived in Ireland, Government decisions are informed by the recommendations and advice of NPHET, which monitors the evolving evidence in Ireland and around the world.  NPHET, in turn, is guided by the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  We are grateful for their assistance.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for this opportunity.  I look forward to a good discussion with them in the coming hours on Covid-19.</p></speech>

I am sure he has not forgotten about that campaign.  I welcome the Minister and his team.  I have a lot of questions to get through in my ten minutes.  As an experienced politician, I am sure the Minister will know that I need distinct answers to the questions if that is possible.  I know we are dealing with very complex issues.</p> <p>  I shall first turn to the preparedness for the coming weeks and months in our acute hospitals.  We are dealing with Covid care, non-Covid care, missed care, the need for catch-up care and so on.  Given that hospitals cannot exceed 80% capacity to ensure we have surge capacity, and given the required infection control and social distancing measures, what is the anticipated shortfall in acute bed capacity?  Will the Minister say how many beds make up the anticipated shortfall, if he has that figure?</p></speech>

Can I give the Deputy the critical care capacity first?  The HSE and the clinicians are strongly focused on the figures for surge capacity for Covid-19.  As we know, before Covid-19 arrived the critical care bed capacity in our system was 255 beds.  This is 204 intensive care beds in ICU and an additional 51 high dependency unit beds, HDU.  At the height of the surge, the capacity for critical care beds was approximately 500.  As of this morning the total capacity in critical care beds is 302 beds.</p></speech>

I welcome that, and we need as many critical care beds as we can get, but I want to bring the Minister back to the number of acute hospital beds and the advice he has been given on the anticipated shortfall or anticipated lack of acute bed capacity due to the rule of not exceeding 80% capacity and due to the social distancing guidelines.

On the Deputy's question, when he and I learned about this first, the figure we were both given was that the hospitals could not operate at more than 80%.  That was based on a variety of advices from the HPSC, including the 2 m distancing.  Over the last weeks and through the next few weeks a lot of detailed work is going on, which is why we do not have a figure yet.</p></speech>

His ministerial brief states the HSE estimates an 20% decrease in the number of targeted inpatient cases for 2020.  It has also estimated there could be a shortfall in capacity due to safe distancing requirements and a reduction in utilisation to 80% of 4,700 beds, based on a current baseline of 11,000.  I submitted a parliamentary question seeking a breakdown on a hospital-by-hospital basis.  The response stated, with regret, that the information was not collected in the form I required and, therefore, was not available as requested.</p> <p>  We cannot even get a breakdown of what that will mean in each hospital or in each hospital group, and we are trying to plan and support the Government in terms of what solutions are in place.  Whatever the figure is, I think we can agree we are going to lose capacity.  What people want to know, and what front-line healthcare workers want to know, is how we will replace that capacity.  If the figure is as bad as the brief suggests and it is 4,700 beds, how is that shortfall in capacity going to be made up, and where is the plan to do so?</p></speech>

That would require about 2,200 additional beds.  What I am saying to the Deputy is that, thanks to an awful lot of good work at every hospital and by central HSE working with the HPSC, the additional number of required beds has reduced from that high figure.  There is not yet a final figure and it is being produced with the winter plan.  As the Deputy and I-----</p></speech>

What are the options on the table?  Every winter there is a crisis in our acute hospitals, and if we are to deal with Covid, non-Covid and catch-up care, as well as reduced capacity, a perfect storm is coming at us and we need more beds and staff in the system.  First, in terms of beds, how is the Government going to inject more beds into the system?</p></speech>

This is exactly what the winter plan seeks to do.  It is being produced several months early, it will be the most comprehensive winter plan that has ever been launched and, because of the costings involved, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it will not be cheap.  It will require discussion by the Government-----</p></speech>

I appreciate there needs to be a winter plan but, with respect, the question I am asking is what are the options for increasing bed capacity.  While we need more investment in primary care, while there are more supports for people with disabilities and while we need to do more in nursing homes, I am dealing specifically with acute hospital beds.  The Minister cannot give me the figure of exactly how many beds will be lost, but surely he has an idea about how he is going to replace that capacity.</p></speech>

The following are all Covid measures.  Home care packages have been increased by 2.6 million hours and community assessment hubs have been introduced, with 29 teams.  The number of acute hospital beds has been increased by 400 this year to deal with the additional capacity, and I am seeking funding to ensure that all 400 of those beds stay open.  We have additional critical care capacity of 42 beds and 1,600 nursing staff have been upskilled to support critical care.</p><p>There has been an increase in the number of intermediate care beds, with 700 open.  I am seeking that they will all stay open.  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been enhanced infection prevention and control, PPE, cleaning and disinfectant.  Part of his reasonable question is on how we increase bed capacity.  The other part is how we keep as many people as possible out of hospitals.  The clinical hubs are working well and we are looking for them to continue.  The mental health support desk has been working well and we are looking for that to continue.  Obviously, we are upgrading many other supports around that at the same time, that is, supports for GPs, new GP contracts, safe staffing levels for nursing and many more complementary measures as well.</p></speech>

There is an urgent need to bring this plan forward.</p> <p>  I have two final questions for the Minister.  I refer to the Be on Call for Ireland initiative.   According to the latest figures I received at the end of July, 1,639 front-line staff were available to come into the system, including 260 nurses, 341 doctors and 228 healthcare assistants.  Since the end of July, how many of them have been offered work?  People find it extraordinary that we have 1,600 front-line workers who could be brought into the system.  We are also being told some beds are not operational because we do not have the staff.  People are just amazed as to how we can have nurses, doctors and healthcare assistants available in what is called a "pool" to come in and they are not there.</p> <p>  Finally, he will be aware that there is a high-profile campaign by cancer patients and others to secure medical cards for terminally ill patients.  A report is due on the Minister's desk in the next number weeks.  When will that arrive?  Is this something he still supports and is this something we will see in the budget later this year?</p></speech>

The challenge we are facing cannot be underestimated and, as he pointed out, there is a real reduction in capacity in the public system.  I look forward to engaging with him and the Oireachtas on that plan.</p> <p>  I will send the Deputy a detailed briefing on front-line workers but my priority regarding nurses is that we reach the safe staffing levels agreed last year.  Nurses and midwives went on strike.  The Deputy and I joined them on the ballot for that strike.  A Labour Court recommendation was agreed.  The progress has not been made.  My priority when it comes to nursing and midwifery staff is that the agreement should be honoured and we reach these safe staffing levels much quicker than has been happening to date.</p></speech>

It is not an easy task.  I also wish all his staff in his Department well.</p> <p>   He stated in his submission that a comprehensive winter plan is being developed with many measures already in place.  I am surprised we did not get a list of those measures.  Could he set out in writing what new measures are in place because it has not been given to us?  Could that be sent on to us?</p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise relates capacity in hospitals.  In Cork a few years ago we had difficulty with a significant waiting list for gynaecological services.  A lot of them were day care procedures and space was rented in the Mater Private Hospital.  Consultants went down there and did the day care procedures.  Is any provision being made whereby space can be rented in other medical facilities to allow, in particular, day care procedures to be dealt with?</p><p>What plan has been put in place in that regard?  Has there been engagement with the private sector in relation to getting space?  It is not necessarily about getting consultants in those facilities to do the work.  A lot of consultants have complained to me about not being able to get operating time and not being able to get day care procedures done.  What is being done in that regard?</p><p> The second issue relates to consultant pay in the context of recruitment.  What progress has been made on that issue?  If the Minister is not able to give me an answer on that today, I ask for it to be provided in writing at the earliest possible date.  Regarding the recruitment of consultants, has there been any fast-tracking done to address the vacancies that currently exist?  </p><p> The third issue relates to nursing homes.  A support scheme for nursing homes is already in place.  I raised this matter with the HSE earlier and am seeking clarification, which could be set out in writing if necessary.  I seek information on the situation with regard to additional costs for nursing homes.  We must remember that they are caring for between 24,000 and 25,000 people.  Can I get clarification on that?</p><p> The final issue relates to the composition of NPHET and the fact that a sector that looks after over 25,000 people is not on NPHET.  Is that going to be revised?  I am talking about a representative from the nursing home care sector being on the team. </p></speech>

In terms of the private hospitals a &euro;25 million bridging fund has been created and the HSE is using private hospital facilities right now, right across the system, based on medical priority.  Tenders have issued from now until Christmas and potentially beyond to all private hospitals.  We are tendering for diagnostics, services and surge capacity and I have no doubt that the example the Deputy gives of tendering for facilities but not necessarily for consultants is incorporated into the thinking on that.  I want to make sure that we avoid the situation we were in earlier this year, although I fully understand why it was done at the time, in the heat of moment in a full-blown crisis.  I am not criticising the action taken but it is clear that it did not work in terms of ongoing support, although it did work in terms of creating surge capacity very quickly.  I want to make sure we avoid the block purchase of resources that happened the last time.</p> <p>  In terms of consultants, a lot of progress has been made but let us remember that we have over 500 consultant vacancies right now.  We have one of the lowest levels of consultants per head of population in the OECD and if we are to get to a decent level, we will have to do an awful lot more than just fill the vacant posts.  C contracts have been signed off recently, which had not been done for quite some time.  I hope to have news to share with the committee soon on public health doctors and transitioning them to where they should be and where they deserve to be, namely, as consultant-grade doctors.  The Sl&aacute;intecare contract is a priority for this term for the Government and we are also looking at the new entrant pay inequality issues that have been discussed in the D&aacute;il for some time.  </p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that with the permission of the D&aacute;il the nursing home support scheme was extended.  That move had the support of Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI.  We will provide a full briefing to the Deputy on that.  The nursing homes expert group report was launched recently.  That report was very comprehensive and contained 86 recommendations across 15 themes.  The implementation team has been set up and we have continuity advising that team from people who were involved in the expert group.  We will be putting a package of recommendations together which I will bring to the Oireachtas for debate.</p></speech>

Are we conducting random testing at our airports and are we considering random testing in schools?</p><p>This is very important now with all our schools going back in the next few weeks.  It is welcome that the D&aacute;il is sitting next week but I am asking the Minister about legislation.  Over the past few months, we have seen that the Garda did not have any legislation to enforce the restrictions that needed to be imposed.  Is it a priority of the Minister's that we get this legislation through next week so that the Garda has the power?  I think they are called primary laws.  We need them.  We need to make sure that we have someone who can actually go out if there is a house party or people overcrowding.  We need to give the Garda the laws allowing them to do this.  It does not have the power at the moment.  A garda told me recently that garda&iacute; do not know where they stand at the moment.  It is not their fault.  Like the Minister and his officials, they are doing a great job.</p><p> The Minister spoke about care homes and nursing homes.  He and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, launched the policies and plan going forward on nursing homes.  I am dealing with care homes that are section 39 organisations.  There are serious issues with them in terms of funding.  On the bigger scale, regarding the community employment schemes, they are finding it hard to get workers.  If we do not get funding for the section 39 organisations I fear some of them will have to close.  </p><p> What is our roadmap for the GAA sports clubs, our wet pubs which have not yet opened, and our dance studios that have contacted us all?  They normally had 50 indoors, then 15 and six.  If we can deliver on legislation, information and testing, we could give people back the confidence they need.  We are doing well but we need to do a lot more.  We could make sure people know this is our message.  We are going to get over this and we will do that.</p></speech>

I will cover as many as I can and will get written responses for the Deputy if we do not get to them all.  With regard to testing and tracing, it is a key weapon in our arsenal.  We rank well by international standards.  The HSE has been ramping up very significantly.  We had approximately 52,000 tests or thereabouts last week.  One of the days last week saw the highest number of tests ever conducted in Ireland.  We have serial testing being rolled out in nursing homes, direct provision centres and meat processing plants.  There is a lot of community testing going on as well.  As the Deputy says, randomised testing will be introduced shortly to the airports.  With regard to schools, the public health advice is against that.  We are obviously led by the public health advice in that way.  If there is more information that can be provided to the public and the Oireachtas on an ongoing basis in terms of testing and tracing we will certainly endeavour to do that.  If the committee has views on that as to how we can be helpful, Chairman, please let me know.</p> <p>  On wet pubs - can we just call them pubs? - the public health advice is very clear.  Pubs cannot open right now.  I really do understand the pain, anguish and suffering that is causing for so many publicans and their staff around the country.  Based on public health advice and what is required to suppress this virus and avoid a second lockdown, that is the very clear position of the National Public Health Emergency Team.  They have said that restaurants can open.  It is not "wet pubs".  It is pubs and restaurants.  Some pubs are operating as restaurants at the moment, which is good and fine.  The international evidence is that we do not see a lot of clusters coming from restaurants, which is why the recommendation from NPHET was that they open.  However, it is my firm view that the moment it is deemed safe for the pubs to open, they need to open.</p> <p>  With regard to the GAA, I heard a lot of criticism from the GAA including singling out the acting Chief Medical Officer, which I have to say I take exception to.  The acting Chief Medical Officer's job is to advise me and Government.  His only focus is on saving lives.  The easiest thing in the world for NPHET would have been to advise us to just close down all sports.  We are at a tipping point, we could be looking at another national lockdown and we have to take this deadly seriously.  It would have been quite reasonable for NPHET to say for the next three weeks, in order to protect the country and lives, we simply have to stop sports.  To its great credit, it did not do that but recognised the incredibly important role sports play in our communities and for our country.</p><p>It said for that reason everyone can train and all matches can go ahead.  The advice it has is that playing of the matches and training is not where the virus spreading.  All it recommended was that for three weeks people did not spectate.  Obviously people can attend for child protection and safety reasons.  I hope that message is heard is by the amazing sporting institutions in this country, be it the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU and so on.  The public health advice was to protect these organisations and to protect sport and ask only that for a short period spectators not attend because the evidence is that there are cases associated with activity before and after training and matches.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#YYY00300"><p>I thank the Minister for attending this session.  I compliment him and his staff on the work they are doing and I wish them well.  Taking the Kildare example, if the Minister was to identify a single issue that might have contributed to the upsurge in Kildare, what would it be?  Would it be a lack of attention to social distancing or, given that the pubs are not open and will not open in the near future, house parties or was it a lack of attention to hand hygiene and so on?  I would welcome a response from the Minister on that question.</p> <p>  Given that we are facing into the winter, and arising from the possibility that a single issue was a contributory factor in the recent outbreak in the midlands-Kildare and adjoining counties, can the Minister be certain of the ability of the system to deal with any further outbreaks that might occur in the community, in schools or adjacent to schools, in clusters or in meat factories and does it have the capacity to do so quickly?</p> <p>  A number of people have raised the question about the pubs.  I acknowledge what has been said.  In the absence of pubs as a social centre for the public there is a tendency for people to seek alternative locations that are not under any control.  What does the Minister say to the publicans who say they can achieve social distancing without any difficulty?  There will be some pubs that cannot do so but those that can are prepared to provide a service that is supervised as opposed to unsupervised and, as a result, safer places for social outlets for the public.  What does the Minister say to their submission?</p> <p>  My final point is in regard to the winter plan, special needs children and the ability to provide the necessary services for them, particularly in regard to children with autism.  There is strong evidence to suggest that owing to the lack of speech and language therapy, for example, their condition has deteriorated sharply.  To what extent can the Minister address that in the short to medium term and does he intend to do so?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#YYY00400"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan.  The Deputy's first question, understandably, relates to what happened in Kildare and the reason for so many cases so quickly.  The advice I have is that it is a combination of factors, including high-risk workplaces in terms of Covid.  That is the experience in Ireland.  Nearly half of the workplace clusters to date, before this happened, had been in meat processing plants.  That is the experience around the world.  It is believed that travel may have played a part in terms of workers sharing commutes to and from work.  It is believed accommodation also played a part in terms of congregated settings.  When I ask the public health experts this question they are at pains to say that there are a lot of other unknown factors.  For example, there may have been a super-spreader or several super-spreaders but they do not know that.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that it is very important that in trying to identify what happened we do not lay blame anywhere.</p><p>The only thing to blame is a deadly virus and we are in the middle of a global pandemic.</p><p> Much good work was done in testing and tracing.  The committee has done good work in this area in its earlier sessions.  Due to the speed and significance of the number of additional cases in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the tracing time slowed down.  We need to ensure that it does not happen again.  It happened for an understandable reason, namely that front-line clinicians were deployed back to their jobs.  However, the tracing team is ramping up from about 50 or 60 around the time of the Kildare outbreaks to more than 150 by the end of the week.  As the schools go back and we seriously ramp up testing for meat processing plants, direct provision, nursing homes, and as our community testing is now high, our priority must be to maintain very high turnaround times.    </p></speech>

A colour coded alert system is being introduced as an alternative to the previously published roadmap for reopening.  Does the Department have a date for its publication?  What can the public expect from the system?  Will there be restrictions tied to specific colours and so on?</p> <p>  Second, data on hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections was released at the end of June.  There were 265 cases, so approximately 8% of all hospitalised Covid-19 cases.  The latest data from the health protection surveillance centre has identified 8,563 Covid-19 infections in healthcare workers which is about 31% of all Covid-19 cases.  As we move towards a potential second wave of Covid-19, what work is being done to reduce its spread within our healthcare facilities?  Will there be a lessons learned report on hospital-acquired infections and the high levels of Covid-19 infections among healthcare workers?</p> <p>  Third, how is the Department ensuring there will be minimal disruption to medical services in the event of a second wave?  Is the Department considering using the private hospitals as before?  Finally, at its Thursday 6 August meeting, NPHET discussed alternative testing pathways for children.  The standard nasopharyngeal specimen is upsetting and offputting for many children and their parents and guardians.  The alternative, less precise, oral fluid or saliva specimen was discussed in recognition of this being more appropriate for children.  Will the Department clarify if it has received recommendations from NPHET on alternative specimen types for testing children?  As we move closer to the reopening of schools, could the Department prioritise this?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#ZZZ00600"><p>The colour coding system is a proposal from NPHET for consideration at Government level.  The Government is putting together the new detailed roadmap which will be available for debate and discussion in the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  Regardless of what is decided in the new roadmap, between now and Christmas we are in a new chapter.  The strategy is: follow the public health advice, suppress the virus to keep society and the economy open, use localised approaches where we can which, thanks to the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly, we know work, and critically target the measures at the areas and activities where we know the virus spreads in order to protect everything else in our society and the economy staying open.</p> <p>  On infections among healthcare workers, I agree the number looks very high.  Any infected healthcare worker is one too many.  There is no doubt but that the level of infection, prevention and control measures that are now in place were not in place previously.</p><p>That is not a criticism of the occupational help provided or of the amazing healthcare workers in our system.  It is a novel virus and it hit us quickly.  We had not dealt with anything on this scale before.  I assure the Deputy that very rigorous infection prevention and control measures are now in place.  However, we must never stop and say that enough has been done.  We have to keep going every day and week and we have to keep tightening up on the protections, not just for our healthcare workers but for our patients also, not just for those working in the nursing homes but for the residents also, and so on.</p><p> The Deputy asked an important question that weighs on my mind a lot, which is what happens to healthcare services if there is a second wave.  The short answer is that nothing good happens.  As we all know, before Covid-19 arrived, we had the longest healthcare waiting lists in Europe and the new information on how long they have become because of the elective care that had to be paused makes for sobering reading.  One of the reasons the winter plan we will propose is so comprehensive is in order that we will be able to deal with Covid-19, have surge capacity, get the healthcare system running to deal with day-to-day demand and, ideally, start looking at these waiting lists as well.  We will minimise the disruption to healthcare but we have to be clear that if we are dealing with a serious second wave of Covid-19 in this country, healthcare services will, for a second time, be severely curtailed.  That is why it is so important for us to get the message out that we are at a tipping point and that if we all comply with the healthcare advice from NPHET, as the people of counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly have shown, we can suppress the virus.  The best way we can all protect healthcare workers and the best thing we can do to make sure our hospitals and community settings stay open is to suppress the virus in the community.</p><p> I will get the Deputy a written response to her question about saliva tests.  The short answer is that the matter has been discussed by NPHET.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#AAAA00200"><p>I am perplexed as to what is happening in this session.  When we asked the Minister to come to the committee a few weeks ago, he was unable to do so.  He is here now.  I am not sure if he is aware of this but he is the main event today, not just for the committee but for the people of Ireland who want to see a plan and some certainty.  The committee received a three-page opening statement, which was well spaced out with a lot of gaps, half an hour before the session began.  There is no submission or further detail, and even within these three pages - and a lot can be said within three pages - there is nothing that gives people any kind of clarity or guidance on what they will have to do until at least Christmas, to use the Minister's timeline.  That is deeply concerning.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about a winter plan a number of times today.  The chief executive of the HSE explicitly stated earlier that the HSE is not referring to a winter plan this year.  He pulled me up on that earlier and said the HSE was looking to manage its services through winter and into next year and that it is in a totally different realm.  I am wondering if the Minister and the HSE are even talking to each other.</p> <p>  In the Minister's opening statement, there is no mention of direct provision, meat plants or travel restrictions and how travel will work.  There is no mention of a roadmap either.  The Minister mentions Kildare, Laois and Offaly, which is quite disingenuous.  If Kildare, Laois and Offaly are to be the pilot system for what we will be doing between now and Christmas, I am deeply concerned.  The previous speaker asked about a roadmap and the Minister said a roadmap would be presented to the Oireachtas for discussion in the coming weeks.  How will that work?  Will we all thrash out a roadmap across the floor of the Oireachtas for a number of weeks before it is delivered?  It is up to the Minister, on the advice of NPHET, to deliver a roadmap so that we all have certainty.  We require leadership on this.  I am at a loss as to where we are going.</p> <p>  To take what little detail the Minister has provided, on the localised county-by-county approach, how would it work for a county such as Dublin?  God forbid there will be a big outbreak in Swords or Balbriggan.</p><p>Is the whole of Dublin city and county going to be closed down in that scenario?  Will Dundrum and Shankill, and the people there, be shut down while Ashbourne and Drogheda, only three or four miles away from those towns, remain open?  How is that going to work?  </p></speech>

I would like to correct several incorrect statements which he made.  First, I was available to come to the committee.  The Chair and I had detailed communications on that and I am more than happy for Deputy Smith to discuss that with the Chair.  That suggestion, therefore, is absolutely untrue.</p> <p>  Deputy Smith, and not the committee, has also suggested that is it unacceptable that I come here with a plan that is still in development.  I imagine that the Labour Party has not finalised its alternative budget yet.  It is not outrageous for the Deputy to not be able to present that alternative budget plan because he and his colleagues are still working on it. </p></speech>

The pandemic is happening now, and the Minister has been mentioning this roadmap for weeks.  The schools are back today.  I am not here just to make a scene.  I am genuinely worried and perplexed as to why we do not have more detail.  I am genuine about this issue and this is not for show.</p></speech>

I will try to answer then.  Let me take the Deputy as asking his question in good faith.  The schools are opening this week.  It is positive news.  There is a very detailed plan for the reopening of schools and an enormous amount of work has gone on in that regard.  I am sure Deputy Smith would agree with me on that aspect.</p><p>The winter plan is happening months before it has happened in any other year.  I would love to be able to give the finalised plan to the Deputy today.  What we are doing is accelerating it by several months.  It will be more comprehensive than anything ever deployed in Ireland before.  We must get the plan right and, as I am sure Deputy Smith will appreciate, it has to be fully costed because I need to come to the Oireachtas for the money for it.  </p><p>Turning to what we are looking at from now until Christmas, there will be detail.  I am sure it will be appreciated that, just as in the case of Deputy Smith and his colleagues in his party regarding their alternative budget plan, we have to put that detail together and test it.  When that is done, I do not believe that it is a lack of leadership to come to the Oireachtas.  I believe it is the role of the Oireachtas to interrogate the Government and I look forward to the debate with Deputy Smith and colleagues in the Oireachtas on this issue.  </p><p><b>Chairman:</b>I thank Deputy Duncan Smith and the Minister.

I also struggle to figure out what exactly is happening with regard to testing and tracing.  I raised this issue with Paul Reid this morning and asked him why the 100,000 tests per week capacity that is currently available is not being used.  He told me that NPHET determines the testing that is done.  I asked NPHET about the matter and was told that it is important that testing capacity is protected and ready to go when it is needed.  Does the Minister understand what that means?  I would suggest that this testing capacity is absolutely needed now.  All one needs to do is to look at the outbreak in Cahir, for example, where there were 22 cases in a meat factory and 16 other associated cases.  Why were we not using that spare capacity to test in the high risk settings?</p></speech>

What is happening right now is the exact answer to the Deputy's question.  We had a much lower level of testing approximately two months ago when we were down to approximately 20 positive tests per day.  As the Deputy is aware, there was a big programme of work involving weekly serial testing for nursing homes which was very useful but provided a very low positivity rate of 0.13%.  What has happened in recent weeks is that there was an outbreak in County Kildare and it was right and proper that serial testing for meat processing plants was rolled out.

It moved heaven and earth to ensure we could scale up rapidly to 100,000 tests and we are now moving in that direction.  Last week, we hit 57,000 tests.  What we are seeing right now is a vindication of NPHET's advice and of the HSE having that capacity ready to deploy as we need it.</p></speech>

There are five separate inquiries ongoing in that regard and the data make for extremely grim reading.  There were 971 Covid-related deaths in nursing homes and 56% of all such deaths are associated with nursing homes clusters.  Of the 5,608 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in nursing homes, only 422 patients were hospitalised.  As I said, it all makes for really grim reading.  Will the Minister commit to a public inquiry into the catastrophe that has happened in nursing homes?  Such an inquiry is owed not only to the people who died in those homes but also to their relatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#DDDD00600"><p>We may well end up at a public inquiry into what happened in nursing homes.  I know Deputy Kenny and many other Deputies have been advocating very strongly for that.  The loss of life is heartbreaking and, understandably, relatives are asking whether all that could be done was done.  We have to look at this now, not with the benefit of hindsight but with the benefit of understanding that what was done happened in a crisis the likes of which had not been seen before.  I am aware, as is the Deputy, of some very serious incidents, both in terms of individual nursing home residents and of very high mortality rates in particular homes.  As the Deputy said, the various agencies of the State have been looking very closely at what happened.  I am sure Deputy Kenny has seen the HIQA report which looked at the half of nursing homes that did not have Covid outbreaks and how prepared they were before the pandemic.  I have asked the authority to do the same report for the other 50% of facilities.  Most important, we have had the nursing home expert group report, which contained 86 recommendations.</p> <p>  I hope the Deputy agrees that the number one priority for us all right now is making sure everything that can be done to protect nursing home residents and staff is done.  The focus now is on what we have learned, what has worked well here, what has not worked well here, what has worked well in other countries and whether we are doing everything we can to protect the people most vulnerable to this awful virus.  At the same time, it is absolutely proper and essential that the families of the residents who have passed away or become very sick get full transparency as to what happened.  I do not believe that now is the time to start a public inquiry because we are focusing on keeping people safe.  However, I am most definitely open to the idea.  I want to see what happens over the next while, work with Nursing Homes Ireland, the expert group and the implementation committee, focus on keeping people safe and saving lives, and then see what is the most appropriate way for families to get answers to their very reasonable and pressing questions.</p></speech>

All the evidence points to the need for such an inquiry into each one of the deaths that occurred and why there was such a catastrophe.  Behind the statistics I gave are grandmothers, grandfathers, fathers and mothers.  The data make for really grim reading and they warrant a public inquiry at this moment in time.</p></speech>

In CervicalCheck, for example, the right answer was deemed not to be a public inquiry but the most excellent work that Dr. Scally did.  That led to many recommendations which are being implemented and to the setting up of the tribunal which will happen in the next few weeks.  It is a discussion for the Oireachtas and for Government to see what the most appropriate mechanism is.  The Deputy and I were very involved in CervicalCheck and I think we would all agree that the work Dr. Scally did was the right approach in that instance.  We need to consider what the best approach is for the families of the people who have passed away to ensure their voices are heard and they get answers and transparency and that this is done in a timely way and does not kick on for years.</p></speech>

I was contacted by a person yesterday.  To get a Covid test in the public health service, it would take this person 24 hours to get an appointment and 48 hours for results.  That is three and a half days, I think.  However, someone who pays &euro;250 to the Beacon Consultants Clinic would get a result in 12 hours.  How does that match up when we have paid &euro;350 million to private healthcare arising from the pandemic?</p></speech>

I do not have the details but I am happy to look at them.  When people talk about median times of approximately three days, it includes several days of contact tracing that takes place afterwards.  The median time at the moment for the HSE from a swab to a test result is 30 hours.</p></speech>

The grass may be greener but I imagine it is just as difficult to cut on the other side.  I want to bring up a matter that is within the remit of the Covid committee as it relates to hospital inpatient stays, elective days and hospital capacity.  I refer to the issue of having a second catheterisation laboratory at University Hospital Waterford.  We have seven cardiologists in the centre trying to access all of their patient schedules through a single cath lab.  The Government has given a commitment in the programme for Government to develop a project.  A tender will be issued in September and it will take four months to evaluate who the contract should be awarded to.  It requires an Office of Government Procurement review.  Will the Minister give a commitment to short-circuit that process?  There is no need for it to take four months.  This project is heading for two years and we have yet to award a grant of tender build.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the ongoing work he did before he was a Member of the Oireachtas and continues to do now.  The Deputy and I both know that his question is not within the remit of the country's response to Covid-19.  Nonetheless, I know it is something that is very important to him, the other Deputies in the Waterford area and, most important, the people of Waterford and the region.  The programme for Government gives specific commitments on this matter.  Deputies Shanahan, Butler and Cullinane and the other Deputies and public representatives in Waterford deserve great credit because they have fought a hard fight for that.  As Deputy Shanahan and I both know, there has been significant pushback.  The second cath lab being put in place is a massive win.  The time it takes to do this is based on the appropriate guidelines.  I am happy to ask for a report and see if the project can be accelerated because I am all too familiar with how important having the facility up and running is to the people the Deputy represents.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for that.  He and I discussed the type A contracts that were to be offered at the time of the private hospitals deal and I heard the Minister refer earlier to funding being put aside for additional capacity.</p><p>If contracts have been written with the private hospitals, will the Minister again seek for private fee-charging consultants to be included or will they be excluded from providing a service under that arrangement?</p></speech>

Tenders have been issued to all private hospitals.  This is not being done in a co-ordinated way by the association this time.  Tenders have been issued for services, beds and surge capacity and are being negotiated hospital by hospital by the HSE.  It is entirely possible that, as well as procuring beds and diagnostics, we will procure services on a procedure-by-procedure basis just like the NTPF does, which would involve the people currently working in those private institutions.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that a large number of mainly foreign doctors have been residing in Ireland for many years at registrar level.  Is there an opportunity to consider providing additional training or fast-tracking some of these doctors?  They have the experience, but it would appear that, for other reasons, they are not being appointed to consultant positions.  The Minister does not need to give me an answer.  This is just something he needs to consider.</p> <p>  Although we have been discussing Covid and the deferment of elective patient procedures and so on, there are significant resourcing issues in the National Ambulance Service, NAS.  New ambulances and additional capacity were tendered for.  We need to look at this issue long and hard before the winter arrives.</p> <p>  My time is up, so I will send the Minister a document that I imagine has been sent to many Deputies and Senators.  It relates to a submission that has been backed by Professor Michael Levitt, a Nobel laureate from Stanford University.  It is worth discussing with NPHET.  It challenges some of the perceived wisdom that obtains currently.  It is important that the submission be looked at by outside health experts so that we can all agree that we are following the best path.</p></speech>

I have a number of queries, which I will keep brief, as I am interested in hearing the answers.  Recently, we came across the omission of post offices, credit unions and banks from regulations on face coverings.  I assume that this relates to security concerns at such facilities.  Will the Minister provide clarity on this matter?</p> <p>  There is an issue for those aged over 70, on whom the recent guidelines have impacted the most.  They are restricting their movements and returning to some degree of cocooning.  Will the Minister provide people in that age bracket with some practical advice as to what is expected of them, how they should go about their business and how they should restrict themselves daily to ensure that they are adequately socially distancing and so on?</p> <p>  Many elderly people have appointments in the North under the NTPF.  In a time when we are asking people in that age group to socially distance and cocoon, has the advice changed for those who have appointments in the coming weeks and are under such impositions?</p> <p>  My final question is on meat plants.  The majority of testing seems to be pre-announced rather than random testing of employees.  What is the rationale behind that?  Will the Minister explain the distinction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.670" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#GGGG00100"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The short answer to the question on face coverings in financial institutions is "Yes", for the reasons the Deputy has outlined.  As I am sure the committee will appreciate, I want to avoid sounding like I am the Chief Medical Officer by providing direct public health advice.  I will do my best to paraphrase the advice of the acting Chief Medical Officer.  The advice is essentially to use extreme caution right now.  We know from the data that people who are more vulnerable to the virus, those over 70 or with underlying conditions, are being extremely careful.  We know that because as the number of cases has gone up and up, the number of fatalities, hospital admissions and intensive care unit admissions has thankfully remained stable and very low.  We know that people who are more vulnerable to this disease are already exercising their judgment very well and very effectively.</p> <p>  The message during this period, which will hopefully last just three and a half weeks, is to be even more careful.  What does that mean?  It means people should limit their number of social interactions and limit the number of people who come into their homes.  Shopping should be done during the times designated for more vulnerable people, if that facility is available.  If it is not, more vulnerable people should seek other ways to have shopping brought to their houses.  People have asked me if they can still go on their holidays in Ireland.  The answer is absolutely "Yes", but they should take all the precautions they would take at home.  Social interactions should be limited, face coverings should be worn and others should be asked to wear them and so on and so forth.  </p> <p>  This is not just up to people who are vulnerable.  It is up to everybody else as well.  We all have a role to play.  The Chief Medical Officer spoke passionately this morning about the need for solidarity.  The best way to protect people who are vulnerable to this disease is to suppress the disease in our community.  That means keeping our distance, limiting the number of people we meet with, washing our hands, wearing face coverings and following the other measures.  That is the message I want to send and which I hope everyone in this committee will relay.  We have to do this together and we can do it together.  We know that it works.  </p> <p>  People can absolutely still go to Northern Ireland for health appointments.  The Deputy had a final question about serial testing in meat processing plants. </p></speech>

Will this practice change or will it continue?</p></speech>

There are randomised inspections, which the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, have now stepped up, as is right and proper.  Then there is mass serial testing.  When the National Ambulance Service comes to a plant, it is important that its staff can carry out testing quickly.  That means notice must be given.  However, no concern has ever been raised about providing notice of testing.  The concern was that inspections needed to be more randomised.  That is beginning to happen.</p></speech>

I will get the exact figure for the committee, but I believe I read this morning that something like 22 of the last 27 HSA inspections had been unannounced.  I will provide the committee with a full briefing on that.</p></speech>

The Minister was quoted as saying at a recent press conference that in one weekend 6,000 pubs were inspected and 26 were found to be non-compliant.  That can be compared with the meat plants.  There is one in my own home town of Cahir.  Only 39 inspections were carried out in meat plants and 30 of those were preannounced.  Those figures are stark.  They are the Minister's own figures.  Those pubs were inspected in a single weekend.  An Garda has enough to do without visiting pubs.  What does the Minister have against pubs?  They have not been found guilty of anything but they have been blackguarded and destroyed.</p> <p>  I refer also to dance schools, musicians and artists.</p><p>They are being left behind and crushed.  There is also the cohort of people with disabilities, especially those on the autism spectrum and special needs children.  They have really suffered and they are not fully back up and running yet.  Huge attention must be given to them, which is very challenging.  They must be supported because they need that. </p><p> There was a situation at Walsh Mushrooms in Golden.  Why is testing not done at the plant, given there is ample space, rather than going into the middle of a village and frightening people by setting up a camp there?  I salute everybody who did that and salute the community for its engagement.  There is further testing next Saturday but it should be done at the plant, where there is plenty of space away from the local village.  It puts fear into people when they see the Army and Garda arrive with the whole entourage.  The inspections are pretty stark.</p><p> There is also the whole situation regarding the treatment of publicans who have opened.  The Minister can call them what he likes today, and he can call them restaurants, but they are pubs.  Many of them do food and many are forced to do food because, apparently, the &euro;9 worth of food is better than any antidote or cure.  Food is the cure.</p><p> The Minister is giving out mixed messages, which are very wrong and very damaging.  I put it to him that he and the Taoiseach have dropped the ball since they took over.  I wished them well when they took over but they have dropped the ball and lost public confidence.  Some of that was due to the Minister's own response at a press conference where he equated the virus to children being on a trampoline or people driving a car.  Those are pretty silly things to say, or else the virus is not that serious.  It is one or the other, and the Minister might explain. </p></speech>

I have the figures regarding the Health and Safety Authority.  There have been 23 meat plant inspections in August to date, and 22 of the 23 were unannounced.  I want to note the Health and Safety Authority does not fall under the remit of the Department of Health but, obviously, we are working very closely with it.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath asked whether we need more Health and Safety Authority inspections.  That is a question directly for the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, but I can give the Deputy my opinion as Minister for Health.  As we look at the meat processing plants and other high-risk areas, I want to see as many inspections as possible to make sure high-risk workplaces in particular are compliant with the protocols that have been put in place.  My preference is for unannounced inspections, for obvious reasons.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked why the pubs are closed.  I share his frustration.  It is not fair for publicans around the country, and I know that.  The reality is we are dealing with a virus that is close to having us lock down the country again.  The public health advice is that we are at a tipping point and we are doing everything we can to suppress this virus to stop a second lockdown, get the schools open, which we now have, keep businesses open, protect jobs, get the hospitals open and so forth.  The public health advice and evidence are that in other countries, unfortunately, where the pubs have opened, they have been associated very quickly with outbreaks.  That is the reason.  I really do not want to be here saying that.  I would like nothing more than to be announcing, and hopefully I will as soon as possible be announcing, that they have to be reopened. </p> <p>  The same applies unfortunately to dance schools.  It is not about going after anybody; it is about trying to save lives.  The measures the Government has brought in for this three and a half week period are based on the evidence that the National Public Health Emergency Team has on where and how this virus spreads.  What it has found is that large indoor gatherings are one of the areas where this virus spreads, unfortunately.  In being able to target that, what we are able to avoid is much wider shutdowns because our experts know more about the virus than they knew four or five months ago.</p> <p>  I fully agree with the Deputy on disability services, which are an absolute priority. </p> <p>  With regard to Golden, I want to respectfully push back.  The Deputy has made comments about why it was set up there and that people are intimidated by the Garda and the National Ambulance Service coming in.</p><p>What happened was that an outbreak was detected very quickly and the healthcare services of the State were deployed in Tipperary almost instantly.  All workers were sent home, isolated and tested.  As a result of this ability to move quickly and comprehensively, we have the best chance of stopping the virus from spreading into the community in Tipperary.  I understand the Deputy's questions and I know he is giving voice to the frustrations of the people he represents but on this particular issue I remind him that what happened in Tipperary was exactly what we have to see to suppress this virus, namely, the public health services working quickly and comprehensively to deal with the clusters as they emerge.</p></speech>

The tests were done by a private company behind closed doors.  There was space in the mushroom plant.  Why was there a difference between what happened in Golden and what happened ten miles away?  The HSE did an excellent job, as did the Garda and everyone in Golden with the locals, and I compliment the local community.  It was a whole different story in Cahir.</p></speech>

I have to say I was not especially impressed with the submission, given that it took quite a long time for us to get it.  I understand there was an issue in the Department of Health yesterday but for future reference we would expect something a little more substantial given there was such a delay.</p> <p>  With regard to the roll-out of the flu vaccine for children aged under 12 in particular, I understand that GPs were sent an announcement from the company, Sanofi, that there has been a delay in the procurement.  What impact will this have on the delivery and roll-out of the scheme?  We know there will be a delay because there is a delay in the vaccine getting here to be distributed.  What will be the delay in terms of weeks?</p></speech>

We have 1.3 million doses on order, which is sufficient for a 90% uptake among the at-risk groups and healthcare workers, all of which will be provided for free.  On the specific version referenced by the Deputy, we have 600,000 doses of the live attenuated influenza vaccine which, as the Deputy has said, will be delivered via nasal drops rather than injection.  This will cover 75% of children aged between two and 12 years.  We are targeting the groups most likely to be hospitalised by the flu.</p></speech>

That is excellent.  With regard to the numbers on trolleys today, I have a series of questions on capacity.  There are 130 people on trolleys.  I assume the Minister, as he did until very recently, accepts the INMO figures and we will not have the usual ding-dong about it counting the figures one way and others counting them a different way.  According to the INMO, which is usually good enough for most people, 130 people are on trolleys.</p> <p>  With 40% reduced capacity due to Covid-19 measures, have there been any modular builds to cope specifically with Covid?  Can the Minister say where they are and what capacity they will add?  I am asking about Covid specifically because he and I have taken issue with the previous Minister re-announcing stuff which had already been announced.  I am aware of projects that were announced pre-Covid, as is the Minister.  Will any projects specifically related to Covid provide modular capacity?  How many extra beds will they add to the system?</p></speech>

Like her, I am acutely aware of the number of people on trolleys.  I also accept the INMO figures.  I appreciate that the HSE uses a different model, but the Deputy and I have used the INMO figures for a long time.</p> <p>  With regard to reduced capacity, the figure is not 40%.  Deputy Cullinane and I had a conversation about this earlier.  The reduced capacity in terms of acute beds is reducing all the time.  The figure we were given initially was 20%.  That figure has now come down quite a lot thanks to the work of the HSE and individual hospitals working with the HPSC.  It is closer to 40%, as the Deputy said, for some issues such as complex diagnostics and somewhat complex surgeries.  In most cases, across the system we expect reduced capacity to be significantly less than 40% and some of the things we are doing to deal with that include extending telemedicine for outpatient consultations and so forth. </p> <p>  The specific numbers in terms of additional acute beds not yet announced this year comprise 400 acute hospital beds and 700 intermediate care beds.  As the Deputy is aware, they have been brought on board from a wide variety of places.  Some have come from the opening of closed capacity within full-time settings and others have been brought on board through the convention centre and other temporary places.  The HSE has engaged very closely with the Department in putting together a very detailed winter plan.  It includes consideration of the questions the Deputy has asked and how we turn the temporary additional beds into at least medium and, ideally, long-term beds.</p></speech>

There is no breakdown of exactly which beds are closed because of staff shortages or infection prevention and control measures.  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the hospitals are now balancing an awful lot of different factors, including staffing, safe staffing, new protocols for staffing, and infection prevention and control, but we are at 96% occupancy.  The remaining 4% is for a variety of reasons.</p></speech>

We know that up to 600,000 people have deleted the COVID Tracker app from their phones.  Are there any confidence-building measures in play that will encourage people to download the app again?  I am sure the Minister is concerned about this figure.  I would be very surprised if he were not.  It is in the newspaper today.  Up to 600,000 people have deleted the app from their phones, so it is going backwards instead of forwards and the figure of 1.7 million I have heard is obviously no longer correct.  Does the Department have plans to put measures in place to ensure that people will have their confidence restored in the app and that the uptake will start going in the right direction, as opposed to backwards, which is where it is going now?</p></speech>

I will urge a word of caution when the Deputy states that people have lost confidence.  Let us be very careful about what we say about this.  It is a very important weapon in our arsenal against this awful virus.  It is being used and is proving effective.  I do not believe there has been a loss of confidence in the app whatsoever.  It is working very well-----</p></speech>

A loss of confidence would be the obvious reason to me.  If there is another reason and the Minister knows it, he can share it.  I have the app on my phone.  I have done as much as anyone to promote it, but if people are deleting it, they are not doing so for any reason other than that they have lost confidence in it.  Let us be honest.</p></speech>

I appreciate that he has a particularly good grasp of the questions, the answers to which I have been listening.  I wish to concentrate on issues he will have heard me speak about before.  Most of the people who have died or have been seriously ill as a result of the coronavirus are older people or people with suppressed or impacted immune systems.</p><p>What additional steps is the Minister taking to ensure nursing homes, be they public or private, are ready for the winter, particularly for influenza and Covid, or is he satisfied that they are?</p></speech>

I acknowledge that in my time on the committee, the Deputy was a tireless advocate on exactly this question and making sure these measures were in place.</p> <p>  "Yes" is the short answer.  We have a useful report from HIQA, which examined half of nursing homes that did not have Covid outbreaks and assessed them under a wide variety of measures regarding their preparedness for a second wave.  I have written to HIQA and asked it to do the same for the other half.</p> <p>  We had a very comprehensive report from the nursing homes expert group.  They made 86 recommendations under 15 themes.  We launched it last week.  We have set up an implementation team, including the stakeholders that need to be involved.  They also have expert advice from people who were involved in writing the original report.  They will come back to me soon regarding the additional measures that need to be put in place.  The Government's goal is to make sure that everything that can be done is done for all nursing homes.</p> <p>  I believe the nursing home recommendations were superb.  Some were short-term.  In fact, we already have some of them in place.  There were medium-term ones.  They also took a look at the much broader questions around whether the regulation of care for older people in this country is good enough.  It is a point the Deputy has raised repeatedly.  The answer, of course, is, "No, it is not."  They have also given us direction in terms of the work we must do in this Government to improve elder care, be it in nursing homes or in hospitals, or, of course, at home.  We have seen some striking figures for other countries, particularly in Scandinavia, in terms of the percentage of people who can live in their older years at home as opposed to going into nursing homes if they have the supports at home they should have, and which we want to take a close look at making sure happens.</p></speech>

What progress has been made on that?  I have spoken to a number of people, either in nursing homes or who have family members in nursing homes.  Many of them would love to live at home if they could but, in fact, in the past, notwithstanding the increase in hours which the Minister spoke about, the facilities have not been there for them.  As we move into winter, there will be an increasing demand for home care hours.  Is the Minister satisfied that across all the CHO areas there will be adequate home care, both in terms of the hours available and the qualified persons to provide that to those people?</p></speech>

That is to do exactly as the Deputy said.  We have to do everything we can to keep patients, particularly those more vulnerable to Covid-19, out of hospitals.  As the Deputy said, one of the most important ways of doing that is to provide adequate home care hours.  An additional 2.6 million additional home care hours have been deployed and sanctioned.  In the winter plan, we will look at a considerable additional number and bulking up the multidisciplinary teams required to support people living at home.</p> <p>  We have to do everything we can this winter to make it unnecessary for people to go into hospital and what we are doing is providing as much home care as possible.  We are also looking at putting in place community hubs so that people with respiratory issues - perhaps people who get the flu - can be treated as they need to be treated, but not in the acute setting this winter.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's direct question on the fair deal scheme, it is something I absolutely want to see.  The current situation does not make sense whereby if one is well enough to stay at home, the State will not provide the supports required but if one goes into a nursing home, the supports will be provided.</p></speech>

I welcome his comments.</p> <p>  Two issues that have upset me the most, most of my constituents and indeed most of the country.  One concerns the man and his stepson ,both of whom lived in Kilbrew nursing home and both of whom died.  We heard the appalling description of the maggots on the poor man's face and the way he was treated.  That case cries out for justice.  I understand the Minister is talking about other inquiries but I believe that he needs to appoint urgently a qualified professional to look into Kilbrew nursing home as a matter of extreme urgency.  I know there were other deaths there.  It requires a qualified person.  Professor Des O'Neill did the Leas Cross nursing home report some years ago.  It needs to be done.  What I understand happened at Kilbrew nursing home is absolutely unacceptable.  Part of the inquiry has to be into the correspondence between Sage Advocacy and HIQA.  There were three or four notices of concern issued to them directly about this family.  It is just appalling.</p> <p>  The second issue, which I asked about at this morning's session with the HSE, concerns the deaths in Dealgan House nursing home, which had the highest number of deaths in County Louth.  For three months, half of the deaths in the county were in Dealgan House.  Families are extremely upset.  A report was done by HIQA but they have not had sight of it.  They are not getting answers from the HSE or from the Department of Health.  In their view, there is obfuscation and delays.  They have spent hundreds of euro on freedom of information requests to try to get to the truth as to why the Department and HIQA, due to what they found, put the Royal College of Surgeons hospitals group in to run that nursing home.  These people have lost family members and are traumatised by their deaths.  They are deeply frustrated at the bureaucracy they have encountered.  I ask the Minister the same question I put to Mr. Paul Reid this morning.  Will he meet those families to listen to their issues?  Will he appoint a competent and qualified person to look specifically at what happened in that nursing home on the particular grounds that he, the Department and the HSE had put in a special team to manage the home?  One of the issues raised was that the majority of staff who worked there were unable to be on duty.  Patients died.  There is evidence that the HSE was aware of the fact that a significant number of workers were absent due to illness and other reasons, and while the executive gave assurances that it was acting, there was a delay of at least four or five days when a lot of people would have caught Covid-19 as a result.  It is a very serious issue and I would appreciate the Minister's comments on it please.</p></speech>

When the invitation was issued 14 days ago, the meeting was scheduled to address the increased restrictions in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  Over the past 14 days, while it is disappointing that Kildare has not emerged from those restrictions, we have successfully managed the outbreak in those counties.  By allowing the public health experts to take the lead, we dealt with the virus as well as we could.</p> <p>  Over the course of the meeting, I have taken away two lessons.  The first was when I heard Mr. Paul Reid talking about us living with the virus and Dr. Ronan Glynn talking about how we can reopen sensibly.  The strategy we are now engaging in, which is not a zero-risk strategy, is based on the idea that we must allow our economy to reopen so that we can go to school, engage with our health service and protect jobs, but with the balance always on the side of public health.  If that is the case, the Minister's analogy of risk management, about which there has been some discussion, is actually a correct one.  An analogy I have used many times, although I hesitate to use an analogy again, relates to the first time one lets one's child walk to the shop.  One will never know when is the right time to do it.  It will inevitably involve risk but the parent knows that the child must be allowed to grow and gain independence.  Each time we go out into the world there are risks, and as we head into a world of living with the virus, that is what we are doing.</p> <p>  What we heard today, however, was the idea that while previously activities were judged on whether they allowed for social distancing and on the public health advice, we now seem to be moving into a different area where some activities, even though they allow for social distancing, are not permitted because they involve increased inter-household contact.  That brings us into a difficult territory where we are making judgments about what is a good or bad activity.  That is always a dangerous area for the Government to be involved in.  If we are to live with this virus for long periods, perhaps we would be better off guiding people to have a prescribed number of contacts or a prescribed level of social contact, and to allow them to apply it, whether they want to go to a football match where they can stand 2 m apart or whether they want to go for a meal in a restaurant where the distance is only 1 m.  Different people choose different things to do in their lives.  I worry that if we are to stay with this virus for long periods, we may end up in a difficulty where the State dictates what is a desirable activity.  I know that is not the intention at the moment as we unravel the advice, but if the virus is to be with us for several months, we will need to give more leniency and to get back to circumstances where people can more easily understand what is or is not permitted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.757" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#OOOO00600"><p>On the issue of comparisons of risk, during a conversation about getting schools open, I made a comment about our need to manage risk.  I believe one of the examples I used caused a great deal of genuine hurt, anxiety and concern.  It was in my head, as it happens, because it was how one of my kids had recently broken an arm.  I was not for a moment suggesting that the risks were at all comparable.  Nevertheless, I understand that in an environment where people are very worried, it caused anxiety, and I certainly did not mean to add to anybody's anxiety.</p> <p>  If I might provide some good news in respect of the point the Deputy made about children, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland has just released its latest view on the impact of Covid-19 on children from a health perspective.</p><p>I will just read one paragraph, if I may.  It states:</p><blockquote>	It is clear now that fortunately the vast majority of children who get SARS-CoV 2 infection do not develop severe COVID-19 illness.  This also appears to be the case for children with underlying health problems, these children may get an infection with very few symptoms at all or they may experience an illness like, but usually no worse than, the seasonal flu.  Children who are immunocompromised, or taking immune medications for inflammatory conditions such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, also do not appear to have an increased risk from COVID-19.  </blockquote><p>We are all worried.  I am sending my own children back to school tomorrow.  There is, however, good, positive news emerging from the experts on this.<br/><br/>To address the Deputy's broader question on striking the right balance in managing the risk in society, we are all figuring this out as we go, as is every country.  It was put to me by medical experts regarding counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly that because of early detection and what we now know about the virus, we were able to bring in much less restrictive measures than the countrywide lockdown we saw.  The point was made to me by one expert that if that had happened four months ago, it would have spread into the whole country and we would have had to lock down the entire country.  If the first piece of good news is that the medical evidence on children is reassuring, the second piece is that we are learning every day about this virus and are now at a point where, as proven by the efforts of counties Laois, Kildare and Offaly and the people living there, targeted localised measures can work.<br/><br/>I suppose the Deputy is now asking the next question, which is whether we can be even more non-specific than that.  Perhaps, at this point, we have all internalised the guidelines, namely, to limit our social interactions, wear a face covering, obey social instancing and all the other measures we all now know.  The answer is, hopefully, in time, &quot;yes&quot;.  If chapter one was flattening the curve by locking down the country, we are now at the start of chapter two, which is suppressing the virus in a targeted way so the rest of society and the economy can function.  Perhaps, the Deputy is describing chapter three whereby it will become implicit in how we live, work and interact and that will be enough.<br/><br/>The expert view from NPHET is that we are not there at this point and based on the increasing number of cases in Ireland, the rate at which they are rising, the profile of those cases, which are in workplaces, homes and social settings, we are finely balanced in terms of a second wave right now.  If there is a second wave, the Government will have to consider the blunt instrument which we know works, that is, a lockdown.  We are doing everything we can to avoid that.  Certainly, the public health advice right now it is that targeted measures are needed.  I agree in spirit with what the Deputy is saying.  We have to trust people.  People know how to deal with this.  In some of the targeted measures we are specifically targeting areas where, perhaps, the level of compliance is not what it needs to be and maybe simply just trusting everybody to do the right thing is not enough.  We know, for example, there have been house parties and that they have been considerable vectors of this disease.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  I will ask a quick question as it is coming to the end of the session.  I want to manage expectations.  County Kildare is obviously still in lockdown.  I discussed earlier with the acting Chief Medical Officer the possibility of the data sets being released in order that we can have granular data.  I am told there will be an update later this week.</p><p>If the data is looking good, what are the prospects for the lifting of the lockdown a little earlier than 6 September?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-08-26a.762" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020082600002#QQQQ00200"><p>While I do not want to take from Deputy Lawless's time, I have an answer to the earlier question on the flu vaccine delay, which is two weeks.  We are pretty much still on target, but there is a two-week delay.</p> <p>  As Deputy Lawless knows, NPHET is meeting tomorrow.  I have explicitly asked the team to look at the profile of what is happening in Kildare and if there is a public health case to be made that it is the right thing to do and it is safe to accelerate the opening up, then that is exactly the recommendation I should get.  I cannot pre-empt that and I do not want to create any false expectations.  As we all know, the rate is very high in Kildare.  The cut-off point for Ireland's green list was a prevalence of no more than five cases per 100,000 over the previous two weeks.  Kildare was at nearly 200 per 100,000.  The rate was very high.  We also know that thanks to the incredible work of people in Kildare, that has been stopped and is now being reversed.  The seven-day rates are much lower.  This is a very difficult call for NPHET to make because while the measures are working, the question is whether they have reduced community transmission to a point where it is safe to relax the restrictions.  We know the restrictions are working and inevitably, there will be risk of community transmission spiralling again if they are relaxed too early.  I salute what the people of Kildare have done and I deeply empathise with the fact that they are now the only county being asked to comply with additional measures.  If the restrictions can be lifted early, based on public health advice, they most certainly will be but we need to be very clear that our absolute focus is on saving lives, which is what the people of Kildare have done, getting the schools open, keeping businesses and our health care services open and avoiding much harsher measures.</p></speech>

That would be such a relief and a reward for the people of Kildare.  I appreciate that the public health advice is paramount but any ray of light would be such a relief and a reward to the people who have been compliant and who have done everything asked of them.</p></speech>

At the beginning of this we were told that the strategy was to flatten the curve.  We were told that the virus would spread, as viruses do but that we needed to flatten the curve to ensure that our health system was not overrun and we did not have scenes like those in Italy and Spain.  At the time that the restrictions were introduced, numbers were rising from 170 in hospital to 440, from 50 in ICU to 80.  Four months ago on 29 April there were 1,185 cases in hospital in Ireland, of which 120 were in critical care units.  Three times today the Minister told us that we were looking at a complete lockdown and that we were at a tipping point.  We have been hearing a lot about tipping points.  We have heard about tipping points since June.  We were also told today by the HSE that 22 patients were admitted to hospital with Covid-19, six of whom are in ICU.  I accept that for those 22 patients and their families and particularly for the six patients in ICU and their families, this is an incredibly worrying and stressful time but what I do not understand is how the Minister can possibly talk about a national lockdown given those figures and given that our health system coped with 1,185 cases four months ago.</p> <p>  What is the strategy here?  What are we hoping to achieve, if not that our health system is not overrun?  I note that earlier this week Dr. Glynn accepted that we cannot eliminate the virus.  That seems to be the general consensus.  I accept that there are some who are calling for it to be eliminated but Dr. Glynn said that he does not think we can eliminate it here.  There is a growing acceptance that we cannot eliminate it and even if we do, what do we do then?  We open up and we go through the same cycle.  The Minister talked about lockdowns and said a couple of times that they work but Argentina has been in a lockdown for six months and its figures are spiralling.</p><p>Earlier this week we heard Dr. Hans Kluge, the European director of the World Health Organization, on RT&Eacute; news saying that lockdowns do not work.  Where are we going?  What is the strategy?  </p></speech>

It is not me making that up.  I am saying it because that is NPHET's position.  It is natural that we all become fatigued with this.  People have been through an awful lot.  The reason I am emphasising and re-emphasising it is that we need to be on our guard.  In terms of the Chairman's question about whether lockdowns work, we know they work.  We did one here and it worked.  They did them across Europe and they worked.  If the purpose is to flatten the curve, we locked the country down and the curve was flattened.  That has been the experience of most of the countries we have looked at.</p></speech>

The Minister talked about causing unnecessary anxiety by the use of the word "trampoline" and I very much accept his explanation yet he is talking about another lockdown in circumstances where we have - I repeat - six people in ICU.  I regret each and every one of them desperately.  I lost a very close relative earlier this year and I know that no matter what age somebody is, we do not want to lose somebody close to us.  We are talking about national priorities.  We have six people in ICU and 22 in hospital with Covid-19.  At the height of this we had 1,100 people in hospital and 120 in ICUs yet the Minister is talking about a lockdown again.  Has he any idea of the effect that is having?  Forget about the economy for a moment.  We cannot forget it about it for too long because something has to fund our healthcare system.  They do not fund themselves in any country in the world.  Has the Minister any idea what effect it is having on mental health, on people's psyches and spirits?  How can he possibly talk about a lockdown given the figures?  It flies in the face of reason.  We all have eyes and a capacity to reason.  We are all living in a post-Enlightenment world.</p></speech>

It is why we brought in the measures last week, because we must suppress the virus in our community.  A huge national priority has been getting the schools open for many of the reasons the Chair gives.  That is now happening because the transmission has been reduced.  I think the Chair's question is fair.  The number of cases is going up and we know it is going up very quickly.  For example, the key measure the public health experts use is the number of cases over the last two weeks per 100,000 of population.</p></speech>

There was a study done estimating that the total number is about 40,000 to 50,000 versus the 27,000 or 28,000 we have detected.</p></speech>

Returning to the figure they use, we were at three per 100,000 a while ago.  Two weeks ago we were at 18 per 100,000 and today we are at 30 per 100,000.  Let us be very clear that this virus is rising again quickly in our community.  The Chair has very fairly asked how that is linked to hospitalisations.  The cases are high but the hospitalisations, thank God, are low.  Go back and look at the profile at what happened the first time, and what you will find is that at this point in the pattern, as the cases were around where they are now and rising rapidly, hospitalisations were also very low.  The unambiguous message and advice from public health is that death will follow high numbers of cases.  What we do not want to do is wait for the hospital system to be overrun.</p><p>We do not want to wait for fatalities to increase before we act.  We have to act first and that is what we are doing.</p></speech>

The trend for some time in North America and the Continent is that detection has not been accompanied by an increase in hospitalisations and deaths, thankfully.  That is all I am saying.</p></speech>

I refer the Chairman to the profile that happened here in March and April.  If we were back in March and April, we could well be having exactly this conversation.  The Chairman could be saying that case numbers are increasing but hospitalisations have not happened at a big level and, therefore, asking whether we need a lockdown to flatten the curve.  As we all know, we have had nearly 1,800 deaths.  The answer is that what we did was necessary.</p> <p>  There are no easy answers.  We are moving early to stop the fatalities, the critical care admissions and the hospitalisations.  I emphasise again that the success of Kildare, Laois and Offaly is that the communities there have shown that relatively reduced measures in comparison with a lockdown not only work, but work very quickly.  That is simply what we are doing.  I am more than happy to remain here for as long as the Chairman wants and to answer any questions but I would like to make one ask and to make a further point.  Speed matters.  How fast we moved in the three counties in question mattered, and how fast we are moving in terms of the national measures matters a great deal.  Critically, how quickly individuals respond matters.  There has been, rightly, a lot of focus in the committee on the turnaround time for testing.  We will continue to reduce it.  The other part is individual responsibility.  My ask is that if people feel symptomatic, they do not do what we all do in the normal world and wait a few days to see if they improve but instead go immediately to their GPs.</p> <p>  If we all act and move early by going to our GPs to request a test if we have one of the symptoms, and if we follow the public health guidelines around social distancing, face coverings and so on, we will move through this crisis without the harsher measures, which is exactly what we are trying to achieve.  We obviously have to reopen our schools but in my brief we have to get the healthcare system to a higher capacity that existed before because of the enormous number of men, women and children waiting for healthcare.</p></speech>

I join him in asking people to behave responsibly, to take personal responsibility for their actions and to adhere to the measures that have been outlined.  Speaking personally, I would caution against talk of another lockdown because there is a risk of unleashing a whirlwind.  That is my personal view.  I am not convinced that the Minister will bring the country with him on that.</p></speech>

I have no doubt that is true.  Do we have the figures on how many young people have long-term debilitating effects from Covid-19?  Leaving aside young people, how many people who have overcome the virus to the point of being able to return to their day-to-day existence, be that as students, workers or retirees, are suffering long-term debilitating effects?  Do we know what that percentage is in Ireland?</p></speech>

We do not know the long-term effects.  Doctors and scientists do not know if there are subtle, longer term health complications among people who get this virus.  They will not know for a while by definition.  However, they point to other diseases which have long-term impacts. I take the Chairman's points, which are reasonable, but given that this is a novel virus unlike anything he or I have ever seen, and given the loss of life it has caused and the serious warnings we have had from doctors and scientists saying there may well be longer issues, I hope he will agree that we must do everything we can to suppress the virus.s</p> <p> He asked what the strategy was.  Right now, it is to use the targeted measures, as we are doing, and to work as a nation in solidarity to follow basic but very effective infection control measures to suppress the virus and get on with opening our society, public services, and the economy and protecting jobs.</p></speech>

Earlier, the HSE told us that the Department engaged the DAA to carry out the follow-up calls in respect of people coming into the country.  What tendering process was done for that or how was Dublin airport selected over, say, Shannon, which is going through a round of redundancies?  There is a lot of capacity there and sometimes it seems as though there is only one airport in the country when it comes to Irish officialdom.  The Minister is welcome to reply now or in writing; it is up to him.</p></speech>
