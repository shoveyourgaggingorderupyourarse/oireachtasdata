He is joined by Ms Deirdre Quaid, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meetings of 14 and 21 February have been circulated.  Is it agreed that they be published?  Agreed.  Any matter arising will be dealt with in the course of the next topic.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  The first items are Nos. 2010 and 2015, correspondence, dated 22 February 2019, received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing a briefing note and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers or Ministers, or both, as a follow-up to requests made at previous meetings of the committee.  The first item is correspondence, dated 18 February 2019, received from Ms Rhonda Evans of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, providing the minutes of meetings of the finance and construction committee.  They were circulated prior to last week&rsquo;s meeting and I propose that we formally note them today.  At our meeting on 14 February we requested the board to publish the minutes of its other meetings. I suggest it also publish these minutes.  It is not for the committee to publish the minutes of meetings of the board.  We will note the correspondence which was discussed at the previous meeting.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1999 received from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in reply to the committee&rsquo;s request for a report on the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities.  Mr. O&rsquo;Toole advises that a draft report is in the process of being finalised by Mazars consultants and that the HEA will consider the report when completed and revert to the committee at the earliest opportunity.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  The field work has been completed and a draft report is being worked on.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence which is dated 20 February 2019 is No. 2000 received from Ms Elaine Sheridan, vice president for corporate affairs and finance at Waterford Institute of Technology, providing information requested by the committee following its recent meeting at which we considered Special Report No. 104 of the Comptroller and Auditor General - Waterford Institute of Technology - Development and Disposal of Intellectual Property in FeedHenry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022800002#A00400"><p>There are a couple of issues with the letter received from Professor Donnelly, president, and Ms Elaine Sheridan, vice president for corporate affairs and finance at Waterford Institute of Technology.  It is on the back of the meeting regarding the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which mentioned several documents, one of which was a memorandum sent to Professor Donnelly by a subordinate highlighting concerns about the process involved in the establishment of FeedHenry and other governance issues.  I sought a copy of the memorandum.  If my memory is correct, it was accompanied by an email stating it should be sent to the president and the financial controller, but it did not reach them.  The president who was vice president at the time went back to the author of the memorandum and asked questions about its contents.  I am aghast that the correspondence states, "In light of the threat of legal proceedings issuing on foot of any disclosure of the Memorandum, it would not be appropriate for us to provide it to the PAC".  I do not understand why there would be any legal impediment to the memorandum being provided for the committee.  There has been an ongoing issue with transparency in dealing this matter.  That is one of the reasons the committee has looked into the process involved in the establishment of the companies.  However, there has been a full examination and the Comptroller and Auditor General has completed his report which mentions the memorandum, yet Waterford Institute of Technology is stating it cannot provide it for us for legal reasons which are not outlined, other than the possibility that certain individuals may be named in the memorandum.  However, it should be possible to redact the names of such persons.  </p> <p>  The committee also requested an information note on the shareholders in FeedHenry, given that WIT was one of the shareholders, but the correspondence states that information cannot be provided either.  The information is available on the website of the Companies Registration Office, but WIT is not in a position to provide it for the committee.  This goes back to the stalled HEA report.</p><p>We need to refer back to the Department and ask it if it has considered appointing a statutory inspector to deal with this.  If it is the case that with every item of information being sought, there is a legal impediment or legal advice is offered as to why we cannot get it, somebody with the authority to look at all of these memorandums and documents is necessary if the committee cannot get them.  I propose that we write back to the HEA and the Department, with copies of the correspondence we received from WIT, to ask them their current position with regard to having another look at the report, which is stalled at present, and what the next steps will be.</p></speech>

In the letter, counsel for the individuals communicated their clients' position that the memorandum contains a number of false allegations and potentially defamatory statements which could put their clients' good names at risk and materially prejudice their commercial interests and professional reputations.  The letter suggests that any disclosure of the memorandum would breach the individuals' constitutional rights of privacy and their right to their good names and would be actionable on that basis.</p></speech>

However, this was never done.  In fact, Professor Donnelly came back to the person in question to ask him to substantiate the concerns he had raised.  I still cannot see how that would be a difficulty.</p></speech>

I will not say it but I can speculate on who one of the two people is who has concerns about what is in the memorandum.  We need to refer back to the Department and the HEA and ask them where they are with their report and if they are going to embark on a different course of action if they cannot publish the report that is in draft form.</p></speech>

Obviously, the institute was one of the shareholders.  I believe what happened, from memory, is that a confidentiality agreement was reached between the shareholders and the institute that there would not be any disclosure.  Perhaps it was with the company.  Again, that raises concerns around the transparency of these processes when it is an institute of technology, a spin out company from the institute, and there are these confidentiality clauses surrounding who the shareholders are.  It just adds more intrigue to the issue.</p></speech>

It is difficult to tease out where we are going with it.  The processes were working in a sense.  Somebody was alerting somebody higher up that there were questions.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

The memorandum is part of a process.  Somebody is concerned and is theoretically doing the right thing.  The person notices something is wrong and wants it checked out.  The person alerts somebody with higher authority so everything was being done correctly, theoretically.</p></speech>

The reason we know what happened with the memorandum is that it was in the report.  The report says that Professor Donnelly, as vice president, received the memorandum.  It was to be sent higher up the chain, but it was not.  It went back to the person who sent the memorandum and the vice president asked for clarifications.  The memorandum could be referenced in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Whatever the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts, and there are many questions about that at present, referencing and examining special reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General is certainly one of them.</p></speech>

That is agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2002 is from Professor Donnelly, Waterford Institute of Technology.  It relates to the same issue.  He states that the institute is seeking clarification in response to the committee's request.  That was an earlier acknowledgement of the email.  We received the more comprehensive reply that we have just discussed in the week following that earlier email.  That is noted.</p> <p>  Nos. 2003 and 2007 are from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board regarding the committee's request for written consent from Mazars before the relevant document or any part of it is disclosed.  Ms Evans advises that permission was requested and is still awaited.  Mazars stated that the document is confidential and we cannot publish it until their consent is given.  We are waiting for that.</p><p>We note that is the position and we will publish that reply.</p><p> The next item is No. 2011 from Ms Carmel Whelan, Kildare-Wicklow ETB, providing information requested by the committee about the valuation report for a building in Arklow.  This is an extensive document and the valuation runs to several pages.  The final paragraph of the letter includes a note from the valuer stating that, in accordance with standard practice, neither the whole or part of this report, or any reference thereto, may be included in any document or circular without prior consent.  We have to ask Kildare-Wicklow ETB to get the consent of the valuer before we can publish it.  It should be standard practice that whenever this committee writes to an organisation seeking a report from a consultant, we should include in our first letter a request of the organisation to get consent from the consultant.  That would be better than us getting the letter and spending another couple of weeks writing back to ask the organisation to seek consent.  On foot of these types of issues arising, we need to put that request for consent in our original request. </p><p> In this case, we have the valuation report but we cannot publish it because we do not have the consent of the valuer.  We have seen it and can discuss it but cannot publish it without consent.</p></speech>

I acknowledge we got the valuation report for that building but there are a number of other items that we requested from the ETB that have not been forthcoming.  We need to follow up on those in the same letter.  There were three other things.  The first was about block E of the Civic Centre in Bray.  There was a list of all properties that the board is leasing which it previously owned.  There was also a list of any other buildings it is leasing which did not have signed contracts.  Those were the three things I was looking for.</p></speech>

We will follow that up.  We will hold over this item because we are awaiting consent from the valuer.  We will not publish that until we get consent.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2012 from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer of the Office of Government Procurement, dated 25 February 2019 in response to the committee's request for information on his role as a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board about the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the role of the Government contracts committee for construction.  We will note and publish this.  He will be coming in with Mr. Robert Watt next week and we will have a detailed discussion.  This is a comprehensive letter.  I do not expect the public to read all ten pages of it but I want to make a few brief points in order that people will know what Mr. Quinn is saying in this letter.</p> <p>  He deals with the role of the Government contracts committee for construction and he states that, in this instance, it considered a request for a derogation for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board from the standard form of contract.  He refers to the standard form of contracts and deals with certain major contracts.  He gives a timeline on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and confirms he is a member.  In the first paragraph of his letter, Mr. Quinn states that he accepts in hindsight that, in his letter to the committee of 25 January, he should have advised that he was a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, having been appointed in a personal capacity by the Minister for Health in 2013.  He states that is separate to his duties at the Office of Government Procurement.  He accepts that the committee should have been informed in that earlier letter that he was a member of the board.</p> <p>  I want to highlight one or two other points.  He states that there is a capital works procurement policy and refers to the capital works management framework, which consists of best practice guidance.  As a result of this, we are asking the secretariat to ensure we have a copy of this best practice guidance in advance of next week's meeting.  We might be sorry we asked for it but we should see it in advance of next week because it is important.</p> <p>  Mr. Quinn also gives the membership of the Government contracts committee for construction.  There are 22 members on that committee to consider the various items.  He gives a timeline in appendix summary 2, which we will publish.  There is a summary of engagement between the Office of Government Procurement policy unit, the construction contracts committee and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  In the second paragraph, he states that, from this early engagement, it became apparent that the scale, complexity and required delivery time associated with the hospital presented a range of challenges.  We want to know what timeline was suggested in that early consultation before next week.</p> <p>  In the fifth paragraph, Mr. Quinn states that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board commenced its formal engagement with the committee in May 2014 with a view to securing a derogation.  He moves on to state that there were subsequent meetings.  I do not see the date the derogation was granted, and by whom, in this memo.  I want the minute of the meeting at which the derogation was granted, who attended that meeting and the full minutes of the meeting.  There are three references to the fact that there were meetings about this matter but no reference in the document to when the derogation was actually approved.  We want that in advance of the next meeting.</p> <p>  I am only mentioning those items.  There are a few additional bits of information we require before next week and I am flagging those so we have them here in advance.  This is very complicated.  There is a big issue we will take up with him but, in essence, Mr. Quinn is saying that he was appointed to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board by the Minister for Health and, as a civil servant, he was responsible to the Minister for Health in that respect and not the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He was appointed by the Minister responsible for this and he is essentially saying he is satisfied, based on the cost overruns that came to light during that summer - and I know Deputy Jonathan O'Brien wants to comment on this - that the matter was being progressed up to the HSE and the Department of Health in a proper manner.  That is why he felt no reason to raise it with the Minister.  He again reiterates, from his point of view, that the Minister for Health is the line Minister for this project.  He is also saying he raised it with neither the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform nor the Secretary General because they were not the line Minister.</p> <p>  In fairness to Mr. Quinn, I am giving his side of it because there has been much criticism on that issue.  We will tease this out next week.  To be fair to everyone, I wanted to say that.</p></speech>

That is down to the contracting authority, which I presume in this case in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB.  Mr. Quinn was a member of the development board while the contract negotiations were taking place.</p><p> Perhaps the Chair will provide guidance on what exactly Mr. Quinn will discuss at the meeting next week.  I certainly want to discuss with Mr. Quinn, in his role as a member of the board, some of the issues around the strategy for the tendering process and not so much in his role as chief procurement officer in the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  I seek direction from the Chair as to whether that is-----</p></speech>

Some people might not agree with his point of view that he was responsible to the Minister for Health.  We have invited him before us in respect of his role on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, as opposed to his role in the OGP.  We will run through those points again because some people might not fully accept what they could describe as a Jesuitical interpretation of his role, but he makes a good case on that particular point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022800002#D00300"><p>I requested that the head of the Office of Government Procurement appear before the committee as part of our consideration of this issue.  The wider point is that there appears to be an institutional gap in terms of some large capital projects.  That aspect would be useful to explore in the context of process.  That is part of the reason it is appropriate that the committee have Mr. Quinn before us, but the issue is not exclusive to the national children's hospital.  It is useful to have an example when we try to explore how something happened.  This issue is much wider in terms of capital projects and institutional gaps.  If there is an institutional gap but no institutional memory, what will happen is that the mistakes will be repeated.  That is central to what we are doing.</p></speech>

The invitation to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt, is exactly as Deputy Murphy indicated and relates to capital projects.  There is a section in this letter dealing with capital works procurement policy.  We want a copy of the capital works management framework, which I am sure is a substantial document.  We need to see the capital works management framework and that is essentially what we want to discuss with Mr. Watt.  We do not want to focus solely on one project, although that will be part of the discussion.  We want to discuss how several other projects are being managed and how the capital works procurement policy is working.  Our invitation to Mr. Watt was clear on that from day one.</p></speech>

The date we pencilled in was the week before the PwC report will come out.  I see no benefit in having it then.  We will come to that matter in a moment.</p> <p>  Next week's meeting will start at 9 a.m. and we will get down to the main business because Mr. Watt, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has another commitment with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Taoiseach in the afternoon.  He has requested that we finish by lunchtime and we will facilitate him on the basis that we will start at 9 a.m.  We will take a short break but if we meet from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., it should be sufficient to do our work.</p></speech>

They can be lengthy documents but much of the content is routine material.  They could absorb all of our time.

We will request documents that summarise or list the key points and guidance for officers on the key issues as well as requesting the large document.  I could probably find the document on the Department's website but we will ask the Department to send it to us in the next day or two to give us time to study it before our next meeting.  We do not want it to arrive next Wednesday evening.  I think we are all happy about that.</p> <p>  No. 2014 is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 26 February 2019 providing details requested by the committee on housing assistance payments, HAP and other items.  We will discuss that when we meet the officials shortly.  We will note and publish the document.  We will also note No. 2017, a copy of the social housing delivery report for 2018, which we received yesterday from Mr. McCarthy.  We will discuss that report with him shortly.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  Correspondence under the heading C is from private individuals.  We received a letter from Deputy David Cullinane, dated 18 February 2019, on Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, Dublin.  The Deputy has momentarily left the room.  We have received correspondence on that in recent times.  It is on our work programme.  We will ask the secretariat to give us an update on this issue, which we dealt with last year and on which there has been recent media coverage.</p> <p>  Nos. 2001 and 2008 are from Deputy Alan Kelly on the Higher Education Authority report on Cork Institute of Technology and certain companies.  As mentioned earlier, we received a letter stating the report is being finalised and the HEA will consider it and revert to the committee at that stage.</p> <p>  No. 2004 is a letter from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in regard to speaking at next week's meeting when officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform come before the committee.  The Deputy may have thought the meeting was scheduled for last week but it is this week.  We will go through our work programme shortly.</p> <p>  No. 2009 is a letter from Deputy O'Connell requesting a number of items to be included in the follow-up information requested from Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  We will note that.  The additional information that Deputy O'Brien asked for in respect of a building in Bray will be included in the request for information.</p> <p>  The next matter is the statements and accounts received.</p></speech>

We will deal with housing this morning and the Local Government Fund and central government funding for local authorities in the afternoon.  We will have one lead speaker in the morning and one lead speaker in the afternoon and a ten-minute slot will be allocated to every other speaker.  We must finish our session on housing this morning.</p> <p>  On 7 March 2019, we will discuss the oversight and implementation of capital projects.  Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will appear before the committee in the morning.</p><p>We are going to deal with the role of public officials in capital projects, not just in the context of the national children's hospital.  </p><p> We will have a private meeting next week to complete our consideration of the draft periodic report for September through to the end of 2018.  We had a discussion about this issue previously and the secretariat will bring forward the amendments proposed.  We are nearly there in our consideration of the report.  The time slots available next Tuesday for the aforementioned private meeting are 1 p.m. and 7.15 p.m.  Which would suit members best?  In respect of the 1 p.m. slot, I remind them that Leaders' Questions in the D&aacute;il will begin at 2 p.m., which may be a little too tight.  I suggest Tuesday evening, at 7.15 p.m., would be better, given that we will all be in Leinster House.  The meeting should not take too long because we have already had a run-through on the report.</p></speech>

The meeting will not take too long.  </p> <p>  I wish to point out, with the media listening, that reports on the aforementioned document appeared on the front page of a newspaper yesterday.  I must stress that the document sent to members by email was a working document produced by the secretariat based on its best summation of the meetings of the committee.  I am saying this in order to inform members of the media that when they receive copies of such a document, they must be aware that it is not a document into which members of the committee had an input.  It is not an official committee document.  What was printed in the report I read yesterday may not concur with the final document issued by the committee.  We intend to publish our report on Wednesday, 13 March, having signed off on it next week.  Those who attend the meeting next week will be given a hard copy.  No further electronic copies will be prepared or issued.  Some member of the committee has acted unfairly by circulating the working document, but I do not know what I can do about that matter.  There are 13 committee members, one of whom has acted unfairly.  In that context, no further hard copies will be issued until the launch of the report.</p></speech>

The plan is to sign off on the report next week and publish it on the Wednesday of the following week, 13 March.  We want to have it done before St. Patrick's Day.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 14 March, we will discuss the national broadband plan with representatives of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We want to bring our consideration of that topic to a conclusion in order that we can include our views on it in an interim report which will take some time.  We have pencilled in a meeting with representatives of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in the afternoon on 14 March.  Do members consider we are taking on too much on a single day?  I am happy to leave it as is, but it is the Thursday before St. Patrick's Day.  I presume the D&aacute;il will be breaking for that week.  Is the afternoon on 14 March a good time to start to discuss a new topic or should we defer our meeting with representatives of the CSO?  I suggest we finish our deliberations on the broadband issue on the Thursday morning and arrange a new date for the meeting with representatives of the CSO.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We had hoped representatives of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board would come back to us on 28 March, but the report from PwC may not be completed by then.  In that context, we will have to move the meeting to April.  I have had a look at some of the Departments, representatives of which have not been before us recently.  There are two key Departments, with which we have not discussed Votes in recent times, namely, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I suggest we meet representatives of the former on 28 March, if members agree.  </p> <p>  On 4 April we will meet representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the appropriation account.  There is also a chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on Garda overtime with which we will try to deal on the same day.  We may have to schedule the meeting to start at a slightly earlier time.  </p> <p>  There is also the question of the Irish Prison Service.  Some members have asked for its representatives to be invited to appear before us again.  The committee received detailed correspondence from the service last week.  If that correspondence which runs to more than 20 pages is considered inadequate, we must write back to seek further clarification.  We should do that first before deciding to invite back representatives of the service.  When they were before us, we had a detailed discussion with them, but there were some unanswered questions which, as usual, we followed up through correspondence.

While it is comprehensive, it does not answer every question we asked.  We will go back to the Irish Prison Service to seek for more information, but I ask members to contact the secretariat if they are seeking clarification on any matter related to the service.  We will write to it again to seek further clarification on certain matters.</p></speech>

We have established that there are only four doctors in the service and that 63% of prisoners are on medication.  I have received private correspondence from people who claim that they are not receiving adequate medical treatment.  I do not want this issue to end up at the door of the State Claims Agency.  We want all of these bodies to have procedures in place to log all of these issues in order that the agency will be aware, in advance, of potential medical negligence cases that could cost the State a lot of money.  We are looking at that broad issue.  We can give the information to other committees too, but we are here to deal with the issue of medical negligence in the context of costs to the State through the State Claims Agency.  We are not going to get into how the prisons are run.  The committee does not need to know that information.</p></speech>

The NTMA was very quick in carrying out its business and publishing its annual report.  Its representatives appeared before us prior to the summer break last year to discuss the annual report.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was released at the end of September.  It contained a chapter on the NTMA and we need to bring back representatives of the agency to discuss it.  A key element of that meeting will be a discussion with the State Claims Agency on issues to do with medical negligence.  We have been assembling a lot of information, but we need to close off the issue as part of our next periodic report.  We will set the date for the meeting as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We know that there is an enormous contingent liability, but it is not the only area covered by the agency.  There is, for example, a significant issue in the Air Corps.  Are we going to try to capture more than the contingent liability, or are we going to keep the focus quite narrow?</p></speech>

We will look at the full &euro;2.6 billion, the main element of which relates to health, although there are other issues.  We will examine the full State Claims Agency, not just the one key aspect.</p></speech>

There are some serious recommendations we can make that will be valuable in the future.  Given the extent of the potential liability, it strikes me that this should be a priority for us, even if we have to spend a number of days on it.</p></speech>

He left the issue open and I thank him for that.  It relates to medical negligence and to the prior step where independent inquiries are carried out.  I have gone back to check on this and I was to come back to the Chairman about it.  I have asked a very straight question regarding Galway.  Over a ten-year period, how many independent investigations were carried out?  It is a simple question.  I also asked about the cost of any such investigations.  I got back a letter which said that information is not recorded.</p></speech>

I went back twice and in two different ways.  I then went to the Minister to ask him whether he was happy with this situation.  I will now refer that question and those two answers to the committee.  Before we get to medical negligence, things inevitably happen because we are only human.  One learns from that and one should set up an investigation, whether internal or external.  I only asked about the external independent investigations.  I asked how many there had been and what they had cost and the people I asked were not in a position to give me that information.  They had no record of it.  How can we learn, how can we now what things costs, and how can we avoid costs in the future?  How can we find out how the issue ties into subsequent medical negligence cases?</p></speech>

Between now and next week, let us have a quick look at the accounts of the State Claims Agency to see whether they include information on non-medical negligence.  If not, we will agree next week to write to the agency seeking this information as soon as possible so that we will have it well in advance of the meeting.  On the Deputy's point, we have letters from the HSE which essentially accept that there is no learning process in the system.  It is very obvious what our conclusions will be when we come to conclude our work.  We have to go back through the correspondence.</p></speech>

This is central to the kind of fragmented approach being taken.  It is about processes and institutional gaps.  The very least the HSE should have is a register.  This issue is not exclusive to the HSE, however.  It is something that cuts across various bodies.  It may be something we could raise with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform next week.  It strikes me that it is the overarching Government Department in respect of the public service.  If there is going to be an outside investigation, at the very least there should be a requirement to register it so that we can know that it happened.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022800002#F01500"><p>The health service has what is called the national incident management system, NIMS.  We need to know whether there is a similar system in other State bodies.  The State Claims Agency handles all these cases when push comes to shove.  It comes under the NTMA, which happens to come under the Department of Finance rather than the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Deputy's point is, however, right.  We will do a little bit of research to see what information we can get in respect of the State Claims Agency and we can decide what information we need before it comes back before the committee.  We are proposing to deal with the Department of Justice and Equality and that chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 4 April.  We are going to write to the Prison Service in the meantime and if we are not happy with the replies we can consider putting it on the work programme for that day.  Until we get information we cannot jump to that conclusion.  We are moving the meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to 11 April, because the report scheduled for the end of March should be out at that stage.  We will then move straight on to the State Claims Agency for our next meeting after that.  We have agreed that we will also have the Department of Children and Youth Affairs before the committee.</p> <p>  While Deputy Cullinane was out, we mentioned his item of correspondence in respect of Harold's Cross.  That is in our system.  We had correspondence on the issue last autumn.  I know that it has appeared in the media again.  I am asking the secretariat to tell us precisely where we are in that regard.  We will then action the issue for the next meeting.  That was agreed in the Deputy's absence.</p> <p>  The last thing I want to say before we briefly suspend is that the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a special report on Ireland's transactions with the EU in 2017 yesterday.  It will be circulated and we will discuss it, perhaps on the day on which we will have the Department of Finance before us.  We all know that in recent years we have become a net contributor to the EU.  The report deals with that.  I have not had an opportunity to study the report.  Members can have a look at it.  In the public interest and for the public's information, it is no harm for it to be seen.  We will schedule discussion of it for the day on which the Department of Finance will be before us.  Would that be reasonable?</p></speech>

Part of the reason for compiling the report is that there is no single place where one can get an overview of our transactions with the EU.  I felt it might be useful to present such information as a framework.  There is a set of financial statements co-ordinated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the FEOGA accounts.  I believe the committee has looked at these on previous occasions.  To be quite honest, they do not give that much useful information.  I was trying to suggest an alternative presentation that might be more useful and of more value to the public.</p></speech>

It is European funding so Europe audits it.  I presume it also audits our contribution to the fund to ensure it is well spent in other countries.</p></speech>

There is a two-way relationship in respect of European Union money.  We are now a net contributor.  That is an aspect of it.  Where is the oversight of it?  A second aspect relates to fines.

Payments out go through the Central Fund.  We are the only committee which looks at the Central Fund.  We will look at that when we have the Department of Finance before us.

CCMA members are chief executives of local authorities and the committee is of the view that they play a critical role in the provision of housing.  I thank the representatives from the CCMA for making themselves available.  While we invited them to attend in order to discuss matters relating to housing, they may stay on for the remainder of proceedings.  I hope they find our deliberations interesting.  The committee has discussed the fact that provision of funding to local authorities by central government is becoming more convoluted as the years go by and we are having difficulty getting our heads around what is involved.  That is why the Comptroller and Auditor General has written a specific chapter on the matter.  Our discussion might be helpful all round.</p> <p>  I remind members that the local authorities do not fall directly under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are absolutely clear on that.  The representatives are here voluntarily and we thank them for coming.  They are not witnesses before the committee.  They are here to assist.  The Secretary General of the Department is a witness but the CCMA representatives are here as invited guests to assist us and provide information that could be of benefit.</p> <p>  From the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, we are joined by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Ms Marguerite Ryan, principal officer, Ms Mary Hurley, assistant secretary general, Ms Nina Murray, principal officer, Ms Theresa Donohue, Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Reilly, Mr. Maurice Coughlan and Ms Janet Jacobs.  From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we are joined by Ms Clare Costello and Ms Margot Dunne.  From the CCMA, we are joined by Ms Jackie Maguire, chair of the association and CEO of Meath County Council, and Mr. Conn Murray, chair of the housing committee of the CCMA and CEO of Limerick City and County Council.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off all mobile phones fully.  Merely leaving them in silent mode will not prevent them from interfering with the recording and broadcasting systems.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol. <br/><br/>We will now hear the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

Programme A, Housing, accounted for &euro;1.3 billion, amounting to almost two thirds of the Vote&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2017.  Programme C, Local Government, accounted for &euro;388 million, or 19%, and the bulk of that expenditure was accounted for in the form of a transfer of &euro;365 million to the Local Government Fund.  Programme B, Water Services, accounted for expenditure of &euro;326 million, or 16% of the Vote total, of which &euro;292 million related to payments to Irish Water.</p> <p>  The income of the Local Government Fund in 2017 was &euro;1.86 billion.  This comprised motor tax receipts of &euro;1.02 billion paid directly into the fund, local property tax transfers from the Exchequer amounting to &euro;477 million and the funding of &euro;365 million from the Vote, as referred to earlier.  Members may wish to note that significant changes have been made in the fund&rsquo;s income streams from January 2018 and the Accounting Officer will outline some of those changes for the members.</p> <p>  The fund expenditure in 2017 amounted to &euro;1.83 billion.  It should be noted that this included a payment to the Exchequer, at the direction of the Minister for Finance, amounting to &euro;230 million.  As a result, the net expenditure from the fund on programmes and services was just over &euro;1.6 billion.  Almost 40% of this was accounted for by a subvention to Irish Water.  About 38% went directly from the fund to local authorities.  Some 22% went to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for roads-related spending, and a substantial part of this was subsequently transferred to local authorities for road construction and maintenance.</p> <p>  Because of the complexity of the various fund flows, chapter 4 is compiled to present an overview of the level of net funding provided by central Government to local authorities, the purposes for which that funding is provided and trends over time.  Central Government transfers to local authorities amounted to a total of &euro;2.66 billion in 2017, up almost 20% year on year.  Most of the increase was in regard to housing and urban regeneration, which accounted for almost half of the transfers.  There was relative stability in the funding provision for other programmes in 2017.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that chapter 1 of my report for 2017 includes a summary of the Exchequer funding provided to Irish Water.  This amounted to a total of &euro;1.2 billion and comprised payments of &euro;292 million form the Vote, &euro;639 million from the fund and a capital contribution of &euro;270 million paid directly to Irish Water from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. </p></speech>

I am joined by a number of colleagues from the Department, who have been introduced.  I am pleased to have been able to facilitate the committee&rsquo;s request to have attendance on this occasion from the local government sector of our two colleagues from the CCMA, who have also been introduced.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing material for the meeting and I will, therefore, keep these comments short.</p> <p>  At the outset, I should note that, in 2017, a transfer of functions took place with the movement of a number of community-related programmes to the new Department of Rural and Community Development.  A further Revised Estimate for the year made the necessary technical changes to the Estimate to reflect the transfer and also provided funding in the Vote of almost &euro;293 million for Irish Water, arising from the Water Services Act 2017, to take account of the revenue shortfall due to the abolition of domestic water charges and the cost of related refunds.  In addition, in the course of 2017, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;100 million was approved to meet costs arising under the local authority housing capital programmes.</p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2017, as set out in the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;2.087 billion.  In accordance with Government accounting practice, this expenditure figure reflects the position after the transfer of functions had been completed and these additional funding provisions had been made.</p> <p>  The Department had significant achievements in 2017 in delivering on key policies and programmes and I will comment briefly on a number of these.  As the committee is aware, implementation of the Government&rsquo;s six-year Rebuilding Ireland action plan is the core focus of our daily work in the Department and, indeed, across central and local government, as we strive to make meaningful, tangible and sustainable progress towards a better housing landscape.  At its meeting on 25 October last, the committee examined in some detail housing supply issues arising in the context of Vote 34 for 2017.  The Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the appropriation account, totalled some &euro;1.3 billion in 2017, including the additional &euro;100 million provided by way of Supplementary Estimate that I referred to earlier.  A further &euro;98 million was also available from local property tax, LPT, receipts to fund housing programmes of certain local authorities whose LPT allocation exceeded their LPT funding baseline, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;1.4 billion in 2017.</p> <p>  As regards 2018, gross voted expenditure on housing programmes totalled some &euro;1.97 billion.  An additional &euro;92 million was also available from LPT receipts, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;2 billion last year.</p> <p>  Table 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper for the committee today, sets out the key Rebuilding Ireland targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that has been made to the end of 2018.  At the October meeting, I shared with the committee information on progress achieved in 2017.  During 2018, significant further progress was made to deliver on the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to over 27,000 households in 2018 through the range of social housing measures in Rebuilding Ireland, significantly ahead of the target of just under 25,500.</p> <p>  Roughly one in four new homes built last year was a social housing home.  The new-build figure was 85% up on 2017 and eight times higher than 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland began.  Wider housing supply also continued to grow in 2018 with the number of new homes becoming available for use in the full year reaching 21,458, an 18% increase on the corresponding figure of 18,209 for 2017.  Significant progress was also made in 2018 in advancing many social housing projects through the range of delivery mechanisms and programmes.</p><p>By the end of the year, a substantial construction programme of over 19,000 units was in place to deliver further increases in the number of new social housing homes being built in the coming years.</p><p> While the numbers of homeless households supported into more sustainable housing continued to increase significantly last year, regrettably, this did not match the numbers of new households presenting to homeless services.  This area of our activity, working with housing authorities and NGOs, will continue to be the focus of priority and sustained attention in 2019.</p><p> The 2019 Estimates provision for housing amounts to nearly &euro;2.4 billion, including local property tax, LPT, receipts, the bulk of which will be devoted to the achievement of the overall 2019 target of supporting almost 27,400 households across all our social housing delivery streams.  While much has been achieved in the first half of Rebuilding Ireland in addressing the issues in our housing sector, there is much work that remains to be done.  There are demanding targets to be achieved in the years ahead and these will continue to be the focus of the absolute highest priority by the Department.</p><p> As the committee is aware, responsibility for the provision of public water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  Detailed information regarding Irish Water's progress in delivering water services is set out in its annual report for 2017.</p><p> The Government decided in September 2017 that, in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, all State funding for domestic water services should in future be provided through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  These new funding arrangements came fully into effect in 2018.  As regards 2017, over &euro;930 million in funding was provided to Irish Water from the Department, made up of almost &euro;639 million from the Local Government Fund, LGF, and almost &euro;292 million from the Vote.  The latter amount comprised &euro;114 million to take account of the revenue shortfall due to the abolition of domestic water charges and almost &euro;178 million for related refunds to customers and necessary administrative costs.</p><p> The second year of operating under the new multi-annual capital funding framework for the rural water programme was 2017.  The new structure provides greater funding certainty for priority investment needs and supports proper planning and sustainable development in rural areas.  The Department recouped just over &euro;15.3 million to local authorities during the year for capital expenditure across the six measures of the programme. </p><p> The chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report concerning central Government funding of local authorities, which we will discuss later today, provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income, detailing the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible, including housing, roads and environmental services, and the range of related funding sources.  As the chapter shows, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities in 2017 totalled some &euro;2.66 billion, an increase of nearly 20% on 2016.  The Local Government Fund accounted for 36% of this amount.  A range of Departments, including my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as other organisations, are involved in providing this annual funding to local authorities.</p><p> The Local Government Fund account for 2017 gives details of the operation of the fund during the year.  The income sources to the fund in 2017 totalled &euro;1.86 billion, made up of motor tax of just over &euro;1 billion, local property tax receipts of &euro;477 million and a payment of &euro;365 million from the Exchequer, through Vote 34.  The main payments from the LGF in 2017 were LPT funding to local authorities of just over &euro;500,000; a payment of &euro;639 million as subvention to Irish Water, which I mentioned earlier; a payment of &euro;333 million to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for works on non-national roads and for public transport infrastructure; and a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;230 million.</p><p> As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned earlier, in January 2018, responsibility for motor tax transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with consequential implications for the Local Government Fund.  In particular, motor tax proceeds are now paid directly into the Exchequer, rather than into the fund, which is now primarily a means of channelling LPT revenues to local authorities.  Funding for Irish Water is now routed through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Funding for roads and public transport infrastructure, formerly routed through the fund, is now channelled through the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a payment to the Exchequer from the LGF is no longer required.  Further details of these changes are in the briefing paper circulated for the meeting.  When taken together, the changes result in much greater transparency in terms of the various flows of funds involved.</p><p> In terms of accountability, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, provides statutorily independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  The LGAS audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.</p><p> Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory audit report to every member of the local authority for his or her consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  In addition, the audit committee of the relevant local authority will review any audited financial statement, auditor&rsquo;s report or auditor&rsquo;s special report in respect of the authority and will assess any actions taken within that authority in response to either a statement or report, and will report on its findings.</p><p> Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years with the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  NOAC scrutinises local government performance and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General notes in his chapter the increase in oversight of local authority spending since 2014 brought about through the operation of the commission.</p><p> Further areas of expenditure set out in the 2017 Appropriation Account include, in the planning area, meeting the costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which amounted to some &euro;17 million, as well as Met &Eacute;ireann costs of &euro;18 million.</p><p> The matters I have referred to illustrate well the broad range of programmes and activities for which the Department had responsibility in 2017.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s further work today.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on the thread relating to the figures for new houses and where they were generated.  I am looking at the document provided to the committee, Rebuilding Ireland - Social Housing Delivery 2018.  A note at the bottom of a table on page 2 states: "Build refers to Local Authority and Approved Housing Body construction, including traditional construction, turnkeys, rapid build delivery, regeneration and homes delivered through the Part V mechanism."</p><p>Can Mr. McCarthy break that down for the committee?  In, say 2018, how many of those local authority builds were turnkeys?  How many were regeneration?  Why does the Department not divide them up?  Within that, in our work, not necessarily this year but in future years, we need to know which is which in order that we can see where there is value for money.  I can appreciate, for example, that in parts of the country purchasing would be sensible but in other parts that option may not be available.</p></speech>

That makes it 1,200 houses plus the turnkey ones.  In the coming days, can Mr. McCarthy give us a breakdown of those, perhaps by way of a note to the committee on costs per house by local authority, because there are different values in different parts of the country and we can consider the value-for-money aspect in that regard?  When the Department provides these statistics, why does it not give that breakdown any more?  The Department used to give it.  It is actually very useful.</p></speech>

It shows a bit of spin with the 85%, given the extent of the housing lists and the challenge ahead of us.  It gives the impression that we are getting ahead of a crisis.  We could do without presenting it in that way because it is not a fair reflection on the extent of the crisis and how that crisis is being tackled.  Would Mr. McCarthy accept that?</p></speech>

Maybe just to step back for a minute, when Rebuilding Ireland was put in place clear targets were set for what was to be built, what was to be bought and what was to be leased, as well as targets for the rental accommodation scheme and for the housing assistance payment.  When it comes to build, we have always published - every quarter for the past eight quarters - a detailed construction status report showing all of the build projects, such as the turnkeys and the traditional builds, so that there is a clear build figure.  When I talk in terms of build, every one of those houses is a new-build local authority or AHB house.</p></speech>

I will skip through a few different aspects of the report.  I refer to Traveller accommodation in the Appropriation Account 2017, Vote 34, A5 housing inclusion supports, which states "Savings of &euro;4.2 million arose on traveller accommodation as a number of capital projects did not progress as anticipated."

Where did the estimate of &euro;200 million over three years come from?  Kildare, Fingal, Meath and Waterford, for example, have all exhausted their funds and started refusing applicants on the basis of insufficient funds in 2018.  Therefore, the fund is depleted.  I completely understand that is a matter for the Minister in the context of the budget for the Department and it is not for Mr. McCarthy, but what analysis was done in terms of borrowing that money and what would be required?</p></speech>

The &euro;200 million over three years was based on the extent to which borrowing actually was happening in local authorities up until then.</p><p>We felt that the &euro;200 million over three years was a reasonable first intervention.

They provide over 600 units of family accommodation.  The Deputy absolutely rightly points to the extent to which homelessness remains a really serious issue for us.

Some of the LPT was actually used elsewhere.  I suppose I am saying that those LPT figures were estimate figures.  When it came to actually distributing the LPT finally among programmes, it was distributed among some of the housing programmes differently, but in overall terms the total difference between the REV and the LPT was only &euro;1 million - between the initial Estimate and the final outturn.</p></speech>

They talked about the possibility of being able to leverage funds from other sources.  Some of that relates to putting it on a statutory basis.  I understand that is obviously in the policy area, but the Department will be working on that.</p><p>Where is it within the Department at this stage?  Many of us would have liked to see it on a statutory basis initially.  It appears to be necessary for it to be put on a statutory basis in order to bring forward the additional fund and, obviously, scale up the amount of housing that could be funded in a different way.  Where is it in the context of the discussions that are ongoing?  Are we nearly there in finalising the legislation for it?</p></speech>

That will be very welcome when it happens.  Does the liability under the capital assistance scheme rest with the Department or the local authority, or is it part of general Government debt?

As I was a member of a local authority for approximately 20 years, I appreciate that it can be difficult to get projects over the line.  Mr. McCarthy might give us a synopsis of the general problems in getting projects like the provision of Traveller accommodation over the line.  The amount of money available is relatively small.  Does the Department engage with the local authorities?  When a local authority applies for funding for a scheme, the Department agrees with the scheme and money is available, I presume it is pretty much locked down at that stage.</p></speech>

With the indulgence of the Chairman, I will ask one of my colleagues to speak about the actual practicalities involved.  During our engagement with local authorities we see issues in local communities.  Local engagement is needed to try to get projects across the line.  Sometimes there can be issues related to engagement between the local authorities and the Traveller community.  One of my colleagues from the local authorities might like to give a flavour of what it is like on the ground.</p></speech>

I will reflect on the position in Limerick.  While almost 90% of the money has been allocated, just a small amount has been drawn down, primarily because we were very late in starting the programmes for the year as a consequence of the level of negotiations required at local level with the community, the elected bodies and, more importantly, directly the community we are trying to serve.  I would like to put the issue in context.  This experience is right across the country in dealing with the Traveller community.  In the specific case of Limerick we have had to go through the courts to have people removed from sites.  We have had to use emergency planning powers to begin to construct housing accommodation on site.  That required case management.  I had to sit down with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, the ESB, the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla to look at individual families.  In some cases, the scale of the problem is challenging.  Therefore, consideration has to be given to those who best require protection and support.  Therefore, the issue must be tackled on a family by family basis and that is the approach we have taken.  It is slow, but it is important.</p></speech>

Even when we have gone through discussions, the situation can sometimes change subsequently.  That is the practicality on the ground because we might not be dealing with the same families.  I have referred to the particular issues that have to be dealt with.  It takes a considerable period of time to go through these negotiations.  Unfortunately, we find ourselves unable to proceed because agreements arrive at the last minute.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

However, we certainly have the numbers.  Sometimes we have to provide specific wrap-around supports for these families and work very closely with the approved housing bodies in doing so.

The experience in the north east was that the majority of the Traveller community were housed directly, rather than in specific schemes.  That was their preference.</p></speech>

On 4 February, Galway had 50 families in private emergency accommodation.  This figure is from the city council.  I am placing my questions in context.  There were 20 notices of termination in quarter 4 of 2018 and the cost of private emergency accommodation in 2018 was &euro;2.455 million, which sum is projected to increase to &euro;3.57 million.  The supply of suitable accommodation is diminishing and so on.  That is the report in the context of modular homes, which should not have to be built in Galway.  That is the context in which I am asking my questions today.  While I understand that our guests are implementing Government policy, there is a certain spin to it, albeit those before us have, rightly, rejected that.  If we have almost 10,000 homeless people, according to the figure supplied, there is spin going on with all of this social and public housing.</p></speech>

I will ask a number of questions on housing, but first I want to look at the accounts and at Vote 34.  Can we look at governance issues and internal financial controls on page 5?  I want to go quickly through this.  There were internal financial control issues in relation to the management of accommodation and homelessness funding.  Weaknesses were identified.  Let us take the management of accommodation.  How much money was in question in relation to the issues identified?  There was a procurement register which should have included expiry dates for contracts - very basic stuff - and a revised procedures manual.  Very quickly, how much money was involved?  Have the faults identified been rectified and are the solutions in place?</p></speech>

Well done.  I thank Mr. John McCarthy.  Staying on those accounts, I will move back to look at the urban development fund.  In fact, I will leave that for a moment and come back to it if I have the time.  I might come back in the second round.  I want to go to the housing assistance payment, or HAP, and all of the money, including HAP, that is going to sustain an unsustainable private market.  I ask Mr. John McCarthy to clarify something here.  I thank him for all the documents, which are extremely helpful.  I want to note that.  It is a good way to proceed.  I am looking at the 26 February 2019 document from the Department.  The second page sets out that the detailed results of the 2018 SSHA were published and showed that 71,858 households were assessed as in need of social housing.  I presume that number is rising.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

A terrible law was brought in under the previous Government to the effect that HAP was the only game in town and that one was considered adequately housed under it.  We have been there before.  Mr. John McCarthy does not have to disagree with me but that was the legislation brought in.  HAP is the only game in town.  We asked repeatedly what would happen when these applicants went into HAP and were told they were taken off the housing waiting list.  Is that correct?  They are taken off the housing waiting list.</p></speech>

Initially, officials were absolutely crystal clear with me in my previous life.  They said it was absolutely right that they were off the waiting list.  Since then, I have been told they were all included in the figures.  Today, the Department is telling us "No".  That is great.  That is clear.  Mr. John McCarthy is stating that a person on the HAP scheme for a year, two years or five years, which is the maximum security of tenure albeit some get less, is off the waiting list and is considered adequately housed by the Department and the Government under Government policy.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with this.  I bore people here by repeating it.  Not a single publicly funded house was constructed in Galway from 2010 until last year, when 14 houses were completed, as I understand.

In that year, for example, when &euro;619 million was going towards rent supplement and the rental accommodation scheme, the corresponding amount that was going into build, acquisition and lease programmes was &euro;314 million.</p></speech>

Nothing went into Galway city for direct social housing.  We got quarterly reports.  This is all factual.  We got columns showing what was proposed, the amount of money, and in the final column it said "construction suspended" on every single quarterly report from 2010 forward.  That is one of the major reasons we have a housing crisis.  It is one of the ingredients.  The State stopped building houses.  Now we are going forward and Mr. McCarthy is telling me the figure is &euro;423 million for this year on HAP alone.</p></speech>

The totality is that almost 10,000 people are homeless, which does not count those who are - I hate the words - "couch surfing", those women who are in refuges and so on.  Let us be realistic.  If Mr. McCarthy wants to say it is Government policy, we stick with that and the officials implement it.  However, when there is a view in respect of it, that is slightly different.  I find it unacceptable.  It is not value for money at all, never mind the humanity, to be spending millions on accommodation in hotels, hubs and so on.  There is something wrong with this policy.</p> <p>  I am going to be stopped but I want to ask one or two more questions.  Mr. McCarthy has clarified that the legislation on voluntary houses is coming.  Brexit has stalled it.

Does that include the total number that have come into HAP and some that have gone out of HAP properties?  When it is measured against the number of active tenancies at a point in time, the percentage is over 100% but if we were to look at the number of properties that were in HAP during the period, it might not have been over 100%.

We were not able to aim for that figure initially in Rebuilding Ireland but we subsequently upped the ambition.  That 50,000 target is one part of Rebuilding Ireland.</p></speech>

We have record levels of homelessness and, as the report says, a lack of residential construction and lack of social and affordable housing.  We know this has the knock-on effect of driving up rents and we had a lengthy discussion about this the last time Mr. McCarthy attended the committee.  This makes our capital city very uncompetitive in many ways.  The reports and the evidence suggest that the Department is not getting to grips with the housing crisis to the extent that it is suggested.  Has Mr. McCarthy accepted what the European Commission said on the lack of social and affordable housing and the impact this has on driving up rents?  Does Mr. McCarthy accept that the homelessness figures published yesterday show the Department is far from getting a grip on the housing crisis?</p></speech>

It has two overarching targets.  One is to get to an overall housing supply position of 25,000 homes per annum.  The other target is the additional 50,000 social housing over the six years.  At this point, which is halfway through the six year plan, we are where we should be or slightly ahead.  We have talked at this committee previously - and the Deputy has referred to it again - about the extent to which issues in the housing space and the sub parts of the housing space are all connected with each other.  If there is inadequate housing supply there are obviously more people competing for the available supply and it has knock-on consequences for rents, for house prices and for homelessness.  With Rebuilding Ireland we have tried to address all of those elements of the housing space starting with the overall housing supply to get to the 25,000.  The Central Statistics Office now publishes that data, which show we are on track to achieve that.</p></speech>

One can set whatever targets one likes but if they do not aspire to substantially deal with the housing crisis, one can say the targets are substantially being met.  Given the level of homelessness, however, and the European Commission's report the evidence suggests that targets are not sufficient and they need to be substantially increased.</p> <p>  I shall move to Mr. Murray on the targets for 2018 and I wish to address the issue of builds.  A total of 14 local authorities did not meet the new build targets.  This is 14 out of 31 local authorities.  How were 14 local authorities not able to meet their targets under new builds given the housing crisis, which is not just in Dublin but right across the State? </p></speech>

There are differences in what can be achieved during a particular year in the build programme and what can be achieved in a previous year.  In our case we may have overachieved in a particular year but - and the committee has probably looked at the statistics on this - we did not get our full programme across the ground this year.  When we consider why, it was because we had difficulty getting Part 8 planning through the council.  We had to go back out to the community and there were slight delays.  The progress for 2019, 2020 and 2021, however, will be on target.</p></speech>

We are always being told and promised that there will be more delivery in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  We can only judge each local authority on what they have delivered this year and in previous years.  We are in the midst of a housing crisis.  I believe that Mr. Murray's Limerick City and County Council achieved 80% of its target.</p></speech>

This includes local authority approved housing bodies and Part V units.  Does Mr. Murray believe that 122 units in a city and county the size of Limerick that are real social housing builds is an acceptable number?  The target was only 80% met.  It is not an acceptable target, and it is not acceptable to not meet the target and to deliver only 112 new builds when there is a significant housing crisis that also affects people in Limerick.  Can Mr. Murray stand over a figure of 112 new builds for 2018?</p></speech>

The 1,171 additional tenancies this year is something we are actually delivering upon.  Part and parcel of that is the overall spectrum of the builds.</p></speech>

Absolutely - when I talk about new builds.  I will come back to Mr. McCarthy shortly on the total spend on RAS and HAP.  Moving on from Limerick, Galway City Council only met 25% of its new build target and only 27% of its overall target, which would include builds, acquisitions and leasing.  Westmeath County Council only met 34% of its target and Wicklow County Council only met 55% of its new build target and 58% of its overall target.</p><p>While we might have come close to meeting targets in overall terms, that is mainly because we shifted more towards acquisitions after not meeting our leasing targets.  What is the Department doing about the 14 local authorities that have not met their build targets, in particular the worst performers that came substantially under target?</p></speech>

I misheard the Deputy.  Regarding local authority builds, we continually try to work collaboratively with our colleagues in local authorities and AHBs to ensure that those who have had difficulties meeting their targets can be brought up to a 100% delivery level.  Some of that involves learning from those authorities that have exceeded their targets.  In some cases, it involves putting specific arrangements in place.  In Dublin, for example, we have had a social housing delivery task force.  We have had a similar task force in Cork and are putting another in place in Galway.  What we try to do is adopt a supportive and engaging role with local authorities, understand what specific problems there may be in particular areas and work collaboratively on dealing with them.</p></speech>

I have no problem with retweets where the performance of ministerial duties is concerned, but these are not departmental accounts.  The tweets were political and housing related.  Both included graphics that boasted about housing numbers in Dublin and clearly displayed the Fine Gael logo.</p> <p>  When the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach appeared before us not that long ago, the issue of the infamous strategic communications unit and the blurring of lines between news and spin or, as I call it, the buying of news were discussed.  I have just come from the D&aacute;il Chamber where we were trying to protect the mainstream media with our motion on local radio and promoting fact-based news, yet here we have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government using subliminal messaging.  Any marketing manager - I come from that sphere - will say that imagery matters and penetrates.  The Department's account, which is State owned, is retweeting @campaignforleo and @MurphyEoghan with a clearly identifiable Fine Gael logo.  Why is the Department retweeting political accounts carrying the Fine Gael Party's logo on the Rebuilding Ireland account?  Are there internal social media guidelines in that regard?</p></speech>

There have been contributions from Deputies this morning on the failings of aspects of any account.  Surely we could have retweets by the main Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, when he is pointing out failures, which carries the Fianna F&aacute;il logo?  We could have retweets of that so that people accessing that Twitter account can get the full picture.  I have a real problem with that.  We saw with the strategic communications unit an attempt, through social media, because marketing and imagery matter, to present a particular picture.  These guys are well-paid and highly-educated about this fear and sending a message through a graphic.  This was not a Minister on-site turning the sod.  It was a Fine Gael graphic with a message.  I have a significant difficulty with that because these guys are as cute as foxes and are trying to get that imagery out.  A Department retweeting that has major ethical issues.</p></speech>

While there is good visibility of the numbers of households coming onto the list because they are assessed, there is not the same visibility of those whose circumstances may have changed and who may no longer be in need of social housing support.  They may have moved area or may have moved out of the country.  We do the count once a year because it provides an opportunity to present the full picture of the numbers that have come on and off.  We will do that again in June.  The target for 2019 is to support just less than 27,400 households this year.  We will break those targets down by local authority shortly.</p></speech>

How do two counties with big populations, Limerick and Meath, feel that those net figures coming down will pan out over the next decade in breaking down those stubborn numbers?  When do they feel that they could actually achieve a diminution of a significant nature of their respective housing lists?  The biggest thing one hears from local authority members and Deputies who have people coming into their constituency offices is that people are on the list for eight, nine or ten years.  As Mr. McCarthy said, the net figures are coming down.  Where could one really put a hole in the CCMA's targets and managerial structures, taking those two counties as a snapshot?  When do they think, in the next ten years, they will have their figures reduced by 50% or 70%?</p></speech>

The impact of the Part V acquisitions is having a very positive effect on certain cohorts of household, especially families of three or more.  With regard to housing a family in a three-bedroom house, we are eating into that when we were not in the past.  The area that we see as a challenge is single accommodations, including predominantly single male applicants on the list.  The emphasis and priority at present is on families, family structures and getting family homes built.  We had a gap of not building housing for many years and we have seen a very positive impact in the last three years relating to that family cohort.  I suspect the challenge for us will be similar across other local authorities and relates to single accommodations that we need to start building again.</p></speech>

I would be loath to put years on it because it will always be brought up that I said we will have a substantial amount of the list diminished in five or six years.</p><p>From our perspective, and from the perspective of numbers still joining the list, households that are still forming and the young population we have, I suspect it is still going to take at least five or six years to eat further into the demand that we see.</p></speech>

There has been a 42% reduction on the existing housing list.  I worked in housing through the 1980s and 1990s.  Fluctuations within the economy have always affected the level of direct builds and, as a consequence, those lists increased during those times.  We need a continuation of the drive that now exists over the next ten years or longer, to keep pace with the coming challenges.  Those challenges will be different.  We are dealing with diverse cultures, and diversity within our cities and counties.  We need to continue the drive in the context of housing over the next number of years and understand that there are going to be different requirements at different times.</p></speech>

The CEO of NAMA was before this committee before Christmas, and spoke about the properties that were made available to local authorities, and the take-up of those properties.  In fairness, both the Department and NAMA provided statistics on that.  One comment made by the Housing Agency that irked me at the time was that there was an over-concentration of supply of social housing in particular areas.  I recognise that the witnesses from the CCMA are representing managers of all local authorities.  What generally is their attitude on that issue ?  I am conscious that a manager from Limerick is present.  I have covered the issues facing the regeneration programme there and the need to address historical issues. The witnesses will also be aware of good housing estates in my home town of Navan.  I have a philosophy that is perhaps different from that of the Housing Agency on this issue, because I believe in affordable social housing on a significant scale.  I recognise the progress being made in puncturing those numbers to the level we have seen.  Can the witnesses comment on large scale housing?</p></speech>

However, I have also lived the challenge of managing housing in Limerick and seen how a policy from the 1970s has destroyed many lives, which have had to be rebuilt.  I have seen the NAMA figures being bandied about, and I examinee at what was offered in my location.  Of the houses offered, 20 were holiday homes and golf estates.  That is absolutely unacceptable in the context of what we are trying to do.  In other instances sites, rather than houses, were offered.  They were rejected for good reasons; they were not acceptable for the type of need we have to meet and the locations required at this point in time.  We would not refuse houses unnecessarily; I assure the Deputy of that.  Our job is to try to provide as many people with homes as we can, but we have to do it as best we can in the context of what is on offer.</p></speech>

The great reduction in housing lists and the great work being done in Limerick is a credit to Mr. Murray and his team.  Is the same policy in place nationally for the HAP and rental accommodation schemes?  Does every local authority consider people to be off the list if they are in receipt of HAP?  My sense is that different local authorities take different approaches to that.</p></speech>

However, all HAP recipients are given the option of going onto the transfer list, which is the mechanism all local authorities use to provide for movements within social housing supports locally.  That might be someone in a mainstream social home which no longer meets his or her needs and who might need to move to another larger home.  It is operated locally, and perhaps one of my colleagues could discuss its operation.</p></speech>

They preferred to stay where they were.  That is a genuine reflection of where some communities are.  I cannot say that is reflected across the country at this stage, but it is something we are looking at.  Choice-based letting is an opportunity to enable people to focus on where they want to be within their own community.  It is sometimes the case that where they are currently residing is more suitable.</p></speech>

I imagine it is the same in all local authorities.  Most tenants will accept that initially, but we have certainly found that people come back and ask to be removed from the list.  That does not preclude them from rejoining the list at a later date again.  They are all given the choice to go on the transfer list.</p></speech>

The reason for that is that we gave local authorities targets, but let them know that if they were further along the pathway and could deliver more than their targets, they could.  We have funded local authorities to go beyond their targets, which is reflected in the performance reports which have been released.</p></speech>

A county manager makes contact with the Department and tells it that there is a site in his or her county with sufficient space for 50 units.  Mr. McCarthy will probably throw statistics at me and talk about 59-week turnarounds and so on.</p><p>In practice, there is an administrative merry-go-round that somewhat baffles me.  If Developer A goes to Meath County Council and states he or she has 100 acres and wants to build a certain number of units and provides the design, the local authority's planners and various experts will either grant planning permission or not.  If it is granted, the developer will build.  Why, then, do we make local authorities jump through so many hoops and engaged in toing and froing with the Department and the building unit in Ballina?  It goes back and up and down in this four-stage process.  During a D&aacute;il debate I brought into the Chamber what was called the streamlined version, which was ironic given how thick it was.  We seem to have most of this expertise in local authorities already so why are we passing information up and down?  Why does the planner in Leitrim or the architect in Meath, who have the expertise, have to be second guessed by somebody in Dublin or in the building unit?  A private developer wants to go in, get planning permission and build.  The lead time for assessments in the private sector is 18 months to two years but, in the public sector, it can be as bad as three to six years depending on the case.  What are we doing about this?  There seems to be a level of unnecessary bureaucracy, which is bound to be adding costs, never mind time and delivery delays.</p></speech>

Inevitably, there have been projects of this type.  What happened in the crash and in the years immediately afterwards was that many projects in the system ground to a halt.  It was quite a few years before they came back.  The Deputy rightly pointed to the importance of things not bouncing backwards and forwards between the Custom House and local authorities.  He and other representatives rightly find this frustrating.  I find it frustrating and I know my colleagues here find it frustrating.  This is why we and the sector sat down to agree timeframes for the completion of the four-stage approval process so we could all be held to account for what we are doing.</p> <p>  To go back to the Deputy's first question which, if I have interpreted it correctly, is on why we have the four-stage approval given what happens with private development, the real issue is it is because they are public funds, for which I am here to be accountable.  To protect public funds, the public spending code applies to public programmes to try to ensure we get best value for money.</p> <p>  When we speak about second guessing, I would like to think the second guessing that might arise would be where a proposal might come forward in which the cost is beyond what we would expect it to be.  This is where value engineering comes in, to see whether we could redesign the scheme in some way that would get us a better value for money outcome.  From a cost control point of view, this is the real value of the four-stage approval process.  As we go from preliminary design to post planning we can see whether the detailed design or planning approval added costs.  We have opportunities at stages along the way to see whether we can do something to address additional costs that may arise.  Its prime purposes are cost control, the protection of public funds and achieving value for money.  Colleagues from the local authorities experience it from the other side.  I am quite happy to-----</p></speech>

We are speaking about local authorities and people of integrity.  I will come to auditing local authorities in a second.  It is not rocket science that the cost per building we expect in Sligo is X per square metre which it might be different in Dublin.  There are broad parameters that any good valuation house or quantity surveyor house could provide, so that if Ms Maguire tells the Department 150 houses are ready to be built in Navan, she is happy with the design scheme, provides the cost and states all the local authority needs is the money, the Department can cross-check it against the market through quantity surveying expertise and give the local authority the money so it can get on with it.  We would get the same value for money.</p> <p>  This is not about policy.  The policy is to build houses.  I have read the four-stage process and I rolled around laughing.  I do not know how a local authority sets about building anything.  The expertise is available.  We are not talking a national children's hospital level of complexity.  People either have the expertise or not and most local authorities do.  On-site quantity surveying and tendering expertise may not be there but for a relatively small cost it could be procured.</p> <p>  What metrics and analysis are there to show our four-stage process has saved us X, given X percentage better value for money or increased units or outturn?  My sense is that with the best will in the world the four-stage process costs money, is bureaucratic, causes delay and certainly does not capture what we seem to be calling a national housing emergency.  We either trust local authorities to do this or we do not.  This might free up a lot of staff that heretofore have been very involved in the four-stage process.  That is fine.  We could create an enforcement division and let them go on tour to make sure everything is being done right throughout the country or pop into the local authority in Sligo or Leitrim to ask how everything is being done.  The delivery of units, which is the policy and what we are all about, would be much better.  It is just a suggestion.</p> <p>  The local authorities are not responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Mr. McCarthy is the accounting officer for local authorities and a large amount is given from the Department to local authorities.  Is it correct that the Department does not audit them?</p></speech>

This issue arose when water service related legislation was before the line committee, from memory, in late 2017 and early 2018.  I think the Minister indicated that he was favourably disposed towards exploring the potential for the Comptroller and Auditor General to play a role.  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor General can either correct or contradict me on anything I say, in case I am not entirely accurate, but there are a number of complexities.  Irish Water has been established under company law as a company and its accounts have to be audited by what is called a statutory auditor.  For these purposes the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a statutory auditor.  The matter is also complex in the sense that Irish Water is a subsidiary of Ervia, the accounts of which also have to be audited.  They are dealt with in accordance with the Companies Acts.</p> <p>  There is a third issue that needs to be considered, not so much perhaps from a formal audit point of view but from the point of view of value for money, similar to what the Comptroller and Auditor General might do in the case of the bodies he audits.  There are value for money review arrangements in place through the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities.  All of Irish Water's operating expenditure and capital plans have to be submitted to the commission which has to approve them.  It will only approve expenditure that it regards will be efficiently incurred.  There is a very elaborate value for money regime in place through the commission.  These issues are being looked at, but that is one of the matter that obviously will need to be considered.</p></speech>

Having gone through the four-stage approval process, it is actually being implemented at a cost of &euro;4.17 million.  For another project, at its highest point, budget proposed was &euro;8.86 million, but it is being implemented at a cost of &euro;7.12 million.  There are very clear examples to show how the process has actually worked in getting better value for money.</p> <p>  I think the Deputy mentioned the enforcement division going on tour.  The issue with it is as follows.  What the four-stage approval process gives us is an opportunity to capture and consider potential increases in cost before they actually happen to see if can we actually strip some of them out.  Ultimately, it is the Exchequer and the taxpayer that fund projects.  With the enforcement division approach, very often one will have lost that opportunity because matters will have moved on.</p></speech>

While I do not doubt that the system is meant to kick in, I do not believe it does.  I know from my own experience in Cork city where I was a member of the council for 11 years and from people who come to my constituency office that some of the most squalid properties are HAP tenancies.  There are health and safety issues, yet a fortune is being paid to private landlords.  In most cases, inspections do not take place and, when they do and the properties fail, the tenants are just left there.  Perhaps other members of the committee might have heard about cases and, if so, they can correct me, but I have yet to hear of one case where a HAP tenancy failed an inspection and the tenant was transferred out of it as a matter of priority.  I just do not believe that happens.</p></speech>

Speaking from experience and the number of people coming into my constituency office who do not have basics such as heating or hot water or who are experiencing leaks and windows falling out, I know that there are major health and safety issues.  These people are getting no support from local authorities and are basically given the option of staying in the property they are in or entering homelessness services.  I do not believe it is not a major issue.  I do not know if we are keeping that kind of data but if we are not, I suggest that we should.</p><p>The biggest reason for people entering homelessness services is a landlord giving a notice to quit on the grounds that a family member is moving in, major refurbishment work is to be done or the property is to be sold.  I have come across many cases - certainly not a handful - where these are not the reasons.  The tenant may be evicted on those grounds but a couple of months later the property would be up on <i>daft.ie</i>with a massive increase in rent.  I put it to both the Department and city and county managers that this is a loophole to get around rent caps in certain areas.  I wonder if there is any evidence to support that.</p></speech>

Approximately the same amount arise because of what are called "family reasons", etc.  We certainly hear anecdotal evidence similar to what the Deputy has described, where a notice to quit might have been served on the basis of a property being sold or used by a family member before the property comes back on the market.  There is an item of legislation going through both Houses designed to strengthen the enforcement powers available to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to be able to track those sorts of cases and it has just finished Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Some issues are still being considered with a view to introducing amendments on Committee Stage or possibly in the Seanad.  The matter has been brought to our attention and although we do not have hard data, we want to put the RTB in a position to be able to track and identify those cases and deal with them as appropriate.</p></speech>

The transfer list consists of people directly applying for transfers.  People who go into HAP have an option in terms of a transfer and an offer will go in that regard if they choose to move from their locality.  In Limerick County Council, 38 people came from the rental accommodation scheme to direct housing and 79 people came across from HAP.  We had 529 new HAP tenancies.

Of the 2,022, how many are new properties that did not exist previously as part of a regeneration where properties were knocked and rebuilt?  How many additional houses did local authorities build?</p></speech>

The focus is on direct builds but the number of homes we provide is what counts at the end of the day.  Regeneration is not simply a process of rebuilding houses.</p><p>It is a revitalisation of those communities, which is far more than just restoration or rebuilding houses.</p></speech>

Of those, 300 are either in construction or being delivered currently, and the balance is already going through the stages with the Department.  That is a ten year plan and we are already four years ahead of that.  Overall they are the units we have to provide.  I cannot go back over the history of it and say how many were demolished.

How many households are supported by the Department through the help-to-buy scheme, HAP, Rebuilding Ireland home loans, acquisitions and new builds?  I will move on to the next question if someone is getting the answer for Mr. McCarthy.</p> <p>  I hear from my colleague beside me that the help-to-buy scheme has been a great success.  At the time, there was much talk that it was an inflationary proposal and that it would cause prices to increase and would not be successful but I have been informed that 10,000 people have taken this up, the budget is gone and the Government is looking at increasing the budget.  Could Mr. McCarthy talk me through the successes of the parameters set at that time?  I refer to the &euro;500,000 price cap, the maximum purchase price of &euro;320,000, the five-year tax rebate period and the successes of an initiative the Department came up with.  I am trying to be positive about housing.  </p> <p>  In respect of HAP, I read a Library and Research Service, LRS, document because I was struck by some of the commentary here - I was not here earlier but I was keeping an eye on proceedings - about HAP tenancies.  The figures from the LRS  not the Department's figures - show that 44% of notices to quit are because of arrears where people not paying rent.  Perhaps there is something I do not understand here but a person providing a HAP property is usually a private citizen, an accidental landlord or someone in the business, who has a property.  According to the LRS the number of people being given notice to quit for rent arrears is 44%.  One can combine the next two figures.  The figure for notices to quit because the landlord wishes to sell the property is 20% while the figure for notices to quit to because of family use is 8%.  I agree that a bit of messing might be going on within that 28% but I want to be sure that the correct information is going out from this committee.  It is almost being put out there that people are being thrown out of HAP homes under false pretences and that the house or apartment is then put on the market.  Could Mr. McCarthy elaborate on those figures in order that we can get the facts out today?  Has he any answer to my first question before I move on to the next question?  </p></speech>

I will take them in pieces if that is okay.  The total number of social housing households supported under Rebuilding Ireland last year was just over 27,100.  That breaks down as 17,926 on HAP, 4,251 through build programmes, 560 voids, 2,610 acquisitions, just over 1,000 leasing units and 755 RAS units.  Although some of the individual elements came in under target while others came in over target, in overall terms, the figure of 27,103 was 6% ahead of the overall target for the year.</p></speech>

If we took the money being provided to HAP and RAS and transferred it to capital programmes involving building or buying, we would only manage to support a fraction of the more than 18,000 people supported through RAS and HAP.  If we took the associated funding for those two programmes in 2018, which between them would have come to &euro;420 million, and applied it to capital programmes, we would not even support 1,000 households.</p></speech>

If we just got rid of it to be populist, I assume we would put the money into building houses.  However, the problem is that it takes time to build houses.  What do we, therefore, with the families in the interim period?  I have failed to find an answer to this question about what we would do with that cohort of people in the interim period from anybody.  I think Mr. McCarthy has given me an answer.</p></speech>

It is important to put it in context.</p><p>If we look at Rebuilding Ireland and the six-year profile of what we aim to achieve, as we started out in 2016 we recognised that, as we spoke about earlier, we were coming from a situation in which the local authority building programme and, indeed, the approved housing body building programme had virtually ground to a halt due to lack of funding.  We recognised that in the early years of Rebuilding Ireland, as the build programme and other elements ramped up, we would be reliant on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, to a greater extend.  As one looks through the six years one will see that the mix of elements changes.  We aim to be assisting more households through measures other than HAP and RAS than through HAP and RAS combined when we get to the end of Rebuilding Ireland in 2021.  That is an important evolution that takes account of the reality of an increasing funding envelope as the years go on and of where we came from in terms of actual activity.  As I have said, the build programmes had literally ground to a halt.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of the help to buy scheme.  I am probably not the best person to speak about this scheme as it is a tax measure but I know from engagements on the issue that almost 10,000 households have been approved under the scheme.</p></speech>

The Deputy also asked about the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  As of the end of January, approximately 575 households had drawn down the loan.  With regard to arrears in the private rental sector and the issue of notices to quit, the Residential Tenancies Board's annual report for 2017 gives a broad breakdown of the main reasons for notices to quit.  Some 44% were related to rent arrears, 20% to landlords selling properties, 8% to landlords wanting the property for a family member, and approximately 8% to refurbishment.  There are other factors but they make up smaller percentages.  Those are the main ones.</p></speech>

It is important to say that buildings need maintenance.  There is a certain argument out there in this regard.  I understand that and there are landlords who use these reasons to get rid of people, but there are also genuine people out there who need to maintain their buildings.  I hear from real people who are renting in the real world that sometimes it suits them to move out for a few weeks.  People often move back into the same unit because if a genuine landlord is trying to provide genuine high-quality accommodation, the landlord may put in insulation and do the pipes and a tenant with whom he or she has a good relationship may move somewhere for a few weeks while it is being done and then move back.  There is almost an argument that refurbishment never has to happen but we know from looking at the history of Dublin city and at the lack of refurbishment in tenements in the Georgian inner city that we had a similar problem generations ago.  I would like to note that today.</p></speech>

I want to ask about interruptions in the supply chain.  When Private Members' Bills come through the Oireachtas, they sometimes create uncertainty.  I refer to things like the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018.  As we saw to some extent with the review of Rebuilding Ireland a few years ago and the changes in rules in respect of apartments, any uncertainty in the market halts the market temporarily.  Does the uncertainty around the Anti-Evictions Bill present real risks to supply in terms of landlords pulling back from the system because of the uncertainty created in these Houses?</p></speech>

Will Mr. McCarthy, as quickly as possible, summarise the concept of the Land Development Agency and outline the mix, the minimum social housing proportion, and the plan in that regard?  From looking at the figures, I believe social housing is being ramped up.  We are in a great place but there is a huge issue in respect of affordability when it comes to people's net pay at the end of the week.  In business studies, we were told that one should spend 30% on rent or mortgage payments but we are now in a situation in which so much of families' incomes are going on rent or the mortgage that they basically cannot live.  I am concerned about affordability for people with young families.  Will Mr. McCarthy articulate how this use of State land will help those real people?</p></speech>

We need to address the issues in all those strands and we are doing that.  One of the issues raised consistently is around the use of public land.  People ask why public land is not being brought into use for housing to a greater extent.  There is a significant uptick in the use of land owned by local authorities, particularly for social housing, but there is also land in wider public ownership.  The Land Development Agency was established to lead the process of bringing parcels of available public sector land into use for multiple purposes related to housing, including general housing delivery and the delivery of social housing through Part V.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.707" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>There is also a 30% minimum for affordable housing.  The aim is to contribute to addressing the housing delivery issues that exist in all of those strands of the housing market.  The other aspect in terms of affordability is the serviced sites fund which is designed to support local authorities bringing some of their lands into play for affordable housing.  The first round of approvals under that fund were issued in December and there will be another call for proposals under the fund issuing shortly.  Initially, it was targeted at the Dublin, greater Dublin, Cork and Galway authorities.  We have now asked other authorities to look at the affordability issues in their areas.  As such, the second call will be wider once we have completed the analysis of the economic assessments local authorities provide.</p></speech>

Rebuilding Ireland is a Government policy which the witnesses are required to carry out.  Mr. McCarthy referred earlier to 50,000 houses per year.  The all-party Oireachtas committee produced its report in 2016.  The No. 1 item in the report in terms of the conclusions was to increase the social housing stock owned by local authorities and AHBs by at least 50,000.  That would be a minimum of 10,000 builds per year.  In what year will there be 10,000 builds?</p></speech>

It includes acquisitions.  We consider stock to include long-term leased units which are available in many cases for 25 years.  The 50,000 is a combination of all three to be achieved by 2021.</p></speech>

There is value for money in the approach that is taken.  Last week, when the Irish Council for Social Housing appeared before the committee, its representatives set out an ambitious plan if a regulation was put on a statutory basis in respect of the number of houses they could build.  They were being held back by virtue of not being on a statutory footing.  I have always accepted that people have to live somewhere while houses are being built.  However, the way it is playing out is perhaps the most costly way by virtue of the time it is taking.  Other funds could have been leveraged from, for example, credit unions and the European Investment Bank.  In 2021, we are looking at 87,000 households, which will be enormously expensive.  Does Mr. McCarthy have a figure on what it will cost at its maximum?</p></speech>

They are dealt with on an annual basis.  It is important to bear in mind that of the 87,000 households to be supported under HAP and RAS, a significant proportion will include people who move from rent supplement across to have their social housing needs met.  It is a process that has been under way since 2014.  Coming back to the discussion with Deputy O'Connell, and as Deputy Catherine Murphy has acknowledged herself, there is a need to provide supports for people within the envelope of resources available to us.  The mix that is there involves a significant build-up of the permanent social housing stock as well as significant numbers in HAP and RAS.</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with a sense of any scheme providing support.  We need to support people.  When it is the major player in the housing market, I have a serious problem regarding value for money.  When a figure doubles within a year and continues to increase, I have a serious problem as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Built into that is lack of security and many other problems.  That is just in respect of HAP, which has been enshrined in legislation as, in its implementation, the only game in town.  Mr. Murray and Ms Maguire are from the CCMA.

Each local authority is required to develop a Traveller accommodation plan and it is up to each local authority to deliver on its plan.  The Department allows for an overall spend nationally but does not set targets for an overall figure of units.  We established that earlier.  Is it not the case that over the past three years while funding has increased, most local authorities are not even reaching their own targets?  We know that six of the 31 met their targets.  Ten had no delivery at all and the rest did not reach their targets.

The buck stops with the Department when it allocates funding for a specific purpose and that funding is not drawn down.

The Secretary General has mentioned a report to be published in April.  That may or may not make some structural or policy changes.  The delivery of Traveller accommodation in the State is poor.  Under the Act, responsibility for that lies with the local authorities, two of whose chief executives are in the room.

I have no doubt that if it was up to them, they would house everyone on their lists in the morning.  I am not suggesting there is some conspiracy to keep people on lists.  What are the main barriers the witnesses see in their positions on local authorities?  Is the main issue funding, planning, a lack of land, contractors or skilled labour or a combination of all of those factors?</p></speech>

There is a combination of issues.  There is no single issue.  We came from a very low base.  We had to start again in getting the right skills and people.  That took time.  That is a fact of life.  2018 saw one of the worst winters for quite some time where the construction programme is concerned.  That affected our operations.  Did we have issues in the very beginning?  Previous Deputies referred to the processes.  We have been in discussions with the Department and we have agreed on a good process.  There is a four-stage process that takes 59 weeks and a single-stage process that is slightly shorter than that.  That is the time period.  It has taken us time to get through that process but we are running it well.  Hence, on occasion, an acquisition is far better and of far more value.  Hence, a turnkey, on occasion if it is presented to me, is of far more value.  That is reflected in the overall figures that have been produced at the end of the year.  The barriers are always there and there are always issues.  There might be an issue with the land, the location, the community or indeed the council itself.  Some of the committee members' parties will know what is involved in Part 8 applications.  It is hard to get them through, despite the willingness to provide social housing.  Those are the realities.</p></speech>

It was not easy for its members.  There was a split down the middle between different parties, many of whom are represented here today.  That is a fact of life.  That is local politics.  It is the nature of the democratic system at local level.  We have to go through that.  The Part 8 system is a critically important part of that negotiation.</p></speech>

People are not against social housing, but we have land in some very settled areas that have not been developed for years.  We are moving into them and this disrupts a community.  It therefore takes time to make the necessary adjustment when putting new housing in.  Settled communities are disrupted.  That is a fact of life.  That is part and parcel of it.  It is not an objection to housing <i>per se</i>.  Locals acknowledge that traffic issues might increase or school provision might not be sufficient.  There are planning issues which need to be addressed.</p></speech>

Mr. Murray can correct me if I am wrong.  In Cork, 50% of the housing waiting list is made up of single people.  We are not building any properties to cater for that cohort.  Most of the turnkey developments are three-bedroom or four-bedroom properties, which are more suitable for families.  Is the type of development a difficulty when local authorities look at housing lists and try to plan for the years ahead?  Is there even scope to take concern on board or is it just a case of needing to build or purchase as much as possible now to address a crisis?</p></speech>

We have to ensure that we do not make the mistakes of the past and that we look for a sustainable mix in tenure.  There is a role for the Land Development Agency, LDA, in avoiding this type of situation arising again.  There is a place for drawing up master plans for locations.  Our development plans can then determine what the mix should be.  That plan should allow for single accommodation, two-bedroom houses and three-bedroom houses as the need arises.  That is certainly the way we would approach any private sector developers coming to the table at this stage.  We want the appropriate mix, not just what might sell on the market.  We dictate or determine the type of use or mixed tenure that is built.  We have acquired 200 acres and are now drawing up a master plan for the development of more than 3,000 units.  Some 26 ha of that is within the local authority area, so we are advancing delivery.  We are using the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and we have already built two schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Pre-planning is important for the future.</p><p>At the moment, we have to try to get as much accommodation as possible while trying to keep that sustainable balance.</p></speech>

Some of the evidence I have is that we have individuals in three and four bedroom properties who wish to downsize and are finding it very difficult to do that due to red tape and so on.</p></speech>

We were in a position to be able to rehouse them to either apartment accommodation, which they chose because they wanted to be near the centre of town, or whatever suited them given their particular circumstances.  The issue we have as local authorities is gathering information on the level of under-occupancy within houses.  We need to do that.  Obviously, it has to be the tenant's choice but we would have had some positive experiences in the past 18 months of people coming forward willingly to say they wish to give up their house to live nearer the centre of town or because they might want to be in an apartment block or near various services, depending on their circumstances.</p></speech>

I have a general observation to make about the Department and it is nothing to do with the Secretary General.  It is a historical issue.  I will put my question by way of giving examples.  If we ask the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the number of people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, it can provide that information every week.  If we ask the HSE for the number of medical cards it has issued, it can provide an answer today, tomorrow or next week.  It knows how many medical cards have been issued and cancelled.  In terms of the Revenue Commissioners and PAYE, everybody can have their tax credits up-to-date on a weekly basis and it is all done online in real time.  When we come to Mr. McCarthy's Department, and this is not personal to him, I ask him to address the historical deficit, as I would call it, in that regard.  He cannot do it now; it is a long-term project.  We ask for the number of people on the housing lists and the Department produces a list once a year.  Imagine if the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection only had information once a year on the number of claimants for all its schemes or the HSE only had information the number of people on medical cards once or year.  Imagine if the Revenue said it would issue one tax clearance or tax credit certificate to last for 12 months.  Mr. McCarthy's Department is almost medieval in terms of its statistics system.  He should not take this personally.  Every other Department is up to date.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government gets its figures from local authorities.  I cannot understand why, in this day and age, there is not a standardised system in the Department across every local authority.  Let us say the Department compiles its housing list in the middle of the summer and has 70,000 people on it.  It then processes 400 cases a week in the different local authorities and 26 people are taken off the list because they have been allocated housing.  It is beyond comprehension in this century that the Department does not have a list setting out the figures for each local authority every week.  That should be available every day if the system was up to date.  I find it strange.  The Department is very busy but we are used to people having up-to-date information.  Even the letter we got today in response to the question on net need refers to exclusions, for example, duplicate applications, those already in receipt of social housing support, which is one of the issues we have been talking about, or who are on a transfer list.  The next sentence states: "While data is not available on the numbers of households under each of the above headings ...".  If officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection came in here and made comments like that, we would be amazed.  As a long-term plan, the flow of information is extraordinary.  Mr. McCarthy might want to respond-----</p></speech>

I would make three comments in response to that.  Some of the bodies the Chairman cited are single bodies.  We do a lot of our work through 31 local authorities and one of the things we continually struggle with is the local authority saying, "You are collecting too much information from us and you are harassing us for this, that and the other."  We always try to strike a balance.</p> <p>  To come back to the point the Chairman made on the transfer lists and why we have not collected data in respect of that, historically we have viewed that as being a matter to be administered locally.  We do not want to add it to data collection we are doing from local authorities.</p> <p>  In terms of the housing list, unlike the number of claimants who are on jobseeker's benefit or something like that, those are the actual people who are in receipt of it.  That would be very obvious to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or any organisation that would be managing that.  They would know exactly how many they are paying.  We can say through the local authorities and the approved housing bodies how many households are being supported.  The difficulty with the list, and the Chairman talked about having figures every week or every month, and the reason we have to do it as a once-a-year exercise is that what we will capture every week and every month is people who are going onto the list.  We will capture some who are coming off it by virtue of being allocated but we will not capture people who have come off the list by virtue of their circumstances changing.  Otherwise, local authorities would need to be continually engaging with everybody on their lists.</p></speech>

When the list is available the Department knows the number of applications and knows that so many houses have been allocated or that approved housing bodies have taken people off the list.  There will be people on the list who, as time passes, will no longer be interested.  I understand that.  We are not asking the Department to go back over every application but if it had an automated system, it could collect the basic information and then, on a less regular basis, hound the local authorities to verify the list and so on.</p></speech>

That is why the local authorities speak of being harassed.  If this process was automated, we would have somebody in the housing Department who could provide the number of applications processed this week and the number of applications on hand but not yet processed.  That is the big issue we have with this.  The form is so complicated, it can take weeks on end to process.  I have never seen an application going in and being approved on the first presentation of the form because the volume of information is extensive, and rightly so.  We did not even talk about the number of unprocessed applications that are in the system.  If this was the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the debate today would be about the delay in processing.  We did not even talk about the cases on Mr. McCarthy's desk that have not been processed yet.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to take what I am saying as referring to automation.  I am not talking about manual work.  I am just saying that other Departments are more up-to-date in that regard.  I accept it is a big project and not something that cannot happen today, tomorrow or next year.  I think Mr. McCarthy gets the point.  The Department probably needs it all the more because there are 31 local authorities and we now have various approved housing bodies involved.  That is probably a greater reason for the Department to have it than a single line Department, if Mr. McCarthy knows what I mean.  I am just making the point.  Mr. McCarthy can take it as a project to be looked at down the road.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. McCarthy to send to the committee the figure for the local authority housing stock at the end of each year for the past five years.

One is, and we are not fully there yet as is obvious from the earlier discussion, better inspections of properties, which would not have been a feature in rent supplement, so we can get to a point of being satisfied that we are utilising good quality accommodation.

That is an important distinction.  You mentioned that the average cost of building a local authority house last year was &euro;212,000 versus &euro;177,000 for buying.  The issue in Laois is that the local authority has eased off on acquisition because it was competing against other local families who were trying to get a start.  It could have bought everything in sight but somewhere along the line it decided it was not being fair to other people.  One can go in and out of the housing market.  I understand you are relying on the chief executive to use some judgment on what is good for the overall environment.  I doubt that anybody wants the local authority to go into an estate, buy everything available in that estate and let nobody else in.</p></speech>

I am aware of that from the part of the country where my parents live.  There are two three-bedroom, normal, semi-detached houses on either side of my parents' house that have been for sale for &euro;195,000 for two years and they have not been bought.  From the point of view of sustainable communities and the efficient use of public infrastructure, if those opportunities remain and the local authority is not competing with other purchasers, and if they are vacant for that long it is not, we do not wish to put more infrastructure in to stretch the water pipe further outside the town and put another scheme outside it.

We carried out a review of that scheme in 2017, if memory serves.  A few things in the scheme were acting as restrictions so we increased the thresholds for the value of properties.  We also increased what we call the over-accommodation so we could get more people into it.  That has brought more into it.</p><p>Mortgage arrears remain a significant issue for the housing market but it has been improving over the last two years.

We are now back to processing the waiting list.  In each year since the scheme was established, how many applications have been made and approved and how many were outstanding at the end of the year?  It seems more cases are bogged down in the process than have come out the far end.  The scheme has been running for a number of years now.  I would have expected difficulties to have been ironed out by now.  Last week, we asked the representatives of the various housing bodies whether negative equity arises.  The Department needs to know that.  I was shocked that the approved housing bodies could not answer the question because they are sitting down with the tenant and the Department.  They are paying the money over.  If a property is in negative equity, I understand the relevant financial institution can still go after the mortgage holder.  Can Mr. McCarthy give a definitive answer on that?</p></speech>

Some people were ready to go.  Somebody advises them that they could be caught for &euro;50,000 at any time if their property is in negative equity.

Our colleagues will be coming in as the vote in the D&aacute;il concludes.  I want to ask a couple of questions about the Local Government Fund.  A few years ago, almost &euro;2 billion was provided through the fund.  There was &euro;1 billion in motor tax receipts.  We used to have the Exchequer contribution and the local property tax, LPT, as well.  That amounted to &euro;1.9 billion in 2016.  That figure has since decreased.  It is estimated that it will be &euro;650 million in 2019, mainly from the LPT and the Exchequer contribution.  I will ask a question about the Local Government Fund before I hand over to Deputy Cassells as the first lead speaker.  In a nutshell, the bulk of the funds that used to go through the Local Government Fund are not going to go through it any more.  The main item in there, aside from the Exchequer contribution used to fund local authorities, which is something that could be done directly through the Department's Vote, is the LPT.  By and large, the LPT is the other real source of income in there now.  That is actually collected by the Revenue Commissioners in any event.  Then it is transferred to this fund before being distributed onwards.  Does Mr. McCarthy, as the Accounting Officer who is responsible for that account, accept that there might be a case to be made for saying the fund is no longer needed, given that it has decreased to one third of the throughput it had a couple of years ago and most of what is now going through the account could as easily be dealt with through the Department's Vote?  I would like Mr. McCarthy to respond to that question.  He can see where the account is going.</p></speech>

I think it still has value from a LPT point of view.  It shows very clearly the ins and outs and the use of LPT, as part of the Local Government Fund, for local government purposes.</p></speech>

I understood the need for this account a couple of years ago.  Maybe there is still a need for it, but I suggest it is a lesser need.  Deputy Cassells is the first speaker in this afternoon's session.</p></speech>

I was a long way down the rabbit hole by the end, but I was none the wiser.  We will go at it again.  In his opening statement, the Comptroller and Auditor General spoke about the &quot;complexity&quot; of the issues pertaining here.  That is putting it mildly.  I want to start by asking Mr. John McCarthy about local authority current expenditure <i>per capita</i>by county, as a percentage of the total local authority current expenditure <i>per capita</i>.  The Department provided us with figures in respect of that last year.  I want to understand this because I spent 17 years on the council trying to grapple with these issues.  I know councillors are still grappling with them.  I am sure people in certain counties must scratch their heads when they look at the real disparities between counties.  According to the 2017 figures that were provided when we were doing the accounts last year, County Meath is at the bottom of the list with a spend of &euro;537 per head.  County Meath is at the bottom with 61%.  County Leitrim, which has a population half the size of Navan, is up near the top at 118%.  I know there have been good managers in County Leitrim in the past decade or so, but that is crazy.  I want to understand how the Department is working to try to reconcile these figures.  It is not acceptable that County Meath, which has a population of almost 200,000, is bottom of the chart.  Shortly after the start of this year, my town council Bill was killed during a private scrutiny hearing.  In course of the knifing that took place at the committee hearing, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, mentioned that the Department, in coming forward with new initiatives, was looking at the methodology being applied to all counties.  I would appreciate it if Mr. McCarthy could expand on that.</p></speech>

As the Deputy has said, the <i>per capita</i>funding to local authorities varies quite a bit between them.  I will set out where we are in terms of LPT-related funding of local authorities.  When we made the transition from the old general purpose grants to the LPT in 2014 or 2015, the policy decision taken at the time was that no local authority should be worse off.</p><p>A particular approach to distributing the LPT was then decided on.  It involved some money going into an equalisation fund.  Even that was not enough to ensure that all local authorities would not be worse off.  That is why some of the Exchequer contribution to the fund is used to supplement those local authorities.<br/><br/>The provenance of the distribution has an origin that goes back quite some time.  It can be traced as far back as the needs and resources model in 2000, which covered a range of factors.  I mention it because the figures that the Deputy has referenced are <i>per capita</i>ones.  The needs and resources model, which dates back 20 years, was-----</p></speech>

Two exercises are under way.  The LPT is the Minister for Finance's responsibility and he has been undertaking a review of it.  In parallel, the group that the Minister of State established is considering the basis on which any buoyance that emerged in the LPT in future would be distributed and what a fair and balanced basket of variables to be taken into account would be, for example, population or God knows what.  That group has been working.  The intention is to try to bring both processes to a conclusion in parallel.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy anticipates an increase in the overall LPT take because some people will no longer have exemptions, there will be new builds and so on.  I have discussed with the Taoiseach his commitment that all counties should retain their LPT revenues in full.  My county, which is a net contributor, would welcome that, but there are only so many net contributors.  Simultaneously, the Taoiseach has stated that no county will be left worse off.  How do we square that circle?  If we are saying that all counties will retain their LPT revenues, the likes of Dublin, Meath and Kildare would welcome that, but the likes of Leitrim and Cavan will be left in the same situation.  Will the buoyancy be eaten up to fund that retention?  If Meath gets to retain all of its LPT, will another strand of our funding be cut to balance that out?  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised this matter and, I am sure, will revisit it.  We ended up being a net contributor to roads and housing when we were not previously.  Will the witness address this point, please?</p></speech>

As the Deputy pointed out, a range of issues arise concerning what will happen to exemptions from LPT and the political commitment to 100% local retention.  All of those elements are being fed into the review group exercise that the Minister for Finance is leading.  Until such time as it is completed, there is probably not much more that I can say.  As I told this committee when the issue arose previously, if one local authority were to gain in a situation in which the pot of money did not change, then other local authorities would inevitably have to lose.  The question of additionality - no one losing and other things still being achieved - would have to be considered.  It is being examined by the Minister's group.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Taoiseach's commitment is a political one rather than a departmental one, but it seems extremely strong and I envisage that, given its firmness, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is examining how to square that circle as part of the review.  It inevitably will have significant ramifications for the funding structure.  There are other commitments, for example, there will be no significant income increase after the bands are examined.  All of these elements cannot be equal.  How will this piece of magic be achieved without a cut in another funding strand?  I will move on to that subject shortly.</p></speech>

Obviously, it could look like a number of different things.  It would look one way if additional money came into play and another, much different, way if additional money did not come into play.  All of these issues are being considered in the round as part of the Department of Finance review group's exercise to determine the best way of pulling them all together and what the ultimate settling point will be.</p></speech>

He has nearly referred to it himself.  When the LPT was introduced, I was a councillor and felt aggrieved that the general purpose grant would be diminished by the same amount as the LPT accrued.  In real terms, we were no better off.  People anticipated a strengthening of local government that would allow us to make more significant achievements in the public sphere but that did not happen to the extent it should have.  I am not saying that it did not happen full stop, as it did.  I acknowledge what councillors in my county dealt with at the time.  On Monday, Oireachtas Members from our county received a briefing.  We had been carrying a debt of &euro;10 million, but that is now down to &euro;1 million.  The council is doing exemplary work in that regard.  Due to the removal of the general purpose grant when the LPT was introduced, though, we did not achieve what we wanted to.  By saying that we will give every council its own LPT revenue without leaving any worse off, are we again giving political commitments that will result in the impoverishment of local government?  That circle cannot be squared.</p></speech>

Indeed, some authorities were better off, albeit not to the extent that might have been the case had other policy decisions been taken.  There is not much more I can say about how some of these political and policy issues will be married without knowing the outcome of the review group's work.</p></speech>

I will put it another way.  What is the total accumulated amount paid by the likes of Meath, Kildare and Dublin into the equalisation fund?  That is probably a better way of getting to the heart of the issue.  How many net contributors are there?</p></speech>

That is no small amount in terms of commitments being made.</p> <p>  The other major issue I raised last year is on the income side, namely, that relating to rates.  Again, I am conscious of the Comptroller and Auditor looking at the significant amount of money coming in to local government.  This is one of the few areas where the council has a mechanism to raise money.  I have made the point in the past decade that dependency has continued to grow at a time when there was major restraint on the part of local authorities as a result of the recession.  I am conscious that the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 is before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  On Second Stage, I made the point that the Bill does not go far enough and that the dependency on rates nationwide is really worrying.  IBEC has also made this point.  Many of the statutory measures being brought forward reflect things that are already being done by councils.  Meath County Council has initiated many measures and some counties would have high collection rates.  Is the Department looking at trying to increase central funding and introducing other funding mechanisms in order to try to reduce the dependency to which I refer?  Having exercised restraint for perhaps the past eight years or so, the temptation is that the heads of finance of local authorities might be of the view that, in the context of this year's budgets, they might be able to bring in more funding via an increase in rates because the new councillors may not know what they are doing.  Will the Department attempt to try to increase central funding to dissuade heads of finance from attempting to put that potential increase before councillors?</p></speech>

If one looks at the period from 2014 to 2017, the proportion of revenue funding for local authorities generally and nationally has reduced in terms of the reliance on rates.  In 2014, it would have accounted for approximately 36% of revenue funding.  In 2017, it was 33%.  Its proportionate share has decreased slightly but certainly the restraint in respect of rates has been very much the call from the centre in recent years.  In large measure, that has been respected but, again, colleagues from the local authorities may want to comment on that.</p></speech>

Mr. John McCarthy stated that the main area of central funding comes through the local property tax.  That is a half misnomer because the people pay into a fund from which they are getting revenue.  We do not have a general purpose grant.  Are we heading towards a scenario - and we see from the chart that the Comptroller and Auditor General produced - whereby local government is becoming more dependent on Departments to try to fund schemes.   Let me provide an example.  The Department of Rural and Community Development, under the Minister, Deputy Ring, might fund development or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport might provide funding for services.  These funds are coming into the system.  Is Mr. John McCarthy stating that this is the way it will be in the future?</p></speech>

It was envisaged that there would be relationships between Departments, other than the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, with the local government system.  If one looks at the revenue income to local authorities from central government - and leaving aside the local property tax - again, that has increased proportionately in recent years.  In 2014, it would have accounted for approximately 21%.  By 2017, it had risen to 28%.  As Deputy Cassells states, an increasing element of funding is coming through other Departments as a result of two developments.  The first of these reflects the coming into effect of the policy position that envisaged local authorities not just delivering services on behalf of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government but on behalf of Government generally and the second relates to changes in departmental functions in recent years has seen some functions transferring to other Departments.</p></speech>

It is bit similar to when we discussed the expenditure relating to the Office of the President.  When one looks at that office, it appears that the spend is very small until one realises the other elements involved, namely those relating to the Garda, the Army, etc.  All of the Accounting Officers involved would have to be brought together in one room in order to try to obtain a real sense of what is being spent in this area.</p></speech>

From the point of view of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, however, &euro;62 million plus in funding was announced by the Minister, Deputy Ring.  Local authorities can apply to the Department for that funding.  This money from the Department of Rural and Community Development will be spent.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have a role in ensuring that it is spent correctly?</p></speech>

As previous speakers indicated, the area of local government finance is complex.  Revenue does not come from one source.  When we get funding from other Departments, it is for a specific purpose.  This means that money from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is spent on roads, etc.  It is increasingly more complex and the sources, not just from the Departments but also the State agencies, be it Enterprise Ireland, through the local enterprise offices, LEOs, the National Transport Authority or whatever.</p> <p>  We would all have a different view of the local property tax.  It is one area in respect of which we, as a representative group, would not agree.  I have to argue it from both sides.  Having spent some time in Leitrim County Council, I am aware that the county is a beneficiary but that, for example, County Meath is a net contributor.  Each local authority has been guaranteed baseline funding and that is required in order to deliver the service.  One then has to look to at where a local authority has discretion, which is in the area of other charges.  Predominantly, that would be commercial rates.  For the past ten years, there has been no significant increase in rates.  In the past two years, some local authorities have moved to giving a general increase in the commercial rate for specific purposes, be it within their own counties.  I know that we have not increased commercial rates in County Meath since 2007.  Our purpose has been to expand the rate base rather than increase the rates.</p></speech>

Most chief executives would be loath to look for an increase in rates unless they really needed the funding or there was a specific purpose.  The legislation allows for a specific rate increase for a bid scheme or whatever, or if it is to be spent on a specific purpose.  Some local authorities have had the need to do that.  It is more that we consider how we can support our local businesses, maybe by giving them incentives to pay.  That has assisted in the collection levels, which have increased.  I refer to incentive schemes to pay on time or to pay electronically over a period.  That does increase the local authority's income take.  The funding of local government as a topic has generated a lot of debate over the last number of years.  No disrespect to our Department colleagues but we would argue that we need to be put on a firm footing.  We saw the local property tax as doing that because it is collecting-----</p></speech>

However, I have seen examples across the country of councillors abusing that autonomy and I have no problem in saying so.  They were whittling away at that base and left their councils bereft of funding.  Our neighbouring County Louth would be a prime example.</p> <p>  Can Mr. John McCarthy explain the local government innovation and reform figure under the LGMA heading in the statement of income?  In the 2017 accounts, it went from &euro;3.8 million to &euro;2.1 million.</p></speech>

I think it was to support the shared services programme that the local government sector is putting in place.  One of the biggest initiatives, as the Chair will be aware, is the MyPay shared service in Portlaoise.  That funding figure depends on the status of some of those initiatives at a particular point.  The shared payroll service, MyPay, would be the most prominent of them.</p></speech>

There are many different streams of funding coming into local authorities from various Departments and agencies and I want to touch on some of them.  I was looking, for instance, at the total funding that goes into local government from across all Departments, including the local property tax.  We are almost back up to the 2011 levels of funding.  It is slightly under that level but we are almost there or thereabouts.  There are huge discrepancies, however, between some local authorities.  Dublin City Council is currently 31% higher than it was in 2011.  South Dublin County Council is 25% higher and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is 26% higher.  All of the other councils are less and are not meeting that.  Is there a reason for this?  Is it because there are capital projects happening in those areas?  Is additional funding coming from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, for example, to meet particular projects or is it perhaps to balance out the <i>per capita </i>funding rates?</p></speech>

From experience I am aware that we had periods of delay between the council having to pay out for a project and getting the reimbursement.  It sometimes could be nine months by the time we had put in all the paperwork and got the money.  How do council managers bridge those funding gaps in the meantime?</p></speech>

At times there may be a layover but that has to be dealt with through the cashflow.  Claims from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Transport Authority, NTA, are recouped monthly and we have a system we must log on to.  It is their system but it is integrated.  We make the claim and it comes straight into the council's bank account on a particular date.  One is managing this all the time.  Similarly, particularly on the capital side in housing, we make recoupments as we incur the costs and then draw them down.  There can be a lag but as of late, it is not significant.</p></speech>

On other projects for which councils can apply for funding, I remember in my day on the local authority, adaptation grants required the council to come up with 50% of the funding and the Department would come up with the other 50%.  Is this still the case?</p></speech>

For housing adaptation we have to come with 20% of the cost.  This is met through internal resources such as receipts from the sale of houses or through our own revenue funding.  We would have to fund other schemes by about 25%, especially capital schemes.  If it is capital, it is funded though the development levies.  If it is revenue spend it is through the revenue account and the council would make provisions within the budget each year.</p></speech>

The local authorities have to produce a capital report on a three-year rolling cycle.  This is presented to their members each year.  In this report the management has to estimate what its council's capital receipts are going to be.  This may be from grants or development levies, for example.  Because of the growth in the private sector, the development levies have been increasing over the years.  This has to be matched with the spend in the council's capital account.  Some of that must be spent for specific purposes.  If the council collects levies for roads it must spend it on roads.  If it is collected for community facilities, it must be spent on community facilities.</p></speech>

Ms Maguire is correct that rates were increased in Cork City Council, but they were ring-fenced for tourism promotion and for selling the city, which would benefit businesses in general.  It was very successful.  One of the difficulties I see in Cork is that the rate base has narrowed in the city centre.  It may have expanded when one looks at the overall rate base, but in the city centre there are shops lying idle in Patrick Street, which does nothing for attempts to promote the city.  Is it within the scope of local authorities to provide rate breaks to new businesses wishing to open up, or is the legislation clear that the rate must be charged?</p></speech>

There is a refund mechanism available where the building is vacant on the date the rate is made.  A refund is available, but it varies across local authorities.  It can be anything from 0% to 100%, and most cities would not give a 100% refund in order to ensure that owners of those properties have let them.  The owner must prove that he or she has been trying to let his or her business but for some reason cannot do that.  Usually, in the very large urban areas, a full refund would not be given because one is trying to encourage the owners to make use of the building by getting a business back into it and getting footfall back onto the high street.</p></speech>

One of those could be the Patrick Street urban renewal-type concept.  Subject to that legislation getting through, we will then have to make regulation to work out how that will actually work in practice.  It is trying to provide a mechanism through which the local authorities objectives in some areas, be it regeneration or otherwise, and other activities for levying rates can be married together in a more coherent way, in order to give local authorities more flexibility.</p></speech>

We want the flexibility to operate on the ground and to be able to respond to exactly these types of issues.  We have used various schemes at various times to enable vacant property to be brought back into use by working with them and providing local grants through councils, which almost subsidises the rates over a period of time in order to get buildings back into use.  The fact that the legislation is starting to come is critically important.</p></speech>

In Meath, 75% of our rate payers are small to medium businesses.  The multinationals pay a high percentage of the actual rate take, but represent a small number of our account holders.

Utilities and goods have to be paid for as businesses cannot operate without them.  The level of rate collection is pretty high, which I believe is down to each individual local authority working with local businesses.

The Deputy will see this on its website when I get her the link.  The commission has carried out things like satisfaction surveys to understand what do members of the public actually think of the service they are getting from their local authority.  It has undertaken reviews of the audit reports that go to the members of the local authorities.  It produces the annual performance indicators reports across a whole range of areas of activity.  It did a review of housing management and maintenance and engaged with a lot of tenants.</p></speech>

I have talked about the issues around internal audit.  It is on our radar too, to make sure that we keep an eye on that as to how that is being addressed within local authorities and to make sure it is addressed at a practical level.</p> <p>  One of the other reports, for example, a review on local authority housing management and maintenance, gave us important information on what was actually happening in terms of investing in the maintenance and management of the asset that was being publicly funded.

The open libraries initiative, and I am sure the Deputy will come back to this again with one of my colleagues whenever they are in, was not really around dispensing with staff within the library service.  It was to try to provide a more open and flexible resource that would be available.  I think we actually had data at the time and, again, I confess now I am speaking historically.  I do recall data, at the time, that even after the introduction of the open library initiative we actually had more staff working in libraries than before.</p></speech>

I am reading from the end of page 19 of the appropriation accounts.  I have asked several times about the audit falling under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When Irish Water was set up, the intention was different from what it is now.  What is the current position in that regard?</p></speech>

We also discussed this with Deputy MacSharry earlier.  The question of a potential role for the Comptroller and Auditor General in the audit of Irish Water arose in, I believe, late 2017 when legislation was before another committee.  The Minister indicated that he was amenable to having that possibility explored.  One of the questions asked this morning was about the issues that had cropped up as part of that exercise.  I will mention a couple of them.  First, Irish Water is established as a company under the Companies Acts.</p><p>That legislation requires audit by a statutory auditor and the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a statutory auditor for that purpose.  That raises the prospect of there being two audits.</p></speech>

The following is not completely related, but as development contributions came in, it was determined in the context of the overall Government debt that some of the money had to be held on deposit.  One could only spend what was coming in that year.  Is that still the case?</p></speech>

The issue has to be managed from a general Government balance perspective.  I am not sure it has been a significant issue in terms of the actual spend in the more recent past.</p></speech>

However, in the current climate private development has increased significantly, as have development levies.  There are strict criteria in determining on what they can be spent and the time limit involved.  It may affect us in the next year or two and we may need to engage with the Department on the general borrowing requirement and the restrictions it might impose on us.  Currently, it is probably not an issue, but I suspect it will become one.</p></speech>

One tends to find that the areas where there is rapid population growth are also in the main the areas with a low baseline.  There will be the additional questions, but I wanted to ask about the baselines.  When I listened on the monitor earlier, I heard that body of work was ongoing.  Local government budgets start to be worked out in August and are concluded in September.  Is the change likely to happen before the local government budgets are set this year?</p></speech>

In terms of timing, 30 September is the date by which local authorities must make their decisions on variations to local property tax rates, while decisions on budgets generally extend from October into November or, in some cases, December.  However, I suspect it will be finished before then.</p></speech>

The basis for the distribution of the fund, albeit there have been some changes, is the needs and resources model.  There is no factoring in of increases in population.  By my reckoning, in the main, it is based on what happened previously.  That means we are using the population in 1996 as the determining factor in the provision of services in any given area.  Does Mr. McCarthy agree?</p></speech>

By virtue of this fact, the local property tax base is stronger, albeit only 80% is retained locally, while 20% goes into the equalisation fund.  Going back to the needs and resources issue-----</p></speech>

I am familiar with what happened at that time.  In the needs and resources model what a local authority had at a point in time was counted and it was resourced.  If it had six swimming pools, one received funding to ensure it could continue to have six swimming pools.  If it did not have any swimming pool, it was not factored in as a need.  That was the basis of the model.  It was a snapshot in time, albeit across a range of metrics.  If the population was static, it was prior to 2000, around the time the needs and resources model-----</p></speech>

It would have taken changes into account.</p></speech>

There were changes and an elaborate gathering of information in order to make them.  However, it did not fundamentally shift things like staffing and capital funding backed up for libraries and so on.  It did not change very much.  I take as an example County Meath and use the 1996 population figures, the ones I have in front of me.  In 1996 Meath County Council had a staff of 645.  In the same year Kerry County Council had a staff of 1,080.  Even though there were 50,000 more people living in County Meath, Meath County Council had 300 fewer staff.  It does not take a genius to figure out that services are poorer in a county the population of which is growing more rapidly.  That has been the profile.</p></speech>

In some local authority areas the population may be smaller but the geography could be more challenging.  There are other things that also come into play.</p></speech>

It is a much more precarious situation.</p><p> There are whole areas of Fingal, such as Ongar and Tyrrelstown, that did not exist when the needs and resources assessment of fiscal equalisation was modelled.  How can one possibly count the services that are required in these areas?</p><p> I am looking at the gross expenditure in terms of a fair distribution of resources.  I am using the 2016 figures to comment on the gross expenditure of local authorities.  One cannot spend what one has not got, but I refer to counties, such as the ones that have been used in the analysis that I have seen, namely, counties Mayo and Wicklow, in describing how the local property tax works.  One finds the gross expenditure tracks the same, that is, one will find areas that are quite large net contributors in terms of local property tax that have a lower gross expenditure and a higher population than other areas.  If one were to land from Mars and look at this, one would say there was something very strange and that it would not be possible to do that review without a sizeable amount of additional money if it was to be a fair review for those rapidly developing areas.  I apologise; I am having a rant.  I admit it drives me absolutely bananas to see the impact this is having on local property tax where counties that are net contributors are adjacent to counties that are net recipients.  There is a perception of that area being poorer when in actual fact it is probably better off in terms of library opening hours, swimming pools or greater ability to engage with people on the investment that is needed.  I hope there will be a sizeable change in that but I am not holding my breath, having waited for 20 years.</p><p> My final question is on the Housing Agency and relates to the revolving acquisitions fund.

It actually made up a significantly bigger chunk in 2016 than it did in 2009, for example, and the big difference is the general purpose grant had shrunk and local property tax came in as a lower contribution to it.  Is that a fair reading?</p></speech>

The proportionate share of rates in the revenue funding of local authorities, certainly from 2014 to 2017, has actually come back slightly.  It was 36% in 2014 and was 33% in 2017.  In fact the actual quantum, if one looks at the revenue income from rates, has largely stayed static.  According to the accounts the yield from rates would have been exactly &euro;1.5 billion in 2014.  In 2017, the figure had dropped to &euro;1.476 billion.</p></speech>

We can see that Sligo has a massive deficit, whereas the local authorities in Dublin and Cork have built up funds.  It is great to see all this information.  </p> <p>  When the Department comes to talk to the local authorities, does it deal specifically with the collection of rates, rents, and so on?

We sat down and collectively worked through a target for increased rates collection across the local government sector.</p><p>In the first two years of that exercise, the target was exceeded.

One issue is that of local authority land debt.  We made a number of interventions in that space in 2009 and 2010 to assist local authorities.  Subsequently, we no longer had the resources to do that.  We are now back in that space.  As the social housing programme is building up, we are finding a vehicle to address some of those issues.  In a number of local authorities, a significant land debt still remains.  We need to work with them on finding ways to look beyond just using those lands for housing, for example, using some of the other funds like the urban regeneration fund to pull together a pool of resources that can unlock those lands and deal with the debt issue.</p></speech>

An exercise of engagement with the AHB sector was completed in recent weeks and, from memory, a further 17 or 18 sites are about to move into the social housing programme.  Everyone accepts that some of the lands were bought with an eye to the longer term.  Those will not come into development for the next five years but may do so afterwards.  We have all the local authority lands for residential development mapped on the Rebuilding Ireland website, so we can see where they all are.  We have a good picture on the extent to which some local authorities have landbanks for immediate and longer term development versus those that may have certain land issues in areas.  That forms part of the factors influencing some local authorities to take advantage of turnkey opportunities in areas where they do not have land.</p></speech>

I will ask a few straightforward questions about the Department's accounts as I go through this document.  In the year under review, the Department did not go through the proper procurement process in respect of &euro;145,000 for temporary security measures around the hoarding erected at the Custom House.  I could understand there being temporary measures for the first few weeks or months where the OPW had erected something because it was doing a job, but that is a large figure.  Was the Department unable to go through a tendering process?  I am on the bottom of page 4 of the appropriation accounts.  Why is the figure so high?

Priory Hall was done in a number of phases.  Blocks 1 to 8 were done initially and we then moved on to the remaining blocks.  That accounted for a significant part of the difference between the two figures.  The earlier phase of Priory Hall was a difficult one, with a great deal of learning around fire safety, pyrite and other issues.  It was useful learning, though.  When it came to phase 2, and going by memory, the unit cost was quite a bit lower.</p></speech>

The regulator that is now being established is a response to the Mahon tribunal and it is provide independence of oversight and advice to the Minister in relation to things like zoning decisions and whether the Minister should exercise his power of intervention in relation to development plans and related issues.  It is very much at the more macro level rather than the micro level.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la deals with individual projects and decides whether they should get planning permission.</p></speech>

I am more than familiar with the process.  Some of the names Mr. McCarthy just mentioned would have discussed the issue with the Minister.  A formal structure is being put in place.  Up to now the Department was doing it.  A previous Oireachtas committee made recommendations.  Ministerial direction hit local authorities out of the blue.  Eventually, the matter was discussed in an Oireachtas committee.  Subsequently, Mayo County Council was also subject to the process and the lack of consultation was highlighted.  The process has improved now.  The Minister outlines his intention and the local authority has an opportunity to respond.  There is a bit more common sense involved.</p></speech>

The situation has improved.</p> <p>  My final question relates to planning policy.  The estimated spend was approximately &euro;500,000 and there is quite a bit of underspend.  That was mainly due to the fact that anticipated expenditure to carry out the strategic environmental assessment of the wind energy development guidelines was not required in 2017.  A lot of people are waiting for the guidelines.  Are they finished?  I hear they are imminent.  This was for 2017, so obviously in 2016 it was expected that this would be done soon.  Is that job done yet, or published?</p></speech>

In 2006 a big wind turbine was 30 m high, now they are 186 m high.  They bear zero relationship to turbines that have been going through the planning process in respect to the guidelines that local authorities are obliged to use.  Somebody in the Department has not been fair to either the communities or the local authorities, expecting them to use guidelines for wind energy generation that are out of date given the advances in technology.  I do not comment on what the guidelines will contain, for better or worse, but it will give some certainty to local authorities, those who are making applications and people who are opposed to developments.  People need certainty.  Could Mr. McCarthy send a detailed note on the timetable?  When did the WHO guidelines come into play?</p></speech>

The committee was supplied with a detailed briefing document on the various Votes in advance of this meeting.  I will outline the work of my Department and its proposed 2019 Estimate as well as the proposed 2019 Estimate for the President's Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in these offices, they operate independently of my Department.  My colleague, the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, will outline the 2019 Estimate allocations for the CSO and will take any questions relevant to that Vote following the committee's consideration of the other Votes in my Vote group.  I am joined today by Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Denis Breen, head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.</p> <p>  The Estimate for Vote 1, the President's Establishment, for 2019 is &euro;4.43 million.  That includes &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance of funding for the centenarian's bounty.  The 2019 revised Estimate for Vote 2, the Department of An Taoiseach, is &euro;35.26 million, which includes &euro;22.52 million for staff and administration costs.  The primary role of my Department is to support me in Executive functions as Taoiseach, to support the Government and to oversee the implementation of the programme for Government.  It also supports four Ministers of State who are assigned to the Department.  These are the Government Chief Whip and the Ministers of State with responsibility for defence, for European affairs and for data protection.  The latter is also assigned to a number of other Departments.  </p> <p>  In addition to assisting my work as Taoiseach and that of the Government, the Department's strategic priorities are as follows: building a sustainable economy; building a better and fairer society; building strong relationships in Europe and the rest of the world; Brexit; and future planning.  The Department is also responsible for a range of other issues such as State protocol, including, for example, the Papal visit last August, national commemorations and the organisation of the Presidential inauguration ceremony and State reception last November.  The Department also engages in the formulation and implementation of Government policy and advises me on the full range of domestic policy issues and on international affairs.  An important part of my Department's work is providing a secretariat for meetings of the Government and Cabinet committees.  The Department also funds a number of inquiries, including the Moriarty tribunal and the Cregan and Cooke commissions.  Other areas of responsibility include constitutional issues, relations with the office of the President, relations with the Oireachtas, the Government Information Service, GIS, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the Policing Reform Implementation Programme Office, the Citizens' Assembly and the Dublin North East Inner City initiative.  </p> <p>  Last year the Government published Project Ireland 2040 which for the first time ever links a national spatial plan with a national development and infrastructure investment plan.  It gives us a framework for future development that will enable us to grow over the next 20 years in a manner that provides for better and sustainable regional balance, less commuting and greater vibrancy in our villages, towns, cities and rural areas.  Ireland continues to experience sustainable and balanced economic growth.  Employment continues to rise and now stands at just under 2.3 million, a record high.  Unemployment was down to 5.7% in January, the lowest since August 2008.  The Government&rsquo;s focus now is on achieving full employment, that is, a job for everyone who wants one and on ensuring that the jobs created are quality jobs.  By this I mean jobs that raise living standards, reward employees and provide for protections and pensions.  Quality jobs must go beyond salary and include good working conditions and benefits, including pension coverage on retirement.  Last year, alongside the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Finance, Deputies Regina Doherty and Donohoe, I published a five year roadmap for pension reform, including the introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for private sector workers, with first enrolments taking place in 2022.  A wide ranging public consultation has been completed and the Government will shortly make decisions on the next steps.</p> <p>  The enactment of the Technological Universities Act means our focus is now on working with the various consortia to get these new technological universities up and running.  Project Ireland commits the Government&rsquo;s financial resources to the development of technological universities, with a particular focus on the establishment of a technological university in the south east where there is currently no university.  </p> <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, &euro;21.8 billion is committed to the objective of transitioning to a low-carbon and climate resilient society.  This is the highest amount allocated to any of the ten national strategic objectives of the plan.  We have strengthened existing measures such as retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency.  We have also made major decisions such as the banning of the registration of any new non-zero emission cars from 2030 onwards and taking coal off the national grid by 2025 and replacing its use at Moneypoint with a cleaner alternative.</p><p>It is important to Government that gains from the growing economy and prosperity are shared fairly with all Irish citizens and felt in all parts of the country.  We want to create a society in which there is true equality of opportunity and where nobody feels left behind.  The Department supports the work of shaping and reforming public services, especially those requiring a cross-Government response, through the Cabinet committee structures.</p><p> Over the recent period, Government has introduced reforms that seek to improve lives and living standards.  To ensure the youngest in society are provided with the best possible start in life and afforded every opportunity to grow into engaged and active citizens, the Government launched First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families.  This is very much led by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs but is a cross-Government strategy.  The aim is to assist families and babies at this critical juncture in their lives, create a well-functioning early childhood system and broaden the range of options for parents to balance working and caring.  As part of this, Government announced an additional two weeks paid parental leave in the first year of a child's life to take effect from November.  Government has also made significant progress in delivering the affordable childcare scheme.  The scheme&rsquo;s primary legislation, the Childcare Support Act 2018, has been enacted with work on regulations, policy guidelines and IT systems ongoing. </p><p> During 2018, a set of actions to improve gender equality were advanced, including efforts to reduce the gender pay gap, promote wage transparency and increase women's membership on State and corporate boards.  The Government approved a General Scheme of the Gender Pay Gap (Wage Transparency) Bill.  The Bill will promote wage transparency by requiring companies to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results showing the gender pay gaps.</p><p> Work on the north-east inner city initiative continues with the programme implementation board, which is assisted by my Department, meeting on a monthly basis to oversee and progress the implementation of the 54 actions set out in the Mulvey report.  The board recently published its 2018 annual progress report, which highlights some notable achievements, including new garda&iacute; assigned to the area, refurbishment works of the Lourdes day care centre and the P-TECH initiative in three second level schools to link industry and education through mentorships and internships.  The board's aims for 2019 include initiatives to improve supports for families affected by addiction and drug-related intimidation, to build on relationships with local businesses and employers to create sustainable employment and improvements to the physical environment to make the area a better place to live and work.</p><p> A new initiative, Better Balance for Better Business, was announced in 2018 to increase women's representation in governance and senior management positions in the private sector.  In June 2018, the Government published the world&rsquo;s first LGBTI+ youth strategy, which aims to create a safe, supportive and inclusive environment for LGBTI+ young people.  A youth advisory group was created to ensure that young people were at the heart of the strategic planning process with input from almost 4,000 young people.</p><p> Housing and homelessness continue to be among the greatest challenges we are facing as a Government and society.  Increasing the supply of housing of all forms is our focus.  In 2018, 21,450 new homes became available to live in, of which 18,072 were new dwellings.  This is encouraging considering that in 2012, housing output was at less than 9,000 and most of that consisted of one-off houses in rural houses.  Progress has been made but it is evident that much more needs to be done.  We need to increase this to 25,000 units this year, which is our target.  In August 2018, the Government published our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, which sets out a vision for the future of healthcare over a ten-year period.</p><p> My Department supports me in an extensive programme of international engagement to advance Ireland's strategic interests both within and beyond the EU.  In June 2018, we launched Global Ireland 2025, a strategic initiative to double the scope and impact of Ireland's global footprint by 2025.  This is the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland's international presence ever undertaken in terms of diplomacy, culture, business, official development assistance, tourism and trade.  We have made considerable progress in implementing the Global Ireland strategy.  In 2018, Ireland opened a new embassy in Wellington and a new consulate in Vancouver.  Throughout 2019, we will open six new embassies and four new consulates.  We will also strengthen existing missions and expand our international State agency presence.  This increased engagement and presence internationally will enable our Departments and agencies to take on more ambitious targets during the coming years.  Also in 2018, the Government launched Ireland's campaign for election to a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term.  Our candidature reflects Ireland's continuing engagement on issues of international importance and the centrality of the UN to our foreign policy.  </p><p> Earlier today, alongside the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, I was pleased to launch the Government's new policy for international development entitled A Better World.  This policy sets out the context in which we will increase our official development assistance, ODA, over the coming years and the priorities we will focus on.  The policy restates the Government&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to increasing ODA to 0.7% of national income by 2030.  It highlights that Ireland's international development policy will focus on gender equality, reducing humanitarian need, climate action, strengthened governance and the pledge of the sustainable development goals to leave nobody behind and to reach the furthest behind first.</p><p> At EU level, Ireland is also actively engaged in the debate on the future of Europe where we have highlighted the need for an ambitious and forward-looking agenda.  EU leaders will discuss this further at our informal summit meeting in Sibiu in Romania on 9 May ahead of agreeing a new strategic agenda for the period ahead at the June European Council.  The EU is the common European home we have helped to build.  As a small country, our experience regarding Brexit has only served to reinforce our commitment to EU membership.  Ahead of the summit in Sibiu, it is intended that the Government will publish a statement on Ireland's perspectives on the future of Europe, which will be informed by last year's citizens' dialogue led by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, as well as the Oireachtas engagement that will take place in the coming weeks.</p><p> The withdrawal agreement agreed last November reflects the Irish Government's priorities in the negotiations on Brexit.  These are to protect peace and the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure the continuation of the common travel area in all circumstances.  It sets out arrangements required to avoid a hard border on this island in light of the UK Government's own red lines and our need to protect the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union - our Single Market and our customs union.  Since the vote in June 2016, we have been very conscious of the need to ensure that the rights and citizenship protections currently available to all the people of Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement are not undermined by the UK's withdrawal.  The deal that is on the table contains a commitment from the UK that Brexit will not result in any diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a firm undertaking made in a legally binding international agreement.  </p><p> One of the most striking things about what has unfolded since the UK's decision to leave has been the remarkable solidarity and unity on the EU side.  It has been strong and resolute.  Ireland's concerns on the Border have become EU concerns.  Our insistence on a legally binding and operable means to avoid a hard border has become an EU insistence.  In my recent contacts with the Presidents of the EU institutions last week - Presidents Tusk, Juncker and Tajani - I was again assured in the strongest terms that the EU stands by the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and the backstop therein.  </p><p> Unfortunately, the political situation in the UK and the rejection of the agreement by Westminster means that the terms on which the UK will depart are unclear.  The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.  Augmenting the ongoing work of my Department's international, EU and Northern Ireland division on Brexit is the Brexit preparedness and contingency planning unit, which assists the Secretaries General group overseeing ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  The unit works closely with other divisions in my Department, including the economic division, and with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has overall responsibility for Brexit.  The work led by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has overseen the detailed preparations for the negotiations at EU level, engagement with the administrations in Belfast and London and the co-ordination of planning around the economic impacts of Brexit.  Across Government, relevant Departments, agencies and overseas missions have also been further strengthened to deal with Brexit.  Preparation and planning for a range of Brexit scenarios, including contingency planning, was initiated well in advance of the UK referendum.  Over the past 18 months, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade has led efforts to deepen and intensify this planning.</p><p>The whole-of-Government response to Brexit is underpinned by a comprehensive set of Government structures, which ensure that all Departments and their agencies are engaging in detailed preparedness and planning, including through the development of sectoral action plans.</p><p> While the Government and the EU are committed to securing a negotiated outcome, that has not yet been achieved and we are now 29 days away from the UK's withdrawal from the Union.  Government therefore considers that preparations for a no-deal outcome must be intensified as the risk of a no-deal Brexit increases day by day, posing unique and unprecedented challenges.  The unprecedented risks associated with the departure of the UK from the EU featured strongly in the 2018 National Risk Assessment &ndash; Overview of Strategic Risks, published by my Department in August last.  Among the geopolitical, social, economic and environmental risks identified were new risks associated with the impact of social media on public debate and elections and the risk of an overheating in the economy.  Brexit brings great uncertainty and risks which require steady and strategic management in both our policies and relationships.  We must continue to manage the public finances and protect the economy and seek new opportunities to diversify and grow.</p><p> Technological developments are transforming lives and driving change in every corner of the world and it is essential that Ireland should be at the forefront of these developments and engage with emerging issues.  For this reason, my Department organised the data summit in September 2018 to demonstrate Ireland's leadership in digital and data.  The summit brought together stakeholders from across the world to discuss emerging issues such as the ongoing implementation of the GDPR and the implications of artificial intelligence for society.  Preparations for a similar event in 2019 are under way.</p><p> An advisory group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, is developing a vision and roadmap for the Grand Canal innovation district.  The advisory group will submit a report to the Government in the second quarter of 2019.  It will have a particular focus on strengthening links between existing multinational companies in the area, small and medium enterprises and start-ups and academic and research institutions to build a better innovation ecosystem.  The Department, in conjunction with others, is also leading the development of a new overarching national digital strategy. The strategy will set out Ireland's vision and ambition to help Ireland to maximise the economic and societal benefits from ongoing digitalisation and its transformative effects.</p><p> My Department also assists the National Economic and Social Council in providing forward-looking, strategic advice on economic, social and sustainable development issues.  The current NESC work programme includes housing and land - transport-led development and housing policy; social insurance and the welfare system; and towards a sustainable developmental welfare state and climate change and low-carbon transition.  The Secretary General and an assistant secretary from my Department serve as chair and deputy chair, respectively.</p><p> Vote 3 is the Vote of the Office of the Attorney General.  The 2019 Revised Estimate for the office is &euro;15.59 million.  The majority of administrative expenditure relates to staff salaries, which will cost just under &euro;12 million in 2019.  The next largest expenditure item is the grant of almost &euro;2.3 million to the Law Reform Commission.</p><p> Vote 4 relates to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  As I mentioned, the Chief Whip will present the 2019 Revised Estimate for the CSO to the committee.</p><p> Vote 5 is Vote of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The 2019 Revised Estimate for the office is &euro;42.8 million.  The Estimate for 2019 represents a decrease of 2% on the 2018 Estimate.  This principal reason for this decrease is a reduction of &euro;1.54 million in input A3 &ndash; fees to counsel.  This is partially offset by an increase of &euro;540,000 in the provision made in subhead A5, for the local State solicitor service.</p><p> Vote 6 is the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The 2019 Revised Estimate for the office is just over &euro;34.6 million.  Salaries, wages and allowances account for just over &euro;18 million out of a total administrative budget of &euro;20.5 million.  The remaining &euro;2.4 million is attributable to the general running costs of the office.  A provision of &euro;15.8 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred, of which &euro;13.5 million is for counsel fees and &euro;1.3 million for general law expenses, which includes expert witnesses and stenographers.  The balance is for use of external solicitors.</p></speech>

In addition, in terms of divisions and business units, the Government Information Service, GIS, has 16 staff and the corporate affairs unit has 32 staff.  In terms of the discussions we have had over the past year and a half about the Government's messaging, one of the Taoiseach's innovations on taking office was to have common Government messaging and a common banner on all Government messaging under <i>mygov.ie</i>.  The Taoiseach stated recently in the D&aacute;il that he is transferring this function to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  His Department still has a significant number of staff dealing with public relations, messaging, etc.  What do these staff do now that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform taken control of the spin unit and <i>mygov.ie</i>?</p><p>The Taoiseach spoke at length about housing and is obviously concerned about the issue.  What I do not understand, and this applies to all constituencies, not only the constituency I share with the Taoiseach, is that the figures published today show that significant numbers of children are in long-term homelessness.  As with long-term unemployment among young people, particularly young men, homelessness among young children is very damaging.  When children do not have a place to call their own for a protracted period, which is generally considered to be more than six months, the damage done to them can be severe.  What does the Taoiseach do to have himself briefed on the crisis, particularly affecting children living in homelessness with one or both parents?</p><p>The Taoiseach has said on many occasions in the D&aacute;il that he does not like the style of Cabinet sub-committees where detailed papers from various Departments or institutions are discussed.  I accept that his style and preference is to discuss everything at the full Cabinet with his colleagues around the table.  That is a fair choice.  Who in government now examines and audits the many detailed reports that are available on the devastating impact of homelessness, in particular, on children?  I note the paper appears to have a target of building 25,000 houses per annum.</p><p>As 18,000 of these were new dwellings, I presume the others are boarded-up houses that are being brought back into use.  The Taoiseach might clarify the position in that regard.  All housing experts have suggested that for the next five years, as a result of the backlog and the base from which the country is coming, we would need to increase the number to approximately 35,000.</p><p> The Taoiseach, as head of his Department, has stated that he has overall responsibility for social advancement, for people's well-being and for the headings he read out.  How does he address those matters?  Who now discusses and examines the detailed briefings on a range of issues that are provided from a variety of sources?  Those issues used to be discussed, possibly at excessive length, by Cabinet sub-committees.  In my experience, the time for detailed discussion in Cabinet is relatively short.  No one has suggested that this Cabinet sits for very long.  The general understanding is that the meetings are brisk enough, as we would probably expect.  Where does that discussion now take place?</p><p> It would also point to questions regarding what is happening with the children's hospital.  In the context of the Cabinet, which is the Taoiseach's responsibility, there no longer seems to be a space for those issues to be discussed in detail.  I presume there must have been some warnings that not everything was right with the cost structure and the progress on the children's hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.1353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022800002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  The first one relates to tribunals.  I imagine she is including commissions of investigation in that because the Moriarty tribunal is the only tribunal extant under my Department.  It is never possible to know what the final cost will be because it will depend on third-party legal fees and many other things.  When it ends will depend on how long it takes for it to do its work.  To give some approximate figures, the spend to date on the Moriarty tribunal has been &euro;65 million.  Our best estimate - it is only an estimate - is that it will top out at approximately &euro;75 million, depending on further legal cost awards.</p> <p>  The spend to date on the Cregan commission, which is the Siteserv-IBRC commission, has been &euro;7 million.  However, we anticipate that the final cost could be as much as &euro;30 million and it is difficult to say when the commission will end.  I sought an interim report but have not received it as yet.</p> <p>  The spend to date on the Cooke commission, which is investigating NAMA and the allegations about Project Eagle, is &euro;2 million and it is estimated that it will top out at approximately &euro;10 million.  Again these are just estimates.</p> <p>  On the 20 politically appointed staff, I know we have discussed this previously-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.1354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022800002#D00300"><p>I wish to raise a point.  The Taoiseach anticipates costs of well over &euro;100 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.1355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022800002#D00400"><p>Yes.  Again this is something we should all bear in mind.  Not a week goes by that an Opposition spokesperson or leader does not call for an inquiry, commission of investigation or tribunal to investigate something.  While they may well be merited, we need to bear in mind the time they take and the fact that they often do not give people the answers they want or need and that they cost the taxpayer a considerable amount of money.  We all need to bear that in mind in our demands for further inquiries, commissions and tribunals in the future.</p><p>The Deputy asked about the 20 politically appointed staff.  They, of course, are for the entire Department and not just for me.  They include civilian drivers for the Ministers of State and constituency staff and staff for the Ministers of State and also for staff for the Independents.  From answers given in the Chamber people will know the amount spent on politically appointed staff by me, as Taoiseach, is less than my last three forebears holding the office.  I intend to keep it at that notwithstanding increments, pay rises and all the rest of it that cause it to edge up bit by bit every year.</p><p>While I may be wrong, I believe <i>mygov.ie</i>has always come under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It never fell under the remit of my Department.  It is headed up by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.  The only role my Department had with <i>mygov.ie </i>and <i>gov.ie</i>was that mine was the first Department to embrace it and transition its website over to it.  However, we never ran the project; that is being run from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The GIS has a press function.  It provides a press office, takes queries from journalists, organises press conferences, organises events and launches, and, obviously, is responsible for <i>merrionstreet.ie</i>, which is the Government news website set up 15 or 20 years ago.  We have really reverted to the previous model with campaigns - where they happen - generally being run from outside the Department from the line Department with a degree of co-ordination from my Department.  I still take the view that it would work better were it centralised, but it became such an area of political controversy and distraction that we took the decision to wind it down.  As I think Deputies will acknowledge, all the inquiries since have found that the vast majority of charges and allegations made were without foundation, but that is all history now.</p><p>On housing and homelessness, of course the figures for those in emergency accommodation were published yesterday, which, again, are bad and very disappointing for all of us struggling to deal with the issue but, most of all, for the people who are affected by it and who are forced to live in emergency accommodation.  On the positive side, to the extent that there is a positive side, it shows that the number of families in emergency accommodation is down to its lowest for a year.  The number of families in hotels is also down as we move more towards the use of family hubs.  However, there is nothing to celebrate in any of that.  The figures seem to be stabilising at around 10,000.  That is where they have been for the best part of a year, but that is not good enough.  In the next couple of months, I want to turn the corner and start to see those figures reducing rather than stabilising.  That is definitely where we want to be in the next few weeks.</p><p>I do not have the figures for length of stay in emergency accommodation.  I am advised that the average length of stay for a family in emergency accommodation is approximately six months.  I take the Deputy's point about the long-term psychological impact that stays longer than that can have on children.  However, in some cases where it is longer than six months one will find that offers of accommodation have been made but have not been accepted.  That is also part of the mix that we need to bear in mind.</p><p>As the Deputy can imagine, I receive many briefings on housing.  I have a big one on my desk for a trilateral meeting with the Ministers for Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government, and their officials and advisers.  We discuss these things in different formats: sometimes at full Cabinet; sometimes at Cabinet sub-committee; and sometimes at a meeting of the three or four key Ministers, which I find to be quite useful.  Cabinet sub-committees have their value but they involve 50 or 60 people.  Sometimes a meeting of seven or eight can be more productive.  Those of us who spend a considerable amount of time at meetings will understand why that will be.  All formats are used and it depends on which is the most appropriate.</p><p>I also receive briefings from the CEOs of the major NGOs working in the homelessness and housing sectors.  I have been involved in round-table meetings on two occasions with all the CEOs from Simon, the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland.  I had a very good one a few weeks ago and will follow that up again later in the year.  I get briefings, of course, directly from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  NESC, which comes under my remit, has done some really good work on land use and housing.  I would have been briefed directly by NESC on that.  Obviously, one of my political advisers also follows housing and looks at a considerable amount of the reports and research that exists.</p><p>Housing and homelessness are two issues in respect of which we make good use of the Cabinet sub-committee system precisely because they relate to a few Departments.  I think the last Cabinet sub-committee meeting on infrastructure and housing was last week or the previous week.  At that meeting, we particularly examined the inter-agency report on homelessness because that requires a response.  We all know that homelessness is about much more than housing.  Dealing with homelessness requires a response from the Departments of Health, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Finance, and Justice and Equality in respect of immigration.  There is a big focus on that with the last Cabinet sub-committee really putting pressure on the other Departments to do their bit and understand that housing is not just a problem for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As there are immigration issues, the Department of Justice and Equality needs to be on board.</p><p>We do not know the exact figure but approximately 20% to 30% of people who are in emergency accommodation are non-EU citizens.  Some of them may not have a right to be here.  There are also issues around addiction and mental health.  Lifting people out of homelessness requires action from the Department of Health, particularly when it comes to issues around better addiction and mental health services.  We have had a detailed discussed around that issue and what we are going to do with the Simon Community, in particular, in responding to some of its requests.  There are also issues around social protection.  The Cabinet committee system is used, where appropriate.  It is often equally appropriate to have discussions with the full Cabinet.  In fact, we took that memo from the Cabinet sub-committee to the full Cabinet this week.  In addition, I meet Ministers on a one-to-one basis and on a trilateral basis, which I find quite useful.  </p><p> On housing supply, the Deputy is right that the target is 35,000 new homes annually.  We want to move away from what we had in the past in terms of the provision of 80,000 homes one year and 10,000 the next year.  We want to achieve a steady stream of approximately 35,000 per annum but we are also realistic that we can only ramp up at a certain pace.  There are limiting factors.  Approximately 20,000 new homes and apartments were built last year.  In regard to the Deputy's request for me to expand on those data, that total includes ghost estates being finished and voids being brought back into use.  Approximately 19,000 new homes and apartments were built last year.  The target for this year is 25,000, with a view to getting to 35,000 but we are being practical, honest and realistic about how quickly we can ramp up housing construction in a sustainable way.  Even though the number of houses built last year was greater that in any other year this decade, we think a reasonable target is 25,000 this year, 30,000 next year and 35,000 the following year.</p></speech>

For example, he referred to one of the causes for homelessness being that people refuse offers.  Another cause was that 27% of people are international people who have come to Ireland.  The figure of 27% is relatively low in terms of the number of international people who have come to Ireland in the past.  The third cause cited was addiction.  I asked the Taoiseach about children in homelessness.  I recognise that a lot of people who are homeless have problems.  As far as I am aware, the people who sleep rough and have serious mental and, possibly, addiction problems are not included in the housing statistics published this morning.  As with women in refuges, they are taken account of but they are not actually, as far as I am aware, included in the figures published this morning.  According to the Taoiseach, everything is the fault of people who are homeless but the real cause is the serious breakdown in our housing provision structure, which is worsening.  </p> <p>  I am glad the Taoiseach responded to my question regarding the 35,000 target.  Is there a Government plan to increase output from 25,000 to 35,000, which is what we need to do if we are to catch up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.1358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022800002#E00300"><p>I would respectfully ask the Deputy not to put words in my mouth.  This is too important an issue to play politics with.  The cause of homelessness and the housing crisis is a lack of supply of housing and a lack of affordable housing but there are plenty of other factors involved as well.  Those of us who are interested in this area and have spent time visiting facilities and NGOs will understand that there are other factors at play as well.  As the Deputy mentioned, for many of those who are rough sleeping mental health and addiction are at play.  There are lots of people who, thankfully, are in shelters and emergency accommodation, who also have problems with addiction and mental health.  For this reason, just providing housing is not enough.  We are trying to adopt a holistic approach, particularly under the banner of Housing First, which is providing shelter and housing, as well as the additional supports that are needed to help people maintain tenancies and not fall back into homelessness.  These are the things we need to do, and are doing, around mental health and addiction supports.  We are working with Simon in this area, which is a splendid NGO in the work it does in terms of ensuring people discharged from hospitals do not end up in homelessness.  There are other initiatives around addiction in particular on which we propose to work with Simon into the future.  Dealing with homelessness requires a holistic approach.  It cannot be resolved by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government alone.  We could build 40,000 or 50,000 houses in a couple of years' time and still have homelessness because it is a social problem as well as one that is related to the number of roofs in the country.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that the rough sleepers are not included in the statistics published today, nor are people who are in domestic refuges but people who do not have an entitlement and people who have turned down offers of housing are included.  The figures will never be exact.  I do not like to get involved in statistical debate.  No matter what the correct figure is, there are too many people in emergency accommodation and we need to change that. </p></speech>

I will concentrate on a few key issues, in particular, the primary role of the Taoiseach's Department, which is to support him in his executive functions as Taoiseach, to support the Government and to oversee the implementation of the programme for Government.  Allied to this are the key strategic priorities of the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure that happens.  In terms of progress and efforts around relationships with Europe and the wider world and in regard to Brexit, in respect of which there is unanimity in the D&aacute;il in support of the Government's stance and efforts to ensure the least worst outcome emerges, we applaud and support all efforts in that regard.  We expect the Department's whole commitment to that effort and we support the provision of any funds required to ensure the least worst outcome.</p> <p>  I propose to focus on four issues.  I am conscious of the Taoiseach's role in implementing the programme for Government and his efforts in that regard while at the same time maintaining a sustainable economy and planning for the future.  The areas of critical importance in the public domain, in the context of the success of this Government's time in office, are health, housing, insurance and broadband.  Without getting into the debacle associated with the existing and potential further overrun in the Department of Health or by the board of the national children's hospital, the Taoiseach mentioned in an interview this morning that he found the whole episode scandalous.  What aspect of it specifically did he find scandalous?  That being the case, what actions are under way that will arrest the overrun and eradicate anything of that nature happening again and thus ensure value for money is achieved?  As has been said on many occasions, we all welcome the provision of a children's hospital and we want to ensure it is provided as quickly as possible but that does not mean we should not investigate forensically the contract provided in the first instance, how it was arrived at, whether it was porous because of the rush to get on site such that we are now being punished.  </p> <p>  In regard to housing, in the final paragraph on page 27 of the Revised Estimates it states that a new council was appointed in May 2017 and that its work programme up to September 2019 comprises three themes, one of which is housing and land, which is to be a transport-led development in housing policy.  How many times has this council met?</p><p> In the budget of October 2017 the Government set up the Land Development Agency.  I welcomed that and hoped it would be afforded the right legislation, authority and remit to implement policies that could help and assist in ensuring it made a difference.  Yesterday, I heard its chair, John Moran, say it had met for the second time recently.  I do not know when he was appointed but it was October 2017 that this agency was being put in place in the first instance.  In response to Se&aacute;n O'Rourke, when he was asked how it would help and assist in regard to the housing crisis, addressing the issue of homelessness and the huge and terrible figures associated with that, Mr. Moran said it was not necessarily his remit, job or role.  He was quickly reminded that it would not have been set up were there not a housing crisis.  Many councils throughout the country, unfortunately, do not necessarily have the capacity or the sort of professionalism and commitment to the provision of houses that they had previously.  With that in mind, this agency could have had a greater role in so far as it could have provided a vehicle for either public or private finance to engage private developers to build houses on State lands, and rent them to local authorities for 100 years, if necessary.</p><p> I am particularly conscious of credit unions and the role they can play.  The credit union in my county this week had &euro;285 million at its disposal; it has &euro;65 million out in loans so it can adequately cater for that; and it was laying off &euro;50 million this week and getting 0% return.  It does not have the capacity under present legislation or Central Bank rules to participate in a scheme such as this, when it is more than willing to do so and more than willing to get a return on it.  Any return would be far greater than 0%, and if it was only 2%, it would be 200% better than what it is getting at present.  I hear the Taoiseach ask what difference exists between us and the Government in regard to policies or what recommendations we are making.  That is a recommendation I made some time ago and I was given to believe we were moving in that direction, yet here we are, nearly two years later, and I do not see any progress in that area.  I would like the Taoiseach to respond on that also.</p><p> In regard to broadband, I am nervous that this too could end up like the children's hospital.  To date, &euro;22 million has been spent and not an inch of fibre optic cable is in the ground yet.  The Taoiseach said in response to a question in the D&aacute;il yesterday that he is afraid the cost might be many multiples of what was initially envisaged.  The national development plan provides for &euro;275 million this year.  If it is many multiples of that, when we will know how many multiples it is?  Will a decision be taken to share that information with us before the contract is signed or afterwards?  It it materialises to be many multiples, apart from the ability of the contract to deliver or the quality of it, what then happens with regard to the commitments in the national development plan?  We have yet to get much of the detail associated with the &euro;100 million that is to come off this year's spend in regard to capital development in the national development plan, let alone the spring statement that is to tell us what the story is for next year, given &euro;100 million-plus is to come off it for the next four years, in light of the commitments that have been made since the launch of Project Ireland 2040.  If this cost is many multiples of that, where do we stand and when will be put on notice as to what the consequences of that overspend is going to be in regard to the national development plan?</p><p> I want to raise the issue of insurance.  I am talking broadly because I acknowledge the detail that is contained with the Estimate and the spend within the Department of the Taoiseach.  As the Taoiseach said in his initial statement, the primary role of the Department is to support him in his functions as Taoiseach, which in turn supports the Government and oversees implementation of the programme for Government.  In regard to insurance, is it true to say the delay and procrastination in regard to the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is blocking the efforts of the Department of Justice and Equality to bring forward a judicial council which might assist in regard to the whole area of insurance, which is a major difficulty for business, unfortunately, and the ability to do business in many parts of the country.  Is that the case?  I would have thought the Department would be well able to multitask and that this legislation could be brought before the House in parallel with the other issue.</p><p> The Taoiseach answered questions in regard to Project Eagle and the cost associated with it.  I take the point he makes and it is well made, yet there is an interest and expectation on the part of the public, further to the recommendation of the D&aacute;il, to ensure that information in that regard could be brought back for adjudication on people's involvement in it, and so on.  That was to be ready last June and we are now told it will be reporting this June.</p></speech>

He asked me about my interview this morning on Newstalk.  I was asked if I found any aspect of the national children's hospital controversy scandalous, and I said that I did.  What I found to be scandalous was that some of our agents - agents employed by Government, albeit indirectly through the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board - underestimated the costs so significantly.  They did, and while I was not terribly surprised the hospital might turn out to cost more than we thought, I was really shocked that it was &euro;450 million more than we thought.  That was down to a number of factors, ranging from VAT to construction inflation, which nobody could have controlled, but the underestimate of some of the costs could have been foreseen and should have been foreseen earlier.  That is the element I said I found scandalous.  Obviously, as Head of Government, I take responsibility for that.  I cannot come in here and claim credit for the public finances being in balance, for full employment or for all of the aspects of the capital programme that are happening on time and on budget, whether Luas cross-city, the Gort-Tuam motorway, the schools programme or pretty much everything else for the past ten years, and then wash my hands of this.  I take responsibility, as Head of Government, for the fact people we employed and trusted to get their numbers right got them so enormously wrong.  That explains a significant chunk of the unanticipated higher cost of the children's hospital project.</p> <p>  As to what we are doing about it, first, the PwC analysis is being carried out to see what can be learned and also to see if there are ways that we can pare back the cost.  I am sceptical as to whether that will be possible but we have to leave no stone unturned in seeing if there are ways that we can pare back the cost of the project, provided it does not in any way result in downgrading, diminution or de-speccing of the project.  We had that before with new hospitals built 20 or 30 years ago, where corners were cut and phases were removed, and we spent 30 years adding all that back on at much greater expense.  I would only be in favour of cost-cutting if it did not diminish the value of the project in terms of healthcare and paediatric care.</p> <p>  The project is now very much under way.  It is something that has been promised for as long as I can remember.  It was first talked about in the 1960s, first called for by doctors in 1993 and it is now well under construction.  The first aspect of it, the satellite centre in Blanchardstown, will open to children this year, Tallaght next year and then the main campus at St. James's in 2023.  At long last this is being done, albeit at 50% more than we anticipated it would cost.</p> <p>  There are definitely lessons in terms of public procurement into the future.  While we have made no final decisions on this, among the areas we are examining is factoring in a risk premium around big projects when we are projecting the cost of a project.  There is always a degree of what is called optimism bias or promoter bias, where the people or the agency promoting the project will often believe it is going to come in cheaper than it really does, and that applies from all-weather pitches to major projects.  We would factor in some risk premiums around that.  The other thing we are considering is whether we should pay a bit more attention to the median price of the bids.</p><p>There has been criticism from some quarters that, in the public sector, we tend to go for the lowest priced bid or tend to weight very heavily who comes in with the cheapest price.  Perhaps that is not the right approach.  Maybe we should look at the median price and then give a score to those who are below it.  I will talk about that in the future.</p><p> The third is one that I strongly believe in and I am determined to make happen, that is, what I call a past form or public sector reference clause.  It is not possible for us under EU procurement law to ban a contractor from tendering for a job even if it has not done a very good job in the past.  I am not talking about any particular contractor.  There are numerous examples, quite frankly, of companies that have done a bad job in providing public buildings or doing other work for the Government.  I would like to see written into public procurement a sort of reference.  If the Deputy was going for a job in any office in this city or any business around the country, he would come with a reference based on what his previous employers thought about how he did.  I would like to work something like that into public procurement so that, in respect of those companies - contractors and professional services companies, whoever they are - we would be able to take and weight more heavily their previous form in doing work for the Government.  These are the kinds of reform that we should make in future.</p><p> The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has done three reports relating to housing.  There is the Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland's Broken System report, which was published back in May.  There are also the International Approaches to Land Use, Housing and Urban Development and the Land Value Capture and Urban Public Transport reports.  They are all very good and worth a read.  They helped to inform the decision to establish the Land Development Agency, LDA, which I see as an ESB for housing.  I see it as a semi-State and as the Government getting involved more in the business of development, construction, building houses and building communities.  A lot of that is done through local authorities already and through approved housing bodies, but this is additional to that.  That is what we need - additionality.  We need councils building more and we need approved housing bodies building more, but we also need the LDA, particularly when it comes to high-density, high-rise sites in more urban areas.  What it will do is build housing of all sorts - social housing for people who are on the housing list; cost rental housing, which is a model that we have not used much of in Ireland, but it has merit and is going to start in places like Emmet Road; affordable housing scheme houses, particularly in urban areas where there is a real affordability issue; and houses for purchase.  However, the LDA is only getting started.  At the moment, it is just a board established by statutory instrument and a small number of executive staff, so it will take it a bit of time to ramp up, but we anticipate it being on site building houses in 2020.  That is what I want to see happen.</p></speech>

I know it is not a new idea - it has been around for quite some time.  I know the Deputy's party has put it forward that credit unions should be able to lend for housing construction.  I am not entirely sure that that is a Government decision at the end of the day.  It may be a matter for the Central Bank to decide whether they can do that.  I could be totally wrong.  Maybe it is something that I need to explore a bit better, but there is always something that we have to bear in mind when it comes to enabling credit unions to get involved in development finance, and that is the potential risk to savings.  The credit union model is all about small savings and small loans.  When credit unions start to do things that banks do-----</p></speech>

They have &euro;1 million coming in per week that they cannot use.  Under the law and the Central Bank, credit unions can only invest in the pillar banks, but the pillar banks are not giving them a return.  The credit unions want to have a role in assisting their own communities.  Here is the primary way for them to do that to the benefit of us all.  It is a matter that needs to be investigated.  The LDA offers a vehicle by which that construct can be put in place.  It would also allow for private investment, including by pension funds.  It would have the same return, that being, the provision of homes and of vitality in our communities that, despite the best will in the world, many councils and various Departments, including the Taoiseach's, cannot deliver.  I was on a council from 1992 on.  It is no reflection on councils' willingness to do this work, but the professionalism, capacity and expertise that they possessed in this regard 40 or 50 years ago is not there anymore.  With the Department, they have supposedly been doing their best for the past seven or eight years.  They are not able to do this as far as I can tell, although, so we have to think outside the box.</p></speech>

A lot of local authorities have lost practice and have lost the corporate knowledge when it comes to building housing.  What the LDA can become is a house-building semi-State that builds houses in the way the ESB builds electrical infrastructure, Gas Networks Ireland does the same in respect of gas, and so on.</p> <p>  On the credit union issue, I do not want to pretend to be an expert on it.  I know it has been a topic of discussion before.  What occurs to me, though, is that local authorities and, indeed, the Government and the LDA can borrow from the European Investment Bank, EIB, at an extremely low interest rate.  We would not want to end up borrowing more expensively if we can already get loans from the EIB at a very low interest rate.</p> <p>  We would just need to bear in mind the safety of people's small savings in credit unions.  I imagine the reason they are only allowed to invest in certain areas is because they are low risk.  We all know that development finance and investing in the property sector are potentially high risk.</p></speech>

Maybe the Deputy is absolutely right, but we just need to bear in mind those factors.  We need to protect people's small savings in the credit unions and we need to make sure that any interest rate that the Government would pay to borrow for development would not be a high one.  It would make no sense to borrow for 3% off the credit unions when we could borrow for 1% or less from the EIB.</p></speech>

We have one bidder left, yet to be designated as the preferred bidder.  We have yet to make a decision as to whether we go ahead with the national broadband programme.  The cost is going to be multiples of what was projected many years ago.  Going ahead would not have a significant impact, or any impact at all, on this year, but it would have an impact on future years.  We will have to bear that in mind in making a decision.  Very different from the children's hospital, this is a 30-year project, so the cost is spread over 30 years.  It involves private finance and user fees, so it is a very different financial model, but it would have an impact on the capital envelope in 2020 and beyond, and we will have to take that into account.</p></speech>

This is something that we want to do.  We have got to the point where, from three years ago where only about 50% of premises in the country had access to high-speed broadband, it is up to around 80% now.  That is mainly private sector driven, but there is very much a Government role involved, too.  However, that still leaves about 500,000 homes, farms and businesses that do not have access to high-speed broadband.  I want them to have access to it.  When I think about what Ireland will look like in ten or 20 years time, I think of a country in which people work for multinationals at home.</p><p>That is already happening with Apple, for example, where 25% of its staff work from home.

It is not simple.  There are many projects that did not happen although there was a very high benefit-cost ratio.  There are others, such as the western rail corridor and the motorway between Carlow and Waterford, that had a low benefit-cost ratio but still went ahead.  Therefore, it is not just a mathematical decision as to whether the benefit-cost ratio is more than 1.5:1 or less than 0.8:1, or otherwise; it is also a political decision.  It is fundamentally a question of whether there is something we want to do.</p></speech>

Is his intention to have the Government make a decision and then to have a conversation with the Opposition on what it has approved, the cost and what can be done?  We have one bidder.  We are over a barrel in regard to that bidder.  There is infrastructure for which rural communities have been crying out.  This process was supposed to have ended in 2017.  I am not even sure whether it can still go ahead based on one of the reports that was to be commissioned on the integrity of the process.  Maybe the Taoiseach can shed some light on that.  What is his intention regarding engagement with others?  Will it solely be a Cabinet decision to proceed?</p></speech>

I am just trying to figure out what we, being in the dark, can know.  We know the likely cost is multiples of &euro;500 million.  The overrun is well above that for the national children's hospital.  We are not talking about hundreds of millions of euro but potentially billions.  Is it not scandalous that the Government got its estimates for this project so wrong?</p></speech>

It is totally different in scale and substance.  When it was originally mooted, a large area was to be part of the national broadband programme.  Probably the bit that was profitable would have cross-subsidised the rest of it.  Owing to EU state aid rules and factors beyond our control, the private sector went in and has been able to provide broadband to those areas where it has been profitable to do so.  That has left the Government picking up the tab for the most unprofitable area.  That was something that changed during the course of the process.  There are also changes in technology as things go on, in addition to the fact that, with any project, one can never know for sure what it will cost until the tenders and bids come in.  The tenders and bids &mdash; or at least the one bid &mdash; have come in for this.  This is totally different from the national children's hospital, where, well into construction on a phase-2 basis, the escalating costs emerged.  That will not happen in the case in question because we actually know what the cost is going to be before we start.  It is quite different on a number of grounds.  Also, private finance is being invested in this.  There are also user charges.  People try to say this is the same as the children's hospital but it is actually nothing like it.</p></speech>

It amounts to billions of euro in addition.  What we are hearing from the media is that the range is between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;3 billion.</p></speech>

What happens with a major project, be it a road, metro, runway, bundle of schools or new hospital, is that one puts it out to tender.  When one gets the tenders in, one can then decide whether one is willing to go ahead with the project based on the cost.  That is how big projects work.  One of the differences with the children's hospital was the two-stage process, whereby we did not know the full cost.</p></speech>

This could end up in the region of &euro;3 billion.  This is a spectacular underestimation, or overrun, on a planned project of national importance.  It really questions how the Government is handling major capital infrastructure projects.  I refer to the fact that the Taoiseach does not believe this is scandalous or that lessons can be learned from the fact that we now have only one bidder.  What if we do not agree with the bidder's price?  What is plan B?</p></speech>

That is part of the examination we have been doing.  Of course, if there is a plan B, plan C or plan D that is quicker and cheaper, one opts for it but if there were not maybe one would not.  These are decisions that have to be made.</p> <p>  To be very clear and very straightforward on this, there is no overrun here; this project has not even started.  A tender has come in at a certain price.  It is now our decision, as a Government and an Oireachtas, as to whether we want to pay that price and believe it is worth it.  There is no overrun here.</p></speech>

Some &euro;275 million has been allocated for this from the State's point of view.  There has been an estimation, factored into our budgetary arithmetic, based on a figure of &euro;500 million.  Regardless of the way in which the Taoiseach wants to play with the words, there is a spectacular overrun on this project, if it ever sees the light of day.  There has been a spectacular underestimation.  If the Government continues to underestimate the cost of capital projects as it is doing with the national broadband plan or national children's hospital, this country will soon be calling for the IMF again.  This never happened in the worst days of underestimation of capital projects.  It never happened under Fianna F&aacute;il at that level.</p></speech>

We are now down to one individual company and are over a barrel, as the Taoiseach said.  There is no other quicker solution.  It has been delayed so long that we can either decide to do it all over from the beginning, and there are questions as to how that could be done because of decisions which allowed for the most lucrative part, that is the 300,000 premises, to be carved out of the system.</p></speech>

The Office of the Attorney General has provided an impressive number of legal advices on requests relating to Private Members' Bills and so on.

We recognise that the unemployment rate is falling.  The Taoiseach referred to full employment, although something that was not in his script was "a job for everyone who wants one".  What rate is full employment?</p></speech>

Long-term unemployment, that is people who are out of work for more than nine months, is about 2.7%.  Based on that figure, we have full employment now.  There will always be people who are between jobs, for one reason or another and who are receiving jobseeker's benefit.  They may have been made redundant and be looking for a job.</p></speech>

There was some discussion that the figure ought to be a little higher but I will not push the Taoiseach on that.  I raise this because I heard the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, make the same point that unemployment is falling, which is an excellent thing, and there is a job for everyone who wants one.  That really annoys people in regions where the unemployment level is not coming down at the same rate.  I come from Donegal, for which the Central Statistics Office gives an unemployment rate that is about 5% higher than the national average.  When we do reach full employment, that will not mean that there is a job for everyone who wants one.  I am asking the Taoiseach to be cautious about that because it stigmatises or attempts to label people in more isolated communities where the economic recovery has not reached and where there are no job prospects for people.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that there are parts of the country where the number of jobseekers exceeds the number of vacancies.  However, taking the country as a whole, there are almost as many vacancies as there are people looking for work and that is close to full employment.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach's opening statement referred to Project Ireland and the Government's commitment to the development of technological universities, with particular urgency attached to the technological university in the south east.  I think everyone will agree that this is urgent.  The last official answer on this was given some weeks ago.  The Minister of State told the D&aacute;il that the application had not yet been received.</p><p>Somebody said in September that an application was expected within weeks and the president of Waterford Institute of Technology recently said it was progressing, albeit not as quickly as it should be.  That is the understatement of the century considering how long this has been going on.  The Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, wants a memorandum of understanding to be completed before the application is submitted.  There is still an issue with regard to the possibility that the headquarters of the new technological university would be located in Kilkenny and negotiations are continuing in that regard.  What is the Taoiseach's view on the timeline?  Can people expect progress on the technological university that has been mooted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.1456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022800002#K00200"><p>The project to have a technological university for the south east is one of three things that I want the Government to get done for Waterford city.  These are the opening of a second catheterisation laboratory for the hospital, the establishment of a technological university and the development of the north quays.  These are all part of developing Waterford as the major growth centre for the south east.  A technological university can be a significant benefit to a region.  It means more students will stay in the region at least have the option of staying in it, more students will come into the region and more jobs, investment and employment will be spun off for the region.  Attending the inauguration of the technological university for Dublin was bittersweet in a way.  It was great that we had our first technological university and that it has a campus in Blanchardstown in my constituency.  However, it is another university for Dublin when there is no university in the south east.  That is why I am determined to get this done.</p> <p>  The major issues and hold-ups appear to be caused by differences and disagreements between the institutions that will make up the technological university of the south east.  The process has been completed in Dublin.  It is likely that the technological university in Munster will come in ahead of the south east, which should not have been the case.  The south east should have been the first region to get a technological university over the line.  I talk to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, but the problems seem to relate to some industrial relations questions and disagreements between the different sites and campuses.  I anticipate that the application will be made this year and I will be very disappointed if that is not the case.</p></speech>

I am from a county that neighbours Deputy Deasy's county and we realise how important this is for the south east.  If the university is to go ahead, it is wrong that the participants in it should be dragging their heels by not submitting the applications.  The Taoiseach mentioned a catheterisation laboratory and cardiac care.  The Taoiseach needs to consider that, in the context of the second laboratory, the argument being made is for 24-7 care.  This is an issue on which thousands of people have marched in the streets and it is worth pursuing.</p> <p>  With regard to inquiries, we have spent &euro;74 million and the figure will probably double.  Has the Taoiseach studied other ways of having these inquiries with the Attorney General and advisers in his Department?  I appreciate his point that Deputies ask for all sorts of inquiries.  While some of these inquiries are needed, they cannot be open-ended.  It would assist in some of these matters if the Department of the Taoiseach undertook work on devising new ways of having different tiered inquiries.  The inquiry approved by the D&aacute;il into the death of Shane O'Farrell should be a public inquiry but it has been kicked into some other arrangement, much to the annoyance, dissatisfaction and disappointment of the family.  There should be a new, cost-effective inquiry with a tight timeframe rather than going down the same old route all the time.  Has any work been done on that?  Would it be worthwhile to do some work on a more efficient and cost-effective approach?</p></speech>

One of my special advisers has a particular remit to try to get this over the line, working with the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and the Minister, Deputy McHugh.  I am determined that we will get it done.  It appears that Munster will have its application in before the south east which is great for Munster but very disappointing for the south east.</p> <p>  The Commissions of Investigation Act was intended to do exactly as the Chairman suggested for commissions of inquiry.  At one stage, we had many tribunals running at considerable cost and for a long time.  I accept that some were necessary inquiries that did good work but they took a long time and cost a lot of money.  There was a view that commissions of inquiry would work better and to a significant extent they have worked better.  However, they are also imperfect and there have been delays in many of them.  The ideal inquiry, which everybody wants, is one that is quick, takes place in public and does not cost a large amount.  I am not sure if that is achievable in the real world.  If something involves findings of fact or potentially significant damage to people's reputations, people have a right to legal representation and to recourse to the courts.  The utopian perfect inquiry is one that is in public, inexpensive and does not take years.  I am not sure that is always achievable or if anyone has ever achieved it.</p></speech>

Both these statements should be compared with the issues of housing, homelessness and the activities of vulture funds in this country.  The statements are fine but, as for actions, those who are caught up in issues pertaining to vulture funds and so on have been put through the wringer.  I would love to see the Government acknowledge this in some way and in particular try to improve these people's lot.  Dealing with banks and these funds, while it is said there is protection with existing regulation or legislation, there really is not in practice.  Has the Taoiseach any analysis of the effect of these funds up to now on society, families and community, rather than just the financial aspect of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.1473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022800002#L00500"><p>A very good analysis was done by the Central Bank of the code of conduct for mortgage arrears and how it differs from banks to what are described in that report as unregulated loan owners.  That is a very informative report and paints a more nuanced picture than what often comes across in the media as to how vulture funds deal with debts and with resolving them.  We have also accepted legislation from the Opposition to extend regulation to vulture funds.  We also have legislation going through at present, championed by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, requiring the courts to take many more factors into account before issuing repossession orders.  That is the work being done to extend consumer protections to people who are in arrears, to have a code of conduct for mortgage arrears, to extend regulation to the vulture funds and to require the courts to take even more into account before they issue repossession orders.  That is quite a large body of work.  We know that Ireland, relative to other countries, has a very low rate of repossession but we also need always to be aware of the bigger picture when it comes to these things.  It is a difficult thing to say but we live in a country where hundreds of thousands of people are paying mortgages and paying interest at higher rates than those in other European countries.  Some of this is down to inadequate competition in the banking sector.  If increasing numbers of people do not pay back their loans and do not surrender the security, the effect will be higher interest rates for hundreds of thousands of people who are paying their mortgages.  It will also make it much harder for tens of thousands of people who want to get their first mortgage to get credit.  We must take into account the wider societal impact, to use the Chairman's term, of anything we do in this space.</p></speech>

I want to avail of this opportunity to say to him directly in this formal setting that the vulture funds are extremely difficult to deal with and are becoming even more difficult.  The banks are now as aggressive and as arrogant as they were during the time of the crash and afterwards.  I am talking about people who want to pay and want to engage with the banks.  In spite of what the banks would say about the engagement, the banks are not engaging.  That has been the experience of the hearings we have had at this committee time and time again.  Tracker mortgages are another example.  I am taking the opportunity to highlight these matters.  I know the Taoiseach is aware of them.  There is a different point of view, and that is fine, but we need to take into account the commentary of the individuals concerned, that is, the many thousands of people caught in bad mortgages, their cry for help and the fact that they continue to tell us that it is an issue of non-engagement from the side of the banks.  That is the point I am making.</p> <p>  I encourage the Taoiseach to look at the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation suggested by my party.  We have had an overrun on the cost of the children's hospital and we have issues, I will call them, with broadband.  That is not an overrun, as the Taoiseach says.  It is still at an early stage.  There is an overrun on the works on Leinster House.  This was flagged for us by the Department of Finance.  Really, it is time to update the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation to give that office a greater role in the examination of the spend of public moneys running right down through the various organisations.  If that were to be done, it would be a reform that would have a very positive impact on the activities of Government, Government officials and so on and would certainly raise the flag of value for money in this House.  I am again just drawing the matter to the Taoiseach's intention.</p></speech>

One of the reasons we decided at Cabinet not to oppose the Bill was that we think it has some merit.  The traditional role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as the Chairman knows, is to examine expenditure that has already occurred rather than planned expenditure.  However, it might be a useful additional role if the office is able to take it on.  At least we would then have a body that could look at issues such as the extra cost of the children's hospital and then come back to us and be able to tell us it has looked at the matter and that the overrun was unavoidable.  Perhaps it is an idea worth exploring.</p></speech>

One is affordable childcare in the community delivered through family resource centres in the main.  They are dealing with Pobal, and an issue is now emerging across counties.  A new group has been formed on the basis that there is not enough flexibility within the oversight of Pobal oversight to allow for the various social disadvantages that occur in communities such as these.  They are experiencing huge financial difficulty in meeting the Pobal requirements in terms of bureaucracy and red tape.  This is something that will come to the fore in the next few weeks.  I have raised it with the Minister concerned.  I just ask that it be flagged because, as I said, it will be an issue and will affect those who are most marginalised in our society and who cannot afford to pay.  We are just talking about flexibility.  The issue will come up.</p> <p>  What is the Taoiseach's opinion on D&aacute;il reform and on this style of new politics?  His Department looks at D&aacute;il reform.  How does he think the D&aacute;il has worked?  Does he think this D&aacute;il has given value for money?</p></speech>

Alongside satisfying the statistical requirements of Government, the information published by the CSO is also used by an extensive variety of public bodies, businesses, third-level colleges, research institutes and the general public. There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN's Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the European Statistics Code of Practice.</p> <p>  The CSO net allocation in 2018 amounted to &euro;48.746 million.  The net allocation for 2019 is &euro;54.714 million.  The funding provided reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to allowing the CSO to actively respond to significantly increased user demand for the development of new outputs.  It also supports the development of the Irish Statistical System, ISS, in line with obligations under national and EU law and consistent with Government strategy for the development of trusted and robust official statistics.</p> <p>  As part of preparing for the census of population in 2021, the office will have to source a census processing system in 2019 and progress the development of a digital census enumerator record book that will replace paper recording and tracking.  Technology systems support is increasingly required at every stage of the production of the CSO&rsquo;s progressively more complex and varied outputs.  The funding will allow for the upgrade of legacy office systems and improve digitisation of data analytics that are aligned to both the public service ICT strategy and the Government data strategy.  The CSO will commence scoping the development of a significant new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland.  The Growing Up in Ireland, GUI, survey is the national longitudinal study of children and youth.  The GUI study was started in 2006 and the CSO has been requested to take over responsibility for GUI from 2023.  Planning for this will commence in 2019.</p><p>Since 2008, the CSO has continued to reduce the response burden of its non-agricultural business surveys, as measured through the response burden barometer.  A decrease of 41.3% was measured between 2008 and 2017, exceeding the target reduction of 25% over this timeframe.  The CSO vote for 2019 provides for a total of 825 staff.  This represents an increase from 801 in 2018 and reflects the cyclical nature of the work of the office.</p><p> I commend the values and principles which inform the CSO's work.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland's public policy by providing a high quality and, most importantly, independent statistical service.</p></speech>

We were doing some work on the cost of insurance and the CSO provided us with some information on insurance, but it does not cover the cost of insurance to business so we are not getting a complete analysis.  Is there a reason for that or is that work which could be undertaken?</p></speech>

The background to that recommendation was the absence of quality information on business insurance, including official statistical data to inform policy formulation by the Government.  The CSO has provided a report on this work to the cost of insurance working group and that report will be published shortly.  One of the findings relates to the lack of international precedent for a price index for business insurance and the difficulty of measuring price changes in this area.  The report assesses several potential data collection methods and outlines a specific approach the CSO will pursue further.  The CSO will continue its research into business insurance in 2019 before deciding whether to begin collecting and compiling a price index on this topic.  If the working group has other recommendations, they can be assessed by the CSO within its resources to see if there is a possibility of providing data.</p></speech>

Due to the fact that information about insurance in general is held by Insurance Ireland it would be an important piece of work that could be undertaken by an independent body such as the CSO for the Government or, indeed, the work of this committee.  I encourage the Minister of State to consider that.</p></speech>

My query relates to one issue.  The Minister of State will be familiar with the sexual abuse and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report.  There was an announcement some time ago that this survey was to be undertaken again.  It was last published in 2002.  It is a very extensive survey of several thousand people in respect of sexual violence against men, women and children in Ireland.  It is considered a key survey by most people involved in issues relating to violence.  The CSO is taking it on.  The lead on it the last time was Professor Hannah McGee from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  She and her large team carried out an extensive survey which is well regarded by people who work in the field and is considered essential by the rape crisis centres and other bodies that provide services to people who have been subject to sexual violence.  Everybody who works in Leinster House is aware of the issue of sexual violence, whether it involves children or others, and we had a discussion yesterday with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on the issues arising in Scouting Ireland, or other aspects of sexual violence.</p> <p>  The last time the survey was done it took three years, plus preparation, before it was finally published in 2002.  It remains the only such survey until now.  On balance, the CSO taking it over is a good thing and I support that.  However, I see a reference here that the CSO is simply going to commence a scoping exercise.  Issues relating to sexual violence in Ireland are very serious issues for our society so I am very disappointed that only a scoping exercise will be commenced.  CSO surveys take a long time.  Typically, the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, takes a minimum of a year and a half, and many of the changes take very long periods of time to establish.  Can the Minister of State say when he expects the survey proper to commence?  How long does he expect it to take?  How long will the scoping exercise, as it is described, last before the CSO commences the survey?  It is incredibly disappointing for all the organisations that work with victims of violence.  It is also an important survey in assisting the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.1517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019022800002#N01000"><p>I thank Deputy Burton for an important question on what is a challenging subject.  The CSO has been charged with undertaking this important work.  That will involve the CSO scoping a means of collecting sensitive personal data in a manner that is confidential, ethical and designed to support accurate and reliable survey results.  Protecting the privacy and supporting the needs of all involved must be the priority in doing so.  The challenge of SAVI is a departure for the CSO.  For the data to be robust, explicit questions regarding behaviours associated with sexual violence will have to be asked of respondents.  It will require specialist expertise and training, consultation with key stakeholders and consideration of best practice from international statistical organisations regarding the appropriate collection methods.</p> <p>  In view of the complexity and sensitivity of the survey, it is envisaged that the entire process of scoping, planning, executing and reporting may take approximately five years.  Exact timelines will only emerge as the scoping exercise progresses.  Obviously, we all hope that period could be reduced but if a five-year timeframe is due the complexity of the issue, then that is what will be required.  However, if it can be reduced, it will be.  The provision of reliable, robust, objective and internationally comparable information requires that the planning and execution of the survey are undertaken in a professional and comprehensive manner.  There is an amount of preparatory work to be done in regard to what form and shape the survey will take.  Then there will be a degree of training of the people who will have to conduct interviews about sensitive information where confidentiality is a must.  People will not take part in a survey unless they can be assured that the confidentiality of their data is protected.  We would love if this could be completed more quickly, but it may take approximately five years.</p></speech>

It means that it will be well over 20 years since the publication of the previous survey before the next is published.  Has the CSO at this point even contacted people such as Professor McGee in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland who compiled the first survey?</p><p>She and her team did groundbreaking work and all of the factors to which the Minister of State refers were taken into consideration then.  I find it extraordinary that he is talking about a five-year timeframe.  The GUI survey is also being brought under the remit of the CSO.  Will a five-year timeframe apply to that as well?</p></speech>

Initial engagement has taken place.  I cannot confirm if the professor has been engaged but we can get back to the Deputy in writing on that.  The GUI survey was previously compiled by the ESRI.  Due to its expertise and reputation, the CSO has been tasked with taking it over from 2023.  That is still some time away.  There were extensive discussions in 2018 with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the ESRI.  The transfer of the study will offer a number of advantages.  Most notably, it will be more firmly embedded in the official statistics for Ireland, thereby providing a more certain future for the study, which we all agree is very important and common sense.  It will be part of the continuous programme of the CSO into the future.</p></speech>

The Act only allows for Part 9 to be commenced by order of the Minister.  As it has been more than 46 months since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted and key Parts have not yet commenced, this amendment proposes to make October 2019 the latest date on which Part 9 can be commenced. </p><p>I am aware that Parts 2 and 3 are not included in this amendment and they must be commenced in tandem.  However, their inclusion would not have been permissible under Standing Orders.  Since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted in April 2015, we have had a referendum on civil marriage equality, the Marriage Act 2015, two amendment Bills aiming to fix typographical errors and six deadlines missed by the Department of Health.  All of that has happened in four years, during which time same-sex parents have conceived and raised children and their families have not been recognised.  Some very important civil rights are absent from the family unit.  I outlined all of that during the Second Stage debate and I am acutely aware that the Minister and committee members are aware of how serious this matter is and how vulnerable it makes families.  The legislation that was proclaimed as embracing their family formation before the law has now turned into a headache and disappointment as deadlines have been missed time and time again and many delays have been announced. </p><p>Parts 2, 3 and 9, as I mentioned on Second Reading, were originally supposed to be commenced one year after the enactment in April 2016.  The delays have occurred and we cannot fix them now, but we can ensure that Part 9, without which this Bill is useless, will be commenced in a reasonable timeframe. </p><p>During the Second Stage debate the Minister said &quot;a small amount of administrative work needs to be done in the Department of Health and the HSE&quot;.  The amendment I have brought forward will ensure that this will be done in the next eight months.  From what the Minister has told us, that is a reasonable timeframe.  She will probably give us a deadline which her Department and the Department of Health are working towards.  I have no reason to doubt that but, unfortunately, too many timeframes have passed and too many deadlines have been missed.</p><p>This is an important amendment.

That it is the only non-Brexit Bill being dealt with in the House should show how important an impact we all believe it will have.  I acknowledge Members' support.</p> <p>  The amendment's effect would be to bring Part 9 into operation by default on or before 6 October if commencement of the Act has not happened prior to that date.  As I have stated on Second Stage, I have no intention of delaying this Bill.  In fact, I will commence it immediately once it has been passed by the Oireachtas.  I have no issue with the 6 October deadline - I do not know why the Deputy magically chose that date - because I will have surpassed it.  However, I will oppose the amendment on the basis that, as drafted, it would make commencement of Part 9 the sole responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is the relevant Minister under the 2015 Act that the Deputy referenced.  The amendment removes the obligation on that Minister to consult with me as the line Minister with responsibility for the General Register Office, GRO, and our registrations unit regarding any change that is made or considered prior to the Bill's enactment.  The arrangement for consulting is provided for in section 17 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, and for good reason, as that Act covers numerous Departments and ministerial responsibilities.  Therefore, removing my responsibility over legislation would not make much sense.  On that basis, I will oppose it.</p> <p>  I wish to make Deputies aware of the other piece of the picture.  The commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I wish to flag to the Chair that the Department of Health has indicated to me that a short technical amendment may be needed on Report Stage.  If so, I will move it.  The Department is engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to seek specific legal advice on an issue regarding the interaction between certain transitional provisions under section 26 of the Act and whether a certificate issued by a donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, facility to the intending parents that enables them or her to register the birth of the child born following a DAHR procedure may be required.  The advice may be that the existing provision is fine, in which case an amendment would not be necessary, but I just wanted to flag the issue.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we cannot take that at face value.  Assurances, guarantees, timeframes and deadlines have been given before and have all fallen by the wayside.  It is important that a timeframe be built into the legislation.  That is why we have tabled this amendment.  Fifty-four months from the original date gives us another eight months.  If small technical amendments need to be made on Report Stage, that is fine.  I am not saying that the failure or fault for delays lies with the Minister or officials within her Department.  I am acutely aware that a number of Departments are dealing with this matter.  For example, the Department of Health has cited six deadlines and breached all of them, letting families down.</p> <p>  I will press this amendment.  It is an important issue.  We owe it to the vulnerable families that have been denied their civil rights.  We need to ensure that they can rear their children with all of the rights to which those families are entitled.  We have passed referendums, and this is the most important element that needs to be addressed.  We owe it to the families watching on.  Since debating the Bill on Second Stage, I have been contacted - I am sure other Deputies and Senators have as well - and told how important this matter is.  Many people are watching on and will not appreciate us breaking any more timeframes.</p> <p>  I take the Minister at her word that this is being fast-tracked.  I have no reason to doubt her, and it should be grounds enough to get this date built into the legislation.</p></speech>

We are here - it is being fast-tracked.  Report Stage has been requested for next week, although I am unsure as to whether the Business Committee can facilitate that.  It will facilitate my request at the earliest next date.  The D&aacute;il will then have finished this legislation and it will go to the Seanad.</p></speech>

I am not holding back on commencing this legislation.  As soon as it is passed by the Seanad, it will be commenced.</p> <p>  The Deputy's amendment would diminish my ministerial rights and responsibilities towards the vulnerable people whom he mentioned.  I do not believe that any of them are vulnerable, though, and certainly not the ones I have met in recent months.</p></speech>
