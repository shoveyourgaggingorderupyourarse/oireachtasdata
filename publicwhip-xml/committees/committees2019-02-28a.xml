He is joined by Ms Deirdre Quaid, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meetings of 14 and 21 February have been circulated.  Is it agreed that they be published?  Agreed.  Any matter arising will be dealt with in the course of the next topic.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  The first items are Nos. 2010 and 2015, correspondence, dated 22 February 2019, received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, providing a briefing note and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers or Ministers, or both, as a follow-up to requests made at previous meetings of the committee.  The first item is correspondence, dated 18 February 2019, received from Ms Rhonda Evans of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, providing the minutes of meetings of the finance and construction committee.  They were circulated prior to last week&rsquo;s meeting and I propose that we formally note them today.  At our meeting on 14 February we requested the board to publish the minutes of its other meetings. I suggest it also publish these minutes.  It is not for the committee to publish the minutes of meetings of the board.  We will note the correspondence which was discussed at the previous meeting.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1999 received from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in reply to the committee&rsquo;s request for a report on the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities.  Mr. O&rsquo;Toole advises that a draft report is in the process of being finalised by Mazars consultants and that the HEA will consider the report when completed and revert to the committee at the earliest opportunity.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  The field work has been completed and a draft report is being worked on.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence which is dated 20 February 2019 is No. 2000 received from Ms Elaine Sheridan, vice president for corporate affairs and finance at Waterford Institute of Technology, providing information requested by the committee following its recent meeting at which we considered Special Report No. 104 of the Comptroller and Auditor General - Waterford Institute of Technology - Development and Disposal of Intellectual Property in FeedHenry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022800002#A00400"><p>There are a couple of issues with the letter received from Professor Donnelly, president, and Ms Elaine Sheridan, vice president for corporate affairs and finance at Waterford Institute of Technology.  It is on the back of the meeting regarding the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which mentioned several documents, one of which was a memorandum sent to Professor Donnelly by a subordinate highlighting concerns about the process involved in the establishment of FeedHenry and other governance issues.  I sought a copy of the memorandum.  If my memory is correct, it was accompanied by an email stating it should be sent to the president and the financial controller, but it did not reach them.  The president who was vice president at the time went back to the author of the memorandum and asked questions about its contents.  I am aghast that the correspondence states, "In light of the threat of legal proceedings issuing on foot of any disclosure of the Memorandum, it would not be appropriate for us to provide it to the PAC".  I do not understand why there would be any legal impediment to the memorandum being provided for the committee.  There has been an ongoing issue with transparency in dealing this matter.  That is one of the reasons the committee has looked into the process involved in the establishment of the companies.  However, there has been a full examination and the Comptroller and Auditor General has completed his report which mentions the memorandum, yet Waterford Institute of Technology is stating it cannot provide it for us for legal reasons which are not outlined, other than the possibility that certain individuals may be named in the memorandum.  However, it should be possible to redact the names of such persons.  </p> <p>  The committee also requested an information note on the shareholders in FeedHenry, given that WIT was one of the shareholders, but the correspondence states that information cannot be provided either.  The information is available on the website of the Companies Registration Office, but WIT is not in a position to provide it for the committee.  This goes back to the stalled HEA report.</p><p>We need to refer back to the Department and ask it if it has considered appointing a statutory inspector to deal with this.  If it is the case that with every item of information being sought, there is a legal impediment or legal advice is offered as to why we cannot get it, somebody with the authority to look at all of these memorandums and documents is necessary if the committee cannot get them.  I propose that we write back to the HEA and the Department, with copies of the correspondence we received from WIT, to ask them their current position with regard to having another look at the report, which is stalled at present, and what the next steps will be.</p></speech>

In the letter, counsel for the individuals communicated their clients' position that the memorandum contains a number of false allegations and potentially defamatory statements which could put their clients' good names at risk and materially prejudice their commercial interests and professional reputations.  The letter suggests that any disclosure of the memorandum would breach the individuals' constitutional rights of privacy and their right to their good names and would be actionable on that basis.</p></speech>

However, this was never done.  In fact, Professor Donnelly came back to the person in question to ask him to substantiate the concerns he had raised.  I still cannot see how that would be a difficulty.</p></speech>

I will not say it but I can speculate on who one of the two people is who has concerns about what is in the memorandum.  We need to refer back to the Department and the HEA and ask them where they are with their report and if they are going to embark on a different course of action if they cannot publish the report that is in draft form.</p></speech>

Obviously, the institute was one of the shareholders.  I believe what happened, from memory, is that a confidentiality agreement was reached between the shareholders and the institute that there would not be any disclosure.  Perhaps it was with the company.  Again, that raises concerns around the transparency of these processes when it is an institute of technology, a spin out company from the institute, and there are these confidentiality clauses surrounding who the shareholders are.  It just adds more intrigue to the issue.</p></speech>

It is difficult to tease out where we are going with it.  The processes were working in a sense.  Somebody was alerting somebody higher up that there were questions.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

The memorandum is part of a process.  Somebody is concerned and is theoretically doing the right thing.  The person notices something is wrong and wants it checked out.  The person alerts somebody with higher authority so everything was being done correctly, theoretically.</p></speech>

The reason we know what happened with the memorandum is that it was in the report.  The report says that Professor Donnelly, as vice president, received the memorandum.  It was to be sent higher up the chain, but it was not.  It went back to the person who sent the memorandum and the vice president asked for clarifications.  The memorandum could be referenced in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Whatever the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts, and there are many questions about that at present, referencing and examining special reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General is certainly one of them.</p></speech>

That is agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2002 is from Professor Donnelly, Waterford Institute of Technology.  It relates to the same issue.  He states that the institute is seeking clarification in response to the committee's request.  That was an earlier acknowledgement of the email.  We received the more comprehensive reply that we have just discussed in the week following that earlier email.  That is noted.</p> <p>  Nos. 2003 and 2007 are from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board regarding the committee's request for written consent from Mazars before the relevant document or any part of it is disclosed.  Ms Evans advises that permission was requested and is still awaited.  Mazars stated that the document is confidential and we cannot publish it until their consent is given.  We are waiting for that.</p><p>We note that is the position and we will publish that reply.</p><p> The next item is No. 2011 from Ms Carmel Whelan, Kildare-Wicklow ETB, providing information requested by the committee about the valuation report for a building in Arklow.  This is an extensive document and the valuation runs to several pages.  The final paragraph of the letter includes a note from the valuer stating that, in accordance with standard practice, neither the whole or part of this report, or any reference thereto, may be included in any document or circular without prior consent.  We have to ask Kildare-Wicklow ETB to get the consent of the valuer before we can publish it.  It should be standard practice that whenever this committee writes to an organisation seeking a report from a consultant, we should include in our first letter a request of the organisation to get consent from the consultant.  That would be better than us getting the letter and spending another couple of weeks writing back to ask the organisation to seek consent.  On foot of these types of issues arising, we need to put that request for consent in our original request. </p><p> In this case, we have the valuation report but we cannot publish it because we do not have the consent of the valuer.  We have seen it and can discuss it but cannot publish it without consent.</p></speech>

I acknowledge we got the valuation report for that building but there are a number of other items that we requested from the ETB that have not been forthcoming.  We need to follow up on those in the same letter.  There were three other things.  The first was about block E of the Civic Centre in Bray.  There was a list of all properties that the board is leasing which it previously owned.  There was also a list of any other buildings it is leasing which did not have signed contracts.  Those were the three things I was looking for.</p></speech>

We will follow that up.  We will hold over this item because we are awaiting consent from the valuer.  We will not publish that until we get consent.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2012 from Mr. Paul Quinn, chief procurement officer of the Office of Government Procurement, dated 25 February 2019 in response to the committee's request for information on his role as a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board about the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the role of the Government contracts committee for construction.  We will note and publish this.  He will be coming in with Mr. Robert Watt next week and we will have a detailed discussion.  This is a comprehensive letter.  I do not expect the public to read all ten pages of it but I want to make a few brief points in order that people will know what Mr. Quinn is saying in this letter.</p> <p>  He deals with the role of the Government contracts committee for construction and he states that, in this instance, it considered a request for a derogation for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board from the standard form of contract.  He refers to the standard form of contracts and deals with certain major contracts.  He gives a timeline on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and confirms he is a member.  In the first paragraph of his letter, Mr. Quinn states that he accepts in hindsight that, in his letter to the committee of 25 January, he should have advised that he was a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, having been appointed in a personal capacity by the Minister for Health in 2013.  He states that is separate to his duties at the Office of Government Procurement.  He accepts that the committee should have been informed in that earlier letter that he was a member of the board.</p> <p>  I want to highlight one or two other points.  He states that there is a capital works procurement policy and refers to the capital works management framework, which consists of best practice guidance.  As a result of this, we are asking the secretariat to ensure we have a copy of this best practice guidance in advance of next week's meeting.  We might be sorry we asked for it but we should see it in advance of next week because it is important.</p> <p>  Mr. Quinn also gives the membership of the Government contracts committee for construction.  There are 22 members on that committee to consider the various items.  He gives a timeline in appendix summary 2, which we will publish.  There is a summary of engagement between the Office of Government Procurement policy unit, the construction contracts committee and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  In the second paragraph, he states that, from this early engagement, it became apparent that the scale, complexity and required delivery time associated with the hospital presented a range of challenges.  We want to know what timeline was suggested in that early consultation before next week.</p> <p>  In the fifth paragraph, Mr. Quinn states that the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board commenced its formal engagement with the committee in May 2014 with a view to securing a derogation.  He moves on to state that there were subsequent meetings.  I do not see the date the derogation was granted, and by whom, in this memo.  I want the minute of the meeting at which the derogation was granted, who attended that meeting and the full minutes of the meeting.  There are three references to the fact that there were meetings about this matter but no reference in the document to when the derogation was actually approved.  We want that in advance of the next meeting.</p> <p>  I am only mentioning those items.  There are a few additional bits of information we require before next week and I am flagging those so we have them here in advance.  This is very complicated.  There is a big issue we will take up with him but, in essence, Mr. Quinn is saying that he was appointed to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board by the Minister for Health and, as a civil servant, he was responsible to the Minister for Health in that respect and not the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He was appointed by the Minister responsible for this and he is essentially saying he is satisfied, based on the cost overruns that came to light during that summer - and I know Deputy Jonathan O'Brien wants to comment on this - that the matter was being progressed up to the HSE and the Department of Health in a proper manner.  That is why he felt no reason to raise it with the Minister.  He again reiterates, from his point of view, that the Minister for Health is the line Minister for this project.  He is also saying he raised it with neither the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform nor the Secretary General because they were not the line Minister.</p> <p>  In fairness to Mr. Quinn, I am giving his side of it because there has been much criticism on that issue.  We will tease this out next week.  To be fair to everyone, I wanted to say that.</p></speech>

That is down to the contracting authority, which I presume in this case in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB.  Mr. Quinn was a member of the development board while the contract negotiations were taking place.</p><p> Perhaps the Chair will provide guidance on what exactly Mr. Quinn will discuss at the meeting next week.  I certainly want to discuss with Mr. Quinn, in his role as a member of the board, some of the issues around the strategy for the tendering process and not so much in his role as chief procurement officer in the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  I seek direction from the Chair as to whether that is-----</p></speech>

Some people might not agree with his point of view that he was responsible to the Minister for Health.  We have invited him before us in respect of his role on the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, as opposed to his role in the OGP.  We will run through those points again because some people might not fully accept what they could describe as a Jesuitical interpretation of his role, but he makes a good case on that particular point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022800002#D00300"><p>I requested that the head of the Office of Government Procurement appear before the committee as part of our consideration of this issue.  The wider point is that there appears to be an institutional gap in terms of some large capital projects.  That aspect would be useful to explore in the context of process.  That is part of the reason it is appropriate that the committee have Mr. Quinn before us, but the issue is not exclusive to the national children's hospital.  It is useful to have an example when we try to explore how something happened.  This issue is much wider in terms of capital projects and institutional gaps.  If there is an institutional gap but no institutional memory, what will happen is that the mistakes will be repeated.  That is central to what we are doing.</p></speech>

The invitation to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt, is exactly as Deputy Murphy indicated and relates to capital projects.  There is a section in this letter dealing with capital works procurement policy.  We want a copy of the capital works management framework, which I am sure is a substantial document.  We need to see the capital works management framework and that is essentially what we want to discuss with Mr. Watt.  We do not want to focus solely on one project, although that will be part of the discussion.  We want to discuss how several other projects are being managed and how the capital works procurement policy is working.  Our invitation to Mr. Watt was clear on that from day one.</p></speech>

The date we pencilled in was the week before the PwC report will come out.  I see no benefit in having it then.  We will come to that matter in a moment.</p> <p>  Next week's meeting will start at 9 a.m. and we will get down to the main business because Mr. Watt, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has another commitment with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Taoiseach in the afternoon.  He has requested that we finish by lunchtime and we will facilitate him on the basis that we will start at 9 a.m.  We will take a short break but if we meet from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., it should be sufficient to do our work.</p></speech>

They can be lengthy documents but much of the content is routine material.  They could absorb all of our time.

We will request documents that summarise or list the key points and guidance for officers on the key issues as well as requesting the large document.  I could probably find the document on the Department's website but we will ask the Department to send it to us in the next day or two to give us time to study it before our next meeting.  We do not want it to arrive next Wednesday evening.  I think we are all happy about that.</p> <p>  No. 2014 is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 26 February 2019 providing details requested by the committee on housing assistance payments, HAP and other items.  We will discuss that when we meet the officials shortly.  We will note and publish the document.  We will also note No. 2017, a copy of the social housing delivery report for 2018, which we received yesterday from Mr. McCarthy.  We will discuss that report with him shortly.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  Correspondence under the heading C is from private individuals.  We received a letter from Deputy David Cullinane, dated 18 February 2019, on Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, Dublin.  The Deputy has momentarily left the room.  We have received correspondence on that in recent times.  It is on our work programme.  We will ask the secretariat to give us an update on this issue, which we dealt with last year and on which there has been recent media coverage.</p> <p>  Nos. 2001 and 2008 are from Deputy Alan Kelly on the Higher Education Authority report on Cork Institute of Technology and certain companies.  As mentioned earlier, we received a letter stating the report is being finalised and the HEA will consider it and revert to the committee at that stage.</p> <p>  No. 2004 is a letter from Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in regard to speaking at next week's meeting when officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform come before the committee.  The Deputy may have thought the meeting was scheduled for last week but it is this week.  We will go through our work programme shortly.</p> <p>  No. 2009 is a letter from Deputy O'Connell requesting a number of items to be included in the follow-up information requested from Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  We will note that.  The additional information that Deputy O'Brien asked for in respect of a building in Bray will be included in the request for information.</p> <p>  The next matter is the statements and accounts received.</p></speech>

We will deal with housing this morning and the Local Government Fund and central government funding for local authorities in the afternoon.  We will have one lead speaker in the morning and one lead speaker in the afternoon and a ten-minute slot will be allocated to every other speaker.  We must finish our session on housing this morning.</p> <p>  On 7 March 2019, we will discuss the oversight and implementation of capital projects.  Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will appear before the committee in the morning.</p><p>We are going to deal with the role of public officials in capital projects, not just in the context of the national children's hospital.  </p><p> We will have a private meeting next week to complete our consideration of the draft periodic report for September through to the end of 2018.  We had a discussion about this issue previously and the secretariat will bring forward the amendments proposed.  We are nearly there in our consideration of the report.  The time slots available next Tuesday for the aforementioned private meeting are 1 p.m. and 7.15 p.m.  Which would suit members best?  In respect of the 1 p.m. slot, I remind them that Leaders' Questions in the D&aacute;il will begin at 2 p.m., which may be a little too tight.  I suggest Tuesday evening, at 7.15 p.m., would be better, given that we will all be in Leinster House.  The meeting should not take too long because we have already had a run-through on the report.</p></speech>

The meeting will not take too long.  </p> <p>  I wish to point out, with the media listening, that reports on the aforementioned document appeared on the front page of a newspaper yesterday.  I must stress that the document sent to members by email was a working document produced by the secretariat based on its best summation of the meetings of the committee.  I am saying this in order to inform members of the media that when they receive copies of such a document, they must be aware that it is not a document into which members of the committee had an input.  It is not an official committee document.  What was printed in the report I read yesterday may not concur with the final document issued by the committee.  We intend to publish our report on Wednesday, 13 March, having signed off on it next week.  Those who attend the meeting next week will be given a hard copy.  No further electronic copies will be prepared or issued.  Some member of the committee has acted unfairly by circulating the working document, but I do not know what I can do about that matter.  There are 13 committee members, one of whom has acted unfairly.  In that context, no further hard copies will be issued until the launch of the report.</p></speech>

The plan is to sign off on the report next week and publish it on the Wednesday of the following week, 13 March.  We want to have it done before St. Patrick's Day.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 14 March, we will discuss the national broadband plan with representatives of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We want to bring our consideration of that topic to a conclusion in order that we can include our views on it in an interim report which will take some time.  We have pencilled in a meeting with representatives of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in the afternoon on 14 March.  Do members consider we are taking on too much on a single day?  I am happy to leave it as is, but it is the Thursday before St. Patrick's Day.  I presume the D&aacute;il will be breaking for that week.  Is the afternoon on 14 March a good time to start to discuss a new topic or should we defer our meeting with representatives of the CSO?  I suggest we finish our deliberations on the broadband issue on the Thursday morning and arrange a new date for the meeting with representatives of the CSO.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We had hoped representatives of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board would come back to us on 28 March, but the report from PwC may not be completed by then.  In that context, we will have to move the meeting to April.  I have had a look at some of the Departments, representatives of which have not been before us recently.  There are two key Departments, with which we have not discussed Votes in recent times, namely, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I suggest we meet representatives of the former on 28 March, if members agree.  </p> <p>  On 4 April we will meet representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss the appropriation account.  There is also a chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on Garda overtime with which we will try to deal on the same day.  We may have to schedule the meeting to start at a slightly earlier time.  </p> <p>  There is also the question of the Irish Prison Service.  Some members have asked for its representatives to be invited to appear before us again.  The committee received detailed correspondence from the service last week.  If that correspondence which runs to more than 20 pages is considered inadequate, we must write back to seek further clarification.  We should do that first before deciding to invite back representatives of the service.  When they were before us, we had a detailed discussion with them, but there were some unanswered questions which, as usual, we followed up through correspondence.

While it is comprehensive, it does not answer every question we asked.  We will go back to the Irish Prison Service to seek for more information, but I ask members to contact the secretariat if they are seeking clarification on any matter related to the service.  We will write to it again to seek further clarification on certain matters.</p></speech>

We have established that there are only four doctors in the service and that 63% of prisoners are on medication.  I have received private correspondence from people who claim that they are not receiving adequate medical treatment.  I do not want this issue to end up at the door of the State Claims Agency.  We want all of these bodies to have procedures in place to log all of these issues in order that the agency will be aware, in advance, of potential medical negligence cases that could cost the State a lot of money.  We are looking at that broad issue.  We can give the information to other committees too, but we are here to deal with the issue of medical negligence in the context of costs to the State through the State Claims Agency.  We are not going to get into how the prisons are run.  The committee does not need to know that information.</p></speech>

The NTMA was very quick in carrying out its business and publishing its annual report.  Its representatives appeared before us prior to the summer break last year to discuss the annual report.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was released at the end of September.  It contained a chapter on the NTMA and we need to bring back representatives of the agency to discuss it.  A key element of that meeting will be a discussion with the State Claims Agency on issues to do with medical negligence.  We have been assembling a lot of information, but we need to close off the issue as part of our next periodic report.  We will set the date for the meeting as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We know that there is an enormous contingent liability, but it is not the only area covered by the agency.  There is, for example, a significant issue in the Air Corps.  Are we going to try to capture more than the contingent liability, or are we going to keep the focus quite narrow?</p></speech>

We will look at the full &euro;2.6 billion, the main element of which relates to health, although there are other issues.  We will examine the full State Claims Agency, not just the one key aspect.</p></speech>

There are some serious recommendations we can make that will be valuable in the future.  Given the extent of the potential liability, it strikes me that this should be a priority for us, even if we have to spend a number of days on it.</p></speech>

He left the issue open and I thank him for that.  It relates to medical negligence and to the prior step where independent inquiries are carried out.  I have gone back to check on this and I was to come back to the Chairman about it.  I have asked a very straight question regarding Galway.  Over a ten-year period, how many independent investigations were carried out?  It is a simple question.  I also asked about the cost of any such investigations.  I got back a letter which said that information is not recorded.</p></speech>

I went back twice and in two different ways.  I then went to the Minister to ask him whether he was happy with this situation.  I will now refer that question and those two answers to the committee.  Before we get to medical negligence, things inevitably happen because we are only human.  One learns from that and one should set up an investigation, whether internal or external.  I only asked about the external independent investigations.  I asked how many there had been and what they had cost and the people I asked were not in a position to give me that information.  They had no record of it.  How can we learn, how can we now what things costs, and how can we avoid costs in the future?  How can we find out how the issue ties into subsequent medical negligence cases?</p></speech>

Between now and next week, let us have a quick look at the accounts of the State Claims Agency to see whether they include information on non-medical negligence.  If not, we will agree next week to write to the agency seeking this information as soon as possible so that we will have it well in advance of the meeting.  On the Deputy's point, we have letters from the HSE which essentially accept that there is no learning process in the system.  It is very obvious what our conclusions will be when we come to conclude our work.  We have to go back through the correspondence.</p></speech>

This is central to the kind of fragmented approach being taken.  It is about processes and institutional gaps.  The very least the HSE should have is a register.  This issue is not exclusive to the HSE, however.  It is something that cuts across various bodies.  It may be something we could raise with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform next week.  It strikes me that it is the overarching Government Department in respect of the public service.  If there is going to be an outside investigation, at the very least there should be a requirement to register it so that we can know that it happened.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019022800002#F01500"><p>The health service has what is called the national incident management system, NIMS.  We need to know whether there is a similar system in other State bodies.  The State Claims Agency handles all these cases when push comes to shove.  It comes under the NTMA, which happens to come under the Department of Finance rather than the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Deputy's point is, however, right.  We will do a little bit of research to see what information we can get in respect of the State Claims Agency and we can decide what information we need before it comes back before the committee.  We are proposing to deal with the Department of Justice and Equality and that chapter in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 4 April.  We are going to write to the Prison Service in the meantime and if we are not happy with the replies we can consider putting it on the work programme for that day.  Until we get information we cannot jump to that conclusion.  We are moving the meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to 11 April, because the report scheduled for the end of March should be out at that stage.  We will then move straight on to the State Claims Agency for our next meeting after that.  We have agreed that we will also have the Department of Children and Youth Affairs before the committee.</p> <p>  While Deputy Cullinane was out, we mentioned his item of correspondence in respect of Harold's Cross.  That is in our system.  We had correspondence on the issue last autumn.  I know that it has appeared in the media again.  I am asking the secretariat to tell us precisely where we are in that regard.  We will then action the issue for the next meeting.  That was agreed in the Deputy's absence.</p> <p>  The last thing I want to say before we briefly suspend is that the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a special report on Ireland's transactions with the EU in 2017 yesterday.  It will be circulated and we will discuss it, perhaps on the day on which we will have the Department of Finance before us.  We all know that in recent years we have become a net contributor to the EU.  The report deals with that.  I have not had an opportunity to study the report.  Members can have a look at it.  In the public interest and for the public's information, it is no harm for it to be seen.  We will schedule discussion of it for the day on which the Department of Finance will be before us.  Would that be reasonable?</p></speech>

Part of the reason for compiling the report is that there is no single place where one can get an overview of our transactions with the EU.  I felt it might be useful to present such information as a framework.  There is a set of financial statements co-ordinated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the FEOGA accounts.  I believe the committee has looked at these on previous occasions.  To be quite honest, they do not give that much useful information.  I was trying to suggest an alternative presentation that might be more useful and of more value to the public.</p></speech>

It is European funding so Europe audits it.  I presume it also audits our contribution to the fund to ensure it is well spent in other countries.</p></speech>

There is a two-way relationship in respect of European Union money.  We are now a net contributor.  That is an aspect of it.  Where is the oversight of it?  A second aspect relates to fines.

Payments out go through the Central Fund.  We are the only committee which looks at the Central Fund.  We will look at that when we have the Department of Finance before us.

CCMA members are chief executives of local authorities and the committee is of the view that they play a critical role in the provision of housing.  I thank the representatives from the CCMA for making themselves available.  While we invited them to attend in order to discuss matters relating to housing, they may stay on for the remainder of proceedings.  I hope they find our deliberations interesting.  The committee has discussed the fact that provision of funding to local authorities by central government is becoming more convoluted as the years go by and we are having difficulty getting our heads around what is involved.  That is why the Comptroller and Auditor General has written a specific chapter on the matter.  Our discussion might be helpful all round.</p> <p>  I remind members that the local authorities do not fall directly under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are absolutely clear on that.  The representatives are here voluntarily and we thank them for coming.  They are not witnesses before the committee.  They are here to assist.  The Secretary General of the Department is a witness but the CCMA representatives are here as invited guests to assist us and provide information that could be of benefit.</p> <p>  From the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, we are joined by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Ms Marguerite Ryan, principal officer, Ms Mary Hurley, assistant secretary general, Ms Nina Murray, principal officer, Ms Theresa Donohue, Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Reilly, Mr. Maurice Coughlan and Ms Janet Jacobs.  From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we are joined by Ms Clare Costello and Ms Margot Dunne.  From the CCMA, we are joined by Ms Jackie Maguire, chair of the association and CEO of Meath County Council, and Mr. Conn Murray, chair of the housing committee of the CCMA and CEO of Limerick City and County Council.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off all mobile phones fully.  Merely leaving them in silent mode will not prevent them from interfering with the recording and broadcasting systems.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol. <br/><br/>We will now hear the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

Programme A, Housing, accounted for &euro;1.3 billion, amounting to almost two thirds of the Vote&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2017.  Programme C, Local Government, accounted for &euro;388 million, or 19%, and the bulk of that expenditure was accounted for in the form of a transfer of &euro;365 million to the Local Government Fund.  Programme B, Water Services, accounted for expenditure of &euro;326 million, or 16% of the Vote total, of which &euro;292 million related to payments to Irish Water.</p> <p>  The income of the Local Government Fund in 2017 was &euro;1.86 billion.  This comprised motor tax receipts of &euro;1.02 billion paid directly into the fund, local property tax transfers from the Exchequer amounting to &euro;477 million and the funding of &euro;365 million from the Vote, as referred to earlier.  Members may wish to note that significant changes have been made in the fund&rsquo;s income streams from January 2018 and the Accounting Officer will outline some of those changes for the members.</p> <p>  The fund expenditure in 2017 amounted to &euro;1.83 billion.  It should be noted that this included a payment to the Exchequer, at the direction of the Minister for Finance, amounting to &euro;230 million.  As a result, the net expenditure from the fund on programmes and services was just over &euro;1.6 billion.  Almost 40% of this was accounted for by a subvention to Irish Water.  About 38% went directly from the fund to local authorities.  Some 22% went to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for roads-related spending, and a substantial part of this was subsequently transferred to local authorities for road construction and maintenance.</p> <p>  Because of the complexity of the various fund flows, chapter 4 is compiled to present an overview of the level of net funding provided by central Government to local authorities, the purposes for which that funding is provided and trends over time.  Central Government transfers to local authorities amounted to a total of &euro;2.66 billion in 2017, up almost 20% year on year.  Most of the increase was in regard to housing and urban regeneration, which accounted for almost half of the transfers.  There was relative stability in the funding provision for other programmes in 2017.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that chapter 1 of my report for 2017 includes a summary of the Exchequer funding provided to Irish Water.  This amounted to a total of &euro;1.2 billion and comprised payments of &euro;292 million form the Vote, &euro;639 million from the fund and a capital contribution of &euro;270 million paid directly to Irish Water from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. </p></speech>

I am joined by a number of colleagues from the Department, who have been introduced.  I am pleased to have been able to facilitate the committee&rsquo;s request to have attendance on this occasion from the local government sector of our two colleagues from the CCMA, who have also been introduced.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing material for the meeting and I will, therefore, keep these comments short.</p> <p>  At the outset, I should note that, in 2017, a transfer of functions took place with the movement of a number of community-related programmes to the new Department of Rural and Community Development.  A further Revised Estimate for the year made the necessary technical changes to the Estimate to reflect the transfer and also provided funding in the Vote of almost &euro;293 million for Irish Water, arising from the Water Services Act 2017, to take account of the revenue shortfall due to the abolition of domestic water charges and the cost of related refunds.  In addition, in the course of 2017, a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;100 million was approved to meet costs arising under the local authority housing capital programmes.</p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2017, as set out in the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;2.087 billion.  In accordance with Government accounting practice, this expenditure figure reflects the position after the transfer of functions had been completed and these additional funding provisions had been made.</p> <p>  The Department had significant achievements in 2017 in delivering on key policies and programmes and I will comment briefly on a number of these.  As the committee is aware, implementation of the Government&rsquo;s six-year Rebuilding Ireland action plan is the core focus of our daily work in the Department and, indeed, across central and local government, as we strive to make meaningful, tangible and sustainable progress towards a better housing landscape.  At its meeting on 25 October last, the committee examined in some detail housing supply issues arising in the context of Vote 34 for 2017.  The Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the appropriation account, totalled some &euro;1.3 billion in 2017, including the additional &euro;100 million provided by way of Supplementary Estimate that I referred to earlier.  A further &euro;98 million was also available from local property tax, LPT, receipts to fund housing programmes of certain local authorities whose LPT allocation exceeded their LPT funding baseline, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;1.4 billion in 2017.</p> <p>  As regards 2018, gross voted expenditure on housing programmes totalled some &euro;1.97 billion.  An additional &euro;92 million was also available from LPT receipts, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;2 billion last year.</p> <p>  Table 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper for the committee today, sets out the key Rebuilding Ireland targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that has been made to the end of 2018.  At the October meeting, I shared with the committee information on progress achieved in 2017.  During 2018, significant further progress was made to deliver on the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to over 27,000 households in 2018 through the range of social housing measures in Rebuilding Ireland, significantly ahead of the target of just under 25,500.</p> <p>  Roughly one in four new homes built last year was a social housing home.  The new-build figure was 85% up on 2017 and eight times higher than 2015, the year before Rebuilding Ireland began.  Wider housing supply also continued to grow in 2018 with the number of new homes becoming available for use in the full year reaching 21,458, an 18% increase on the corresponding figure of 18,209 for 2017.  Significant progress was also made in 2018 in advancing many social housing projects through the range of delivery mechanisms and programmes.</p><p>By the end of the year, a substantial construction programme of over 19,000 units was in place to deliver further increases in the number of new social housing homes being built in the coming years.</p><p> While the numbers of homeless households supported into more sustainable housing continued to increase significantly last year, regrettably, this did not match the numbers of new households presenting to homeless services.  This area of our activity, working with housing authorities and NGOs, will continue to be the focus of priority and sustained attention in 2019.</p><p> The 2019 Estimates provision for housing amounts to nearly &euro;2.4 billion, including local property tax, LPT, receipts, the bulk of which will be devoted to the achievement of the overall 2019 target of supporting almost 27,400 households across all our social housing delivery streams.  While much has been achieved in the first half of Rebuilding Ireland in addressing the issues in our housing sector, there is much work that remains to be done.  There are demanding targets to be achieved in the years ahead and these will continue to be the focus of the absolute highest priority by the Department.</p><p> As the committee is aware, responsibility for the provision of public water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  Detailed information regarding Irish Water's progress in delivering water services is set out in its annual report for 2017.</p><p> The Government decided in September 2017 that, in line with the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services, all State funding for domestic water services should in future be provided through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  These new funding arrangements came fully into effect in 2018.  As regards 2017, over &euro;930 million in funding was provided to Irish Water from the Department, made up of almost &euro;639 million from the Local Government Fund, LGF, and almost &euro;292 million from the Vote.  The latter amount comprised &euro;114 million to take account of the revenue shortfall due to the abolition of domestic water charges and almost &euro;178 million for related refunds to customers and necessary administrative costs.</p><p> The second year of operating under the new multi-annual capital funding framework for the rural water programme was 2017.  The new structure provides greater funding certainty for priority investment needs and supports proper planning and sustainable development in rural areas.  The Department recouped just over &euro;15.3 million to local authorities during the year for capital expenditure across the six measures of the programme. </p><p> The chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report concerning central Government funding of local authorities, which we will discuss later today, provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income, detailing the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible, including housing, roads and environmental services, and the range of related funding sources.  As the chapter shows, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities in 2017 totalled some &euro;2.66 billion, an increase of nearly 20% on 2016.  The Local Government Fund accounted for 36% of this amount.  A range of Departments, including my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as other organisations, are involved in providing this annual funding to local authorities.</p><p> The Local Government Fund account for 2017 gives details of the operation of the fund during the year.  The income sources to the fund in 2017 totalled &euro;1.86 billion, made up of motor tax of just over &euro;1 billion, local property tax receipts of &euro;477 million and a payment of &euro;365 million from the Exchequer, through Vote 34.  The main payments from the LGF in 2017 were LPT funding to local authorities of just over &euro;500,000; a payment of &euro;639 million as subvention to Irish Water, which I mentioned earlier; a payment of &euro;333 million to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for works on non-national roads and for public transport infrastructure; and a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;230 million.</p><p> As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned earlier, in January 2018, responsibility for motor tax transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with consequential implications for the Local Government Fund.  In particular, motor tax proceeds are now paid directly into the Exchequer, rather than into the fund, which is now primarily a means of channelling LPT revenues to local authorities.  Funding for Irish Water is now routed through the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  Funding for roads and public transport infrastructure, formerly routed through the fund, is now channelled through the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a payment to the Exchequer from the LGF is no longer required.  Further details of these changes are in the briefing paper circulated for the meeting.  When taken together, the changes result in much greater transparency in terms of the various flows of funds involved.</p><p> In terms of accountability, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, provides statutorily independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  The LGAS audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.</p><p> Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory audit report to every member of the local authority for his or her consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  In addition, the audit committee of the relevant local authority will review any audited financial statement, auditor&rsquo;s report or auditor&rsquo;s special report in respect of the authority and will assess any actions taken within that authority in response to either a statement or report, and will report on its findings.</p><p> Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years with the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  NOAC scrutinises local government performance and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General notes in his chapter the increase in oversight of local authority spending since 2014 brought about through the operation of the commission.</p><p> Further areas of expenditure set out in the 2017 Appropriation Account include, in the planning area, meeting the costs of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which amounted to some &euro;17 million, as well as Met &Eacute;ireann costs of &euro;18 million.</p><p> The matters I have referred to illustrate well the broad range of programmes and activities for which the Department had responsibility in 2017.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s further work today.</p></speech>

I want to pick up on the thread relating to the figures for new houses and where they were generated.  I am looking at the document provided to the committee, Rebuilding Ireland - Social Housing Delivery 2018.  A note at the bottom of a table on page 2 states: "Build refers to Local Authority and Approved Housing Body construction, including traditional construction, turnkeys, rapid build delivery, regeneration and homes delivered through the Part V mechanism."</p><p>Can Mr. McCarthy break that down for the committee?  In, say 2018, how many of those local authority builds were turnkeys?  How many were regeneration?  Why does the Department not divide them up?  Within that, in our work, not necessarily this year but in future years, we need to know which is which in order that we can see where there is value for money.  I can appreciate, for example, that in parts of the country purchasing would be sensible but in other parts that option may not be available.</p></speech>

That makes it 1,200 houses plus the turnkey ones.  In the coming days, can Mr. McCarthy give us a breakdown of those, perhaps by way of a note to the committee on costs per house by local authority, because there are different values in different parts of the country and we can consider the value-for-money aspect in that regard?  When the Department provides these statistics, why does it not give that breakdown any more?  The Department used to give it.  It is actually very useful.</p></speech>

It shows a bit of spin with the 85%, given the extent of the housing lists and the challenge ahead of us.  It gives the impression that we are getting ahead of a crisis.  We could do without presenting it in that way because it is not a fair reflection on the extent of the crisis and how that crisis is being tackled.  Would Mr. McCarthy accept that?</p></speech>

Maybe just to step back for a minute, when Rebuilding Ireland was put in place clear targets were set for what was to be built, what was to be bought and what was to be leased, as well as targets for the rental accommodation scheme and for the housing assistance payment.  When it comes to build, we have always published - every quarter for the past eight quarters - a detailed construction status report showing all of the build projects, such as the turnkeys and the traditional builds, so that there is a clear build figure.  When I talk in terms of build, every one of those houses is a new-build local authority or AHB house.</p></speech>

I will skip through a few different aspects of the report.  I refer to Traveller accommodation in the Appropriation Account 2017, Vote 34, A5 housing inclusion supports, which states "Savings of &euro;4.2 million arose on traveller accommodation as a number of capital projects did not progress as anticipated."

Where did the estimate of &euro;200 million over three years come from?  Kildare, Fingal, Meath and Waterford, for example, have all exhausted their funds and started refusing applicants on the basis of insufficient funds in 2018.  Therefore, the fund is depleted.  I completely understand that is a matter for the Minister in the context of the budget for the Department and it is not for Mr. McCarthy, but what analysis was done in terms of borrowing that money and what would be required?</p></speech>

The &euro;200 million over three years was based on the extent to which borrowing actually was happening in local authorities up until then.</p><p>We felt that the &euro;200 million over three years was a reasonable first intervention.

They provide over 600 units of family accommodation.  The Deputy absolutely rightly points to the extent to which homelessness remains a really serious issue for us.

Some of the LPT was actually used elsewhere.  I suppose I am saying that those LPT figures were estimate figures.  When it came to actually distributing the LPT finally among programmes, it was distributed among some of the housing programmes differently, but in overall terms the total difference between the REV and the LPT was only &euro;1 million - between the initial Estimate and the final outturn.</p></speech>

They talked about the possibility of being able to leverage funds from other sources.  Some of that relates to putting it on a statutory basis.  I understand that is obviously in the policy area, but the Department will be working on that.</p><p>Where is it within the Department at this stage?  Many of us would have liked to see it on a statutory basis initially.  It appears to be necessary for it to be put on a statutory basis in order to bring forward the additional fund and, obviously, scale up the amount of housing that could be funded in a different way.  Where is it in the context of the discussions that are ongoing?  Are we nearly there in finalising the legislation for it?</p></speech>

That will be very welcome when it happens.  Does the liability under the capital assistance scheme rest with the Department or the local authority, or is it part of general Government debt?

As I was a member of a local authority for approximately 20 years, I appreciate that it can be difficult to get projects over the line.  Mr. McCarthy might give us a synopsis of the general problems in getting projects like the provision of Traveller accommodation over the line.  The amount of money available is relatively small.  Does the Department engage with the local authorities?  When a local authority applies for funding for a scheme, the Department agrees with the scheme and money is available, I presume it is pretty much locked down at that stage.</p></speech>

With the indulgence of the Chairman, I will ask one of my colleagues to speak about the actual practicalities involved.  During our engagement with local authorities we see issues in local communities.  Local engagement is needed to try to get projects across the line.  Sometimes there can be issues related to engagement between the local authorities and the Traveller community.  One of my colleagues from the local authorities might like to give a flavour of what it is like on the ground.</p></speech>

I will reflect on the position in Limerick.  While almost 90% of the money has been allocated, just a small amount has been drawn down, primarily because we were very late in starting the programmes for the year as a consequence of the level of negotiations required at local level with the community, the elected bodies and, more importantly, directly the community we are trying to serve.  I would like to put the issue in context.  This experience is right across the country in dealing with the Traveller community.  In the specific case of Limerick we have had to go through the courts to have people removed from sites.  We have had to use emergency planning powers to begin to construct housing accommodation on site.  That required case management.  I had to sit down with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, the ESB, the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla to look at individual families.  In some cases, the scale of the problem is challenging.  Therefore, consideration has to be given to those who best require protection and support.  Therefore, the issue must be tackled on a family by family basis and that is the approach we have taken.  It is slow, but it is important.</p></speech>

Even when we have gone through discussions, the situation can sometimes change subsequently.  That is the practicality on the ground because we might not be dealing with the same families.  I have referred to the particular issues that have to be dealt with.  It takes a considerable period of time to go through these negotiations.  Unfortunately, we find ourselves unable to proceed because agreements arrive at the last minute.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

However, we certainly have the numbers.  Sometimes we have to provide specific wrap-around supports for these families and work very closely with the approved housing bodies in doing so.

The experience in the north east was that the majority of the Traveller community were housed directly, rather than in specific schemes.  That was their preference.</p></speech>

On 4 February, Galway had 50 families in private emergency accommodation.  This figure is from the city council.  I am placing my questions in context.  There were 20 notices of termination in quarter 4 of 2018 and the cost of private emergency accommodation in 2018 was &euro;2.455 million, which sum is projected to increase to &euro;3.57 million.  The supply of suitable accommodation is diminishing and so on.  That is the report in the context of modular homes, which should not have to be built in Galway.  That is the context in which I am asking my questions today.  While I understand that our guests are implementing Government policy, there is a certain spin to it, albeit those before us have, rightly, rejected that.  If we have almost 10,000 homeless people, according to the figure supplied, there is spin going on with all of this social and public housing.</p></speech>

I will ask a number of questions on housing, but first I want to look at the accounts and at Vote 34.  Can we look at governance issues and internal financial controls on page 5?  I want to go quickly through this.  There were internal financial control issues in relation to the management of accommodation and homelessness funding.  Weaknesses were identified.  Let us take the management of accommodation.  How much money was in question in relation to the issues identified?  There was a procurement register which should have included expiry dates for contracts - very basic stuff - and a revised procedures manual.  Very quickly, how much money was involved?  Have the faults identified been rectified and are the solutions in place?</p></speech>

Well done.  I thank Mr. John McCarthy.  Staying on those accounts, I will move back to look at the urban development fund.  In fact, I will leave that for a moment and come back to it if I have the time.  I might come back in the second round.  I want to go to the housing assistance payment, or HAP, and all of the money, including HAP, that is going to sustain an unsustainable private market.  I ask Mr. John McCarthy to clarify something here.  I thank him for all the documents, which are extremely helpful.  I want to note that.  It is a good way to proceed.  I am looking at the 26 February 2019 document from the Department.  The second page sets out that the detailed results of the 2018 SSHA were published and showed that 71,858 households were assessed as in need of social housing.  I presume that number is rising.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

A terrible law was brought in under the previous Government to the effect that HAP was the only game in town and that one was considered adequately housed under it.  We have been there before.  Mr. John McCarthy does not have to disagree with me but that was the legislation brought in.  HAP is the only game in town.  We asked repeatedly what would happen when these applicants went into HAP and were told they were taken off the housing waiting list.  Is that correct?  They are taken off the housing waiting list.</p></speech>

Initially, officials were absolutely crystal clear with me in my previous life.  They said it was absolutely right that they were off the waiting list.  Since then, I have been told they were all included in the figures.  Today, the Department is telling us "No".  That is great.  That is clear.  Mr. John McCarthy is stating that a person on the HAP scheme for a year, two years or five years, which is the maximum security of tenure albeit some get less, is off the waiting list and is considered adequately housed by the Department and the Government under Government policy.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with this.  I bore people here by repeating it.  Not a single publicly funded house was constructed in Galway from 2010 until last year, when 14 houses were completed, as I understand.

In that year, for example, when &euro;619 million was going towards rent supplement and the rental accommodation scheme, the corresponding amount that was going into build, acquisition and lease programmes was &euro;314 million.</p></speech>

Nothing went into Galway city for direct social housing.  We got quarterly reports.  This is all factual.  We got columns showing what was proposed, the amount of money, and in the final column it said "construction suspended" on every single quarterly report from 2010 forward.  That is one of the major reasons we have a housing crisis.  It is one of the ingredients.  The State stopped building houses.  Now we are going forward and Mr. McCarthy is telling me the figure is &euro;423 million for this year on HAP alone.</p></speech>

The totality is that almost 10,000 people are homeless, which does not count those who are - I hate the words - "couch surfing", those women who are in refuges and so on.  Let us be realistic.  If Mr. McCarthy wants to say it is Government policy, we stick with that and the officials implement it.  However, when there is a view in respect of it, that is slightly different.  I find it unacceptable.  It is not value for money at all, never mind the humanity, to be spending millions on accommodation in hotels, hubs and so on.  There is something wrong with this policy.</p> <p>  I am going to be stopped but I want to ask one or two more questions.  Mr. McCarthy has clarified that the legislation on voluntary houses is coming.  Brexit has stalled it.

Does that include the total number that have come into HAP and some that have gone out of HAP properties?  When it is measured against the number of active tenancies at a point in time, the percentage is over 100% but if we were to look at the number of properties that were in HAP during the period, it might not have been over 100%.

We were not able to aim for that figure initially in Rebuilding Ireland but we subsequently upped the ambition.  That 50,000 target is one part of Rebuilding Ireland.</p></speech>

We have record levels of homelessness and, as the report says, a lack of residential construction and lack of social and affordable housing.  We know this has the knock-on effect of driving up rents and we had a lengthy discussion about this the last time Mr. McCarthy attended the committee.  This makes our capital city very uncompetitive in many ways.  The reports and the evidence suggest that the Department is not getting to grips with the housing crisis to the extent that it is suggested.  Has Mr. McCarthy accepted what the European Commission said on the lack of social and affordable housing and the impact this has on driving up rents?  Does Mr. McCarthy accept that the homelessness figures published yesterday show the Department is far from getting a grip on the housing crisis?</p></speech>

It has two overarching targets.  One is to get to an overall housing supply position of 25,000 homes per annum.  The other target is the additional 50,000 social housing over the six years.  At this point, which is halfway through the six year plan, we are where we should be or slightly ahead.  We have talked at this committee previously - and the Deputy has referred to it again - about the extent to which issues in the housing space and the sub parts of the housing space are all connected with each other.  If there is inadequate housing supply there are obviously more people competing for the available supply and it has knock-on consequences for rents, for house prices and for homelessness.  With Rebuilding Ireland we have tried to address all of those elements of the housing space starting with the overall housing supply to get to the 25,000.  The Central Statistics Office now publishes that data, which show we are on track to achieve that.</p></speech>

One can set whatever targets one likes but if they do not aspire to substantially deal with the housing crisis, one can say the targets are substantially being met.  Given the level of homelessness, however, and the European Commission's report the evidence suggests that targets are not sufficient and they need to be substantially increased.</p> <p>  I shall move to Mr. Murray on the targets for 2018 and I wish to address the issue of builds.  A total of 14 local authorities did not meet the new build targets.  This is 14 out of 31 local authorities.  How were 14 local authorities not able to meet their targets under new builds given the housing crisis, which is not just in Dublin but right across the State? </p></speech>

There are differences in what can be achieved during a particular year in the build programme and what can be achieved in a previous year.  In our case we may have overachieved in a particular year but - and the committee has probably looked at the statistics on this - we did not get our full programme across the ground this year.  When we consider why, it was because we had difficulty getting Part 8 planning through the council.  We had to go back out to the community and there were slight delays.  The progress for 2019, 2020 and 2021, however, will be on target.</p></speech>

We are always being told and promised that there will be more delivery in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  We can only judge each local authority on what they have delivered this year and in previous years.  We are in the midst of a housing crisis.  I believe that Mr. Murray's Limerick City and County Council achieved 80% of its target.</p></speech>

This includes local authority approved housing bodies and Part V units.  Does Mr. Murray believe that 122 units in a city and county the size of Limerick that are real social housing builds is an acceptable number?  The target was only 80% met.  It is not an acceptable target, and it is not acceptable to not meet the target and to deliver only 112 new builds when there is a significant housing crisis that also affects people in Limerick.  Can Mr. Murray stand over a figure of 112 new builds for 2018?</p></speech>

The 1,171 additional tenancies this year is something we are actually delivering upon.  Part and parcel of that is the overall spectrum of the builds.</p></speech>

Absolutely - when I talk about new builds.  I will come back to Mr. McCarthy shortly on the total spend on RAS and HAP.  Moving on from Limerick, Galway City Council only met 25% of its new build target and only 27% of its overall target, which would include builds, acquisitions and leasing.  Westmeath County Council only met 34% of its target and Wicklow County Council only met 55% of its new build target and 58% of its overall target.</p><p>While we might have come close to meeting targets in overall terms, that is mainly because we shifted more towards acquisitions after not meeting our leasing targets.  What is the Department doing about the 14 local authorities that have not met their build targets, in particular the worst performers that came substantially under target?</p></speech>

I misheard the Deputy.  Regarding local authority builds, we continually try to work collaboratively with our colleagues in local authorities and AHBs to ensure that those who have had difficulties meeting their targets can be brought up to a 100% delivery level.  Some of that involves learning from those authorities that have exceeded their targets.  In some cases, it involves putting specific arrangements in place.  In Dublin, for example, we have had a social housing delivery task force.  We have had a similar task force in Cork and are putting another in place in Galway.  What we try to do is adopt a supportive and engaging role with local authorities, understand what specific problems there may be in particular areas and work collaboratively on dealing with them.</p></speech>

I have no problem with retweets where the performance of ministerial duties is concerned, but these are not departmental accounts.  The tweets were political and housing related.  Both included graphics that boasted about housing numbers in Dublin and clearly displayed the Fine Gael logo.</p> <p>  When the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach appeared before us not that long ago, the issue of the infamous strategic communications unit and the blurring of lines between news and spin or, as I call it, the buying of news were discussed.  I have just come from the D&aacute;il Chamber where we were trying to protect the mainstream media with our motion on local radio and promoting fact-based news, yet here we have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government using subliminal messaging.  Any marketing manager - I come from that sphere - will say that imagery matters and penetrates.  The Department's account, which is State owned, is retweeting @campaignforleo and @MurphyEoghan with a clearly identifiable Fine Gael logo.  Why is the Department retweeting political accounts carrying the Fine Gael Party's logo on the Rebuilding Ireland account?  Are there internal social media guidelines in that regard?</p></speech>

There have been contributions from Deputies this morning on the failings of aspects of any account.  Surely we could have retweets by the main Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, when he is pointing out failures, which carries the Fianna F&aacute;il logo?  We could have retweets of that so that people accessing that Twitter account can get the full picture.  I have a real problem with that.  We saw with the strategic communications unit an attempt, through social media, because marketing and imagery matter, to present a particular picture.  These guys are well-paid and highly-educated about this fear and sending a message through a graphic.  This was not a Minister on-site turning the sod.  It was a Fine Gael graphic with a message.  I have a significant difficulty with that because these guys are as cute as foxes and are trying to get that imagery out.  A Department retweeting that has major ethical issues.</p></speech>

While there is good visibility of the numbers of households coming onto the list because they are assessed, there is not the same visibility of those whose circumstances may have changed and who may no longer be in need of social housing support.  They may have moved area or may have moved out of the country.  We do the count once a year because it provides an opportunity to present the full picture of the numbers that have come on and off.  We will do that again in June.  The target for 2019 is to support just less than 27,400 households this year.  We will break those targets down by local authority shortly.</p></speech>

How do two counties with big populations, Limerick and Meath, feel that those net figures coming down will pan out over the next decade in breaking down those stubborn numbers?  When do they feel that they could actually achieve a diminution of a significant nature of their respective housing lists?  The biggest thing one hears from local authority members and Deputies who have people coming into their constituency offices is that people are on the list for eight, nine or ten years.  As Mr. McCarthy said, the net figures are coming down.  Where could one really put a hole in the CCMA's targets and managerial structures, taking those two counties as a snapshot?  When do they think, in the next ten years, they will have their figures reduced by 50% or 70%?</p></speech>

The impact of the Part V acquisitions is having a very positive effect on certain cohorts of household, especially families of three or more.  With regard to housing a family in a three-bedroom house, we are eating into that when we were not in the past.  The area that we see as a challenge is single accommodations, including predominantly single male applicants on the list.  The emphasis and priority at present is on families, family structures and getting family homes built.  We had a gap of not building housing for many years and we have seen a very positive impact in the last three years relating to that family cohort.  I suspect the challenge for us will be similar across other local authorities and relates to single accommodations that we need to start building again.</p></speech>

I would be loath to put years on it because it will always be brought up that I said we will have a substantial amount of the list diminished in five or six years.</p><p>From our perspective, and from the perspective of numbers still joining the list, households that are still forming and the young population we have, I suspect it is still going to take at least five or six years to eat further into the demand that we see.</p></speech>

There has been a 42% reduction on the existing housing list.  I worked in housing through the 1980s and 1990s.  Fluctuations within the economy have always affected the level of direct builds and, as a consequence, those lists increased during those times.  We need a continuation of the drive that now exists over the next ten years or longer, to keep pace with the coming challenges.  Those challenges will be different.  We are dealing with diverse cultures, and diversity within our cities and counties.  We need to continue the drive in the context of housing over the next number of years and understand that there are going to be different requirements at different times.</p></speech>

The CEO of NAMA was before this committee before Christmas, and spoke about the properties that were made available to local authorities, and the take-up of those properties.  In fairness, both the Department and NAMA provided statistics on that.  One comment made by the Housing Agency that irked me at the time was that there was an over-concentration of supply of social housing in particular areas.  I recognise that the witnesses from the CCMA are representing managers of all local authorities.  What generally is their attitude on that issue ?  I am conscious that a manager from Limerick is present.  I have covered the issues facing the regeneration programme there and the need to address historical issues. The witnesses will also be aware of good housing estates in my home town of Navan.  I have a philosophy that is perhaps different from that of the Housing Agency on this issue, because I believe in affordable social housing on a significant scale.  I recognise the progress being made in puncturing those numbers to the level we have seen.  Can the witnesses comment on large scale housing?</p></speech>

However, I have also lived the challenge of managing housing in Limerick and seen how a policy from the 1970s has destroyed many lives, which have had to be rebuilt.  I have seen the NAMA figures being bandied about, and I examinee at what was offered in my location.  Of the houses offered, 20 were holiday homes and golf estates.  That is absolutely unacceptable in the context of what we are trying to do.  In other instances sites, rather than houses, were offered.  They were rejected for good reasons; they were not acceptable for the type of need we have to meet and the locations required at this point in time.  We would not refuse houses unnecessarily; I assure the Deputy of that.  Our job is to try to provide as many people with homes as we can, but we have to do it as best we can in the context of what is on offer.</p></speech>

The great reduction in housing lists and the great work being done in Limerick is a credit to Mr. Murray and his team.  Is the same policy in place nationally for the HAP and rental accommodation schemes?  Does every local authority consider people to be off the list if they are in receipt of HAP?  My sense is that different local authorities take different approaches to that.</p></speech>

However, all HAP recipients are given the option of going onto the transfer list, which is the mechanism all local authorities use to provide for movements within social housing supports locally.  That might be someone in a mainstream social home which no longer meets his or her needs and who might need to move to another larger home.  It is operated locally, and perhaps one of my colleagues could discuss its operation.</p></speech>

They preferred to stay where they were.  That is a genuine reflection of where some communities are.  I cannot say that is reflected across the country at this stage, but it is something we are looking at.  Choice-based letting is an opportunity to enable people to focus on where they want to be within their own community.  It is sometimes the case that where they are currently residing is more suitable.</p></speech>

I imagine it is the same in all local authorities.  Most tenants will accept that initially, but we have certainly found that people come back and ask to be removed from the list.  That does not preclude them from rejoining the list at a later date again.  They are all given the choice to go on the transfer list.</p></speech>

The reason for that is that we gave local authorities targets, but let them know that if they were further along the pathway and could deliver more than their targets, they could.  We have funded local authorities to go beyond their targets, which is reflected in the performance reports which have been released.</p></speech>

A county manager makes contact with the Department and tells it that there is a site in his or her county with sufficient space for 50 units.  Mr. McCarthy will probably throw statistics at me and talk about 59-week turnarounds and so on.</p><p>In practice, there is an administrative merry-go-round that somewhat baffles me.  If Developer A goes to Meath County Council and states he or she has 100 acres and wants to build a certain number of units and provides the design, the local authority's planners and various experts will either grant planning permission or not.  If it is granted, the developer will build.  Why, then, do we make local authorities jump through so many hoops and engaged in toing and froing with the Department and the building unit in Ballina?  It goes back and up and down in this four-stage process.  During a D&aacute;il debate I brought into the Chamber what was called the streamlined version, which was ironic given how thick it was.  We seem to have most of this expertise in local authorities already so why are we passing information up and down?  Why does the planner in Leitrim or the architect in Meath, who have the expertise, have to be second guessed by somebody in Dublin or in the building unit?  A private developer wants to go in, get planning permission and build.  The lead time for assessments in the private sector is 18 months to two years but, in the public sector, it can be as bad as three to six years depending on the case.  What are we doing about this?  There seems to be a level of unnecessary bureaucracy, which is bound to be adding costs, never mind time and delivery delays.</p></speech>

Inevitably, there have been projects of this type.  What happened in the crash and in the years immediately afterwards was that many projects in the system ground to a halt.  It was quite a few years before they came back.  The Deputy rightly pointed to the importance of things not bouncing backwards and forwards between the Custom House and local authorities.  He and other representatives rightly find this frustrating.  I find it frustrating and I know my colleagues here find it frustrating.  This is why we and the sector sat down to agree timeframes for the completion of the four-stage approval process so we could all be held to account for what we are doing.</p> <p>  To go back to the Deputy's first question which, if I have interpreted it correctly, is on why we have the four-stage approval given what happens with private development, the real issue is it is because they are public funds, for which I am here to be accountable.  To protect public funds, the public spending code applies to public programmes to try to ensure we get best value for money.</p> <p>  When we speak about second guessing, I would like to think the second guessing that might arise would be where a proposal might come forward in which the cost is beyond what we would expect it to be.  This is where value engineering comes in, to see whether we could redesign the scheme in some way that would get us a better value for money outcome.  From a cost control point of view, this is the real value of the four-stage approval process.  As we go from preliminary design to post planning we can see whether the detailed design or planning approval added costs.  We have opportunities at stages along the way to see whether we can do something to address additional costs that may arise.  Its prime purposes are cost control, the protection of public funds and achieving value for money.  Colleagues from the local authorities experience it from the other side.  I am quite happy to-----</p></speech>

We are speaking about local authorities and people of integrity.  I will come to auditing local authorities in a second.  It is not rocket science that the cost per building we expect in Sligo is X per square metre which it might be different in Dublin.  There are broad parameters that any good valuation house or quantity surveyor house could provide, so that if Ms Maguire tells the Department 150 houses are ready to be built in Navan, she is happy with the design scheme, provides the cost and states all the local authority needs is the money, the Department can cross-check it against the market through quantity surveying expertise and give the local authority the money so it can get on with it.  We would get the same value for money.</p> <p>  This is not about policy.  The policy is to build houses.  I have read the four-stage process and I rolled around laughing.  I do not know how a local authority sets about building anything.  The expertise is available.  We are not talking a national children's hospital level of complexity.  People either have the expertise or not and most local authorities do.  On-site quantity surveying and tendering expertise may not be there but for a relatively small cost it could be procured.</p> <p>  What metrics and analysis are there to show our four-stage process has saved us X, given X percentage better value for money or increased units or outturn?  My sense is that with the best will in the world the four-stage process costs money, is bureaucratic, causes delay and certainly does not capture what we seem to be calling a national housing emergency.  We either trust local authorities to do this or we do not.  This might free up a lot of staff that heretofore have been very involved in the four-stage process.  That is fine.  We could create an enforcement division and let them go on tour to make sure everything is being done right throughout the country or pop into the local authority in Sligo or Leitrim to ask how everything is being done.  The delivery of units, which is the policy and what we are all about, would be much better.  It is just a suggestion.</p> <p>  The local authorities are not responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Mr. McCarthy is the accounting officer for local authorities and a large amount is given from the Department to local authorities.  Is it correct that the Department does not audit them?</p></speech>

This issue arose when water service related legislation was before the line committee, from memory, in late 2017 and early 2018.  I think the Minister indicated that he was favourably disposed towards exploring the potential for the Comptroller and Auditor General to play a role.  Again, the Comptroller and Auditor General can either correct or contradict me on anything I say, in case I am not entirely accurate, but there are a number of complexities.  Irish Water has been established under company law as a company and its accounts have to be audited by what is called a statutory auditor.  For these purposes the Comptroller and Auditor General is not a statutory auditor.  The matter is also complex in the sense that Irish Water is a subsidiary of Ervia, the accounts of which also have to be audited.  They are dealt with in accordance with the Companies Acts.</p> <p>  There is a third issue that needs to be considered, not so much perhaps from a formal audit point of view but from the point of view of value for money, similar to what the Comptroller and Auditor General might do in the case of the bodies he audits.  There are value for money review arrangements in place through the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities.  All of Irish Water's operating expenditure and capital plans have to be submitted to the commission which has to approve them.  It will only approve expenditure that it regards will be efficiently incurred.  There is a very elaborate value for money regime in place through the commission.  These issues are being looked at, but that is one of the matter that obviously will need to be considered.</p></speech>

Having gone through the four-stage approval process, it is actually being implemented at a cost of &euro;4.17 million.  For another project, at its highest point, budget proposed was &euro;8.86 million, but it is being implemented at a cost of &euro;7.12 million.  There are very clear examples to show how the process has actually worked in getting better value for money.</p> <p>  I think the Deputy mentioned the enforcement division going on tour.  The issue with it is as follows.  What the four-stage approval process gives us is an opportunity to capture and consider potential increases in cost before they actually happen to see if can we actually strip some of them out.  Ultimately, it is the Exchequer and the taxpayer that fund projects.  With the enforcement division approach, very often one will have lost that opportunity because matters will have moved on.</p></speech>

While I do not doubt that the system is meant to kick in, I do not believe it does.  I know from my own experience in Cork city where I was a member of the council for 11 years and from people who come to my constituency office that some of the most squalid properties are HAP tenancies.  There are health and safety issues, yet a fortune is being paid to private landlords.  In most cases, inspections do not take place and, when they do and the properties fail, the tenants are just left there.  Perhaps other members of the committee might have heard about cases and, if so, they can correct me, but I have yet to hear of one case where a HAP tenancy failed an inspection and the tenant was transferred out of it as a matter of priority.  I just do not believe that happens.</p></speech>

Speaking from experience and the number of people coming into my constituency office who do not have basics such as heating or hot water or who are experiencing leaks and windows falling out, I know that there are major health and safety issues.  These people are getting no support from local authorities and are basically given the option of staying in the property they are in or entering homelessness services.  I do not believe it is not a major issue.  I do not know if we are keeping that kind of data but if we are not, I suggest that we should.</p><p>The biggest reason for people entering homelessness services is a landlord giving a notice to quit on the grounds that a family member is moving in, major refurbishment work is to be done or the property is to be sold.  I have come across many cases - certainly not a handful - where these are not the reasons.  The tenant may be evicted on those grounds but a couple of months later the property would be up on <i>daft.ie</i>with a massive increase in rent.  I put it to both the Department and city and county managers that this is a loophole to get around rent caps in certain areas.  I wonder if there is any evidence to support that.</p></speech>

Approximately the same amount arise because of what are called "family reasons", etc.  We certainly hear anecdotal evidence similar to what the Deputy has described, where a notice to quit might have been served on the basis of a property being sold or used by a family member before the property comes back on the market.  There is an item of legislation going through both Houses designed to strengthen the enforcement powers available to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to be able to track those sorts of cases and it has just finished Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Some issues are still being considered with a view to introducing amendments on Committee Stage or possibly in the Seanad.  The matter has been brought to our attention and although we do not have hard data, we want to put the RTB in a position to be able to track and identify those cases and deal with them as appropriate.</p></speech>

The transfer list consists of people directly applying for transfers.  People who go into HAP have an option in terms of a transfer and an offer will go in that regard if they choose to move from their locality.  In Limerick County Council, 38 people came from the rental accommodation scheme to direct housing and 79 people came across from HAP.  We had 529 new HAP tenancies.

Of the 2,022, how many are new properties that did not exist previously as part of a regeneration where properties were knocked and rebuilt?  How many additional houses did local authorities build?</p></speech>

The focus is on direct builds but the number of homes we provide is what counts at the end of the day.  Regeneration is not simply a process of rebuilding houses.</p><p>It is a revitalisation of those communities, which is far more than just restoration or rebuilding houses.</p></speech>

Of those, 300 are either in construction or being delivered currently, and the balance is already going through the stages with the Department.  That is a ten year plan and we are already four years ahead of that.  Overall they are the units we have to provide.  I cannot go back over the history of it and say how many were demolished.

How many households are supported by the Department through the help-to-buy scheme, HAP, Rebuilding Ireland home loans, acquisitions and new builds?  I will move on to the next question if someone is getting the answer for Mr. McCarthy.</p> <p>  I hear from my colleague beside me that the help-to-buy scheme has been a great success.  At the time, there was much talk that it was an inflationary proposal and that it would cause prices to increase and would not be successful but I have been informed that 10,000 people have taken this up, the budget is gone and the Government is looking at increasing the budget.  Could Mr. McCarthy talk me through the successes of the parameters set at that time?  I refer to the &euro;500,000 price cap, the maximum purchase price of &euro;320,000, the five-year tax rebate period and the successes of an initiative the Department came up with.  I am trying to be positive about housing.  </p> <p>  In respect of HAP, I read a Library and Research Service, LRS, document because I was struck by some of the commentary here - I was not here earlier but I was keeping an eye on proceedings - about HAP tenancies.  The figures from the LRS  not the Department's figures - show that 44% of notices to quit are because of arrears where people not paying rent.  Perhaps there is something I do not understand here but a person providing a HAP property is usually a private citizen, an accidental landlord or someone in the business, who has a property.  According to the LRS the number of people being given notice to quit for rent arrears is 44%.  One can combine the next two figures.  The figure for notices to quit because the landlord wishes to sell the property is 20% while the figure for notices to quit to because of family use is 8%.  I agree that a bit of messing might be going on within that 28% but I want to be sure that the correct information is going out from this committee.  It is almost being put out there that people are being thrown out of HAP homes under false pretences and that the house or apartment is then put on the market.  Could Mr. McCarthy elaborate on those figures in order that we can get the facts out today?  Has he any answer to my first question before I move on to the next question?  </p></speech>

I will take them in pieces if that is okay.  The total number of social housing households supported under Rebuilding Ireland last year was just over 27,100.  That breaks down as 17,926 on HAP, 4,251 through build programmes, 560 voids, 2,610 acquisitions, just over 1,000 leasing units and 755 RAS units.  Although some of the individual elements came in under target while others came in over target, in overall terms, the figure of 27,103 was 6% ahead of the overall target for the year.</p></speech>

If we took the money being provided to HAP and RAS and transferred it to capital programmes involving building or buying, we would only manage to support a fraction of the more than 18,000 people supported through RAS and HAP.  If we took the associated funding for those two programmes in 2018, which between them would have come to &euro;420 million, and applied it to capital programmes, we would not even support 1,000 households.</p></speech>

If we just got rid of it to be populist, I assume we would put the money into building houses.  However, the problem is that it takes time to build houses.  What do we, therefore, with the families in the interim period?  I have failed to find an answer to this question about what we would do with that cohort of people in the interim period from anybody.  I think Mr. McCarthy has given me an answer.</p></speech>

It is important to put it in context.</p><p>If we look at Rebuilding Ireland and the six-year profile of what we aim to achieve, as we started out in 2016 we recognised that, as we spoke about earlier, we were coming from a situation in which the local authority building programme and, indeed, the approved housing body building programme had virtually ground to a halt due to lack of funding.  We recognised that in the early years of Rebuilding Ireland, as the build programme and other elements ramped up, we would be reliant on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, to a greater extend.  As one looks through the six years one will see that the mix of elements changes.  We aim to be assisting more households through measures other than HAP and RAS than through HAP and RAS combined when we get to the end of Rebuilding Ireland in 2021.  That is an important evolution that takes account of the reality of an increasing funding envelope as the years go on and of where we came from in terms of actual activity.  As I have said, the build programmes had literally ground to a halt.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of the help to buy scheme.  I am probably not the best person to speak about this scheme as it is a tax measure but I know from engagements on the issue that almost 10,000 households have been approved under the scheme.</p></speech>

The Deputy also asked about the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  As of the end of January, approximately 575 households had drawn down the loan.  With regard to arrears in the private rental sector and the issue of notices to quit, the Residential Tenancies Board's annual report for 2017 gives a broad breakdown of the main reasons for notices to quit.  Some 44% were related to rent arrears, 20% to landlords selling properties, 8% to landlords wanting the property for a family member, and approximately 8% to refurbishment.  There are other factors but they make up smaller percentages.  Those are the main ones.</p></speech>

It is important to say that buildings need maintenance.  There is a certain argument out there in this regard.  I understand that and there are landlords who use these reasons to get rid of people, but there are also genuine people out there who need to maintain their buildings.  I hear from real people who are renting in the real world that sometimes it suits them to move out for a few weeks.  People often move back into the same unit because if a genuine landlord is trying to provide genuine high-quality accommodation, the landlord may put in insulation and do the pipes and a tenant with whom he or she has a good relationship may move somewhere for a few weeks while it is being done and then move back.  There is almost an argument that refurbishment never has to happen but we know from looking at the history of Dublin city and at the lack of refurbishment in tenements in the Georgian inner city that we had a similar problem generations ago.  I would like to note that today.</p></speech>

I want to ask about interruptions in the supply chain.  When Private Members' Bills come through the Oireachtas, they sometimes create uncertainty.  I refer to things like the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018.  As we saw to some extent with the review of Rebuilding Ireland a few years ago and the changes in rules in respect of apartments, any uncertainty in the market halts the market temporarily.  Does the uncertainty around the Anti-Evictions Bill present real risks to supply in terms of landlords pulling back from the system because of the uncertainty created in these Houses?</p></speech>

Will Mr. McCarthy, as quickly as possible, summarise the concept of the Land Development Agency and outline the mix, the minimum social housing proportion, and the plan in that regard?  From looking at the figures, I believe social housing is being ramped up.  We are in a great place but there is a huge issue in respect of affordability when it comes to people's net pay at the end of the week.  In business studies, we were told that one should spend 30% on rent or mortgage payments but we are now in a situation in which so much of families' incomes are going on rent or the mortgage that they basically cannot live.  I am concerned about affordability for people with young families.  Will Mr. McCarthy articulate how this use of State land will help those real people?</p></speech>

We need to address the issues in all those strands and we are doing that.  One of the issues raised consistently is around the use of public land.  People ask why public land is not being brought into use for housing to a greater extent.  There is a significant uptick in the use of land owned by local authorities, particularly for social housing, but there is also land in wider public ownership.  The Land Development Agency was established to lead the process of bringing parcels of available public sector land into use for multiple purposes related to housing, including general housing delivery and the delivery of social housing through Part V.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.707" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>There is also a 30% minimum for affordable housing.  The aim is to contribute to addressing the housing delivery issues that exist in all of those strands of the housing market.  The other aspect in terms of affordability is the serviced sites fund which is designed to support local authorities bringing some of their lands into play for affordable housing.  The first round of approvals under that fund were issued in December and there will be another call for proposals under the fund issuing shortly.  Initially, it was targeted at the Dublin, greater Dublin, Cork and Galway authorities.  We have now asked other authorities to look at the affordability issues in their areas.  As such, the second call will be wider once we have completed the analysis of the economic assessments local authorities provide.</p></speech>

Rebuilding Ireland is a Government policy which the witnesses are required to carry out.  Mr. McCarthy referred earlier to 50,000 houses per year.  The all-party Oireachtas committee produced its report in 2016.  The No. 1 item in the report in terms of the conclusions was to increase the social housing stock owned by local authorities and AHBs by at least 50,000.  That would be a minimum of 10,000 builds per year.  In what year will there be 10,000 builds?</p></speech>

It includes acquisitions.  We consider stock to include long-term leased units which are available in many cases for 25 years.  The 50,000 is a combination of all three to be achieved by 2021.</p></speech>

There is value for money in the approach that is taken.  Last week, when the Irish Council for Social Housing appeared before the committee, its representatives set out an ambitious plan if a regulation was put on a statutory basis in respect of the number of houses they could build.  They were being held back by virtue of not being on a statutory footing.  I have always accepted that people have to live somewhere while houses are being built.  However, the way it is playing out is perhaps the most costly way by virtue of the time it is taking.  Other funds could have been leveraged from, for example, credit unions and the European Investment Bank.  In 2021, we are looking at 87,000 households, which will be enormously expensive.  Does Mr. McCarthy have a figure on what it will cost at its maximum?</p></speech>

They are dealt with on an annual basis.  It is important to bear in mind that of the 87,000 households to be supported under HAP and RAS, a significant proportion will include people who move from rent supplement across to have their social housing needs met.  It is a process that has been under way since 2014.  Coming back to the discussion with Deputy O'Connell, and as Deputy Catherine Murphy has acknowledged herself, there is a need to provide supports for people within the envelope of resources available to us.  The mix that is there involves a significant build-up of the permanent social housing stock as well as significant numbers in HAP and RAS.</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with a sense of any scheme providing support.  We need to support people.  When it is the major player in the housing market, I have a serious problem regarding value for money.  When a figure doubles within a year and continues to increase, I have a serious problem as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Built into that is lack of security and many other problems.  That is just in respect of HAP, which has been enshrined in legislation as, in its implementation, the only game in town.  Mr. Murray and Ms Maguire are from the CCMA.

Each local authority is required to develop a Traveller accommodation plan and it is up to each local authority to deliver on its plan.  The Department allows for an overall spend nationally but does not set targets for an overall figure of units.  We established that earlier.  Is it not the case that over the past three years while funding has increased, most local authorities are not even reaching their own targets?  We know that six of the 31 met their targets.  Ten had no delivery at all and the rest did not reach their targets.

The buck stops with the Department when it allocates funding for a specific purpose and that funding is not drawn down.

The Secretary General has mentioned a report to be published in April.  That may or may not make some structural or policy changes.  The delivery of Traveller accommodation in the State is poor.  Under the Act, responsibility for that lies with the local authorities, two of whose chief executives are in the room.

I have no doubt that if it was up to them, they would house everyone on their lists in the morning.  I am not suggesting there is some conspiracy to keep people on lists.  What are the main barriers the witnesses see in their positions on local authorities?  Is the main issue funding, planning, a lack of land, contractors or skilled labour or a combination of all of those factors?</p></speech>

There is a combination of issues.  There is no single issue.  We came from a very low base.  We had to start again in getting the right skills and people.  That took time.  That is a fact of life.  2018 saw one of the worst winters for quite some time where the construction programme is concerned.  That affected our operations.  Did we have issues in the very beginning?  Previous Deputies referred to the processes.  We have been in discussions with the Department and we have agreed on a good process.  There is a four-stage process that takes 59 weeks and a single-stage process that is slightly shorter than that.  That is the time period.  It has taken us time to get through that process but we are running it well.  Hence, on occasion, an acquisition is far better and of far more value.  Hence, a turnkey, on occasion if it is presented to me, is of far more value.  That is reflected in the overall figures that have been produced at the end of the year.  The barriers are always there and there are always issues.  There might be an issue with the land, the location, the community or indeed the council itself.  Some of the committee members' parties will know what is involved in Part 8 applications.  It is hard to get them through, despite the willingness to provide social housing.  Those are the realities.</p></speech>

It was not easy for its members.  There was a split down the middle between different parties, many of whom are represented here today.  That is a fact of life.  That is local politics.  It is the nature of the democratic system at local level.  We have to go through that.  The Part 8 system is a critically important part of that negotiation.</p></speech>

People are not against social housing, but we have land in some very settled areas that have not been developed for years.  We are moving into them and this disrupts a community.  It therefore takes time to make the necessary adjustment when putting new housing in.  Settled communities are disrupted.  That is a fact of life.  That is part and parcel of it.  It is not an objection to housing <i>per se</i>.  Locals acknowledge that traffic issues might increase or school provision might not be sufficient.  There are planning issues which need to be addressed.</p></speech>

Mr. Murray can correct me if I am wrong.  In Cork, 50% of the housing waiting list is made up of single people.  We are not building any properties to cater for that cohort.  Most of the turnkey developments are three-bedroom or four-bedroom properties, which are more suitable for families.  Is the type of development a difficulty when local authorities look at housing lists and try to plan for the years ahead?  Is there even scope to take concern on board or is it just a case of needing to build or purchase as much as possible now to address a crisis?</p></speech>

We have to ensure that we do not make the mistakes of the past and that we look for a sustainable mix in tenure.  There is a role for the Land Development Agency, LDA, in avoiding this type of situation arising again.  There is a place for drawing up master plans for locations.  Our development plans can then determine what the mix should be.  That plan should allow for single accommodation, two-bedroom houses and three-bedroom houses as the need arises.  That is certainly the way we would approach any private sector developers coming to the table at this stage.  We want the appropriate mix, not just what might sell on the market.  We dictate or determine the type of use or mixed tenure that is built.  We have acquired 200 acres and are now drawing up a master plan for the development of more than 3,000 units.  Some 26 ha of that is within the local authority area, so we are advancing delivery.  We are using the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and we have already built two schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Pre-planning is important for the future.</p><p>At the moment, we have to try to get as much accommodation as possible while trying to keep that sustainable balance.</p></speech>

Some of the evidence I have is that we have individuals in three and four bedroom properties who wish to downsize and are finding it very difficult to do that due to red tape and so on.</p></speech>

We were in a position to be able to rehouse them to either apartment accommodation, which they chose because they wanted to be near the centre of town, or whatever suited them given their particular circumstances.  The issue we have as local authorities is gathering information on the level of under-occupancy within houses.  We need to do that.  Obviously, it has to be the tenant's choice but we would have had some positive experiences in the past 18 months of people coming forward willingly to say they wish to give up their house to live nearer the centre of town or because they might want to be in an apartment block or near various services, depending on their circumstances.</p></speech>

I have a general observation to make about the Department and it is nothing to do with the Secretary General.  It is a historical issue.  I will put my question by way of giving examples.  If we ask the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the number of people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, it can provide that information every week.  If we ask the HSE for the number of medical cards it has issued, it can provide an answer today, tomorrow or next week.  It knows how many medical cards have been issued and cancelled.  In terms of the Revenue Commissioners and PAYE, everybody can have their tax credits up-to-date on a weekly basis and it is all done online in real time.  When we come to Mr. McCarthy's Department, and this is not personal to him, I ask him to address the historical deficit, as I would call it, in that regard.  He cannot do it now; it is a long-term project.  We ask for the number of people on the housing lists and the Department produces a list once a year.  Imagine if the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection only had information once a year on the number of claimants for all its schemes or the HSE only had information the number of people on medical cards once or year.  Imagine if the Revenue said it would issue one tax clearance or tax credit certificate to last for 12 months.  Mr. McCarthy's Department is almost medieval in terms of its statistics system.  He should not take this personally.  Every other Department is up to date.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government gets its figures from local authorities.  I cannot understand why, in this day and age, there is not a standardised system in the Department across every local authority.  Let us say the Department compiles its housing list in the middle of the summer and has 70,000 people on it.  It then processes 400 cases a week in the different local authorities and 26 people are taken off the list because they have been allocated housing.  It is beyond comprehension in this century that the Department does not have a list setting out the figures for each local authority every week.  That should be available every day if the system was up to date.  I find it strange.  The Department is very busy but we are used to people having up-to-date information.  Even the letter we got today in response to the question on net need refers to exclusions, for example, duplicate applications, those already in receipt of social housing support, which is one of the issues we have been talking about, or who are on a transfer list.  The next sentence states: "While data is not available on the numbers of households under each of the above headings ...".  If officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection came in here and made comments like that, we would be amazed.  As a long-term plan, the flow of information is extraordinary.  Mr. McCarthy might want to respond-----</p></speech>

I would make three comments in response to that.  Some of the bodies the Chairman cited are single bodies.  We do a lot of our work through 31 local authorities and one of the things we continually struggle with is the local authority saying, "You are collecting too much information from us and you are harassing us for this, that and the other."  We always try to strike a balance.</p> <p>  To come back to the point the Chairman made on the transfer lists and why we have not collected data in respect of that, historically we have viewed that as being a matter to be administered locally.  We do not want to add it to data collection we are doing from local authorities.</p> <p>  In terms of the housing list, unlike the number of claimants who are on jobseeker's benefit or something like that, those are the actual people who are in receipt of it.  That would be very obvious to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or any organisation that would be managing that.  They would know exactly how many they are paying.  We can say through the local authorities and the approved housing bodies how many households are being supported.  The difficulty with the list, and the Chairman talked about having figures every week or every month, and the reason we have to do it as a once-a-year exercise is that what we will capture every week and every month is people who are going onto the list.  We will capture some who are coming off it by virtue of being allocated but we will not capture people who have come off the list by virtue of their circumstances changing.  Otherwise, local authorities would need to be continually engaging with everybody on their lists.</p></speech>

When the list is available the Department knows the number of applications and knows that so many houses have been allocated or that approved housing bodies have taken people off the list.  There will be people on the list who, as time passes, will no longer be interested.  I understand that.  We are not asking the Department to go back over every application but if it had an automated system, it could collect the basic information and then, on a less regular basis, hound the local authorities to verify the list and so on.</p></speech>

That is why the local authorities speak of being harassed.  If this process was automated, we would have somebody in the housing Department who could provide the number of applications processed this week and the number of applications on hand but not yet processed.  That is the big issue we have with this.  The form is so complicated, it can take weeks on end to process.  I have never seen an application going in and being approved on the first presentation of the form because the volume of information is extensive, and rightly so.  We did not even talk about the number of unprocessed applications that are in the system.  If this was the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the debate today would be about the delay in processing.  We did not even talk about the cases on Mr. McCarthy's desk that have not been processed yet.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to take what I am saying as referring to automation.  I am not talking about manual work.  I am just saying that other Departments are more up-to-date in that regard.  I accept it is a big project and not something that cannot happen today, tomorrow or next year.  I think Mr. McCarthy gets the point.  The Department probably needs it all the more because there are 31 local authorities and we now have various approved housing bodies involved.  That is probably a greater reason for the Department to have it than a single line Department, if Mr. McCarthy knows what I mean.  I am just making the point.  Mr. McCarthy can take it as a project to be looked at down the road.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. McCarthy to send to the committee the figure for the local authority housing stock at the end of each year for the past five years.

One is, and we are not fully there yet as is obvious from the earlier discussion, better inspections of properties, which would not have been a feature in rent supplement, so we can get to a point of being satisfied that we are utilising good quality accommodation.

That is an important distinction.  You mentioned that the average cost of building a local authority house last year was &euro;212,000 versus &euro;177,000 for buying.  The issue in Laois is that the local authority has eased off on acquisition because it was competing against other local families who were trying to get a start.  It could have bought everything in sight but somewhere along the line it decided it was not being fair to other people.  One can go in and out of the housing market.  I understand you are relying on the chief executive to use some judgment on what is good for the overall environment.  I doubt that anybody wants the local authority to go into an estate, buy everything available in that estate and let nobody else in.</p></speech>

I am aware of that from the part of the country where my parents live.  There are two three-bedroom, normal, semi-detached houses on either side of my parents' house that have been for sale for &euro;195,000 for two years and they have not been bought.  From the point of view of sustainable communities and the efficient use of public infrastructure, if those opportunities remain and the local authority is not competing with other purchasers, and if they are vacant for that long it is not, we do not wish to put more infrastructure in to stretch the water pipe further outside the town and put another scheme outside it.

We carried out a review of that scheme in 2017, if memory serves.  A few things in the scheme were acting as restrictions so we increased the thresholds for the value of properties.  We also increased what we call the over-accommodation so we could get more people into it.  That has brought more into it.</p><p>Mortgage arrears remain a significant issue for the housing market but it has been improving over the last two years.

We are now back to processing the waiting list.  In each year since the scheme was established, how many applications have been made and approved and how many were outstanding at the end of the year?  It seems more cases are bogged down in the process than have come out the far end.  The scheme has been running for a number of years now.  I would have expected difficulties to have been ironed out by now.  Last week, we asked the representatives of the various housing bodies whether negative equity arises.  The Department needs to know that.  I was shocked that the approved housing bodies could not answer the question because they are sitting down with the tenant and the Department.  They are paying the money over.  If a property is in negative equity, I understand the relevant financial institution can still go after the mortgage holder.  Can Mr. McCarthy give a definitive answer on that?</p></speech>

Some people were ready to go.  Somebody advises them that they could be caught for &euro;50,000 at any time if their property is in negative equity.

The Bill was referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 19 February 2019.  In order to provide for the smooth running of the meeting, any member acting in substitution for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk now if he or she has not done so already.  Divisions on the Bill will be taken as they arise.  Members attending the meeting in accordance with Standing Order 95(3) should be aware that, pursuant to that Standing Order, they may move amendments but may not participate in voting on the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.930" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022800002#C00700"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 7, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Amendment of section 1 of Act 2015</b><blockquote><b>12.</b>Section 1 of the Act of 2015 is amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (7):<blockquote>&ldquo;(7) Part 9 shall come into operation 54 months from enactment or on such earlier day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision of that Part and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>This is an important amendment to section 1 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 to provide that &quot;Part 9 shall come into operation 54 months from enactment or on such earlier day or days as the Minister may appoint by order&quot;.  The Act only allows for Part 9 to be commenced by order of the Minister.  As it has been more than 46 months since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted and key Parts have not yet commenced, this amendment proposes to make October 2019 the latest date on which Part 9 can be commenced. </p><p>I am aware that Parts 2 and 3 are not included in this amendment and they must be commenced in tandem.  However, their inclusion would not have been permissible under Standing Orders.  Since the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 was enacted in April 2015, we have had a referendum on civil marriage equality, the Marriage Act 2015, two amendment Bills aiming to fix typographical errors and six deadlines missed by the Department of Health.  All of that has happened in four years, during which time same-sex parents have conceived and raised children and their families have not been recognised.  Some very important civil rights are absent from the family unit.  I outlined all of that during the Second Stage debate and I am acutely aware that the Minister and committee members are aware of how serious this matter is and how vulnerable it makes families.  The legislation that was proclaimed as embracing their family formation before the law has now turned into a headache and disappointment as deadlines have been missed time and time again and many delays have been announced. </p><p>Parts 2, 3 and 9, as I mentioned on Second Reading, were originally supposed to be commenced one year after the enactment in April 2016.  The delays have occurred and we cannot fix them now, but we can ensure that Part 9, without which this Bill is useless, will be commenced in a reasonable timeframe. </p><p>During the Second Stage debate the Minister said &quot;a small amount of administrative work needs to be done in the Department of Health and the HSE&quot;.  The amendment I have brought forward will ensure that this will be done in the next eight months.  From what the Minister has told us, that is a reasonable timeframe.  She will probably give us a deadline which her Department and the Department of Health are working towards.  I have no reason to doubt that but, unfortunately, too many timeframes have passed and too many deadlines have been missed.</p><p>This is an important amendment.  We owe it to the families that have been left vulnerable and waiting and whose civil rights have been denied.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-28a.933" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2019022800002#D00300"><p>I am well able to do so, as the Chair knows.</p> <p>  As Deputies are aware, this Bill is being fast-tracked with the co-operation of every Member of the Oireachtas because it is a priority not only for the Government, but for the women who have been awaiting its enactment for far too long.  That it is the only non-Brexit Bill being dealt with in the House should show how important an impact we all believe it will have.  I acknowledge Members' support.</p> <p>  The amendment's effect would be to bring Part 9 into operation by default on or before 6 October if commencement of the Act has not happened prior to that date.  As I have stated on Second Stage, I have no intention of delaying this Bill.  In fact, I will commence it immediately once it has been passed by the Oireachtas.  I have no issue with the 6 October deadline - I do not know why the Deputy magically chose that date - because I will have surpassed it.  However, I will oppose the amendment on the basis that, as drafted, it would make commencement of Part 9 the sole responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is the relevant Minister under the 2015 Act that the Deputy referenced.  The amendment removes the obligation on that Minister to consult with me as the line Minister with responsibility for the General Register Office, GRO, and our registrations unit regarding any change that is made or considered prior to the Bill's enactment.  The arrangement for consulting is provided for in section 17 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, and for good reason, as that Act covers numerous Departments and ministerial responsibilities.  Therefore, removing my responsibility over legislation would not make much sense.  On that basis, I will oppose it.</p> <p>  I wish to make Deputies aware of the other piece of the picture.  The commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I wish to flag to the Chair that the Department of Health has indicated to me that a short technical amendment may be needed on Report Stage.  If so, I will move it.  The Department is engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to seek specific legal advice on an issue regarding the interaction between certain transitional provisions under section 26 of the Act and whether a certificate issued by a donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, facility to the intending parents that enables them or her to register the birth of the child born following a DAHR procedure may be required.  The advice may be that the existing provision is fine, in which case an amendment would not be necessary, but I just wanted to flag the issue.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we cannot take that at face value.  Assurances, guarantees, timeframes and deadlines have been given before and have all fallen by the wayside.  It is important that a timeframe be built into the legislation.  That is why we have tabled this amendment.  Fifty-four months from the original date gives us another eight months.  If small technical amendments need to be made on Report Stage, that is fine.  I am not saying that the failure or fault for delays lies with the Minister or officials within her Department.  I am acutely aware that a number of Departments are dealing with this matter.  For example, the Department of Health has cited six deadlines and breached all of them, letting families down.</p> <p>  I will press this amendment.  It is an important issue.  We owe it to the vulnerable families that have been denied their civil rights.  We need to ensure that they can rear their children with all of the rights to which those families are entitled.  We have passed referendums, and this is the most important element that needs to be addressed.  We owe it to the families watching on.  Since debating the Bill on Second Stage, I have been contacted - I am sure other Deputies and Senators have as well - and told how important this matter is.  Many people are watching on and will not appreciate us breaking any more timeframes.</p> <p>  I take the Minister at her word that this is being fast-tracked.  I have no reason to doubt her, and it should be grounds enough to get this date built into the legislation.</p></speech>

We are here - it is being fast-tracked.  Report Stage has been requested for next week, although I am unsure as to whether the Business Committee can facilitate that.  It will facilitate my request at the earliest next date.  The D&aacute;il will then have finished this legislation and it will go to the Seanad.</p></speech>

I am not holding back on commencing this legislation.  As soon as it is passed by the Seanad, it will be commenced.</p> <p>  The Deputy's amendment would diminish my ministerial rights and responsibilities towards the vulnerable people whom he mentioned.  I do not believe that any of them are vulnerable, though, and certainly not the ones I have met in recent months.</p></speech>
