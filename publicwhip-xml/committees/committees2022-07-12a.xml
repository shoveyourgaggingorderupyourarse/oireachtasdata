We have received apologies from Senator Flynn.  Before we start business today, I would like to read some formal notices and the Covid-19 code of conduct.</p> <p>  The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community in May 2022.  Members, staff and visitors are requested to continue to be vigilant and follow public health advice on preventing the spread of Covid-19 infection so that we can continue to manage risk for ourselves and for others who are more vulnerable, including colleagues and their family members who may be elderly or have underlying health conditions or both.  All members of the parliamentary community and visitors are strongly encouraged to wear face masks in busy or crowded locations in the Leinster House complex.  Medical grade masks should be worn whenever recommended by the public health advice and should be worn for ten days after diagnosis of Covid-19.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation on this.</p> <p>  On privilege, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, and her officials.  On World Autism Awareness Day in 2021, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop an autism innovation strategy in consultation with stakeholders and the public.  The committee welcomes the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to making Ireland a more autism-friendly country.  We look forward to discussing how this can be achieved with the Minister of State.  </p> <p>  We also look forward to our second session this morning when we will hear from Mr. Adam Harris, CEO of AsIAm.  AsIAm is Ireland&rsquo;s national autism charity and we are delighted to welcome Mr. Harris to contribute to today&rsquo;s discussion on autism policy.</p> <p>  Before we hear from the Minister of State, I propose that we publish her opening statement to the committee&rsquo;s website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I suggest that the Minister of State should make her opening statement for approximately ten minutes, after which we will have questions and comments from members.  Each member will have roughly four minutes.  Members may speak more than once, should we have time at the end.  The session will last for an hour and a half.  </p> <p>  I now invite the Minister of State to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today to discuss the work that the Government is undertaking to support people with autism.  At the outset, as Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I recognise the clear value of national action on autism.  I recognise the need to address the bespoke challenges that people with autism face today in Ireland.  These challenges occur at all stages and facets of life, from healthcare to education, employment, housing and other areas.  It is for this reason that I have prioritised the development of a national autism innovation strategy.</p> <p>  On World Autism Awareness Day in 2021, I announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to launch an autism innovation strategy to deliver real and tangible solutions to the challenges and barriers faced by people with autism and to deliver on the commitment to act on autism set out in the programme for Government.  A budgetary allocation of &euro;100,000 was secured under budget 2022 for the purpose of designing and raising awareness of such a strategy.  </p> <p>  There are a number of key processes under way to make the autism innovation strategy a reality.  In April this year, I launched a public consultation seeking submissions to inform an initial draft of the strategy.  I am glad to say there was a very positive response to the consultation from individuals, from their families and from representative organisations.  </p> <p>  I also opened an expression of interest process in order to appoint an oversight and advisory group that will ensure that the strategy is being implemented appropriately and will monitor the delivery of progress.  It is intended that this group will have strong representation from people with lived experience of autism and members of the neurodiverse community.  This process closed at the end of June and I will consider the applications received and appoint the members of the group over the coming weeks.  </p> <p>  Engagement and consultation with autistic and neurodiverse people and their representative organisations is key in developing any new policy measure.  In line with our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, it is critical that the strategy be co-designed and informed by the lived experiences of people with autism, their families and their representatives.  That has underpinned our consultations to date and my Department will work with the members of the oversight and advisory group and with colleagues across Government to compile a draft strategy.  We will ensure that there is an additional public consultation before the strategy is finalised to allow key stakeholders and the public to have a final say before the strategy is published at the end of this year.  </p> <p>  My officials are also engaging with colleagues across Europe to learn from the experiences of other countries and to pool best practices to inform the development of our own strategy.  The week before last, some of my officials met officials in Malta to discuss their autism strategy, how it was developed and how its implementation has worked to date.  Each key pillar of the Irish strategy will be rooted in the aims of increasing awareness, promoting innovative solutions and empowering autistic people.  While previous Governments have looked into developing such a strategy and, indeed, organisations such as AsIAm have long campaigned for one, this Government will be the first to actually develop one in Ireland.  It is my intention that the autism innovation strategy will specifically identify and develop steps to address gaps in existing supports for people with autism in an agile manner that is localised in and sits in harmony with wider disability measures and supports.</p><p>The autism innovation strategy will complement our existing national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, and the comprehensive employment strategy, CES, for people with disabilities.  It is important that in creating bespoke supports for autism we do not create a hierarchy of support structures based on differing disabilities.  By operating in harmony with the NDIS and CES, the autism innovation strategy will be informed by wider policy development and <i>vice versa</i>.  This represents the kind of co-ordinated and joined up policy-making that is needed.  <br/><br/>There should be no doubt about the commitment of the Government to making equality of support and of opportunity a reality for all people with autism in Ireland.  I will continue to work with colleagues right across Government to address the needs of people with autism in a co-ordinated and comprehensive manner.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, I supported funding for a telephone information line for the autistic community which is being operated by AsIAm.  The information line operates five days a week and offers callers the information and community-based support they need, insofar as is possible, without the need for external referral.  <br/><br/>I recently joined the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, at the launch of a new innovation to support autistic students and those with an intellectual disability in accessing third level education.  The proposals, which will form part of the proposed new national access plan, will allocate ring-fenced funding of &euro;3 million per year to 2025.  This will support higher education institutions to implement universal design and inclusive practices on their campuses and enhance opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities in higher education.  <br/><br/>These are examples of how the Government is proactive in its support for autistic people across the country and I look forward to building on and further co-ordinating these measures.  I am aware of the challenges faced by autistic people in accessing disability services and therapies.  As Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I am committed to working with the HSE to explore how services can be better delivered to people with autism and to create greater awareness of autism.  <br/><br/>A particular priority is ensuring timely and equitable access to therapies and supports for children with autism to enable them to achieve their full development potential.  The establishment of children's disability network teams, CDNTs, marks an important reform in this regard as we work to ensure equitable child and family centred services across the country.  Having met many families, I am acutely aware of the current frustrations regarding the lack of services for children and young people, including those with autism.  The Government has committed funding for additional posts to enhance the capacity of CDNTs to ensure that services can be provided.<br/><br/>To conclude, I am aware there is a need for additional measures to support the health, education, employment and other needs of autistic people in Ireland.  It is my intent that the autism innovation strategy will provide an effective mechanism for addressing these gaps in an integrated manner with wider disability supports and will pave the way for Ireland to become a more autism-inclusive and neurodiverse-friendly country.  I thank the committee and look forward to questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  We have circulated speaking slots for today to members.  The first speaker is Deputy Tully, who has four minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#C00300"><p>I want to talk about the positives, namely, the autism innovation strategy and the national access plan, which I welcome.  We all want them to proceed without delay.  The main issues we are contacted about are assessments of need and a lack of therapies.  A manager in one of the CDNTs told me the majority of children being referred to her are children with suspected autism.  The assessment is vital in order for them to not just receive a diagnosis but to get a proper school placement and proper follow-up services.  As the CDNTs have a significant problem with recruitment and retention, what measures have been taken to deal with this?  Does the Minister of State expect the recruitment process to improve this year?</p> <p>  I refer to the need for cross-departmental co-operation between disability services, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and education.  A lot of children who do not get the supports they need or are in an inappropriate school placement develop anxiety and need mental health supports.  CAMHS does not seem to be addressing the needs of the children in many cases, especially if the services are told a child is autistic.  That seems to be a problem.  There needs to be better co-operation between all the teams, because I have heard from one side that it is not getting information and co-operation from the other.</p> <p>  There are many other issues that time is very limited.  Public attitude is one of the things need to change.  I have previously raised with the Minister of State the issue of respite services for children and their families.  There is a severe lack of such services, not only in my area but all over the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  She raised the issue of recruitment.  The current model is not working and has to change.  At a recent meeting, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I met the national team from the HSE, along with Paul Reid.  We agreed that a roadmap would be put in place to ensure that we could attract more people in the sector.  While the plan has not been finalised by any manner or means, I will provide some examples.  The Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the HSE agreed to come together and compile the report together.  It is approximately four weeks since we had that meeting.  We also had a meeting with the Taoiseach at which the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, were present  </p> <p>  As for the plan, the HSE currently does not have a pay grade for behavioural therapists.  We are producing them but we are not recruiting them.  One of the first requests was the HSE put in place a pay structure for behavioural therapists.  Second, we found we did not have occupational, physical or speech and language therapists on the critical skills list.  We have written to those responsible for it and those professions are now on it.</p> <p>  We also have a problem with recruiting students who have recently finished college.  They have to wait for CORU and everything else to come through.  We know what the process is regarding that.  It is not time sensitive to our needs.  We have put forward a proposal that we recruit directly from colleges and while doing so, we would put people on an assistant level until CORU applications come through.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has announced an extra allocation of posts but we know it will take a while for that to come through.  It is good to have it in the mix and it is welcome that the need for therapists has been acknowledged.  Another piece we have added relates to people who trained in the UK or elsewhere abroad.  If they come home and are missing a component of what is required, we will recruit them and the person can meet the need for that specific component while training in service.  On the need to return therapists to special schools and the validation of therapists in new schools, such as Rochestown and Carrigaline and a number of schools in Dublin which do not have any therapists on staff, they will be validated into the programme.  The last piece we need to deal with in terms of recruitment is work experience for therapists who are in training.  At the moment, we do not have a proper number of people in clinical posts.  There are only 70% in post, which means that we have a gap of 30% in the number of therapists required on our teams.  If we could increase the figure to 90%, we could provide training on the job.  That does not happen at the moment in any of the teams.  It is critical that trainee therapists get the opportunity to train on teams.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy on CAMHS.  There needs to be a national access policy.  It has to work in a number of ways.  It has to be integrated into primary care, mental health and disability services.  At certain times, the need within a diagnosis might change.  If the preliminary diagnosis is autism, but a child now needs to be reassessed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and needs to have integrated access, that must be universal across all disciplines.  I spoke the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, about the need for better integrated access when it comes to autism and access to services only last week.</p> <p>  Respite in the Cavan-Monaghan area is currently under discussion.  In one count,y children only get respite every second week and there is no designated respite house.  I am discussing that with the local community healthcare organisation, CHO, manager as we speak. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#D00100"><p>I commend the Minister of State on her work to date and on the enthusiasm with which she meets the challenges relating to her very busy portfolio.  Following on from Deputy Tully, the Minister of State will probably know what I am going to raise.  I will be very parochial about it.  The Minister of State has visited the children's disability network team in Longford.  It is fair to say there is a crisis there.  We have scheduled staff of 9.5, with 4.5 vacancies and 0.8 of a speech and language therapist position has been recruited through agencies.  On the whole, the team it is operating with less than half the staff required.  On 1 June, there were 786 children assigned.  One in four children still await autism diagnoses.  The current average wait time is 2.5 years.  Thirty seven children have been waiting more than four years for autism diagnoses.  I appreciate what the Minister of State is doing about recruitment, but that is a crisis.  I was struck by one of the comments to the effect that autism presents bespoke challenges.  We all agree that no two diagnoses are the same in autism but this is a crisis that needs a bespoke solution.  We have put a proposal to the Minister of State in the context of putting therapists into schools and taking the pressure off team 8.  Will she provide an update on that proposal?</p> <p>  I know the Minister of State is working, as in Cavan, on an overnight respite solution for Longford.  Can she provide an update on that?</p> <p>  I am very pleased to see that her team has engaged with special education, and with the staff in Malta.  It is a benchmark for what we should be doing.  We have all been contacted by parents who have been unable to access the summer programme.  Her team will be aware that Malta runs an 11-week programme.  We are passed the time when schools can opt out of providing the summer programme.  Will she give an update on how she intends to challenge that?</p> <p>  The Minister of State will be aware of the issues with the summer camp in Longford.  Traditionally, it would have used the facility in Cavan.  That was booked out by other counties and it was not available to them.  They are looking to put a plan together for August.  It is regrettable that it has been farmed out to Bluebird, a third-party care agency, and that the service is less than adequate.  If anything, it is disrespectful to the parents but more importantly to the service users.  I have given the Minister of State a lot to deal with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#D00200"><p>It is best if I start with the good news.  On respite, we have found a solution for Longford.  It was one of the counties where we had no children's respite whatever.  It was a county with no respite house because that facility had closed some years ago.  Since my meeting in Longford, I can say that we will deliver a respite house in Longford before the end of the year.  It will be open 48 weeks of the year.  That will support the 250 families the Deputy would talk about.  That is coming.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#D00300"><p>Good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#D00400"><p>On the bespoke model involving therapists going into schools, I have clearly said that we need to return therapists to special schools.  That goes without saying.  The Deputy is right.  There are children in mainstream education who also need to access services.  They are not getting that at this time.  The parents who the Deputy mentioned and who he represents are already collectively clubbing together to pay for therapists to go into the schools.  There are approximately 250 children across a number of schools where they have had to put the services in because they had not received services for such a long time.  That is not the way the system should operate by any means - where children and families are left with no option.  That is on my desk.  A proposal has come in on it and I have not ruled anything out.  I would prefer the system to work and for the local children's disability network team, CDNT, would make its way into the schools there and there would be a comprehensive approach, working with our partners in education to deliver it.  At the same time, we cannot leave children without any therapies whatever.  The local team there is coming back to me with a proposal on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about summer provision in Longford.  July provision needs to work differently from the way it does now.  I will probably say something outrageous in stating this, but what is there is not working.  July provision is not working.  It should not fall within one sector.  It needs to be cross-Government and cross-departmental working together.  We should no longer call it July provision but it should be a summer provision, no different to what they have in Malta but we also need to use our trainee therapists, the third-year and fourth-year trainee therapists and our third-year trainee intellectual disability nurses.  We need to work with our trainee behavioural therapists.  It should not all be just a medical model but a more holistic model that we use the training.</p> <p>  We should be working with our partners in education to support that and our trainee teachers but it needs a more holistic approach to ensure that the system can work.  There is a great pool of people.  Let me not forget the special needs assistants, SNAs, either.  Without burning anyone out, we should widen the pool to have more people be able to participate on it, particularly people who know the children, too.  Summer provision is also a respite service.  That is what it is to families.  Children need that routine.  We know, coming out of Covid when we did not have respite houses, that not having July provision sets children back.  Parents understand this well.  Regression takes place and bringing them back into the system in September does not work.  We need to have continuity of intervention all the way around.  In fact, it should be the choice of the parent when they send or do not send their child to a provision rather than when it is or is not available.  We need to turn the narrative around on that.</p> <p>  I hope that next summer, working with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, across Departments, that we should have a different approach.  We will also work with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Skills.  We will use the therapists, we know where the pool is, and we will pay them.  Let us be clear about this.  If we were really ambitious with the therapists who are coming through, they could use that time as part of their accredited training that can be used as part of CORU.  As I already told Deputy Tully, they are not getting the opportunity to work with children with disabilities.  We need to create that pathway.  If the summer provision is one of the models, we need to look at that. </p></speech>

I was there at the launch of the funding for the national access plan for universities.  It is very encouraging.  My issue has always been around service delivery.  It is there in the Minister of State's statement and she acknowledges up from that the challenges for delivery for children with autism in particular, and their parents are acute in my area.  I am at the point where I do not know how to do back to parents so often have I raised their issue with the HSE and the Minister of State's office.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, I accept her <i>bona fides </i>and how hard she is working but some of the replies I get from the HSE are outrageous.  I have raised this before.  The Minister of State and I met on 6 April and I raised this directly with the HSE on 26 May at the Committee of Public Accounts.  Today is 12 July.  I have been raising some of these cases for two years.  I refer to one case in particular.  It is a young girl, who I will refer to by her initials A.S.  This is an example of the standard of reply from the HSE.  I received a letter back on 1 February 2022 from the HSE to say that A.S. had had her assessment of needs completed on 10 May 2021 and was subsequently referred to the HSE school age team on 20 May 2021.  So I got back to her parents and said &quot;That is great, isn't it?&quot;</p><p>I was told by the parents that they had read my letter and were a bit confused, given that she had never been assessed by the HSE.  I went back to the HSE to say it turned out that A.S. had not been assessed, because her parents said as much, and that I was pretty sure they knew what they were talking about and what the situation was.  The HSE apologised and said that it was an error.  I was told the HSE would come back to me with an update, but I am still waiting for it.  That is just one case.  I have brought these to different levels of attention.  I have a pile of these cases on my desk and the Minister of State knows I have raised them with her directly.  That is just by way of the standard.</p><p> I am an elected Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  My fellow Members and I raise these cases time and again with the HSE.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is to be the parent of an autistic child with acute needs.  Parents have to navigate that on a day-to-day basis, try to support their children and, at the same time, has to navigate the HSE and try to get assessment of needs and delivery of services for their children.</p><p> I am beyond embarrassed at this point to go back to parents.  I did not even tell them I was raising this today, because I am too embarrassed.  Every time I have raised it during Questions on Policy and Legislation, at the Committee of Public Accounts or directly with the HSE, I go back to say I have raised it and I hope to get an outcome, but nothing ever happens.  I am too embarrassed to tell them.  It has been going on so long.</p><p> I am very much encouraged to hear about the meeting four weeks ago and that there will be some momentum now from the HSE, God between us and all harm.  Let us hope there is, because delivery is needed.  How many therapists will the momentum generate?  What will the impact be on service delivery?  That is all that matters.</p></speech>

I am not an apologist for the HSE but, as Minister of State with responsibility for disability, that sort of response is absolutely soul-destroying in that somebody does not know who is on the system.  The suggestions I have put forward to Deputy Tully and shared with the committee are mine.  I have not seen the HSE's suggestions yet.  I have a list of suggestions from listening to the members tell me how the system can work.</p> <p>  The PDS programme was ten years in the making before it happened, but there did not seem to be ten years of planning and delivery, because it fell between every gap one could imagine.  Some 743 therapists are now not in the system and there are unfilled posts.  I presented my suggestions as to how I think.  I am not a clinician or a clinical need.  I am a mere politician who is working with my constituents, as the members are with theirs, to try to find solutions.  If I think my solutions might go some of the way, I look forward to suggestions by the HSE, which is paid for and tasked with finding solutions.  I look forward to how it can bolster what I have already said to bring delivery in a timely fashion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#E00300"><p>Agreed.  It is the HSE's responsibility to do so.  We can put forward suggestions but, at the end of the day, the HSE has the clinical expertise and at least in theory, the management expertise.  It is the HSE's responsibility to collate and co-ordinate that and delivery it for parents.  The likes of the Minister of State and I try to come up with practical suggestions with no clinical or health management experience.  All we can do is hold the HSE to account, but it has to happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#E00400"><p>It certainly does.  It is important that it happens in a timely fashionable and is measurable and accountable.  While I talk about the 743 therapists, I need to see those numbers go down and find their way into positions.  We need to go from a 30% to 40% gap in vacancies.  I need to near my 90% operational piece, where I can have trainee therapists on site.  That is my ambition and it has to be delivered at a timely pace.  To be honest, it is important for me to clearly tell the Deputy that there is a policy shift in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Health.  It is not that the Minister of State says that she would like something.  We need to make a transition while the progressing disability services for children and young people, PDS, programme is being rolled out.  It is not an aspiration.  It is a policy shift supported by the Taoiseach and Government colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#E00500"><p>I know the Minister of State has been doing a lot to try to get services up to scratch.  At the end of the day, that is what we really want to hear.  This is where we get most queries from families.  As the previous Deputy said, it is impossible to go back to parents without any information.  Two weeks ago, the Dublin 12 autism group organised a round table for families to speak to Deputies to explain their situation with their children.  Of eight parents, six of them had paid for private assessment of needs, cognitive assessments, mobility classes and speech and language therapy, which costs &euro;130 per term.</p> <p>  The Minister of State indicated that there is a gap of 743 therapists in the system.  Her concept is to bring more trainees in to fill the gaps and get them trained on campus.  Does that figure of 743 relate to both CDNTs and schools?  Schools have considerable problems in accessing therapists and behavioural therapists.  Will the Minister of State go into that in more detail?  She spoke about outsourcing access to therapy.  Will she expand on that?  I wish to know exactly what she is thinking of.  I do not want to see something like the national treatment purchase fund develop for children who need access to therapy and assessment of needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#E00600"><p>Some of the 743 posts will include special schools posts, which were halted last year.  There were 85 therapists posts, but some of them have been recruited into.  It does not include all special schools.  They are a make-up of the posts I recruited for in 2021 and to date in 2022, and the additional 85 special schools posts last year.  People have also failed to identify that we have lost staff from our CDNT teams.  We have lost staff to primary and acute care.  That is why the number is so high.</p> <p>  In the current budgetary cycle, I plan to seek additional funding to ensure that therapists are added to CDNT teams to cover special schools and new schools, which is not included.  The 85 therapists posts are included, but I know from Deputy O'Sullivan's side, that I need to add another 30 therapists which are needed for Cork schools.  That is part and parcel of it.  Additional funding is required for additional therapists posts for the special schools.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins wishes to tease out the idea of outsourcing.  Outsourcing is about using the private sector to assist us with some of the assessment of needs.  I am not saying the private sector will assist us with all of it by any manner or means.  Four of our nine community healthcare organisation, CHOs, are currently using various operators to assist them in the delivery of assessment of needs.  They can only do it to a level of &euro;25,000 because of procurement procedures.  They use that bulk of money to do it and it works successfully.  I have seen it working very successfully in CHO 2.  It works.  Outsourcing will complement our assessments of needs until such a time that we are in a space where interventions are happening and it is not all about assessments.  We need the therapists on our teams to also deliver interventions.</p> <p>  The system is overwhelmed at present.  It seems to be focused on assessments and not enough on interventions.  We need to create a balance.  However we create the balance, I do not want people getting private therapies and finding it difficult to them come into access services, because they have left the system.  I would prefer to keep everybody in the system, if I could, and bring everybody along the journey as quickly as possible.  That means I have to work with outsourcing in conjunction with the proper clinical oversight from within the teams structure.  It is not as though the outsourcing is put out there and there is no connectivity back to the teams.</p><p>It would be outsourced but there would be an acknowledgement and notification of who the child is, how they have come back in to the teams and how their delivery of care would continue.  It is no different from how we did it with the assessment of needs two years ago when we cleared 6,500, which was fantastic.  That was with the old assessment of needs model.  That was not a preliminary team assessment, PTA.  I know it can be done in a timely fashion but we need to run both parallel with each other.  There is no point doing an assessment if there is no intervention because that just frustrates parents.  Parents need both.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I listened to her opening statement from my office.  She mentioned that her Department had looked at the model in Malta.  Can she give us some insight into where that consultation is at the moment?  It is a model that is held up by many as regards European norms and where we should be going as a country.  I ask her to develop that point a bit.  What contact has there been with Malta and where does she see that going?  I would appreciate that.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I missed last week's meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  The July programme is essential to families.  The change of routine is brought up with us on many occasions when we meet with families.  In Kildare, some schools are not in a position to put it on for a variety of reasons.  One suggestion that has been made to me by a number of families and schools, and the Chair has mentioned this as well, is that we should organise regional centres for summer July programme.  In big towns where there are three, four or even five schools we could have a centre where that routine can be maintained for families.  That is something the Department must look at urgently.  Obviously it would not be done for this year but it should be looked at as we proceed into the future.  I would welcome the Minister of State's response to that and hopefully her support for it.  Newbridge, for example, has four schools and it could have a centre that people could bring their loved ones into.  It is so important for the routine.</p> <p>  The Minister of State responded to Deputy Joan Collins on the cost of assessment.  I get asked about this on an almost weekly and sometimes daily basis.  Parents are paying up to &euro;1,000 privately for assessments of need.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a lot of help to pay for those costs.  A community welfare officer is not a solution, although I have tried that option a couple of times.  Is the Minister of State looking at something like that to assist people who cannot afford a private assessment of need, to see if the Government can help them?  I appreciate that the services have to be in place for after the assessment of need but first the assessment of need is demanded.  Will there be help from the Government with that cost of up to &euro;1,000?</p> <p>  The Labour Party has introduced the Autism Bill 2022.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.  I hope we have her support and that of the Government.  Where should that Bill go from here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#F00300"><p>The Senator brought up a number of issues.  He asked about supporting families and needing to get assessments of needs completed.  Families feel there is no option because they are left waiting for so long.  That is why I spoke about outsourcing.  The assessment varies depending on the need as well.  In some cases it could be &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,500, depending on the clinical need for intervention.  Families sometimes do not realise that at the start of it.  They might be told they will get X but you need to get that fully comprehensive piece.  We are looking at all the procurement rules and I am having those conversations around it.  That is why I talked about the &euro;25,000.  That will not get a lot done in any CHO.  We need to get to the European standard of &euro;250,000 and we need to make it very available so we can cater to the need and we are not limited.  At this moment in time there are 10,000 PTAs that need to be given back to parents for that reassessment.  There is a lot to get done while at the same time meeting other needs.</p> <p>  The answer to the Senator's question about funding is "Yes".  That would mean that all children are within the system and that all children could get the proper interventions.  Deputy Flaherty asked about where the children are, how we can best deliver services and if they can be delivered in the schools.  It is about the mechanism for delivery.</p> <p>  I agree with the Senator about the idea of larger centres.  There is a community school in my constituency in Portumna and we have 11 national schools around the place.  It has fantastic playing pitches and everything else.  Why would we not access it?  However, there has to be that continuity at the same time.  We need a link with the schools somewhere along the way.  We do not need to have the teachers there for four weeks but if we had them or the SNAs coming in there would be a friendly face the children would recognise.  We should create that pathway but at the same time maybe we should be bringing trainee therapists or trainee teachers into the schools a few weeks earlier and building that link as well.  That is another way of looking at it.  There are good success stories in the delivery of July provision.  Only last week I visited the PALS early years centre, which is delivering full July provision.  There we can see the benefit for the child, the family and the wider community.  When a system works well it can work really well.  We are missing that in a lot of communities at this moment in time.</p> <p>  I started working on the Malta question about two years ago when I came into office.  I took two people over from Trinity College Dublin.  They were looking for something to do for the summer and I gave them work experience to go out and research which is the best place for this.  They came back with Malta.  I am still not in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth but I have managed to nudge my way in there and get the funding from the team in the Department.  I will pass over to Mr. Brunell because he was doing the engagement last week.  He will bring the committee up to date on where we are at.</p></speech>

There are some areas around the UNCRPD where we are a little bit ahead of Malta and some areas where it is a little bit ahead of us so there is an opportunity there to share learning.  Autism is one of those areas.  We have had discussions focusing on how Malta addressed the issue of identifying and addressing bespoke needs while not duplicating labour or creating that hierarchy of disability supports.  That has been quite useful.  We have also had some discussions around the content of its strategy, how it handled consultations and how to access persons who might have complex needs or who might not be caught in the normal consultation process.  We have had good progress on that in our own consultation and have produced easy-to-read documents on it but we will reflect on that for the final consultation process.  That is ongoing.  We have arranged future meetings and Malta has some questions for us in other areas of UNCRPD compliance.  Maltese officials want to talk to us about assisted decision-making, for example.  There is a good two-way flow of communication there and that will continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#F00500"><p>My first question is a very basic one.  Some might say it is even stupid.  I have often had discussions with the Minister of State and she has said her job is to advocate for the children.  Over the last while she has been torn between the Departments of Health, Education and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Can she clarify where we are now with that process and how that is going to feed into the autism strategy?  Are those various Departments actively engaging at this point in time?</p> <p>  My second question relates to recruitment.  This issue has been mentioned by most speakers today.  I will give one example.  We were at a CHO 4 meeting recently with HSE management.  They told us the average time it takes to hire a home care worker is nine months.  I am not trying to demean anyone's work because the work home carers do is very important but we are talking about specialised staff in different therapies.  If it takes nine months to hire a home care worker for the HSE, what kind of timeframes are we looking at for filling speech and language therapy posts and so on?</p> <p>  Summer provision has already been mentioned.  The Minister of State said earlier that she, similar to myself, supports engaging student therapists and a whole cohort of people working in care health and education to provide that.  Why can we not do that?  What are we waiting for?  We have &euro;40 million that will probably go unspent.  Why can we not do it?</p> <p>  My last question relates to children with autism who are prescribed mental health medication.  Are they being included in the CAMHS audit following on from recent controversies?  Does the Minister of State have any information on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#G00100"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He spoke about my Department actively engaging with other Departments.  I believe that is what I am doing.  If one can imagine a spider's web, I am stuck in the middle of it and I am trying to work across government and Departments and with all Ministers to find gaps where they exist in the system and address how it works or does not work.  I referred earlier to play and language support, PALS, centres, which provide early year intervention for children with autism.  Everybody working on a PALS site has to have a Teaching Council number.  If a child is out for more than three days, it will lose its funding.  We are talking about children aged two and a half to five and a half years.  They are expected to be registered as part of the childcare programme and they are also regulated by Tusla.  There are approximately 24 such centres in the country.  It does not make any sense that there is that level of hierarchy in the delivery of supports for 25 early years providers while at the same time there are 4,200 childcare providers around the country.</p> <p>  What I am saying is that I am working with all Departments.  I am working with the early years sector, special education, education and higher education.  For me, it is all about the transition planning when a child leaves the early years sector and goes into national school, leaves national school and goes into secondary school, or leaves secondary school and goes on to third level.  That is where the gaps are identified and that is where there are the blocks in respect of accessing places within education and higher education.  It is about trying to tease that out together.  Yes, there are good working relationships, but there are challenges within it as well and I am trying to iron that out.  I believe that when I move fully to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth I will challenge every Department on the rights of equality of access for all children on a rights-based approach.  Children have the right.  At present, I am still in the Department of Health.  When I move to the other Department I will be challenging Departments wearing an entirely different lens, and particularly with regard to the education space of early years, primary and post-primary.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about recruitment.  He is correct that it takes nine months.  If the section 38 and 39 organisations are advertising they can do it in a shorter timeframe.  It should not take nine months.  It should involve the basics.  It should involve child protection, CORU registration and the relevant qualification.  It should not be necessary to go through 31 different processes to be recruited to a post.  There has to be a swifter way of doing it.  It is one of the avenues I am talking about with regard to the targeted national recruitment.  The Deputy can see it in his area, although he might not be aware of it yet.  A campaign is being put together in CHO 4.  If it is a successful campaign, we will roll it out to all the CHOs throughout the country.  It is to attract more people to it and more trained therapists.  We are also looking at the apprenticeship programme for therapists.  We are looking at various levels of getting people in as opposed to waiting for that nine months.  I talked about the CORU piece to bring them in as an assistant and then qualify them while they are on the job.  Again, it is trying to break down that barrier of the nine months.</p> <p>  I agree summer provision is not working and it has not worked.  The let-down is what I hear daily from everybody.  An awful lot of money is being put into that system.  I genuinely believe in the proposals I have made, similar to the Deputy's, regarding using our therapists, our intellectual disability nurses, the trainee teachers and using everybody.  It should not be just one model to deliver support to families during the summer months.  The Deputy knows about the Rainbow Club in Cork.  Karen O'Mahony could have it filled every day of the week if she had the support and proper funding to enable her to do it.  She supports 1,000 children but she is only on a grant of &euro;55,000.  That is not good enough, yet she is supporting so many families.  There are many more like Karen who are available to do it.  We need to bring them into the circle as well as part of the July provision and support and reward them.  We need everybody supporting us.  It should no longer be just the four weeks.  It should be summer provision as opposed to just a July one.</p> <p>  I find the CAMHS piece concerning within the disability space.  If a child is diagnosed with autism and re-presents needing additional support, it is about access to mental health care and access to primary care.  An integrated access to care policy needs to be refreshed within the HSE piece.  Disability can no longer be just sitting out there.  We were told when we did the reform that the 91 CDNT teams would sit predominantly over the 96 primary care units, and the reason for that was the integrated access to care.

When I hear her talking about things such as a policy shift in the Department of Health, I feel like cheering out loud.  However, we have to see that there is actual policy change.  The fact that the Minister of State is prepared to speak up about it, say it is necessary and say she will deliver it gives us hope.  I very much look forward to seeing the delivery of that policy change on the ground over the next couple of months.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  The Minister of State has answered the question about July provision quite comprehensively.  However, representatives of the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland were before the committee last week.  One of the questions I put to them was whether the childcare sector could be part of July provision.  They said they did not see a problem, but one of the issues we will face there is that I think one has to be registered with the Teaching Council, and that is a miasma at times.  That is another place where we need to get rid of some of the barriers.  I ask the Minister of State to examine that.  With regard to all the changes she has spoken about in respect of July provision, and she spoke about them with enthusiasm, can she tell us if she hopes to see most of those or a substantial percentage of them in place by next year?</p> <p>  Nobody has mentioned the employment strategy for people with disabilities.  The rate of employment in Ireland is half the European average.  I need not tell the Minister of State how important access to employment is.  What actions are being taken to deal with that?</p> <p>  The local question I wish to ask is about the most up-to-date information regarding respite care provision in south Leitrim.  I thank her for her intervention, but I need to know what is happening.</p> <p>  If the Minister of State has 20 seconds at the end, will she talk about the cost of disability?</p></speech>

The Deputy was there that day.  We were very fortunate that when we all sat around the table we could find solutions.  The solutions were within the Sligo site.  Everybody was pleased about that.  My understanding is that one of those houses is being worked on as we speak.  The HSE told me it would be January, but we agreed that day that the site had to happen at the end of the year.  I am still working to that target of the end of the year.  There are two houses there and it would be dreadful not to use both houses, to be honest.  It still would not be a congregated setting by any manner or means.  We must actively pursue that, and it is ongoing as we speak.  It is important to acknowledge the work of Edel Quinn that day, who was prepared to be agile and pragmatic in her approach to finding a solution.  That was fantastic.</p> <p>  The comprehensive employment strategy is going into its third iteration.  I take this opportunity to thank the board and the team.  They have given endless hours to trying to make this work.  There is no denying that we are an outlier so as part of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, ADMC, we are going to put it in legislative terms that the public sector has to go from 3% to 6%.  That will be a positive step change.  The other piece is the ability programme.  I have seen some very positive work in the ability programme since I took office.  It is not just a particular location but is supporting 2,400 people across the country.  That falls under the funding of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  This is the cross-government and cross-Department piece again.  It is a really good model and it is one we need to retain and expand.  It comes under the LEADER side of things and is really good.</p><p> The rural social scheme, T&uacute;s and the community employment scheme are now open to taking persons with disability allowance, which also is a step change.  As there were many barriers there, I acknowledge the Department for listening and responding to that.  On the childcare sector and other Departments, to be clear education is not my brief but as it impacts children with disabilities, I must have a knowledge of it to see how we can find solutions.  The Department of Education funds early years providers.  I talked to the Play and Language Support, PALS, Preschool again about it.  Everyone must have a Teaching Council number.  They also need childcare qualifications.  They are regulated by Tusla.  Without places such as PALS, we would not support children with autism in earlier years.  We need to look at that model, how we can expand it and invest more into it.  It is a fantastic model.  It is delivering on the July provision.  We need to work across all Departments.  The Departments of Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Health need to work together on the delivery of care.</p><p> We will hopefully address the cost of disability soon.  Last week in the D&aacute;il, I gave a commitment to do so within three or four weeks and I hope to follow through on that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State talked about school settings and having therapists in schools, especially in special schools or special classes.  Parents say to me that in many cases, because the CDNTs are based on a community where a child lives, children have to travel out of their community to attend an appropriate school.  It ends up with children being taken out of school to attend community supports.  That does not make sense.  Better interaction is needed.  As well as that, parents sometimes say to me that a speech and language therapist might come into the school and not actually engage with the children, but instead talks to the teacher and gets information.  One parent said that a therapist came in to talk about six children and did not engage with any children or leave a programme of work, but noted that as having dealt with six appointments.  There are a couple of issues that could be dealt with.</p></speech>

The access policy states that it should be the closest to home or the closest to your school.  The parent has that choice.  That was part of the original PDS model from 2009.  As it was being rolled out last year, there was perhaps some misunderstanding that it had to be in a set area.  Parents have a choice of whether it is closest to home or closest to school.  Therapists being returned to special schools will provide an uplift to the 134 special schools and the new special schools that are coming.  We then need to look at how we can best meet the needs of all other children.  We all know that the best place is in a school setting.  We do not need to extract them.  We can work better.  Going in and not meeting them is not delivery or an intervention.  We need to see whether there is a designated room and how we can work best with our partners in education and with parents.  I hope that when we look after special schools, we will move to that space.</p> <p>  The school inclusion model is in place in some cases, but it is more about speaking to the teacher than to the child.  We need to join that up more.  We would then have a service where the majority of children are in a setting with their friends and peers.  We need to see how that integration works.  I spoke with Adam Harris in AsIAm and his team about how complete integration can work.  That is what parents are asking us to do.  Parents also have to work.  They need the best for their children.  When assessments are done, they happen in the school environment, so therapy should be delivered in the school environment too.  I have covered those three things.</p></speech>

On her visit to Longford, she was probably struck by the location of the CDNT in the old workhouse building.  Probably the only meritorious thing we can say about the building is that it was once home to Padraic Colum, the poet, but aside from that, it is a terrible reflection on our commitment to people with disabilities that we are still using that building in a modern age.  I have asked the HSE about plans to provide a new CDNT facility.  As the Minister of State rightly said, it needs to sit with primary care.  There is a plan in place to move it to the Ballyminion site.  I am told it is going through the HSE's initial approval process.  Once approval is granted, the legal paperwork will be completed and the developer will submit a planning application for the proposed work.  I hope the Minister of State can assure me it will be a priority for her to get the work done within the programme for Government.</p></speech>

I was on the site.  For anyone here who does not know it, it is a claustrophobic building, so it is not the right environment for a child with high sensory needs.  It is a closed space with narrow corridors.  One feels that people with additional needs could hardly breathe, particularly if they are on the autism spectrum.</p><p>I support both of the Deputy and the Chairman on the primary care site and the complete integration of services.  I am aware there is a site there and everything else and that it just needs to be fast-tracked, and I support that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned equality and the particular pinch points when transitioning from one school to another.  There is a further such point when children are coming to the end of junior school.  I am getting a lot of children now where school principals are saying they cannot meet the children's needs and they are going to have to find something else for fifth and sixth class.  There needs to be additional support in the schools, especially at that point.</p> <p>  The second point is on the special schools and Ballyowen Meadows Special School in particular.  I have raised this with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  It is not clear where equipment for occupational therapy is supposed to come from.  The HSE requires them to apply to the Department of Education, which then says that is not a matter for it, so it has fallen between the gaps.  There needs to be some engagement with the NCSE on exactly where that is.  The committee visited Ballyowen Meadows Special School.  There is a fantastic occupational therapy room that needs more equipment.  Moreover, as there also is nobody to work in it at present, it is not that much use, though it is a great room.  We cannot even get clarity on where to get funding for additional equipment.  If the Minister of State could follow that up with the NCSE it would be helpful, or just provide clarity from the HSE.</p></speech>

Aids and appliances are a priority of mine.  A total of &euro;540 million is spent every year on aids and appliances and yet I hear about children outgrowing their wheelchairs, not getting access to their shoes and not getting timely assessments for the right equipment.  The point I am making is we need to work with education within disability.  Within my own Department, we need to hold our own budget to support education, so it is coming through the one stream.  Maybe there should be a centralised approach, as opposed to having 91 different fiefdoms, as well as working with our partners in education, special education and in the early years sector.  If a child needs it at the beginning, then more than likely the service and intervention will need to continue.  A piece I would like to look at, and I have talked to the Taoiseach about it, is our not reusing things.  We could bring it back, get it serviced and get that whole recycling piece put into it.  I am looking at that very clearly.</p></speech>

I thank her for coming and thank her for her commitment to disabilities.  She has moved to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and I look forward to seeing huge gains while she works with her new line Minister.  It is a really exciting time and we are putting our trust in her to deliver services and therapies for our children.  I wish to highlight the importance, which so many of us have mentioned today, of having services attached to all the new classes and all the new schools and of training SNAs and teachers properly.  It is vital.  I agree with Deputy Carroll MacNeill's point about equipment.  It is not just equipment like wheelchairs and footwear but also occupational therapy, OT, equipment for kitting out sensory rooms, including the equipment children might need in an occupational therapist's gym.  It is very hard for the school to put in place a proper, fully-equipped occupational therapy room and the NCSE said that is a Department of Health funding requirement.  However, the schools need a better way of figuring out where to go properly for the funding.  We need a more streamlined way because it seems to be quite an issue and not just in the school my colleague mentioned.  Our Lady of Hope Special School is also looking to get more OT equipment and sensory rooms.  This applies to many schools.  When you are opening an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, class you need to ensure you have the equipment as well as the staff to support the class properly.</p></speech>

What she has reflected there is that this is about integrated delivery of services.  That is integration between education, health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That must be the new conversation piece.  If we are true to our line on the UNCRPD, it has to be about integration and the Government working together across Departments.  I do not think any of the Departments would mind funding it but it is about ensuring it gets to the end user.  It must be about service delivery.  Funding is one thing but we need to ensure the young people who need access to it can access it, regardless of location.</p></speech>

I will only be a minute.  I asked her about next year and July provision.  Everyone knows about all the families who are contacting us telling us they are in crisis and feel abandoned this year.  We know that for many of those families, things will not change.  The Minister of State has many good ideas and we have heard them today but can we go back to families and say we have a very good reason to believe that when next year comes, we will be looking at a different model of July provision that will cater for those who need it and that families will not be in such crisis as they are at the moment?  I ask the Minister of State, in a way, to give a hostage to fortune but those families are asking us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#J01100"><p>Absolutely.  I totally understand why those families are asking us because they hear there are four weeks of July provision and they are lucky if they get a week and they hear they might get two weeks.  Then they might hear of a fantastic provider where people get the four weeks and are wondering why they cannot have the same.  I also need to recognise, as it would be wrong of me not to, that teachers and SNAs are tired.  That is why we need to add into the mix.  That is why we need to include more to be part of.  That is why cannot leave the burden with a particular group.  There is more in disabilities than just the teacher and the SNA.  We need to complement each other and talk to that piece about how we can all work together and put it into a summer programme.  We know it can be done; I genuinely believe it can be done.  I have a willingness to see it done.  I want to work with our partners in higher education and primary and post-primary, as well as parents, and actually give therapists the opportunity of the experience of working with children with disabilities.  As they are not getting it at the moment, how can I recruit them if they have never had the experience?  I genuinely believe there is a better, more enhanced model than what we are doing.  We should let the therapists as part of the solution.</p></speech>

That leaves me.  I have a couple of points.  Before that, Senator Garvey could not come in to the meeting but she had a number of queries on transport to school when a parent gets their child a place at a special school and the difficulty of accessing that.  There is the whole issue of summer provision, which is coming up all the time.  It is a struggle to get staff to do it.  There were issues last year with people not being paid until November.  I think they are due to be addressed this year.  I fully concur with the Senator's proposal that all early childhood care and education, ECCE, staff with a qualification should be eligible to work in summer provision.  Those are some points Senator Garvey put forward that the Minister of State may want to comment on before I speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#J01300"><p>I hear exactly what she is saying about the ECCE staff.  Those staff finish up at the end of June and could be available and to be included as part of the scheme.  Why not?  We need as many people trained in creating that awareness and understanding of how to work with and support.  That is what is should be about.  On transport, I am not the Minister with responsibility and I have to keep saying this but at the same time, if a child cannot access the service that is something we must address.  Whatever the mode of transport is, we must address it.</p><p> Children need to be able to participate in their July provision.  It ensures that a child's relationship at home does not fall down and become a crisis situation of needing to access respite.  We also must ensure we continue that routine.  As we are talking about the spectrum of need, parents know best.  They still have to hold down jobs and go to work.  They cannot take every August off, because at the moment they already have to take August off if they have a child with additional needs.  In some cases, they had to take an extra two weeks of unpaid leave on top of the four weeks.</p><p> The Government wants to find a solution.  Extra funding was found this year and we have to compliment the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, for doing to that.  To be fair to the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, they brought in student teachers.  They put in place a scale and said they would pay further in advance.  This still did not meet the needs, so we now have to ask what else do we have to do to make it work.  There is no denying that we need to look to the Maltese model.  It is a fantastic model that runs for the entire summer.  We have the trainees.  We have the ability, capacity and buildings to deliver this.  We need to find a model to apply it.  We cannot fail any further.  We have a good benchmark to start with and we need to build on it.</p></speech>

I met with the Minister of State, her officials and Deputy Flaherty at the CDNT centre in Longford.  We know it as the Phoenix Centre.  I am delighted by the Minister of State's commitment to make it a priority to move it to the new site beside the primary care centre.  I understand what she is saying for parents going in there.  I mean no disrespect to the good staff working there, but it is not a place for bringing kids, to be honest.  I am, therefore, delighted by the Minister of State's commitment.  When we met with the parents' group, they brought up the fact that respite was not available.  The Minister of State gave a commitment to us that it would be put in place and I am delighted that it will be in place before the year is out.  Respite is much needed by parents.</p> <p>  On the summer camp that was mentioned, I agree with the comments made earlier.  I do not think it is suitable.  I refer to the advertisement to hire staff to provide that service.  It states that it would be an advantage to have experience of working with people who have an intellectual disability.  That was stated in the advertisement seeking staff to work in that camp.  I do not think that "would be an advantage" is acceptable.  We need people who are experienced in looking after our kids with the highest needs.</p></speech>

We cannot have an <i>ad hoc</i>approach.  It needs to be planned.  We know how many children need support from our services.  It is not like we do not know our numbers; we clearly know them.  Planning has to be part of the solution.  Putting out an advert in the middle of July like that is nearly wilful neglect by the units there.</p></speech>

The Minister of State touched on that.  There is an actual shortage of therapists.  In our meeting last week, I spoke on an issue I feel strongly about, which is the large number of special schools that are not providing summer provision.  That is not acceptable.  In summer 2023, every school should provide summer provision.  We may need to bring in student occupational therapists and student speech and language therapists.  As other members mentioned, some qualified staff within the early childhood care and education, ECCE, system are signing on for unemployment payments during the summer, while schools are closed and unable to provide the service.  Ultimately, the kids for whom the summer provision was initially brought in are not getting that service now.  They are the kids with the most needs, and this is not acceptable.  We need to look at different ways.</p> <p>  I am glad the Minister of State looked at the Maltese model.  It is a model I have also looked at.  Approximately 18 months ago, we spoke with Adam Harris about this and the empowerment Act that was introduced in Malta a number of years ago.  For a small nation in the Mediterranean, Malta is well ahead of us in a lot of areas.  We need to aim to have fully supportive models for children and families throughout the whole of life, and not just in health or education.  It needs to be in employment, where more than 85% of people with autism are either underemployed or unemployed and that is not acceptable.  Parents want to know that those supports are in place for their children as they get older.</p> <p>  I fully believe in the school inclusion model and that it is the way forward.  I know the trial model used in CHO 7 was successful but, unfortunately, the Covid pandemic came in the middle of that.  I said to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan and her officials last week that we should look to expand that model.  I would like that model to be used in Longford.  Deputy Flaherty mentioned the figures that show the severe need we have in our county, which probably has the longest waiting lists of people waiting for services and assessment of needs in the country due to the lack of staff.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, visited us, we had half a speech therapist for the whole county, with a population of 45,000.  Based on the staff numbers we had, it was estimated that we will be waiting up to six years to clear the existing assessment of needs lists.  I want us to prioritise those services and get them into schools on a daily and weekly basis.  The model worked when it was trialled in CHO 7.  I know there is a commitment in the programme for Government that the funding will be put in place to roll that out throughout the country.</p> <p>  I want to put on record that I believe the Minister of State is an excellent advocate in her position.  I know she is doing a lot of work on behalf of families and she will make things happen.  Having spoken to her prior to the announcement, I know that delivering the strategy means a lot to her personally.  I know she will deliver it.  She will make sure to get the funding necessary to implement it and make it a success, and that is extremely important for all families out there who have children with autism.  I thank her for her time today.  I want to see higher staffing levels in the progressing disability services, PDS, model in Longford.  In the past three weeks, two occupational therapists transferred to Mullingar and Cavan, so they are no longer in Longford.  It is a priority for me and it should be a priority for the Government to fill those posts and not let a bad situation become worse.  Would the Minister of State like to make any comments to finish up?</p></speech>

I greatly appreciate the opportunity to come before this new committee.  As I said, the reason I have been invested in the autism innovation strategy is not because I want to create new legislation; it is because I want to knit what we currently have in place and make it work, and to operationalise the system through me being in the centre talking to the Department of Education and the Departments with responsibility for early years, housing, and employment.  Disability is not just a health issue.  It is across all Departments.  When we specifically talk about autism and its diagnosis, health is a needs-based model but, unfortunately, education is a diagnosis-based model.  Social protection is a social-based model.  Therefore, we have to look at the model.  We also have to look at what we have and how we can knit it together.</p> <p>  On my autism innovation strategy, I said to officials and my adviser, Noel Byrne, that we have an awful lot of low-hanging fruit where we can make powerful changes with very good interventions.  The summer programme is one of them.</p><p>There is also the transitioning from early years provision into primary, post-primary and higher education.  We see what I have done with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on that, but we also see what the telephone line has done.  The funding of that telephone line is being delivered by AsIAm and it is taking a large number of calls.  Being able to signpost families to speak to people with the lived experience has been hugely beneficial to the Department and the HSE, which is a welcome intervention and more interventions like that are required and can happen.</p><p> I ask the committee to work with us on the autism innovation strategy.  I would love the committee to pick the pillars within education, housing, health and employment and for members to tell us what their experience would be and what they would identify as the three issues that we do not need legislation to unlock but that are practical solutions that we need to work with Departments on.  The ask is there and whether it is the ask to deliver the summer programme or how we can increase employment, we have to ask the various Departments to help us make it work.  The solutions are there.</p><p> I will not shape anybody's thoughts on the matter.  I would love the committee's input on it.  As I work towards bringing forward the draft, I would love this committee to feed into it.  Those are some of the pillars the committee can help us to shape in order to help prevent people falling between gaps.  We must support families.  The funding is there but now we need to provide the practical solutions that are needed to make the system work for people in the autistic and neurodiverse communities.</p></speech>

This discussion has been beneficial and informative.  We intend that our proposals will feed into the strategy.  In the autumn term, we will meet families and discuss their lived experience.  I would like to think that the basis for many of our proposals will come from speaking to people on the spectrum about their needs.</p></speech>

For the information of our witnesses, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  They are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in any such way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Adam Harris, CEO of AsIAm.  I propose that we publish his opening statement on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I invite Mr. Harris to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We were especially appreciative of the opportunity to deliver training to the committee members prior to the public hearings.  As members are aware, AsIAm is Ireland&rsquo;s national autism charity.  Over the past eight years, we have been working towards our vision of an Ireland where every autistic person is accepted as they are - equal, valued and respected.  Our purpose is to advocate for an inclusive society for autistic people that is accessible, accepting and affirming.  We work to support the autistic community and our families to fully engage in Irish life and to build the capacity of society to facilitate true inclusion.  In everything we do, we are guided by the lived experience of autistic people, with half of our own team being autistic or neurodivergent.  We run a broad range of programmes to realise our vision.  This includes the recently established autism information line, the AsIAm autism ID card programme, and a range of supports including social and employment programmes for autistic people alongside formal autism-friendly accreditation for businesses and public services.</p> <p>  The establishment of a joint Oireachtas committee on autism and the drafting of a national autism innovation strategy have been long-standing strategic priorities for AsIAm since our foundation in 2014.  We consider the committee's work to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a joined-up approach to support autistic people and our families.  We believe this committee can create a blueprint for an inclusive and accepting society and help to drastically shift how autism and autistic people are seen, perceived and empowered within Irish society.  We welcome the approach taken by the committee so far and we hope that in the nine months ahead, the public hearings will provide an inclusive, rights-based, neuro-affirmative approach for autistic people and our families to have our voices heard.</p> <p>  There has been an increased policy focus on autism in recent weeks and months.  Alongside the committee, we are intensely engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s autism innovation strategy consultation.  We are represented on the advisory group of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act review and we have been working closely with the Department of Education on the ongoing barriers which persist for autistic people accessing their constitutional right to an education.  These initiatives are long overdue.  However, I must stress that the benefits from any of this engagement will ultimately be judged and assessed on whether it delivers much needed change for the community.</p> <p>  In the past two weeks the committee has focused its attention on the barriers autistic people experience in accessing a suitable and appropriate education.  In many respects, the issues at play in the area of education, namely, a lack of effective forward planning, a lack of proactive support and guidance for families, under-resourcing and a need for greater training, culture change and accessibility measures are indicative of the barriers which our community faces in every aspect of Irish life.  In a recent AsIAm survey, we documented the experiences of some 268 children who did not have an appropriate school place for September.  We believe this figure to be just the tip of the iceberg.  We welcome the emergency legislation introduced by Government but see it as just the first step.</p> <p>  One cannot create an inclusive education system simply by permitting people to enter a building.  Deeper change must follow and meaningful integration for students in special classes is vital and far from a universal reality at present.  We need to take a rights-based approach to this area and that is why our organisation is engaging with the EPSEN Act review and continues to oppose any non-rights-compliant measures such as the establishment of special education centres.  As we sit here today, there are many children and young people, especially those who attend special schools or who have the highest level of support, who have been unable to access this year&rsquo;s summer programme and whose family face a summer without structure or support.  I hope that the committee will look at the issues autistic people face in education in more detail and would welcome further engagement in this regard.</p> <p>  It is critical, however, that the committee also look at the bigger picture and the barriers which our community faces right across the life cycle.  Across Ireland, autistic people are deprived of the same chance &ndash; the same chance to go to school, to access healthcare, to get a job, to live a long, healthy, and happy life.  In many respects ours is a community in crisis.  We need to see policy change but, critically, we also need to see policy resourced and implemented and we need this to happen urgently.  In April, AsIAm published the Same Chance Report 2022.  This report consisted of an attitudes to autism poll, conducted with a representative sample of 1,000 Irish adults, and our own autism ID cardholder survey results.  The findings from our cardholders survey are startling.  More than a quarter, 28% of parents did not believe their child had an appropriate school place.  More than half of our respondents had experienced discrimination on the grounds of being autistic.  Almost two thirds did not believe the healthcare system was accessible for autistic people and 27% of people did not feel safe in their own communities.</p><p>These findings align with the trends we see daily through our autism information line and through the growing body of research, statistics and literature.  They are set against a backdrop of increased autism awareness.  Indeed, in our poll, 80% of the public were aware of autism as a clinical diagnosis, yet just 40% claim to have a good understanding of autism; an important distinction when it is considered that judgment and attitude is the single greatest barrier to inclusion identified by our community.</p><p> Our message to the committee is that, as a society, we need to go beyond autism awareness.  It is an important starting point but, ultimately, it does not deliver change alone.  The work of this committee must seek to identify means of removing the barriers autistic people face from cradle to grave and empower autistic people to be included, not by changing us but by changing attitudes, enhancing accessibility and ending stigma within society.  It is clear that the challenges our community face are not confined to one policy, sector or Department.  They are systemic and profound.</p><p> When a child is born in the State, most parents can assume they will have their choice of school places and can expect their child to learn, make friends and thrive there.  For our community, to even find a suitable place might mean applying to 20-plus schools or settling for home tuition, which is never a substitute for full educational provision.  If you are lucky enough to have a place, you will be faced with a series of relentless battles to get the support you need to learn and will often be at risk of a reduced timetable, suspension or even expulsion, just for being you.  Making friends may be a whole lot harder.  Statistically, it is likely that you will be bullied at some point along the way.  Most parents can take for granted that their children will be able to engage in day-to-day activities without supports.  The benefits and acceptance that comes from this participation helps to promote self-esteem and positive mental health.</p><p> For our community, differences in communication, self-regulation and sensory processing, to name just a few areas, often require access to support in order to be able to engage in education, community or adult life.  However, a family may wait many years to get a diagnosis or even to see a therapist.  Eight in ten people in our community will experience a mental health condition over the course of their lives and yet we are shut out of mainstream mental health services.  &ldquo;No&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am not the right person to talk to&rdquo; and &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see autistic people here&rdquo; are perhaps the most common terms our community hears when interacting with disability and health services.</p><p> As people grow up, they expect to find work, live independently and feel a part of their communities.  For our community, unemployment is a norm, with more than 80% of autistic people unemployed or underemployed.  This is unacceptable.  Too many adults continue to be deprived the opportunity to work and participate in the community in a manner that meets their needs; pushed instead towards services that are not always focused on the needs and preferences of the individual concerned.  For those who secure work, it often means masking who they are, which means having to hide parts of being autistic that others may find uncomfortable or not getting the support they need for fear of being discriminated against, underestimated or treated differently.</p><p> Accessing appropriate accommodation and adult day and residential services is a major challenge, with access to any support often only available after a crisis and with few to no pathways for autistic people who wish to live independently or find housing that is suitable to their needs.  Going to the shop, using public transport or accessing public services are all mundane tasks for most.  For an autistic person, these things often involve sensory overload - sense of being overwhelmed and of inaccessibility.  This arises from a lack of suitable training for public servants and businesses, even for those who regularly encounter autistic people.</p><p> A long, healthy life is something to which most can reasonably aspire.  For our community, low self-esteem, poverty, negative perceptions and attitudes within society and inaccessible healthcare means dying on average younger than most.  I know these statistics all paint an incredibly bleak picture of being autistic.  Sadly, however, that is the reality for many autistic people in Ireland in 2022.  It gives me no pleasure to say this, and I do not want to undermine the very good work and progress that has been made in some areas.  Rather, I highlight this because loneliness, isolation, poverty or social exclusion should not be an inevitable part of being autistic or raising autistic people.  None of the experiences or outcomes I have described are a prerequisite for an autism diagnosis.  A happy, healthy life should not be an exception for an autistic person - it must become the norm.  Our community deserves the same chance to be part of the rich fabric of Irish society.</p><p> We have already provided a detailed submission to the committee based on our autism innovation strategy submission.  This includes 56 specific actions for consideration.  While a broad range of actions are required to bring about the necessary change, at this initial hearing, I wish to highlight some key strands the committee should consider and explore in drafting its report.</p><p> Autistic people wait too long to receive timely access to supports such as assessment, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychological supports.  Too many people are forced to access private services at an enormous personal and family cost, which pushes many people towards poverty.  When services are available, they are too often aligned with a medical and behaviourist approach that focuses on compliance or implies the challenge is with the individual as opposed to validating different ways of communicating, thinking and experiencing the world, and supporting a person to participate and develop in life as their autistic selves.  Services must not be restricted to children.  A public pathway of support for autism assessment and services for adults must be urgently put in place.  Supports should also be inclusive of the full diversity of autistic person&rsquo;s experiences, and instead of taking a functional or medicalised approach, should facilitate people to get supports they need.  Supports must also be designed with the needs of women and intersectional minorities in mind.  Not providing timely services simply defers and increases the cost of support later at an enormous loss to the individual and society.  The State should act as a facilitator, not a gatekeeper.  A radical plan is needed and excessive waiting lists must end to ensure appropriate, regulated supports are in place.</p><p> As the committee has already identified, much more must be done to support autistic people in our education system.  While most young people now attend mainstream schools, this does not necessarily mean they are included.  If we truly want to see an education system where every student has the opportunity to attend a school that meets his or her needs in his or her locality, major change is required.  This includes addressing the pupil-teacher ratio, implementing mandatory training, ensuring boards of management have the expertise they need, addressing the sensory environment of schools and radically overhauling school discipline policies and the method  of educational assessment.  Many students suffer greatly in an education system that was not designed with our community in mind and which does not always allow our students' strengths and identities to be recognised and affirmed.  Too often, a person or family is provided with a diagnosis with no further context or follow-on support.  We must ensure every autistic person and their family has access to supports that empower the person to participate in the community and build the capacity of the individual and family to understand their diagnosis, advocate for their needs and educate those who support them.  This included the roll-out of a national post-diagnosis support programme, the provision of key workers and personal assistants and meaningful support for autistic adults to engage in self-advocacy.</p><p> Despite the challenges that exist, there is evidence that the public is far ahead of the State in recognising the scale of the challenge and desiring to effect change.  All of us are very proud of the strong communities that exist throughout Ireland and this must be better utilised.  A programme of supports should be put in place to educate the public to understand autism, run local initiatives and programmes to enable inclusion and ensure every autistic person grows up in a community that is accessible and accepting of who they are.  This should take place alongside mandatory training and accessibility measures for public services to ensure they are inclusive of autistic people.</p><p> I ask the committee to think radically.  The time for local solutions and sticking plasters must pass.  We cannot continue to stumble from one crisis to another while our community suffers.  We ask members to look to our European peers to benchmark other ambitious national autism strategies and recommend that Ireland not only creates such a strategy but, critically, legislates for it and furthermore, aligns it to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  This strategy would be complementary to existing disability legislation and must have time-bound, measurable goals and corresponding resources.</p><p> Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine have highlighted the ability of the State to mobilise and deliver responses.  If we put our minds to it, we firmly believe we can create a society in which every autistic person not only receives the supports he or she needs but is empowered to participate and contribute his or her unique skills, abilities and insights.</p><p> In 2025, AsIAm will host the Autism Europe Congress in Dublin.  We will welcome 2,500 advocates, researchers, practitioners and policymakers from across Europe.  What will the Ireland of 2025 look like for autistic people?  I hope, through the work of this committee, we will be able to describe a significant shift in how our society perceives and includes autistic people.  I hope we can report major improvements in how the State supports and engages with autistic people and family members.  I believe that our country, if it wants to, can become an example for others to learn from and follow.</p><p> I look forward to further engagement on specific themes with the committee.  I will be delighted to take members' questions.</p></speech>

I know AsIAm provides support and training to many parents' groups and other smaller organisations which come together to try to support each other.  AsIAm does considerable work in creating the awareness that needs to be improved.</p> <p>  As the Chairman said, Mr. Harris's report is very comprehensive.  He has given us some stark and frightening statistics as well as some good recommendations.  The positives are that this committee has been established and that an autism strategy is being prepared.  However, as Mr. Harris said, unless something comes from those, they will be no more than talking shops.  Some excellent reports on a range of issues have been produced but just gather dust on a shelf with nothing implemented.</p> <p>  Mr. Harris mentioned that awareness is at 80% which is good, but understanding is only at 40%.  How can that be improved?  We often talk about improved training for teachers, those in childcare settings and those in further education, but it needs to extend to all people, including all employers.  One parent told me about her son who had a masters in IT.  She was talking to an employer who was very interested in him and when she said he was autistic, suddenly the interest waned.  That is pure misunderstanding of autism in many ways or perhaps not knowing enough about what it might mean and the supports needed.  Perhaps education is also needed.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the lack of appropriate school places.  One parent contacted me on Friday.  She thought she was getting ahead of the posse by looking for a place for her son in a special class in September 2023 only to be told there were no places in the surrounding area.  He is in a mainstream primary school and has supports.  A NEPS psychologist recommended a special class setting.  I asked her what his SENO suggested.  She said there was no SENO in place or if there is, she has had no contact.  I will contact the NCSE to discuss that case.  Does AsIAm have much interaction with the NCSE on creating sufficient school places?</p> <p>  The Minister of State appeared before the committee earlier.  Is Mr. Harris confident that the changes she discussed, particularly on the CDNTs, will happen quickly enough to make a difference because early intervention is so important?</p></speech>

We work with many groups around the country.  We have recently finished the bridge forward programme with Cavan Autism Parents Support Group, a very good group in the Deputy's constituency.  The committee can look to international examples of training which would make a big difference.  Legislation recently passed in Westminster will now mandate all NHS staff in the UK to have autism training.  That arose from a tragic incident in the UK in which an autistic person was misdiagnosed and did not receive the treatment they needed because there was not an understanding of some of the communication differences.  This training saves lives and is critical.</p> <p>  A few years ago, Northern Ireland had an initiative using lottery funding to allow every member of the PSNI to access training.  Mandatory training is critical.  Training that is bespoke to specific industries is needed.</p> <p>  In Ireland we are not always good at talking about these things and if it is in any way uncomfortable, we shy away from it.  We have seen that with many social issues.  We have moved people into mainstream schools and now 86% of autistic people attend mainstream schools.  We have done it in a very Irish way in that we have not really talked about it.  Sitting in classes throughout the country are autistic people whose peers really do not understand.  We need to have very targeted awareness campaigns across the educational system.  Young people get this when they are given the information they need.  It goes beyond just the positive openness to it, which young people have already, but they need the tools to show them how they can make a friend and how they can help somebody if they become overwhelmed.  I would like to see awareness campaigns for the general population and also targeted mandatory training particularly for public services.</p> <p>  Regarding education, we have had very good engagement in recent weeks with the new CEO of the NCSE and he has undertaken to meet our organisation once a month in future.  This will allow us to keep him informed of trends on the ground which will be helpful.  There seems to be a disconnect between the spirit of the role of a SENO envisaged in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and what it is in practice.  For many families it can feel like a purely bureaucratic task as opposed to actually someone who is holding the child's hand and working with the family.</p> <p>  We need more SENOs in the NCSE.  There has actually been a reduction since its establishment and the need has grown enormously.  I would like to see a streamlining of the process to support families.  There is nothing more soul-destroying than having to apply to 20 different schools, sometimes even when it is clear there will not be place in one at the time parents are given the list by the NCSE.  Some streamlining needs to be done urgently.  Linked to that, if a child accepts a place that turns out not to be appropriate, the child should remain on the NCSE's books.  Many children take their mainstream class place and then drop off the system.  Often they are the children for whom the school placement does not work or begins to breakdown.</p> <p>  The issue of CDNTs can be incredibly frustrating for families.  It does not seem to be working properly anywhere in the country.  To improve access to therapies, we need to return to the Disability Act.  We saw how quickly the change to assessment of needs came in once the High Court ruled.  As a result, we also need to move to therapies being rights based and not just grace in favour.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Tully, I commend his outstanding work and that of AsIAm.  It is great have such a strong advocacy group which not only challenges us but will also help us inform what will be very important policy into the future.  I have taken one key nugget from Mr. Harris's opening statement which is that we need to move from mere autism awareness to a system where we are removing barriers from cradle to grave.  It is great that 2,500 people will attend AsIAm's conference and it will be an opportunity to showcase Ireland.  I know Mr. Harris set us a challenge.  He gave a very aspirational vision for Ireland in 2025 and he really challenged us to see if we can give a better service to those with autism.</p> <p>  As Deputy Tully said, some of AsIAm's key requests have been delivered.  We have the autism committee and the national autism innovation strategy.  Mr. Harris is correct that over the course of nine months this committee can probably develop a blueprint for a better and more inclusive society.  As she was leaving, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, asked us to deliver what are the key asks for this committee.</p> <p>  Some of us have come here with different backgrounds and different skill sets.  Deputy Tully has a background in special education.  Every day that I attend this committee represents a learning process for me.  I am overwhelmed by the challenges the autism community faces which we need to address.  It is apparent that it needs to be done as quickly as possible.  What are the key things Mr. Harris wants us to deliver with the Minister of State as she has asked us?  What are the roadblocks and what are the actions we need to take immediately if we are serious about helping deliver that vision to the 2,500 people who will come to Ireland in 2025? </p></speech>

We are really pleased by the autism innovation strategy.  For a long time, we faced significant Civil Service opposition to establishing a strategy.  It has come about through the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and her engagement with us.</p> <p>  I would like the committee to look at the pathways through the process.  Every day families face constant roadblocks.  People can fall between chairs that they did not even know were there.  In the discussion in recent years, concern has been expressed over whether autism is treated better than other disabilities.  The diagnosis opens many doors.</p><p>In our experience, an autism diagnosis locks an awful lot of doors straightaway - for example, getting a school place, and particularly accessing mental health services.  There are a lot of problems.  Part of what we need to do is resource services.  Earlier the committee debate concerned recruitment, which is a big issue.  Culture is also a factor.  Even when resources are not always available, then it is to do with how one communicates with families, and signposts people to enable them get to the next stop on their journey.  In our experience what very often happens is people are handed a diagnosis report and off they go but they have no idea where to go.  When I delivered training to this committee I said that if one typed the word "autism" into a Google search as many as 3 billion results will come up straightaway so families are just overwhelmed and end up spending a lot of money.  Sometimes the options they go to are not accredited or are unsafe.  Clearer pathways from the get-go would be really good, and one of the areas that we would like to see established is a key worker for families.  I mean someone whose job is to provide support through the entire journey as opposed to persons constantly being passed between different professions.</p><p> Training is an obvious need and in many respects it is an achievable thing to be put in place.  Let us consider all of the battles it took to set up autism classes in the education system.  In reality, an autism class is a teacher and two special needs assistants, SNAs.  One can end up with a teacher who is fresh out of college and has no experience or training in the area, which is a situation that does not work for anybody.  Therefore, I would like the issue of mandatory training addressed.</p><p> Another key area is diagnosis for adults, and I am talking in very broad themes.  There is a reality that for an autistic person to get a private diagnosis as an adult, it can cost between &euro;800 and &euro;1,500 plus there is very little follow-on support.  There have been very good initiatives, such as the Aspect programme in Cork, which show that providing a small bit of support to people at the right time can enable a person to live a fully independent life as opposed to a person becoming isolated and reliant on the mental health or social welfare systems.  I have outlined some of our key asks.</p></speech>

I join with colleagues in thanking him and AsIAm for everything they do for autistic people in this State.  It is wonderful that Ireland has an organisation like AsIAm with Mr. Harris at its helm for people who need him.  He has outlined many issues for us.  I totally agree with Deputy Flaherty that this committee has been established with a nine-month remit and we want to know what we can do to make changes in such a short time.  Mr. Harris outlined a number of issues that we need to take on board, and quickly, during the period.  I know the Chair is very positive about doing so and preparing our report.</p> <p>  I was alarmed by the fact that there is an 80% unemployment rate in the autism community, which was outlined in the presentation, and I ask Mr. Harris to outline how we can totally reduce that percentage.  However, I am aware of a number of services in my own area of County Kildare that help people.   A number of towns near me are what is called "autism-friendly".  I suspect that they are part of the education piece Mr. Harris mentioned in his introduction.  What is his opinion of autism-friendly towns?  Does he believe it is a good initiative?  Are there advantages and disadvantages?  Portlaoise is now an autism-friendly town and Councillor Noel Twomey contacted me recently about the initiative.  How can we develop the autism-friendly model and ensure that towns are friendly?  Like my colleagues, I have been in shops when autistic people arrived and they were looked at, which is not good enough and is an issue that must be addressed quickly.</p> <p>  I mentioned a lack of the July programmes in many places to the Minister of State.  One of the issues I asked her to consider, and I know that the Chair is involved in this matter too, is central locations for the July programme where we do not have enough teachers, SNAs, etc., to provide the programme.  The big town of Newbridge, which is in my own area of County Kildare, cannot provide a programme yet there are three or four secondary schools and multiple primary schools in the area.  I ask Mr. Harris to comment on the July programme and ask him to support this initiative.  As he well knows, a lack of routine for children, particularly during the summer months, is a major cause of concern for families.  I believe that this committee needs to address the issue and make recommendations.  I know that the Minister of State supports the initiative and I ask for the view of AsIAm. </p> <p>  Mr. Harris mentioned in his introduction that the Autism Europe Congress will take place in 2025 and will be attended by numerous stakeholders.  As we have discussed before with Mr. Harris, Malta has been touted as an example of what we should do better in this country and maybe there is something in Malta that this committee should examine.  The Minister of State said that her officials have been in contact with their counterparts in Malta and discovered that there are things that they do well that we could copy while there are things that we do well that they would like to copy.  I ask Mr. Harris to give European examples that this committee can look at and present to the Minister of State at the end of our nine-month remit.  </p> <p>  Finally, Mr. Harris mentioned how much it costs for an adult to get a diagnosis and I raised the following again this morning.  Almost on a weekly basis, and sometimes on a daily basis, I deal with families who cannot afford that cost.  It is essential that people get an early diagnosis and we all know why.  Where can we go to secure support for these families?  I asked the Minister of State that question and she told me that we will have that and that she is developing a model that will support families in their pursuit of a diagnosis.  Many families simply cannot afford a diagnosis because they cannot get it publicly and have tried to secure a private diagnosis but the cost was prohibitive.  Has AsIAm considered a model?  Can Mr. Harris suggest a model that we, as a committee, can recommend that the State provides as a help to families who simply cannot afford he cost of a diagnosis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.78" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#P00400"><p>I will touch on all of the issues raised.  One of the things about this committee is that it is vital that a few clear wins are identified and actioned in the time that we have available.  The Minister of State launched the autism innovation strategy, which will last one year and this committee will feed into that.  It is important for the committee to think strategically about what will happen beyond that year, so we need to identify what will take three or five years before we see improvements because some of these problems are deep and systemic.  There will only be a committee like this once and reaching an agreed understanding of solutions is really important.</p> <p>  The rate of unemployment among autistic people is hugely concerning.  In terms of disability as a whole, Ireland is the fourth poorest performer in the EU but it seems particularly different for autism.  There is a range of reasons for the high rate of unemployment and AsIAm has looked quite a bit at the issue.  Recently in the organisation a new team was established to specifically look at the issue of employment.  This year, we will run two pilot programmes in order to get under the roof of the issue a little bit more.  One of the big issues is that a lot of the existing support services that support autistic people to gain employment vary greatly from county to county.  Even disability-specific employment services do not always have the confidence or a knowledge of autism so sometimes there really is nobody supporting.</p> <p>  Ambition is another issue.  We know that the vast majority of autistic people go to mainstream schools like everybody else.  We also know that the children who attend special schools do not have access to career guidance so from that stage in education there is a presumption that an autistic person will not be employed within the community.  Let us consider the children who are in mainstream education.  There are still so many who when the leaving certificate examination comes around, and if they are not going to college, the conversation straightaway shifts to one of whether they will go to a day service as opposed to thinking that they can work. </p> <p>   To be clear, I believe that every autistic person can have a job but that does not mean every autistic person can work even what we might consider to be a part-time contract.  It might be that for some people, one day might be so exhausting or overwhelming but I think that it is about the State giving value to that and still going after those jobs.  Yes, the person probably will still need their disability allowance but this is about the dignity of participating and all of the problems that can be removed as a result.</p> <p>  There are two things we must look at if we want to change and one is work experience.  Literature shows that if we can expose people to work while they are still in education then the chance of them being unemployed after reduces drastically.</p><p>Autistic people in college might have to do a mandatory placement.  Many of our young people find they cannot get a good internship because they are so overwhelmed in college that their marks do not reflect the quality of their ability.  In other instances we might find that a person is so overwhelmed by college work that taking on a job is challenging.  We need to find ways to help people to get work experience while they are still in college because it gives them training and back up.</p><p> I am delighted the Senator asked about autism-friendly towns.  AsIAm created the framework in Clonakilty so I am probably biased in my answer.  Clane in County Kildare is one of the towns we are working with.  We feel it is a model that does two things.  Around the world when we looked at various autism-friendly towns much of the time it was a statement of intent.  We felt it had to mean something tangible and it needed to be transparent.  We created a framework for a town to follow to reach the standard.  It has worked incredibly well.  The supports help people in the town on a day to day basis.  They are also a driver for tourism.  The main thing is that from a very young age autistic people are told the community where they are growing up wants to meet them half way.  This can have a real impact from a self-esteem point of view.</p><p> We were delighted to be in Malta in 2016 when its legislation was published on world autism day.  It is a great example of the importance of consultation.  The legislation that became the autism empowerment Act was introduced in the Maltese Parliament as an autism spectrum disorder Bill.  Everybody worked very closely with autistic people to develop the oversight council that Malta now has.  It is seen as an example of best practice.</p><p> The only other comment I will make on best practice is if we want to look at European examples something that is very clear is that we are the only State on these islands that does not have an autism Act.  Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales do.  This should tell us the direction we should go in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1630" speakername="Catherine Ardagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#Q00200"><p>I thank Mr. Harris.  I was listening to him on the way in.  Much of what he said in his opening statement rang true particularly that the public is far ahead of the State when it comes to autism.  We can see all of the groups that exist.  In my area there is the Dublin 12 Campaign 4 Autism Inclusion and Involve Autism.  I know Mr. Harris is very aware of these groups.  The work they do is phenomenal.</p> <p>  I have heard anecdotally that the NCSE has directed parents to advocacy groups when simple questions are being asked.  This is very unfair.  These groups have taken on a huge burden.  It is practically a full-time job for the main advocates in the groups.  They are not getting any support from the State.  Perhaps the committee might look at supporting the groups administratively or giving something back to them.  Many of those involved stay at home to look after children and run the organisations at the same time.  It is amazing.  They have to be thanked.  I congratulate AsIAm, which is doing unbelievable work.  AsIAm and all of the other organisations must be thanked.  They are filling a gap the State should be filling.  As Mr. Harris said, there are no roadmaps.  There is no plan.  People are given a diagnosis but not told what will happen next.  Parents go to these groups to look for direction and support.  This should be provided by the State.  It should be very clear what will happen after a diagnosis with regard to what school the children will go to and the opportunities they will then have to go to college or work.</p> <p>  The committee should consider as a long-term goal the parents of children who need high levels of support.  Probably on a daily basis many parents of children with autism who require high levels of support ask themselves what will happen when they pass away and who will mind the children when they are not around.  We have to have a proper discussion on this.  We want to make sure that children have meaningful lives and get the proper support.  We are afraid to go down this road and answer the question.  Perhaps there is someone the committee can bring in to discuss it.  This is not just with regard to children with autism.  Parents of children with any disability face this tough and upsetting struggle.  It is unfair not to have a discussion until someone passes away.  It should be open.  What do we do for children with disabilities who require high levels of support when their parents pass away?  Do they just go into the local county home?  I do not know.  I have no idea what happens.  It is a real question people have and they deserve to know what the answer is and what supports will be there for the child.  The committee needs to step up and ensure there is a pathway and framework for supports for children.</p> <p>  Many local employment schemes are closing down, as was mentioned earlier.  The local employment service in Bluebell, which offered the employability scheme, closed down.  Many people contacted me about it.  For whatever reason it is not able to reopen.  It is not prepared to retender, for its own justifiable reasons.  We are losing a huge resource that supported people with disabilities to get employment.  We need to be able to pull it back.  Many services for people have already fallen away because of what is happening with the local employment service.  It is regrettable.  I thank Mr. Harris and I hope we all have an opportunity to attend the conference.  It is very exciting and I wish Mr. Harris the best of luck with planning it.</p></speech>

I agree there are strong local groups throughout the country.  The Dublin 12 autism support group with Helen and MJ and Involve Autism with Miriam are two examples of the incredible work being done.  Both of these groups in their respective areas have single-handedly changed the narrative on the availability of special classes and school places through their hard work.  We owe them a huge amount of gratitude and support.  These local groups play a vital role that an organisation such as AsIAm cannot necessarily do.  My mother said that when I was younger the most useful thing to do was to speak to the parent of the child in the locality who was two or three years older to find out how they overcame certain obstacles and get local intelligence on who to speak to and what a school was really like.  Supporting initiatives such as this should be part of an autism strategy.  I touched on this in the opening statement.  Much more targeted funding and support need to be available for these activities.  In many respects they are full-time jobs and full-time undertakings.</p> <p>  I completely agree with Senator on the point she raised about the death of parents.  It is something that comes up more and more.  It is very difficult because the parent groups that have been established are often more geared towards the early stage of life.  Parents do not often feel at home with this issue and it is often the same with the local autism groups.  There is a need for more targeted support.</p> <p>  The same is true with regard to a tangential issue, which is ageing and autism.  We speak about a population and we focus on the very young.  We have a cohort of people who are growing older and there are many challenges that go with this.  Other jurisdictions are only beginning to look at this.  It is something we should have on our radar.  The issues regarding ageing and death are particularly relevant given the assisted decision-making Act.  It will bring in a lot of changes and we will need to support families and individuals with understanding it.  Our concern at present is that too often the transition to adult services, such as residential care, happens when someone dies or only when a crisis happens.  Autistic people need certainty and predictability.  It would be far more helpful if it were done in a structured way much earlier.  It would be better for everybody.</p> <p>  With regard to the local employment service it is clear we need more supports in this area and not fewer.  It is vital that something is done.</p></speech>

There is a huge number of groups in every county.  Parents are coming together because of a lack of support.  They do a huge amount of work on behalf of all families and children.  I agree they should have some sort of support.</p><p>In recent weeks, a group of parents in my area fundraised over &euro;20,000.  Funding to support the special school to help the kids is not available through the HSE.  It is a problem.  Parents are taking action to bring in services that are lacking in the area.  It is important that some sort of support mechanism is put in place.  I hope that the work of this committee and the proposals we make will result in the provision of support for all of life.  That is important for all parents.</p></speech>

I am sure we will be seeing a lot more of him in the next nine months.  He mentioned that we need to be radical in our approach.  I fully agree.  The word "radical" is often thrown around in political parlance.  I have been a Deputy for two and a half years and I can say that, in general, we are far from radical as a body politic.  I am not pointing the finger at anyone in particular.</p> <p>  I hate to localise the issue, but I am familiar with the situation in County Cork.  Credit is due to the Taoiseach for his intervention last year in Carrigaline, where, against the clock, we got a special school up and running.  The process was managed in such a haphazard way that it was obvious that planning and forward thinking was completely absent, to put it mildly.  Were it not for political intervention, we would still be talking about a special school for County Cork.  Thankfully, there is another set to be delivered in Rochestown.  As I said, there seemed to be no joined-up thinking in the context of the process of delivering the special school in Carrigaline.  It was reactive, and far from radical.</p> <p>  We can also see the reactive approach in the emergency legislation that is going through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  The issue has been spoken about for quite a while, yet here we are in the last week of term trying to get the legislation, as welcome as it is, passed.  My experience as a Deputy in the last two and a half years has shown me that there is no radicalism here.  I just see the machinery of State moving very slowly.  However, I hope that more that anything, the work of this committee can highlight how we need to be radical.  That is where we need people like Mr. Harris to help point us in the right direction.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Harris on housing.  This is an issue I have worked on with Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  Some local authorities are better than others in dealing with individual circumstances, whether they involve autism, disability, an elderly person or whatever.  To Mr. Harris's knowledge, are there any local authorities that have housing policies which, in the context of housing allocation, reflect the needs of autistic people?  Obviously, many people will seek to retrofit houses - and will apply for grants for same - for their children or themselves as time goes by.</p> <p>  Mr. Harris referred to the fact that 80% of autistic people are not working.  I have no doubt that a large proportion of them could work if they were given the opportunity to do so.  What specific areas should we be targeting to bring people into the workforce and give them the opportunity to contribute to society?  I ask Mr. Harris to answer those two questions initially.  If there is time, I will raise the issue of assessments of need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#R00300"><p>Housing is an area in respect of which we have seen a huge spike in demand and growing concern since the start of the pandemic.  We have gone from receiving correspondence on the matter relatively occasionally to receiving it consistently from families that are in quite significant difficulty.  When we consider how important the sensory needs of autistic people are, we see that very often they are misunderstood and overlooked.  Meeting the sensory needs of an autistic person is as serious as a physical accessibility issue may be for somebody with a different disability.  That is not always understood or accepted.  During the pandemic, our homes became classrooms, kitchens and social settings all in one place.  Many families found that very challenging, particularly those with more than one autistic family member who could have very different sensory needs.  Sharing one small space was very challenging for them.  What we have found across the country is that a very different approach is taken from county to county.  In advocacy work we have done on behalf of community members in some local authority areas, it has been accepted that if a person is not in the right environment, their condition could become progressive.  If their needs are not being met, the person will become increasingly distressed and less self-regulated, for example.  Some local authorities have accepted that.  Others have not.  I can follow up with the committee to provide more information on where we have had good experiences.  I will talk to the team and revert with that information.  It is clear that we need to have a national policy that recognises that autistic people have specific housing needs that should be catered and provided for in each area.</p> <p>  On the issue of employment, it is important to state that I do not think there are specific sectors that should be targeted as such.  In fact, there is already a bit of stereotyping that finance, IT are pharmaceuticals are sectors that attract autistic people.  It is true that there are autistic people with those skill sets and there are initiatives by some big companies around hiring autistic talent, but, actually, it is about matching the skills of an autistic person to a particular job.  In order for us to be able to do that, we need to look at two areas.  We need to have a much broader range of employers engaging in the process.  For example, we know that there are lot of autistic people with qualifications and interest in the creative arts, such as animation.  However, there are not necessarily employment opportunities for autistic people in those sectors.  It is really about matching the people to their interests.  If we do that, they will thrive.  If there is another area of the economy that is especially important, it is the SME sector.  Many members of the autistic community cannot travel long distances and need to work locally.  We must ensure that there are not just opportunities in Dublin and Cork, but that the SME sector has the confidence and support to hire people in rural towns as well.</p></speech>

We discussed recruitment for the provision of therapies and assessments of needs.  We have spoken about how we can address that.  There are people moving from the public sector into the private sector.  There is undoubtedly a shortfall in the number of qualified therapists in a whole raft of different areas.  What does AsIAm advocate in terms of how we can recruit the therapists we need?  Thinking of my local area, around one in four posts remains unfilled.  It has been like that since 2016 or 2017.  In that period, the situation has not improved; it is proving more challenging to retain staff now.  I ask Mr. Harris to address that issue.  If he has time, I ask him to comment on the summer programme.  I cannot expect Mr. Harris to be an expert in everything.  It is great when we see headline figures such as the provision of &euro;40 million for the programme.  Like others, however, in my heart and soul I know that we will be lucky to draw down one third of that based on what last year was like.  How do we maximise those opportunities?  Should we be expanding the programme out to beyond teachers?  Should care workers and different therapists in training be recruited?  How does Mr. Harris see those vacancies in the summer programme being filled?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#R00500"><p>On the recruitment issue, it is clear that there is a cultural aspect involved.  It is also clear that the teams that are facing recruitment crises are often those that are under-resourced.  In many respects, the clinician becomes the public face of a failing system.  That has a huge impact on people's willingness to work there, particularly in the long term.</p> <p>  Another issue, as I understand it, is that there are significant entry-level opportunities, but we are not offering people the pathways that are so critical to ensuring that they remain in the system, particularly as they build up experience.  That is where we are losing people.  Another area that is important here concerns exposing people to disability when they are still in training.  When many people are training, for example, as physiotherapists, they are not actually seeing disability as an attractive place to work or as a place with significant pathways.  That definitely needs to be improved.  Not only do we need to train more people, but we need to expose people to more opportunities to work in disability while they are studying so that they build up an interest in the area.  It is clear that the summer programme could play a role in that.  Strategically, it would make a lot of sense to kill two birds with one stone.</p> <p>  Ultimately, we must ensure that in trying to fix this issue we do not drive funding into the private sector as well.  That is always a tension.  We are increasingly seeing people leave the public sector to work in the private sector.  The public sector then begins to collapse further.</p><p>A range of measures are required.  It is very clearly about pathways, but it is about culture and morale as well.  Again, that comes back to resourcing.</p><p> On the issue of the summer programme, I am glad the Deputy raised this because it is very important.  We all know how difficult it is to get funding for disability.  The idea that any of that money would be surrendered back to the Department of Finance is gut-wrenching.  There need to be creative ways to look at how that money can get to the end user if they are not able to access the summer programme.  If there is any sort of surplus, which I think there will be at the end of the summer &ndash; we already raised this matter with the Department &ndash; that should be looked at in terms of whether there can be a transition back-to-school programme that could be developed to support people who might find starting in September especially difficult because they have gone two or three months without any support.  That is important as well.</p><p> We welcome the expansion of the summer programme.  It should include as many children as possible.  However, there has to be a recognition that those with the highest level of need and those in special schools have been left behind.  In next year&rsquo;s response, there needs to be a targeted approach to make sure that those children are able to access the support they need.  The only way of doing that is moving it outside just the Department of Education and bringing in therapy and HSE staff as well.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Harris and his organisation for their role in that.  Obviously, I deal with families all the time.  Half the time I am just heartbroken and left wondering what solutions can be found.  That is one aspect.</p> <p>  This is our second or third meeting.  From reading Mr. Harris&rsquo;s documentation, I learned how I need to reorient my thinking and expand it to be, literally, more inclusive.  That makes me realise how big a challenge this is for all of society.  I would think, as we all do, that we are fairly broad-minded and open.  However, when you do not have personal experience of something or you do not see it in your immediate family, your experience can be quite limited.  I see the huge challenge that presents for society.</p> <p>  As I said, that is where we are starting from.  The committee will be in place for a period of nine months.  Many Deputies have referred to that, and Mr. Harris talked about the wins that we could hope to achieve during that time.  Also, we have to look at fundamental policy change.  In regard to the wins, I raised employment earlier with the Minister of State.  Mr. Harris spoke about it as well.  Can he elaborate a little on practical supports in employment settings?  Has he worked with any employer organisations?  What response did he get?  What progress has been made?  What is his view on the WALK programme and how could we give it greater support?</p> <p>  On legislative change, is there anything at EU level?  There is a lot of good legislation.  We have the disability strategy, but that is a strategy; it is not actual legislation.  Of course, we have anti-discrimination legislation and the convention, but, again, it is a convention.  Does Mr. Harris see anything in regard to concrete legislation that would be useful, either at EU level or here, particularly as there is nothing to prevent us from going further?  While the legislation in place is supportive, it is not sufficient to move us that bit further that we need to go.</p> <p>  Mr. Harris is absolutely right that we need to grasp some of the nettles.  If a certain percentage of children with autism are in mainstream schools, we think that is inclusion just because they are physically present.  At a much more basic level, however, it means that the whole system, including teachers, students, physical space, school policies and boards of management, is, if you like, set up in such a way that inclusion actually means that the space - by space I mean everything - is not just designed for an autistic child, but it is designed for all, which includes autistic children.  We talk about universal design meaning the physical space.  However, we have to broaden our thinking on that.  What are Mr. Harris&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter?</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Harris to grasp a very difficult nettle.  I was a teacher for many years.  Mr. Harris wrote about discipline policies in his submission.  Can he talk to us about that, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#S00300"><p>To start with the employment space, this is something our organisation has been doing quite a lot of work on.  Two years ago, we set up a new partnership with <i>IrishJobs.ie</i>, the country&rsquo;s main employment website.  We published a report, which I can send a copy of to the committee, called Autism in the Workplace.  In that report, we looked at two things.  We surveyed members of our community about their experience looking for work and then we surveyed employers about their openness and attitude in this area.  If I was to sum it up broadly, employers are interested in this and want to do something, but are terrified of getting it wrong.  That is the main barrier.  There is the sense that employers would do something but they do not know what they should do or do not even know where the barriers are.  Contrasted with the experience of autistic people, there is a reluctance to even share that they are on the spectrum if they are going for job interviews.  Some 75% said they would not tell their employer.  There is an awful lot of culture work that will need to be done there to shift it.  Sometimes within the workplace, we find it is slightly like a chicken-and-egg situation because, on the one hand, there needs to be more people standing up and saying, &ldquo;I am autistic and I work here&rdquo;, which gives other people confidence.  However, at the same time, it is very hard to be the first person to do that.<br/><br/>Last year, AsIAm published a toolkit for employers - the Same Chance Toolkit - with <i>IrishJobs.ie</i>.  That looks at all of the measures an employer can take from recruitment through to interview, induction and onboarding.  It is very important to note that there is a piece of work just about demystifying, because the sorts of accommodations that our community might need are often very minor.  It may be, for example, a person wanting to work remotely three days a week because the bus takes so much out of the person in the morning.  It might be somebody, for example, needs to wear a certain item of clothing because other clothing may cause irritation.  For example, perhaps something like what I am wearing might not be comfortable for every autistic person.  It might mean that a person just needs to sit in a particular part of the office where it is less noisy.  Often, the accommodations can cost very little.  It is about educating everyone in the workplace to realise it not the way they used to do it, but that is actually okay.  Education is key in that regard.<br/><br/>We recently set up a community of practice with some of the leading employers in the country.  We will be rolling out training with them over the course of the next number of months with a view to them beginning to employ people over the coming year.  That is a project we will keep the committee updated on.<br/><br/>On legislation, I will raise two things that I do not have an answer on today but that may be food for thought for the committee.  In many European countries, there are quotas in the private sector in respect of this area.  There are no such quotas in Ireland.  There are pros and cons to quotas, and they do not always mean true inclusion.  At the same time, however, there comes a point where one has to ask whether, if the rate of progress is too slow, we need to think more radically.  Where the State could have an instant impact and already does some work in this area, is in procurement.  We have had some engagement with employers where they are looking at this area because they are seeing it is impacting procurement in public contracts.  Those are two areas at both an EU and national level where more could possibly be done.<br/><br/>On universal design, a piece of work that might interest the committee is the ASPECTSS framework.  One of the challenges with design in autism is it is not like physical access where it can be codified, rather, it is more of a framework because people are so different.  That framework was developed by an Egyptian architect called Dr. Magda Mustafa.  We find it is a very good basis for looking at design.  Many of our school buildings, even our new ones, are not considering autistic people.  They are more physically accessible but not necessarily as autism friendly.</p><p>High ceilings, common-purpose areas, and all of those sorts of spaces can cause challenges.</p><p> Discipline is a huge issue.  If an autistic person goes to school and becomes really overwhelmed, begins to feel really distressed in the classroom and experiences a meltdown, a meltdown is not something that he or she has any control over.  The brain has actually reached such a point that it can no longer communicate or regulate all of the information it is getting.  Currently, if a person has a meltdown in the classroom and during that hour or 90 minutes throws a chair, lies on the floor or becomes distressed, the situation will very often be addressed through a code of behaviour that is the same policy that deals with the student who smokes behind the shed out the back.  It does not seem remotely fair that those two things would be treated in the same way.  There are times when the school placement breaks down or the person is not in the right school but it is harrowing that how we address such situations is by suspending and expelling people and by using terms like "assault", when in many cases the people being referred to would not be held criminally liable in any court in the State.  They are actually treated nearly like a criminal by the education system.  There is a real need to change the code of behaviour.</p></speech>

I do not want to overemphasise it but he said that "A radical plan is needed and excessive waiting lists must end to ensure appropriate, regulated supports are in place."  Many of us here are very quick to identify the problems.  We know the problems because people come to us every week in our clinics.  What does Mr. Harris envisage specifically in that radical plan to tackle those excessive waiting lists to ensure people get appropriate access to the interventions they require?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#T00300"><p>There is a lot of work to be done here.  As with any complex issue, it will require more than one intervention to address it.  We need to be very clear that we are in a major crisis now arising from the recent judgment around the assessments of need.  Last year the HSE struggled to do 6,000 assessments of need.  Next year, as a result of the legislation, they may have to do 29,000 assessments of need.  The entire range of support that is available will go purely on that diagnostic piece and will not be available for therapy.  This is hugely worrying.</p> <p>  One aspect that needs to be looked at urgently is attracting therapists from overseas to come to Ireland.  Obviously, this relates to pay and conditions but currently occupational therapy and speech and language therapy are not on the list of urgently needed professions.  People cannot bring their families here.  This is a very quick thing we could change that would have an impact.  We will have to look at a range of measures such as giving people a budget to spend within the private sector, enabling people to travel abroad, and access to telehealth.  The challenge is that if we provide those solutions they need to be very time-bound.  There is a risk the system will worsen because the whole system will shift towards a private model.</p> <p>  I wish to pick up on a point that Senator Wall also brought up, but which I did not get to.  We really need to look at the cost of disability.  Dr. &Aacute;ine Roddy of NUI Galway has published a paper around the cost of autism.  It found that, on average, families are spending &euro;28,000 more per year than they would if they were raising a child who is not on the autism spectrum.  This mainly comes about because one parent must give up work or go part-time and any bit of disposable income ends up going on private therapies.  The State has to do something to recognise this.  Everybody knows that it is going to take time to address the waiting lists but people need to be resourced and provided for in the interim, particularly when we are faced with a cost-of-living crisis.  Our pre-budget submission will focus on this.</p></speech>

I believe there are 137 early intervention classes nationwide.  It is clear that the majority of children who avail of those classes obviously would require a diagnosis.  The difficulty is that if a child is three, four, five or six years of age, the chances are that he or she will not have received a diagnosis if he or she is on the public list.  Those early intervention classes are therefore undeniably skewed towards people who can afford to pay for it.  Does Mr. Harris see any solution to that other than possibly the State filling in and providing for it?  The State should be doing it anyway but what is the solution to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#T00500"><p>It is important to note that the HSE has an autism programme board.  I am not sure if the committee is aware of it.  It was set up a couple of years ago arising from a review of autism services that was carried out in 2017.  The board is tasked with looking at two main areas of work.  First, it is preparing to do a HSE awareness campaign about autism.  That piece is coming.  Second, there is a desire to develop a pathway protocol for autism assessment.  This is looking at a tiered model of assessment through the public system.  That pilot is going on at the minute in CHO 2, CHO 7 and CHO 9 and is running until next March.  I specifically made the point that it is really important that this committee would get an opportunity to scrutinise the progress, or otherwise, that the board is making.  I believe it will have some preliminary data towards the end of this year.  It would definitely be worth the committee hearing about that progress.  One model - which will not necessarily be the right model - is an example of where the system's thinking is that in that regard.  Perhaps this answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

However, this model is not suitable for a lot of families or for many students and schoolgoers with autism.  I am glad that Mr. Harris gave the response he gave but what is his view on the AIM programme when it clearly is not suitable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.97" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#T00700"><p>This is really useful.  I nearly missed that so I thank the Senator for asking me.  AIM is a very good example of where a disability general approach does not always work for people with autism.  Even getting this committee established was one of the big points that had to be driven home.  People do not always grasp it.  Because so many people with autism are going into preschool without a diagnosis, the reality is that the support required at level 7 is generally out of reach for our families even if it is sanctioned.  As a result, AIM is an example of a lot that is positive, but with regard to parent satisfaction the parents who tend to be least satisfied or feel that it works least effectively are the parents of people with autism.  We were very concerned with some of the speculation a number of months ago about the NCSE not opening more autism early intervention classes or moving to abolish them.  We would not support such a measure.  This is important because of course we want to move towards a more inclusive model but we are very clear that we cannot have a lost generation in the process.  Until we have preschools that are fully resourced and meet the needs that exist, parents must have the option and it must be resourced.  The other reality is that because there is not the required level of autism early intervention classes around the country, very often money is then going through the home tuition scheme to private providers.  There is a need to scrutinise a little bit more the value for money in some of these areas.  I think again of the 15,000 children who must travel outside of the community to go to school and the massive costs this is generating.  By not putting in place the required support at a local level, I am not sure that we are not losing a lot of money for the system across the board.</p></speech>

Then there is debate on whether that is a good idea.  The majority of adults with autism do not agree with any ABA therapies, yet ABA cr&egrave;ches are being offered, which the State is supporting.  Maybe they are great; I do not know.</p></speech>

We are clear that it is not something we would be supportive of.

Mr. Harris is an excellent advocate for people and families with autism.  I want this on the record because it is important that wider society has a better understanding of what autism actually is.  That this committee has been set up has brought it a little bit more into the public domain.  There is more discussion about it in the media and around special education, special schools and so on.</p><p>It is important that this committee was set up.  Like all members, I am hopeful that the proposals we make as a committee will feed into a strategy that will make a lot of positive changes to the lives and families of people with autism.</p><p> Mr. Harris has set us a challenge.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that the conference took place in 2005.  Mr. Harris has asked the Government and the committee where Ireland will be in 2025.  Many European countries are far ahead of us.  The question is whether we are climbing the ladder and will overtake them.  That is what we need to do.  Mr. Harris and I have spoken at length about the model followed in Malta.  Although it is a small Mediterranean country, it is many years ahead of us with its empowerment Act to make sure whole-of-life supports are available for people.</p><p> Through the clerk, we have made contact with the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach with regard to making Leinster House and its grounds autism-friendly.  I would like to see that in place for September when families come in here.  It is important that we set out our stall about what we are going to do.  Perhaps the approach could be rolled out to every single local authority and every public building across the country.  That is the challenge we need to set for all local authorities across Ireland, the OPW and all public buildings.  We need buildings to be autism-friendly.</p><p> Mr. Harris has commented on the summer provision.  The issue has been highlighted at our meetings in recent weeks.  I agree with Senator Wall's point about schools being clustered together so that at least one school in a geographic area or town is providing the service.  As a committee, we must be strong on the point that it is not acceptable for a special school not to have summer provision.  We must expand the range of staff eligible to work in the summer provision to include those working in the ECCE system to make sure we have enough staff.  We do not want to see advertisements for staff who do not have the necessary qualifications.  I know of one school that already has its 2023 yearly plan but does not intend to include summer provision.  That is not acceptable.  A clear signal must go out that every single school should provide it in summer 2023.</p><p> The figures on employment are very stark.  Some 80% to 85% are underemployed or unemployed.  That is the reason I think it is important to break down the barriers and change policy regarding employment.  If more people had a better understanding of autism, it would be a help.  When people do not understand, there can be a fear attached to employing a person with autism.  In many respects, they are more than able for jobs.  It is more a question of wider society knowing about and understanding autism.  That will be a help.</p><p> I have spoken to local authorities on this issue.  In Waterford, there are hidden disability car parking spaces.  Every local authority should take this excellent idea on board.  Such parking spaces should also be provided in car parks attached to public buildings.</p></speech>

Did he have any discussions with the Department in regard to the model of training to give teachers more experience?  I had a discussion with someone the other day who was going to work in a special class.  Such a person should have to work in summer provision prior to going into work in such a class.  We have heard stories about teachers arriving to teach a special class who have no experience at all in the area.  That is not acceptable.  Something must be put in place for people to get experience.</p> <p>  I am a firm believer in the school inclusion model.  That is what we need to work towards, to ensure it is rolled out throughout the country.  Speech and language therapy should be provided to children on a weekly basis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, indicated that it could be part of the summer provision.  People in third or fourth year of an occupational therapy course or a speech and language therapy course could be employed for the summer so that children would get the service through the summer as well.  What are Mr. Harris's views on teacher training?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adam Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022071200002#U00400"><p>Teacher training is a source of enormous frustration for everybody.  This point was raised when the representatives of the teachers' unions were before the committee.  There is agreement across the board about how important it is.  When we come to teacher training and autism, it is yet another example of the point I made a moment ago to Senator Ardagh that there has been a reluctance to grasp the nettle and recognise that teachers of autistic people need very specific training.  Sometimes there is an adage used in education that good teaching is good teaching, if one likes, but what people need to understand is that communicating and interacting with an autistic person for a neurotypical teacher is often counter-intuitive.  A very simple thing is how a teacher knows a student is listening.  He or she might check if the student is making eye contact.  An autistic student might need to look away in order to hear what the teacher is saying.  There is such a counter-intuitive way of communicating that the teacher might need to learn about.  We are concerned that it should be part of initial teacher education.  Whatever about having a transition time, we are seeing teachers come out of college now who tell us that they had a couple of lectures on autism and that was really it.</p> <p>  I encourage the committee to consider in the coming period the fact that Mary Immaculate College, at its second campus in Thurles, has a compulsory module in autism in the final year of the degree.  It is the only teacher training college that has done that.  There is a success story there that should be rolled out.  Dr. Finn &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is the principal there and he has been leading the work.  That is something to look at as a model.</p> <p>  What is also important is the ongoing development of the teacher.  AsIAm has developed an autism-friendly schools programme that we had evaluated last year.  Some 350 schools came to us and they completed a tool that shows them their areas of strength and their areas of development.  They have online training on an introductory level that every teacher in the school can do.  Then they nominate one mainstream and one special education teacher to come to three CPD days over the course of the year, where they access master classes and meet other schools.  It is a real community of practice.  That is something that we would like to scale and expand, but at the moment we are operating at a loss because nobody is providing something similar.  We need funding at different levels, but initial teacher education should have a compulsory component around autism.  The module in Mary Immaculate College in Thurles is definitely something that the committee should consider looking at further.</p></speech>

It is great news to hear about the progress that is being made about accessibility measures in Leinster House.  That is certainly something we can assist with in the summer prior to the committee hearing from families later on.</p> <p>  We will follow up with a couple of pieces that I undertook to send on to the committee.  We will continue to be available as a resource throughout the nine months, should the committee need any further input or guidance on specific issues.</p> <p>  There was one question that I did not get to, which related to the idea of regional centres for the summer programme.  We need to be as flexible as possible to get the maximum number of children through the programme.  What is unknown at the moment is that a school can welcome a child from another school if it has capacity.  We have seen some good local examples, but the Department should be promoting that more.</p><p>The one point I would make is that it will not work for every child.  For some children with the most complex needs, you really need staff and a setting you are familiar with.  I thank the committee again.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 29.  I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members to confirm prior to making their contributions that they are on the grounds of Leinster House.</p> <p>  In accordance with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate.  I call on the Minister of State to make his opening statement, which will be followed by questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022071200002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to present details of the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 29.  Our purpose in being here is to seek the approval of the select committee for the Supplementary Estimate, which will allocate &euro;200 million to a new subhead B13 - emergency generation capacity in the energy transformation programme.  The Supplementary Estimate includes &euro;110 million in additional Exchequer funding, along with a reallocation of &euro;90 million in forecast underspending within the Department.</p> <p>  On 7 June 2022, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, directed EirGrid, the transmission system operator, to procure circa 450 MW of additional generation capacity for the period covering winter 2023-24 through to winter of 2025-26 to offset a potential capacity shortfall of electricity supply.  In order for EirGrid to be able to comply with this direction, it requires financial support from the Department.  Legislation to ensure that EirGrid can carry out this direction, including the legal basis for the Department providing the necessary financial support, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas and was signed into law by the President last Thursday.  For the avoidance of doubt, the public service obligation levy provisions in the legislation, which provide for a rebate to customers, will be dealt with through electricity bills.</p> <p>  The level of financial support required from the Exchequer in 2022 to allow EirGrid place orders on the electricity generation units and ensure that they are delivered and installed in time for winter 2023-24 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;350 million.  However, as the final level of financial support required from the Exchequer this year will not be fully known until later in the summer when all of the contractual arrangements are in place, it has been agreed that approval for the allocation of funding will be requested in two tranches, namely, the current allocation under this Supplementary Estimate of &euro;200 million and a subsequent request later in the year for the balance of funding required.  The second Supplementary Estimate will take account of the final agreed figures for the purchase and installation of the equipment, Transmission Use of System cost recovery and any further savings arising in the Department based on projected year-end expenditure.</p> <p>  As I have mentioned, the overall purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to allocate &euro;200 million to a new subhead B13 in the energy transformation programme area to fund the purchase by EirGrid of additional emergency generation capacity.  The &euro;200 million being allocated comprises: &euro;110 million in additional funding from the Exchequer; the reallocation of &euro;40 million from subhead B4 &ndash; residential-community retrofit programmes; &euro;20 million in savings under subhead B11 &ndash; electricity credit; and &euro;30 million from subhead D.3 &ndash; national broadband plan.  The transfer of &euro;30 million from the national broadband plan subhead was considered by the Selection Committee on Transport and Communications on Wednesday of last week.</p> <p>  Following the announcement by the Government earlier this year of an enhanced package of measures to support the uptake of home energy upgrades, demand for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, residential energy efficiency schemes has been very strong, with the number of applications received double the level seen in 2021.  It is expected that the pipeline of applications will result in high levels of delivery for the remainder of the year.  However, indicative mid-year results from the SEAI show a forecasted underspend at year end on the one-stop-shop and community energy schemes.  While the targeted number of houses will be started in 2022, it is anticipated that not all of these will be completed and certified for payment in 2022 due to supply chain constraints.  It is expected that the pipeline of applications in 2022 will result in strong levels of delivery in 2023.</p> <p>  The &euro;400 million allocated to the electricity credit included a contingency to cover the possible cost arising from a growth in the number of domestic household accounts in excess of the original 2.15 million forecast.  The final cost of the electricity credit was just under &euro;380 million.  This left savings of &euro;20 million available to be reallocated to the emergency generation capacity subhead.  I am happy to take questions from the committee.</p></speech>

For the record, the Opposition has facilitated the legislation on the basis of the urgent nature of the crisis we face regarding the lights going out next winter.  I have to say it is a very unsatisfactory process with regard to engagement and information.  I have listened to Government Deputies speak about how much information was available.  Every time we have had an exchange on this there has been new information and some answers but other questions remain unanswered.  I want to make this point to the Minister of State, as I did to the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  At a meeting of the transport committee last week I told the Minister the presentation of these as savings is quite the Orwellian move.  They are missed targets as they relate to retrofitting.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  We are dealing with &euro;200 million out of a possible &euro;350 million.  Do we know from where we might expect the &euro;150 million to come later in the year?  I welcome the fact there is &euro;252 million remaining for the retrofit budget.  Will the Minister of State give us some details of what targets will be missed that have given rise to the availability of this funding?  The Minister of State has pointed towards the one-stop-shop and community energy targets.  Will the Minister of State give us the figures on what the targets were, what will be started and what will be completed by the end of the year?  This will give us a sense of the progress we are making on the one-stop-shop and the community energy scheme.</p> <p>  Within this funding will the Minister of State give us an update on the warmer homes scheme?  I know the target is 4,800 by the end of the year.  I know that at the end of May we had 1,453 done.  The Minister of State points towards the objective of getting to 400 a month.  Are we at 400 a month?  Did we do more than 400 in June?  To get us to the target of 4,800 by the end of the year we will need to do an average of 478 a month.  Is this another target we will miss by the end of the year?  These are the most vulnerable citizens.  This brings me back to my original question.  Will we have an underspend and money available at the end of the year because we will have missed targets in the warmer homes scheme?  I want to register a concern about the approach in government at budget time and announcing very high figures for retrofitting and then spending the rest of the year moving money out of this allocation, whether for the electricity credit or something else.</p> <p>  With regard to the reallocation from the electricity credit underspend my colleague, Senator Boylan, held a session last week on energy poverty.  On Second Stage Deputy Smith and I raised concerns about the fact the electricity credit would not be made available to people in halting sites for example.  We know there are other multi-unit residences that did not receive the electricity credit.  We have &euro;20 million being reallocated from it now.  Will the Minister of State tell us how many people in halting sites or multi-unit developments did not receive the electricity credit?</p></speech>

If I do not get to a question the officials will revert to the Deputy.  He will appreciate I am not responsible for these matters.  With regard to the lack of information I take on board the points the Deputy has made.  I understand it has been widely discussed at this committee and other fora during the debate.  These are not targets that have been missed.  I said in my opening statement there were supply chain issues that will carry us into 2023 and those targets will be met.  There is very buoyant demand for the energy retrofit and this is to be welcomed.  It is important that these targets are met, if not in 2022 certainly in 2023.</p> <p>  With regard to the specific question on the &euro;150 million, it will have to be achieved later in the year.  The balance will come from Exchequer funding and any underspend in the Department at year end.  It is normal for this to take place and it will be there.  With regard to the reallocation of the electricity credit it is the case that the number of dwellings the Department had anticipated fell slightly short.  This is why the &euro;20 million was there as additional moneys.  These are moneys that were there because all households had received it.</p> <p>  We will have to come back to the Deputy on the number of people and families in Traveller accommodation and halting sites.  The Deputy has made a valid point.  It is important.  They are vulnerable low-income families and this is important.  It is something on which we will get back to the Deputy.</p> <p>  With regard to the warmer homes scheme and the achievement of 400 a month, in June 436 were achieved.  We anticipate we will be on target to achieve the 478 per month by year end.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has said there is strong demand and that the Department is confident the work will be commenced by the end of the year but it might not be paid.  Will the Minister of State give us the figures on what the target was, what will be commenced and what will be completed by the end of the year?  I want to flag the point of the additional &euro;150 million.  It comes back to the Exchequer and that is fair enough but there is further underspend.  My concern is that we will be here in two or three months' time and we will be taking from the warmer homes scheme or another area of real need.</p> <p>  Does the Minister of State have figures for the projects in the one-stop-shop that were targeted to be completed and those that will be started but not completed by the end of the year and the same for the community energy scheme?</p></speech>

I am interested to hear a little bit more about the cost of the investment in generating units for a short period.</p><p>It is a very different provision from the norm.  It is a sort of outside-of-the-market provision.  What penalty are we paying for going for short-term standby capacity compared with what we would have paid in normal auctions?</p><p> The second issue is what will happen at the end of the period.  As I understand it, it is a short period during which we contract to have these units operating as a standby.  At the end of the period what happens to the asset?  Does it have a second-hand value?  Is it likely to be sold to one of the existing providers?  It seems to me that this is the sort of technology we will need, at least in the long term, that is, the capacity to come in with relatively small loads and to fire up quickly.  It would therefore seem a shame if we were to pay a premium and then the capacity had to go again when we still would need it for the transition.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's view on that side of this.</p><p> As for the bidding arrangement now taking place, I recall the Minister stating that there is a time limit now in that this has to be urgently tendered for.  Do we know at this point whether many bidders are coming in or whether it will be a competitive auction?  Obviously, we would not want to find ourselves over a barrel in having to pay over the price.  I would like to get a little insight into the costings and so on.</p></speech>

I imagine, therefore, that the resale value of this kit would still be quite strong.</p></speech>

Do we own the asset and then sell it at its second-hand value back into the marketplace or are we just contracting it for the three or four years or whatever it is?</p></speech>

The CRU has stated that the procurement of the temporary generation could translate into around an overall increase of approximately &euro;40 in the average domestic bill for the forthcoming tariff year and a slightly lower cost increase of &euro;25 in the following years of operation.  These Estimates do not take into account the residual value of the units at their end of life, which would be subject to commercial negotiation.</p> <p>  In response to the question about the competitive nature of the bidding arrangements, again, I would have to ask my officials.  I am not aware of how competitive the bidding is.</p></speech>

I imagine that these generating plants have a fairly long design life so, presumably, the State has a fairly valuable asset.</p> <p>  Is there any difficulty for the State, having procured this under this exceptional arrangement, which, as I understand it, is outside of the market or quasi-outside of it for generation, in then trading it back into our market such that it has been sort of screened away to avoid interfering with the competitive players in the marketplace?  On re-entry into the market, the nightmare scenario would be that we would have a valuable piece of kit that we would no longer be able to deploy in the Irish system.  Is there any barrier to its deployment in the Irish system after this period is over?</p></speech>

This is about a transition towards our renewable outputs.  Certainly, there would be no difficulty selling the equipment once we are through that period.  It is about being able to have that additional capacity in the system and ensuring a security of supply for the State.</p></speech>

I would like to follow up on what my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, said about the &euro;200 electricity rebate and the &euro;20 million being moved from that.  We were contacted by the National Traveller Money Advice and Budgeting Service about this.  There may be only one meter on a halting site.  The families there get one &euro;200 rebate even though there might have been several families paying for the electricity.  I do not think it is beyond the abilities of the Government to contact the local authorities across the State to find out how many halting sites this applied to and how many families are using electricity from one meter and to give each family a &euro;200 rebate.  I would like to know why that has not been done.</p> <p>  I also wish to raise the fact that we are moving money that was ring-fenced for retrofitting.  I brought this up with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, last Thursday.  We were always told that the carbon tax revenue is ring-fenced, but in this instance it is not being ring-fenced but is going towards infrastructure for fossil fuels, I believe.  We have to address that.  It should not be addressed from the money that was ring-fenced for retrofitting.  Public trust is affected when we are told that money is being ring-fenced and then it is moved to a different item.  We are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.  The Minister of State said that these are not missed targets, but they are.  We might catch up, but if we are to catch up why is this revenue not being kept for retrofitting?  Could the Minister of State explain those two things to me?</p></speech>

That is a good suggestion.  I am not sure if the Department has reached out in that regard.  The Deputy is correct that a number of families in a group housing scheme or on a Traveller halting site could be working off a single meter.  As I said in my response to Deputy O'Rourke, we have to establish that issue with local authorities and try to figure out what is the best mechanism for the rebate for families on Traveller halting sites.</p></speech>

That comprises &euro;94 million remaining under subhead B4, &euro;57.91 million in capital carry-over from 2021 and &euro;100 million from the energy-efficiency programme.</p> <p>  Some &euro;5 billion of the expected &euro;9.5 billion in additional carbon tax receipts, along with the additional &euro;3 billion in Exchequer funding, will be invested in energy retrofits in the period 2021 to 2030.  That is a consistent and very significant increase in the annual allocation.</p><p>The consistent point the Government has made around the progressive nature of the carbon tax concerns its ability to deal with energy poverty.  It is incredibly important from our perspective that the carbon tax is ring-fenced for retrofitting homes and particularly to support low-income families to move away from excessive energy dependency and fuel poverty.</p></speech>

Just so we are clear, all this extra funding is about facilitating extra gas generators for the winter of 2023-24.  We were strongly opposed to this idea.  This is mainly because we think, even if we cannot do this immediately, we will be able to improve the situation in the near future when we get the answers.  Most of these funds will be going to feed gas-guzzling data centres.  I would like the Minister of State to address this allegation.  I have gone to a great deal of trouble to find the facts regarding the number of data centres due to come onto the national grid that have already been given agreements, where they are based and what level of power they will be using.  I think we will be proven to be right in the end that this endeavour is about facilitating extra data centre capacity on the national grid.  That is quite shocking.</p> <p>  My question to the Minister of State is similar to the last query.  On the Traveller community, I was glad to hear him make a commitment about halting sites regarding how they can receive grant funding as well.  It should be done quickly rather than leaving it until the autumn or winter.  People need that money now.  The funding for the community and residential energy efficiency schemes comes from direct funding and from carbon tax revenues.  As far as I remember regarding the &euro;8 billion it is planned to spend on the retrofitting scheme overall to 2030, some &euro;5 billion is to come from the carbon tax revenues.  It is to be ring-fenced, hypothecated or whatever word the Minister of State used.  Concerning what is being done now, some of the funds must be coming from the increase in the carbon tax.  If the Minister of State can show me that is not the case, I will be delighted.  I will ask the question directly.  Will any of the funding we are going to spend on gas generators in the context of this community and residential retrofitting budget be coming from the increase in carbon tax or, indeed, any of the carbon tax revenues?  If it is, then it is scandalous that this Government is willing to dip into a ring-fenced carbon tax fund for moneys that are going to be spent on gas-guzzling facilities that are high emitters of carbon dioxide.</p> <p>  According to the Department&rsquo;s own plans, the level of funding for community and residential retrofitting schemes is to ramp up dramatically in the next few years.  The targets in this regard, however, are heavily backloaded and promise great things in the years to come.  My concern, though, is the here and now.  What is the problem with spending the money on energy efficiency retrofitting schemes in the here and now?  It is a relatively small amount of money in the bigger scale of things.  We all have experience of people in our constituencies who cannot access this funding, for one reason or another.  Obstacles are put in their way, but these people require this funding.  The lower socio-economic groups really need access to funding to bring down their heating bills.  What is the problem in providing access to that funding now?  Is it a capacity issue?  Will the Minister of State commit to these people getting their funding as soon as it is possible to get the companies that are able or willing to do the work needed?  If we cannot spend the money this year, then what hope do we have in the coming years when we increase the capacity and funding to deliver on the targets for retrofitting?</p></speech>

Concerning the increase in the carbon tax, I stated, and it is the case, that &euro;202 million is to be allocated for retrofitting directly from the carbon tax in 2022.  In respect of supplementary funding, &euro;252.8 million is still available for retrofitting in 2022.  Certainly, then, funding is not the issue.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s last question, as I said there are supply chain and capacity issues in respect of delivery.  These issues are being addressed by the Government.  Hopefully, these supply chain issues will be resolved as we move into 2023.  The capacity to deliver in this regard centres on skills, apprenticeships and labour supply.  These are issues that the Minister has worked on with the Departments of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure we have sufficient people trained in the requisite fields to carry out these important works.  Undoubtedly, the ambition is significant, but it will take time to ramp up to the scale we require to get these extremely important retrofitting projects carried out urgently in the next several years.</p></speech>

The big debate about carbon tax when we were devising the climate action plan was on the question of it being used to bring about a reduction in emissions and to bring benefits to communities and households in respect of a just transition in this context.  Clearly, however, it is being used for the opposite, to ramp up-----</p></speech>

As I have given the figures, the carbon tax is a progressive tax.  It is taxation being used for the deep retrofitting of our housing stock, as well as to tackle fuel poverty issues.  Therefore, it is a critically important tax to aid in this progress around the retrofitting of homes.</p></speech>

If that is what he believes, and he clearly does, then why would funding be taken from the carbon tax to facilitate gas generators?  It would fly in the face of everything he stands for.

What we are exploring is a short-term measure to tide us over the next few years as we ramp up renewables.

I welcome the Minister of State.  To build on or to explore Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith&rsquo;s concerns further, I would certainly like to see what the projected growth in demand for electricity would be in the context of the data centres that are planned and then what it would be without them.  There is a narrative that we are building this extra capacity to facilitate these data centres.  Unless we see those two projections, one for the forecast demand without data centres and then one with them included, it will not be possible for us to know how things stand.  This is complex.  My understanding is that we are building this extra capacity, and it is fossil fuel generation, to keep the lights on when renewable energy sources are not available.  This is fossil fuel energy generation that will be used in situations when demand is high, especially in the winter, and wind and solar renewable sources of energy are not available.</p><p>It is capacity that will not be used very much.  It is for that rare situation.  One is probably talking up to a small number of hours in the year.  Somewhat paradoxically, building this fossil fuel generation, because it can be dispatched, enables us to build more renewables.  While it might be a bit counter-intuitive, this can actually lead to us having lower emissions than if we did not build it.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is standing in for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, but perhaps the officials could respond with those projections around growth in electricity demand with and without the data centres.  That would clear up much of the confusion.  The reality is that we are electrifying our economy and, data centres aside, there will be very significant growth because of transport and home heating becoming electrified, as well as very significant population growth.  These are the reasons that electricity demand is growing.  We need to really get into the weeds on this and show that this new capacity is not required to keep data centres going, because that is a very damaging argument and I do not believe it is true.  I do not know whether the Minister of State wishes to comment, but I would certainly welcome projections with and without data centres.</p></speech>

However, the primary need for the temporary generation units is not to address the overall demand, but to meet peak demand on days when there is low renewable output and interconnector availability to address it.  Having this reserve capacity allows EirGrid to have more confidence in scheduling network outages for new connections to the grid, such as new wind and solar farms from the recently-announced renewable electricity support scheme, RESS 2, list of projects, without jeopardising security of supply.  This is very much in keeping with Government policy of delivering up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030.  I do not have the figures for projections with or without data centres, but the important point is that the rationale around these temporary generation units is to meet that additional demand when there is low wind generation or interconnector availability.  That is the critical point here.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  I acknowledge that this is not his portfolio.  It is disappointing that the Minister or the Minister of State from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is not here, because there are many specific questions that will need to be answered.  I will go back and forth.  I have started to see "B2 equivalent" come into the terminology.  While in the programme for Government, it states 500,000 houses to B2, I am starting to see B2 equivalent.  Has that been a policy change?  When and why did it happen?  A change in policy will obviously impact the Department's ability to meet its 400,000 heat pump target, because heat pumps can only go into properties that are B2, not B2 equivalent.</p></speech>

Is that correct?  Am I reading that correctly?  The programme for Government, however, specifically stated 500,000 homes that were at B2 level.</p></speech>

The fact that we are now having this discussion on Estimates where the primary focus of it is to allocate this money and the fact that the Department is not coming in with the answers to these questions that have already been asked of the Minister in the previous debate is not acceptable.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State does not have these figures.  This the sort of stuff that we need to know if we are voting these measures through.  Does no one have any answer with regard to how much it will cost?</p></speech>

The 450 MW figure is just the start.  The CRU has identified it could potentially be 700 MW.  I can see someone shaking their head but it will be that, if the other measures are not in place as set out in its policy.  If they are not implemented, we could potentially be looking at 700 MW.</p></speech>

On the &euro;90 million savings, in response to a few questions, the Minister of State outlined the forecast of &euro;23 million in savings from the one-stop shop and the community energy schemes.  I also heard his comments about the target perhaps not being met this year due to supply chain issues but that it will be caught up with in 2023, which is understandable.</p> <p>  In terms of the retrofitting schemes, we heard about solar panels going into homes for those who have medical needs and, obviously, a higher energy requirement, as well as for those on lower incomes.  Does the Minister of State have any specifics or data from his officials -I realise that this is not his portfolio - about the number of houses in respect of which progress has been made with solar panels, even down to attic insulation and draught excluders, and anything to try to improve the energy efficiency of homes in the calendar year 2022?  Does the Minister of State have data on that?</p></speech>

I refer to the better energy warmer homes scheme specifically for the elderly.  I and every other member of this committee have constituents who have applied for these initiatives, which are very welcome, but there is a backlog in that specific scheme.  I am sure if that is the Minister of State's experience too.  Does the saving that we are talking about, the supply chain issues, relate to that scheme as well?  Is it all the schemes operated by the one stop shop in the SEAI or is it a particular scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022071200002#F00600"><p>It relates across all schemes given the challenges there have been not just with the supply chain but also labour.  Certainly, deep retrofits take longer and there is a longer lead-in time for them as well.  There are significant of challenges as we ramp up these schemes.  The SEAI has been available to Deputies to give detailed briefings on all the schemes, and I encourage them to avail of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022071200002#F00700"><p>It has.  Unfortunately, even after the briefings we still do not get a result.  After the announcement of the improved grants, which was very welcome, the public responded with gusto because they wanted to avail of them, only to find that there was no capacity in either the one-stop shop or the subsequent suppliers.  There are other issues curtailing the roll-out of those schemes so we hope to see an improvement on that in late 2022 and early 2023.</p> <p>  To return to the solar panels, this is something I raised with the Minister last week in the D&aacute;il,.  I hope the officials will refer it back to the Department.  There is an expectation on the part of people, particularly those who are hard-pressed in advance of winter, to avail of improvements to their homes.  We need to prioritise that.</p> <p>  I will turn to the electricity grant.  The Minister of State highlighted the grant in the context of subhead 11.  He indicated that the remaining unallocated funding by the suppliers must be returned by ESBN to the Department by the end of July.  Was the amount &euro;20 million?</p></speech>

People could not avoid availing of it.  It was there in their accounts.  I know that some could gift it back.  Where did that &euro;20 million come from?</p></speech>

Some people did not actually get the credit for one reason or another.  Perhaps they had moved house or they live in these multi-unit developments or dwellings.  What is the process for them?  Do the officials have any advice for how they avail of that credit?  Some of them have not received it yet.</p></speech>

We will refer back to the committee with a response on it.</p> <p>  To refer to the Acting Chair's, the SEAI is reviewing the end of June numbers currently and will revert to the Department shortly with specific detailed numbers for the rest of the year.

As always, the Minister is very welcome.  I also welcome the officials and thank them for the comprehensive briefing material that has been furnished to the committee.  We are also joined by H.E. Mr. Ruggero Corrias, ambassador of Italy to Ireland, who is observing from the Visitors Gallery, and H.E. Ms Anna Sochaska, ambassador of Poland to Ireland.  They are both very welcome.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that, in the usual manner, we will hear an opening statement from the Minister and this will be followed by a question-and-answer session with members of the committee.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses and members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and such direction must be complied with.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus - I do not think we have any witnesses attending remotely today - there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the room do.</p> <p>  Members are reminded that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  I do not see any members joining us online but it is open to members to take part in the meeting online and their questions, observations and submissions will, of course, be taken.  I have received a note from Deputy Clarke that she may be late arriving to the meeting because she is in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s engagement at the UN Security Council and the Foreign Affairs Council since my last update in November.  I also wish to update the committee on the development of the Government&rsquo;s response to the war in Ukraine since my most recent update, which I gave in March.</p> <p>  Ireland is now more than 18 months into its term on the UN Security Council.  It is fair to say that we have been consistent, principled, constructive and impactful where we can be.  We have been consistently active across the council agenda, particularly on Ukraine, Afghanistan, the Middle East peace process, Syria, Ethiopia and Iran.  Our work is ongoing, and what is at stake is sometimes of enormous importance.</p> <p>  As we meet here, we are into our seventh day of what have been 24-7 negotiations on the Syria humanitarian resolution.  This was about getting agreement to extend humanitarian access into north-west Syria, making sure that life-saving aid can reach more than 4 million people in need.  I have seen at first hand the outstanding work done by the UN and its humanitarian partners, most recently in June when I visited  Bab al-Hawa, a crossing point on the Turkey-Syria border, jointly with the Norwegian foreign minister.  Along with the vast majority of council members, and based on what we know is needed from the UN and NGOs working on the ground, we wanted a 12-month extension to this resolution.  Russia vetoed the resolution that Ireland and Norway presented to the council last Thursday, which would have allowed the extension.  We negotiated with unstinting determination over the weekend and up to today.  I am pleased to announce that we have secured a resolution to extend the mandate for the operation for six months, with a further extension of an additional six months, subject to another resolution by the council in January.  This is a crucial result that will ensure that millions of people in north-west Syria will continue to receive the aid they require.  In simple terms, this is about 1,000 trucks a month going into north-west Syria from Turkey.  It is supporting about 4 million people, most of whom are living in massive tented cities on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey.</p> <p>  In April, we organised an informal Security Council meeting, known as an Arria formula meeting, on conflict and hunger.  We organised another meeting in May on the protection of journalists and media professionals following the deaths of journalists in the occupied Palestinian territory, Ukraine and Afghanistan.  We convened another such meeting in June to mark the 20th anniversary of the entry into force of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, ICC.</p> <p>  The Security Council has discussed Ukraine 23 times to date this year.  In April, I was pleased to accept the invitation of my Ukrainian counterpart to visit again and see first-hand the impact of Russia&rsquo;s aggression and war.  I promised him that I would use Ireland&rsquo;s seat on the Security Council to bear witness to what I had seen, and did so a few days after my visit to Kyiv.  It is both unacceptable and deeply frustrating that, due to Russia&rsquo;s vetos, the Security Council has been unable to take meaningful action to end this war.  Ireland played a central role in support of a UN General Assembly resolution led by Liechtenstein which was adopted in April.  This means that the General Assembly will now automatically hold a debate whenever a veto is used at the Security Council, which will effectively oblige the country which has used the veto at the Security Council to account for its decision to the full UN membership.  This is an important new element for increased accountability and transparency in the work of the UN.</p> <p>  I know that Ukraine is still to the fore of members&rsquo; minds, and rightly so.  It is also to the fore in the minds of those in government.  EU foreign affairs ministers have discussed the invasion and our collective response at every meeting since the war began and will be doing so again next Monday.  I have heard directly from the Ukrainian foreign minister on how the EU could best support his country.  He has been very clear - more military support, more sanctions, proper accountability and full support for Ukraine&rsquo;s candidacy for the EU.  We have also met with the foreign ministers of the US, the UK, Canada, Norway and Iceland, the Secretary General of NATO, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the ICC prosecutor in order to ensure that our response is co-ordinated with our closest partners.</p> <p>  To date, the EU has adopted the most significant package of sanctions in its history.  We have seen unprecedented co-ordination with like-minded states.  Sanctions have been imposed on 1,158 individuals and 98 entities.  Sectoral sanctions are targeting imports and exports of selected goods, alongside other measures focused on the financial, energy, technology, defence and transport sectors.  Russian media outlets involved in spreading disinformation have been blacklisted.  Restrictions have also been introduced on economic relations between the EU and the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.  I expect the committee to bring forward proposals for a further seventh package of measures later this month.</p><p>This will likely focus on addressing anomalies and loopholes and tackling efforts to circumvent sanctions and contain some new measures.  I have repeatedly said that Ireland supports the toughest possible sanctions.  We are ready to support a complete ban on the import of Russian gas, should we get agreement on that.</p><p> The European Peace Facility, which was adopted just last year, is being used to support the capabilities and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces in defending their territorial integrity and the sovereignty of their country and in protecting Ukrainian citizens against the ongoing Russian military aggression.  Four tranches of military assistance have been provided to date, totalling &euro;2 billion.  In line with the programme for Government, Ireland's full share of funding - approximately &euro;44 million to date - is being directed exclusively towards non-lethal support.  Consideration is currently being given at EU level to a possible fifth tranche of military support.  I suspect that it will happen sooner rather than later.  This consideration follows the agreement by leaders at last month's European Council to provide further military assistance to Ukraine.</p><p> Looking beyond the end of the war, I was encouraged by the European Council's decision to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine.  Ireland advocated strongly for that outcome and will stand alongside Ukraine every step of the way to membership regardless of how long that takes.</p><p> We are working closely to support the security and resilience of other European states that have become even more vulnerable in recent months.  The European Council recently granted candidacy for EU membership to Moldova.  The Foreign Affairs Council had a useful engagement with the Moldovan foreign minister and Deputy Prime Minister in March.  Moldova is a country with limited resources and its commitment to supporting Ukrainians has been extraordinary.  I plan to travel there next week to see how Ireland can further deepen our support.  I will also be travelling to Romania on that visit.</p><p> We have intensified our dialogue with the western Balkans.  In May, the Foreign Affairs Council met all six western Balkan foreign ministers.  We are hopeful of seeing progress soon on the accession negotiations for North Macedonia and Albania.  In truth, they are long overdue.  The UN Security Council mandate for the crucial work of EUFOR Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina is due for renewal in November, with Ireland as a likely penholder.  For obvious reasons, securing this renewal is a key UN Security Council priority for Ireland.</p><p> The war has resulted in fundamental changes to Europe's security architecture and environment.  Even before then, Europe had been facing evolving security challenges, notably cyber and hybrid threats.  The strategic compass, adopted by foreign ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in March, outlines the way forward for the EU in the field of security and defence over the next decade and will ensure that the EU remains relevant, strong and coherent in its policies and action.</p><p> Ireland needs to improve our own resilience, including through a significant increase in our security and defence spending, which I am glad to say the Government agreed to this morning.  For this reason, I brought an ambitious set of proposals to the Cabinet today in response to the recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  These proposals also reflect the increasingly complex and evolving threat landscape that we face.</p><p> As a highly globalised state, it is clear that Ireland can no longer rely on geographic isolation for our defence and we are at risk from cyber and hybrid attacks, even where we are not the direct target.  With this in mind, and subject to Government approval, Ireland is expected to join the Hybrid Centre of Excellence in Helsinki later this year to ensure that we are learning from other states that are facing similar challenges.  Participation in the centre, together with other EU and transatlantic partners, will provide us with additional expertise and practical capabilities to counter hybrid threats, including through information sharing and training.</p><p> Regarding the Middle East, while we address a war that should never have happened, we also know that we cannot afford to reduce our engagement in other key issues.  The Middle East peace process continues to be a priority for Ireland.  At the Foreign Affairs Council meetings in April and May, we addressed the delayed payment of 2021 EU funding to the Palestinian Authority.  I argued strongly for the urgent release of the funding without the introduction of conditionality, which had been proposed by the European Commission.  This position was supported by a large number of my EU counterparts.  I was pleased that agreement was finally reached in June to release the badly needed funding without conditionality or further delay.  Ireland continues to engage actively in monthly meetings of the UN Security Council on the Palestinian question, most recently on 27 June.  We also organised an informal meeting of the Security Council on the protection of journalists in May following the unlawful killing of Shireen Abu Akleh and the entirely unacceptable policing of her funeral.</p><p> As committee members may recall from earlier meetings, Ireland serves as facilitator of Resolution 2231 on the Security Council, which endorses the Iran nuclear deal, called the joint comprehensive plan of action, JCPOA.  In this role, we presented our third report to the Security Council in June.  Ireland has engaged extensively with all key parties to urge a restoration of the JCPOA.  I visited Tehran for the second time in February and urged the Iranian President and foreign minister to return to compliance.  We hope to see progress coming out of the recent talks in Qatar, facilitated by the EU.</p><p> Turning to Africa, I remain deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia.  I welcome recent indications that both sides are willing to engage in talks aimed at finding a peaceful solution.  This opportunity must be seized.  It was at my request that the Foreign Affairs Council last month discussed how the EU could best influence the situation.  While we concluded that recent positive progress was not sufficient for full normalisation of relations, we considered how we could incentivise further progress.</p><p> The situation in Mali also continues to be of serious concern.  Engagement of the Malian armed forces with Russian mercenaries has been discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council four times so far this year.  In April, we decided to suspend the operational training that the EU training mission in Mali provided to Mali's armed forces due to the failure of the transition authorities to provide assurances about their co-operation with Russian mercenaries, or the Wagner group as some committee members will know them.  Options for EU action in respect of the situation in Mali and the Sahel continue to be discussed.</p><p> On 17 June and in a process chaired by Ireland in Geneva, agreement was reached on a political declaration on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  For too long, we have watched the destruction and suffering caused by the use of explosive weapons in urban areas.  The misery inflicted in Ukraine is a case in point, but we have also seen this in Syria, Libya, Ethiopia and many other conflict zones around the world.  This declaration represents a significant milestone.  It recognises the humanitarian consequences of the use of these weapons and, most importantly, it includes a number of ambitious actions that states will take to address those impacts.  The implementation of this declaration will change how militaries operate in populated areas, including when the use of explosive weapons is expected to cause civilian harm.  The declaration will be formally adopted at an international conference that we will host in Dublin in the autumn.</p><p> Staying with arms control, the Tenth Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference will be held in New York in August.  As the committee will be aware, nuclear disarmament is a foreign policy priority for Ireland stretching back many decades.  At the review conference, Ireland will advocate for the implementation of concrete, transparent, mutually reinforcing, verifiable and irreversible nuclear disarmament measures.  This would be comprehensive if achieved.  We will urge the fulfilment of obligations and commitments within the framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</p><p> I might conclude by noting our Presidency of the Council of Europe, a multilateral body in which members of this committee are particularly engaged.  On 20 May, we assumed the Presidency of the Council's Committee of Ministers.  We have taken some significant steps already.  Just last week, we brokered Ukraine's accession to the Council of Europe Development Bank, enabling the bank to play a significant role in rebuilding Ukraine's social infrastructure.  We are also advancing reforms that I hope will ensure the organisation's relevance in the years to come.  Our former President, Ms Mary Robinson, has been appointed chair of a new high-level group to reflect on the future of the Council of Europe while Senator Fiona O'Loughlin is chairing the council's Parliamentary Assembly committee on the same question.</p><p> Alongside our successor in the Presidency, Iceland, we are pushing to convene what would be just the fourth summit of heads of state and government in the Council's 73 years of existence.  We have several other important initiatives planned for the autumn, including a conference that will see 46 justice ministers convene in Dublin in September to counter sexual and gender-based violence across the Continent.  I could pick many other issues around the world to talk about as well.  I thank the committee members for the opportunity to outline some of the highlights of our work in recent months.  I am happy to take questions on whatever people would like to ask about.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Brady.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022071200002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the Minister.  First and foremost, I commend the team working in the context of the UN Security Council under the stewardship of Ambassador Byrne.  In May, the Chair, Senator Wilson and I had the honour of going over to meet some members of that team and of sitting in on some of the debates in the Security Council.  One of the major issues debated was food security.  I commend the work, expertise and professionalism of the team there.  They are in the capable hands of Ambassador Byrne.</p><p>I will touch on several areas.  Like the Minister, I could ask 50 or 60 questions on issues across the board, but I will try to be as brief as I can.  Certainly, I will not be asking that many questions.  Starting with the situation in Ukraine, the brutal and illegal invasion of that country is still being carried on and perpetrated by Russia.  Unfortunately, we can see the tragic fallout from that daily.  We see the war crimes committed by Russia.  I welcome the commencement of investigations in this regard.  I ask the Minister to give us a brief update on our work in this regard and on what pressure has been brought to bear to ensure that Russia is held to account for the illegal actions, war crimes and crimes against humanity it has perpetrated.  Will the Minister give us an update concerning the investigations in that context?</p><p>Turning to the sanctions, I fully support the strongest possible sanctions against Russia.  We must, though, ask and continue to ask the question as to how effective the sanctions are.  What process or review is under way in respect of the sanctions to ensure they are having the right impact?  They should be hurting the Russian regime and Putin's regime.  The Minister might just outline what review there has been, or is planned to take place, regarding the effectiveness of the sanctions.  We must support the sanctions, but efforts must be made to ensure public support is sustained.  It has been said here and across Europe that the sanctions are having a bigger impact on ordinary citizens than where their impact is most needed, which is on Putin's regime.</p><p>The other issue I wish to touch on is Moldova.  The Minister mentioned that he is due to travel to that country and to Romania.  I welcome this.  Recently, I was in Moldova and Romania and I saw the exceptional work and support both countries have provided in opening their countries, alongside many others, such as Poland, to Ukrainians fleeing the war.  Moldova, however, the poorest country in Europe, has experienced many challenges in this regard.  The Minister will be well aware of the pressures that country's systems have come under, especially its health service, due to the number of Ukrainians who have been welcomed into Moldova.  </p><p>Regarding the announcement that 500 vulnerable Ukrainians in Moldova were going to be taken in by this State, and we have had this conversation here several times, the most recent information I got via a parliamentary question was that only 19 of those vulnerable refugees have landed in Ireland.  This announcement was made way back in March or April 2022, so it is concerning in the context of the pressures impacting Moldova that only 19 of these 500 refugees have landed here.  I ask the Minister to update the committee on this matter.</p><p>The other major issue stemming from the war in Ukraine, and also as a result of global warming, is food security.  We are aware of the figure issued concerning 22 million tonnes of grain having, essentially, been locked into Ukraine because of the inability to ship that food to places like Africa and parts of the Middle East where there is a significant danger of deepening humanitarian crises.  What action is being taken in this regard?  It was interesting to sit in on the debate on this issue in the UN Security Council.  Everyone knows this is a major challenge.  The fear, and now the reality, is that famine is sweeping across many countries around the globe, but particularly those in the Horn of Africa.  Major challenges are faced in this regard, even in respect of the UN World Food Programme, WFP, and the cuts implemented in that regard prior to the invasion of Ukraine.  Many countries were already scaling back their commitments to the WFP.  There are now major fears that the focus of many countries will shift from supporting the WFP to supporting the war effort in Ukraine and that this development will deepen the crisis in many of the countries on the brink of humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Turning to the situation in Syria, it was shocking to hear that Russia used its Security Council veto to block humanitarian aid going into northern Syria.  I welcome that a solution has been found and that a resolution has now been adopted to extend the current aid programme by six months.  While Russia vetoed the programme's extension for 12 months, it put forward a proposal to extend it by six months instead.  Ultimately, a similar resolution was adopted.  What was the difference between the proposal put forward by Russia to extend this programme by six months and the resolution that was adopted for an extension of six months?  </p><p>Also on the subject of Syria, I raise the issue of there being major worry regarding Turkey's threats to carry out further invasions of north-eastern Syria.  This is deeply concerning for the many Kurds living in the area because of the atrocities Turkey perpetrated against those people in the past.  There has been much speculation that some kind of deal has been struck between Turkey and the US in the context of applications by Sweden and Finland to join NATO.  Essentially, the suggestion is that a green light has been given to Turkey to go ahead with its military operations in north-eastern Syria.  Does the Minister have a view and a position regarding this issue?  Has this matter been discussed at the level of the Security Council?  I ask this not only because such an action would be greatly<b></b>detrimental to the Kurdish population in the area, but because I think it will also lead to a further deepening of the humanitarian crisis in Syria.</p><p>On the European strategic compass, which the Minister mentioned, there are obvious concerns for Ireland's military neutrality in this regard.  Does the Minister see implications in the context of this initiative for our military neutrality?  Turning to the Commission on the Defence Forces, I note that a proposal was brought to the Cabinet and signed off on it.  We will need to have a fuller debate in this committee on that report.  I do not intend to delve into it now because we could be here for some time.  Such a discussion would take up not just this meeting but, I am sure, several meetings.</p><p>However, the Minister might give just a brief overview of that.  I have concerns about elements of it.  We have to implement level of ambition 2.  I am not sure what was contained in the report in respect of the issue of retention or whether the proposals that have been agreed will be sufficient to address the serious retention issues in respect of allowances etc.</p><p> The last thing I will touch on is the Middle East and Palestine.  I express my serious concern about the lack of progress at Security Council level on holding Israel to account for its barbaric, illegal actions.  We see that with the continuing illegal colonial settlement expansion programme.  I note that President Biden is due to travel this week to Israel and, it is to be hoped, to the occupied territories as well.  There is now overwhelming evidence from all the reputable human rights organisations that Israel perpetrates a policy of apartheid.  We see it with the Amnesty report, with the report from Professor Michael Lynk and with many other human rights organisations all coming now to the same conclusion, that is, that Israel operates a policy of apartheid.  I note the Irish Government's position.  It has stated time and time again that the use of the word "apartheid" is not useful.  That does not sit well with the Palestinian people, who are living through the policy of apartheid.  What is the Minister's position on the matter, the Government's position on it and, more importantly, the position of the Security Council on it?  Has there been any debate or discussion on this multitude of reports, including that of the UN special rapporteur, Professor Lynk?  What is the likelihood of the Security Council having a debate and coming to a conclusion or an agreed position on the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands, the occupied territories and the policy of apartheid?  Does the Minister believe that a position can be achieved at Security Council level?</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister and both Departments on the work they are doing.  The presentation was short but the Minister packed a lot into it, not only on the amount of work but also on its quality and the impact Ireland is having in its role on the Security Council.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials and our ambassadors on that work.  It is amazing that a small country like ours is having such an impact in many areas.  We continue to do so, and I wish those involved well into the future.</p> <p>  I wish to ask the Minister a few questions.  He mentioned North Macedonia and Albania and the accession negotiations.  He might tell us how he sees that progressing and how soon we might see progress on that and what kind of progress it might be.  That is quite important.  I agree with the Minister on that.</p> <p>  I wish to focus a little on the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces that the Minister outlined.  Some very interesting points were raised, and I know we will probably come back to the matter again, but how soon does the Minister see some of those actions occurring?  In the next six to 12 months, for instance, what does he see occurring in respect of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the decisions taken today by the Government?  What exactly does he see happening in that regard?  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Brady, that it is imperative we work on the retention and recruitment issues because we need good people in the Defence Forces.  That is hugely important.</p> <p>  There are a few interesting things in the presentation like the capability branch - the Minister might spell out what that is about - and the office of reserve affairs, which is also new, from what I can see.  The Minister talked about moving up to level of ambition 2 quite soon.  He might explain what that is about.  The spending, which, of course, is crucial, is to go to &euro;8 billion by 2028.  That is an enormous amount of money, but without it I do not think we will see progress.  Again, the Minister might outline his ambition in that regard for the next 12 months.  He is talking about 2,000 more personnel, bringing the number up to over 11,500, I think.  The Minister might give us an idea of his plans for the Reserve and the numbers in that regard.  We will come back to that at a later stage.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Brady, mentioned food security.  I wish to bring up the issue of energy security.  I am particularly interested in it.  With the closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline into Germany yesterday, the Minister might say what impact that might have on Europe, including Ireland, and what contingencies there are in the event of gas becoming in short supply.  What contingencies do we in Ireland have in that regard?  If, for instance, the market pipeline comes under pressure for whatever reason, do we have contingencies in place to replace that supply?  I have been asking that the Kinsale Head pipeline not be decommissioned.  It is about to be decommissioned and it should not be.  I am not talking about extra gas; I am talking about replacing any gas coming from Scotland that we might lose.  I am fully in support of the green agenda in respect of green hydrogen, solar, wind and so forth.  It is hugely important we drive that on as quickly as possible.  This has to do with our security as a nation.  If we do not have power and if we do not have energy, we are in serious trouble.  I would like to hear the Minister address that.</p></speech>

So far there have been questions from Members on defence issues.  Particularly in light of this morning's Government decision on a foreign affairs issue, I ask the Minister to keep the issues separate in his responses.  I am conscious of the fact that a wide range of issues have already been put to the Minister.  I call Deputy Gannon, to be followed by Deputy Clarke.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022071200002#E01000"><p>I thank Deputy Gannon.  His proposal seems helpful.  Otherwise, I could pick and choose my answers, which would not do at all, obviously.</p> <p>  I thank Deputies Brady and Stanton for their recognition of the quality of our UN team in New York.  Trust me: they are phenomenal.  As to what they have done over the past four days, I was there on Friday and we thought we would get an agreement on the wording of the resolution across the line that day.  That did not happen, and they have been working literally night and day through the weekend and into today.  At 9.30 this morning, New York time, we managed to get agreement on a wording.  I think it was the best possible wording.  It is not ideal.  We would have liked to have got certainty on a 12-month extension.  What we got, effectively, was certainty on a six-month extension and then a possible further six months, but there will need to be an updated resolution in six months' time to deliver the second half of that.  The voting patterns were quite clear.  The P3 - in other words, the UK, France and the US - abstained, and Russia and China and the other ten supported the proposal, seeing the sense in what we were trying to do.  It just reflects the division and tension between the P5 members on these issues.  Our job was to get the job done and to keep the humanitarian assistance flowing.  That is the job of the penholder.  We forced a vote because we felt it necessary to do so.  Russia vetoed that at the end of last week.  We have managed to get as good an outcome as was possible, which I think will be an enormous relief to the people working on the ground filling up trucks with food, medicines, clothes and all sorts of other things.</p><p> In terms of Ukraine, we are big supporters of the ICC.  In fact, I will be in The Hague on Thursday at an accountability summit, conference or meeting.  As the committee knows, when I was Kyiv I announced a financial support package of &euro;3 million for the ICC, not just for Ukraine but for its activities more generally to make sure the prosecutor has the resources he needs to gather evidence and put case files together, which is really important.  </p><p> In terms of what is being done to ensure Russia is being held accountable for its actions, the strong international condemnation of Russian aggression has triggered the operation of many different mechanisms to address accountability issues arising in Ukraine.  These include technical support to assist Ukrainian authorities in collecting, storing and preserving evidence in line with international standards, the investigation of the ICC that I referred to and the work of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, in terms of the Moscow mechanism.  Eurojust is co-ordinating investigations and prosecution efforts between Ukraine and member states, including the joint investigation team set up by Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, together with the ICC and recent additional members Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia.  The US, EU and UK recently established an atrocity crimes advisory group to support the co-ordination of their respective accountability efforts on the ground.  There is also a wide range of initiatives by NGOs.  There is a lot going on in this space.  We are supporting a lot of it, but our primary financial support has been for the ICC.  I met the prosecutor in Ukraine and the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, before travelling to Kyiv to make sure we are giving the right support where it is needed.</p><p> It is fair to ask what we are doing to verify that sanctions are working.  In truth, it is not is not an exact science.  If we are trying to build pressure over a short period of time, we do not have the capacity to be able to review over months the impact of sanctions.  We have had six rounds of sanctions agreed.  The Commission is working on a seventh.  The seventh round will, in my view, not involve the banning of gas.  Rather, it will focus on a whole range of other things.  It will also focus on ensuring the existing sanctions are working and loopholes are closed.</p><p> From our perspective, this is about the politics and reality of ensuring that the continuation of this war has a growing cost so that there is a disincentive to its continuation.  If the EU did not apply sanctions and did not increase the weight of those sanctions with each round, that would send a very clear signal to Russia that it has a green light to continue what it is doing, and it does not.  This is illegal, brutal and aggressive.  It involves multiple war crimes on a weekly basis and has to have a consequence and cost.</p><p> Ireland has traditionally been very cautious around sanctions generally, in terms of ensuring there are safeguards around protecting the supplies of humanitarian assistance, people's human rights and so on.  In this instance, we feel the strength of EU sanctions and their increasing cost to the Kremlin has to be a very strong statement.  The reality is that some of the sanctions also introduce hardship within the European Union.  These are not cost-free for us, but the continuation of the war also has an extraordinary cost.  We are seeing the human consequences with over 40,000 Ukrainians coming to live with us for their own safety over the past number of months.  The most impactful weapon the EU has is its economic muscle and creating a cost for Russia in continuing the war, as well as the support we give to Ukraine.</p><p> Maintaining public support is a fair question.  Maintaining public support for all that we are doing for Ukraine is something we need to be careful of in terms of supporting Ukrainians here in the context of pressure on housing and so on, and the humanitarian, military and, of course, political support we are providing.  There is a consequence on Ireland as well as Ukraine to the war continuing, although we should not compare the two.  Obviously, there is a cost of living and inflation impact as a result of Russia's decisions.</p><p> Moldova is a country that needs our help and that is why I am going there.  We made a commitment to support Moldova and to take 500 Ukrainian displaced people from it into Ireland in order to try to ease the burden.  That has proven to be a little bit more complicated than one might think.  Trust me, there is no lack of will here.  Ireland is not applying any quotas or visas.  Anybody who travels from Ukraine to Moldova into Romania and then onto Ireland is free to come here and we will look after them as best we can.  We will also try to work with the Moldovan authorities to ensure we can share some of the burden they are facing at the moment.  </p><p> There are practical issues around language and willingness to travel.  We must not forget that most Ukrainians want to stay close to Ukraine.  That is why there are about 4 million Ukrainians in Poland right now.  Poland has been extraordinary in regard to this effort.  It is a solidarity and generosity that, to be perfectly honest, I have never before seen in Europe.  I was not around during the world wars, for obvious reasons, but Poland's status in the European Union in the context of the leadership and solidarity it has shown to Ukraine has been very significant, and should be recognised as such.  I have had a number of meetings with the Moldovan Foreign Minister.  I understand I will meet the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister and we will do all we can to try to give practical assistance to Moldova.</p><p> In terms of food security, when I was in New York last week I had a good discussion on UN efforts, along with Turkey, Russia and Ukraine, to try to find a way of getting grain out in larger quantities.  There are about 20 million tonnes of grain in storage in silos and they are about to start harvesting in Ukraine.  All of its storage facilities are full.  We have to try to get grain out of Ukraine.  The EU has opened up humanitarian supply lines through EU countries via rail, and that has gotten about 5 million tonnes of grain out, but a lot more can only be moved in the volumes that are needed via ships out of ports in southern Ukraine in the Black Sea.  </p><p> Therefore, there is a possibility that we could see agreement in the not too distant future on a mechanism that can guarantee Ukraine's security in terms of Russian aggression coming from the Black Sea, in particular towards the city of Odesa, and also get ships safely out past waters that are mined into an agreed area where inspections can take place and ships can move into other ports that are in need and are waiting for these supplies.  There has been a huge amount of work done over the past number of weeks to try to make progress on that issue.  I do not honestly know whether it will come off, but there are increasing expectations and hopes that it may be possible to do something.  We will have to wait and see.  It needs to happen quickly, otherwise we will find new pressures post harvest in Ukraine.</p><p> I am getting technical notes on what I am saying, so I do not want to repeat myself.  On the pressure on the World Food Programme, I met the head of the programme in Italy a few months ago.  It would normally source about 60% of its wheat from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia combined.</p><p>Obviously, that is now completely disrupted.  They are sourcing from elsewhere but that is taking food supply that would otherwise find its way into the system.  It is a zero sum game.  If you take 22 million tonnes of grain out of the system along with vegetable oils, maize and other important foods, they are very difficult to replace at short notice.  As we have seen, that drives the prices of these food products up dramatically and in some cases makes it almost impossible to source them at all at any price.  It is having a really big impact on some countries.  I am thinking of Lebanon and Egypt and a number of countries across the horn of Africa.  Because of increased costs the World Food Programme is under pressure with the funds available to it.  David Beasley, the head of the World Food Programme, has spoken of having to take food from the hungry to give to the starving in places like Yemen.  These are the consequences of war.</p></speech>

We have multi-annual funding programmes with the World Food Programme.  Interestingly, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine put in place a three-year rolling multi-annual funding programme with the World Food Programme which I think is a really good example of how most countries should do it.  Food security, nutrition and the sustainability of food production is one of Ireland's calling cards in terms of international policy and humanitarian assistance and will continue to be.  A new agreement was signed last December between Ireland and the World Food Programme which will provide at least &euro;75 million over the next three years.  We are doing our bit here and it is important that we state that at a time when there are a lot of other pressures on the Irish Exchequer and so we should, as a country of our resources.</p> <p>  On Turkish intent in north-west Syria, I am concerned that President Erdogan plans to launch further military action in Syria in order to create what Turkey describes as a safe zone.  I expressed my concern about President Erdogan's remarks when I met with the Foreign Minister, Mevl&uuml;t &Ccedil;avuolu in June.  I called on all parties to exercise restraint in order to avoid any further exacerbation of this already fragile situation and to co-operate in the effort to find a political solution under UN auspices, which alone can bring lasting peace to Syria.  We do not want to see the Turkish military crossing the border and effectively cleaning out a buffer strip of what it regards as terrorist groups.  It will say that it is about Turkish security but it is not justifiable to cross another country's border to do what it proposes.  I had quite a long discussion on that issue and our position is well known.</p> <p>  I want to emphasise something on the strategic compass.  We have discussions around threats to neutrality and so on all the time - I get that and I am happy to have these conversations because it is really important that we give people reassurance - but we were very involved in the finalising of the text of the strategic compass and so was Austria.  These are countries that are not in NATO; Finland and Sweden were not then applying for NATO membership either.  The whole point of the strategic compass is that it gives a direction on the EU common defence and security policy over the next ten years that allows countries that have a very different perspective on military alliances to still be able to work together on a voluntary basis.  That is why Ireland is comfortable about getting involved in more Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO projects, for example, because we can opt in or out when we want to just like when there are projects and training programmes in the future.  However, we should make no mistake, our security in the future will be dependent on collective co-operation, training, partnership and interoperability with lots of other EU countries, learning best practice, making sure we have the best equipment and making sure that we can respond to cyber threats and hybrid threats.  Other countries in the EU are our partners and friends.  We do not have a formal defence pact with them but we are certainly open to increasing the level of partnership and knowledge-sharing between countries.  That is the whole benefit of being in a union.  We should not to isolate ourselves because of perceptions around neutrality.  That is why it is important for us to be involved in the cyber security centre and the hybrid warfare centre of excellence.  That is why it is important that we get involved in what are called battle groups, which we did before.  That is effectively groups of countries agreeing to train together to ensure that they are interoperable should they ever choose to go abroad together on peace keeping or peace intervention, a humanitarian mission or whatever.  The strategic compass is flexible in how it is written to accommodate Ireland, Austria, Malta, Cyprus and at the time Sweden and Finland.  I want to give people reassurance on that.  </p> <p>  I will address the commission because people will have questions on it.  I look forward to having a much longer and more in depth discussion on it and will be very happy to do that.  We have not even launched it yet.  We agreed it at Cabinet this morning.  We will launch it tomorrow morning at 9.30 a.m. with the party leaders.  On a personal level, in a political career, I have been privileged to be in Government for quite a period of time.  You really only get about half a dozen opportunities to do something of real significance as a Minister.  This, for me, is one of them.  It is about as fundamental a decision for the Defence Forces as I think people will ever see an Irish Government make.  We are committing to a significant and steady increase in funding for the next six years.  We are effectively saying that the benchmark now is what the commission has asked for, namely that we have to get to &euro;1.5 billion of a defence budget.  However, we have agreement from the Government that it will be done on the basis of January 2022 pricing, that is, that inflation will be factored in year after year.  If, for example, military equipment inflation over the next six years was an average of 4%, which is a conservative estimate given the international spending we will see on security and defence, that would effectively mean that by 2028 we would need to be spending &euro;1.9 billion on defence every year.  That means the decision that we made today and making no increase in defence spending between now and 2028 is about &euro;2.7 billion extra expenditure over the next six years.  From an Irish perspective, given that we only spend about &euro;1.1 billion a year now, to increase the spend by &euro;800 million by 2028 into the base annually is a very significant statement by the Government in its commitment to expanding, growing and developing the Defence Forces in the way that it needs to happen.  As to what that means numerically, the official position is that we are moving from 9,500 to 11,500 in the Permanent Defence Forces.  However, given that we have fewer than 8,500 personnel in the Defence Forces now, we need to find a way of adding 3,000 people into the Permanent Defence Forces over the next six years and another 3,000 into the Reserve which needs that to get to the establishment that has been benchmarked.</p><p>This means that over six years, there will be a net increase of 6,000 people within our Defence Forces, including both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve.  Anybody who tells me we are not being ambitious enough in this Government with our decisions needs to have a look at the detail.  I do not believe it is possible to deliver something more ambitious than this in terms of numbers, expenditure and the equipment that is being itemised and recommended by the commission to get to level of ambition 2.  Anybody who says we should be going to level of ambition 3 needs to read the commission's report.  It says that even if we wanted to do that, it probably would take until about 2040 to get there because it is such a dramatic increase in numbers and equipment across all fields.  Even if we wanted to do it, we would have to get to level of ambition 2 first in terms of putting a basis and platform in place upon which we can then build.  That is what we have committed to doing by 2028.<br/><br/>We have done other things, including making decisions around how we use and increase allowances for people, for which different parties and members of the committee have been calling.  That is a positive news story as well.  Along with the funding, the structural change this Government decision demands and requests is of a similar scale of ambition.  We are talking about completely restructuring the Army, and it is the Army itself that will do it.  There will be a completely new leadership structure within the Defence Forces, with a new chief of defence and a new structure for Defence Forces headquarters.  Immediately, we are going to set about the recruitment of a head of transformation for the Defence Forces and a head of human resources, both of whom will be civilians.  We will also appoint a gender adviser and a head of digital services.  There will be new people, new expertise and new thinking.  We will also focus on driving a change of culture within the Defence Forces.  We all recognise why that is needed.<br/><br/>This is a very big deal and it will take years to deliver.  The Government has set a clear course and a level of ambition that will allow the Chief of Staff and his team and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and her team to set about putting the building blocks in place over the next six to ten years to ensure we have strong, growing and sustainable Defence Forces into the future.  Most importantly, it will send a signal to young people, both men and women, that the Defence Forces offer an exciting career option that is rewarding financially as well as in many other ways.  I am sorry if this is coming across as a sales pitch.  It is a decision for which I have spent a long time preparing and I think it is a really good one from a Defence Forces perspective.<br/><br/>Deputy Brady knows, because we have spoken about it often and will speak about it often in the future, that the Middle East situation is something in which I want to invest a lot of political time between now and the end of the year.  If he asking me whether I think the Security Council will recognise what is happening in the occupied territories in the way he described, I would say there is no chance of that happening.  The Security Council continues to be deeply divided on this issue.  We have a debate there every month and it is a sort of Groundhog Day situation.  The same arguments are made and there is often quite a bit of acrimony, difference of opinion and so on.  I have committed to working with others, both like-minded states in the Arab world and within the EU, to try to bring forward some new thinking on the Middle East peace process.  That is what we will be trying to do in the autumn.<br/><br/>I have spoken about this issue with a number of colleagues in other governments.  I hope we will visit the region again in the early autumn to try to progress some of that thinking.  I met Professor Michael Lynk when he visited Ireland and I read his report.  The one thing I know for sure is that the <i>status quo</i>is a recipe for more violence, tragedy and discrimination.  We will see another cycle of violence if we do not find a way of changing the political direction in regard to the Middle East peace process and the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians.<br/><br/>Deputy Stanton asked about the situation with North Macedonia and Albania, which is increasingly frustrating for the EU.  There really is an appetite now to move ahead and accelerate the accession process.  Some of the countries in the western Balkans have been waiting nearly 20 years to make any progress.  If there are progressive forces in a country fighting and winning elections on the basis of making the necessary changes to reach the thresholds for moving forward the accession agenda and then there is not a positive response from the EU, not only does that delay accession but it potentially undermines the possibility of accession, it undermines the progressive political forces that are trying to achieve it and it creates a vacuum others will fill.  I do not want to get too prescriptive in this regard but that is what will happen.  As the committee knows, there are issues in regard to North Macedonia and Albania that are preventing progress on accession.  France, in particular, has been very active in trying to put a proposal in place that could move the issue forward.  We will support any efforts that can find a way forward that treats North Macedonia with respect as a potential EU member state, and likewise for Albania.  Those efforts continue.<br/><br/>On energy security, last week, for the first time, the EU imported more energy product, including oil and gas, from the US than it did from Russia.  That says a lot.  We are now seeing a number of countries, Germany probably being the leading one, looking at quite dramatic contingency plans should Russia decide to switch off the gas or should the EU decide to stop the gas flowing in the autumn.  There is little doubt that the war in Ukraine has changed our world view in a way that is not going to be reversed.  In response to Russia's aggressive behaviour, countries have shown great unity.  Further unity is now required to place energy security, efficiency, savings, diversification and acceleration towards renewables at the heart of a climate and energy policy.  Heads of state and government have already agreed to accelerate Europe's decarbonisation and phase out our dependence on Russian oil, gas and coal imports as soon as possible.  The EU's green deal and the associated Fit for 55 package represent key tools in this effort.  The global energy price crisis has highlighted the danger of an over-reliance on fossil fuel imports and has led many countries to attempt to move away from their dependence on Russian imports.<br/><br/>Some people might say this is all well and good but the question then is what happens next year.  The truth is that we are not going to have the offshore wind projects built for next year that we certainly will have by 2030.  We are not going to have the solar capacity in place or the liquefied natural gas, LNG, plants operating.  This means we must put contingency arrangements in place.  Some people seem to be complacent on the basis of the false premise that we do not source much gas at all from Russia.  Our gas comes from our own sources off the west coast and also through two gas pipelines from Scotland, with that gas coming from the North Sea, predominantly from Norway, into the UK and on to Ireland.  If Russian gas were to be cut off from the EU, the pressure on Norway to provide gas into other EU countries would undoubtedly be very strong.  We cannot simply say that Ireland does not import any Russian gas and that means we are fine.  That is a complete oversimplification of the reality of where gas prices may be in the autumn and, indeed, the knock-on price consequences for electricity and other carbon-based fuels, which will be significant.</p><p> There is a great deal of work going on within the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to look at contingency plans for the autumn.  We have already committed to spending &euro;500 million on buying new turbine facilities that can, if necessary be used at short notice.  We will continue to look at contingency plans in that regard.</p><p> I take the point regarding the gas pipeline infrastructure off Kinsale.  There have been proposals in the past to use that natural storage facility as a gas storage facility.  There are also other proposals in respect of floating LNG terminals and so on.  We need to be open to all of those ideas.  Ultimately, however, it is not my area of responsibility, so I do not want to over-commit on anything.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is looking at energy security issues as well as the shift away from carbon-based fuels and the need for sustainability and emissions reductions.</p></speech>

That is it for the moment.  There are two Deputies offering.  I am conscious of the clock and the motion of confidence in the Government taking place in the D&aacute;il.  I call Deputy Gannon.  he will be followed by Deputy Clarke.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for coming in.  I echo the sentiments regarding our UN mission.  It has been fantastic.  I commend everybody involved.  Will the Minister explain the Government's position on the decision in respect of Georgia's candidacy for accession to the EU?  I am concerned that the decision not to grant candidacy status to Georgia as opposed to Moldova and the expedited process for Ukraine leaves Georgia somewhat isolated.  The ramifications of that may be to push it closer to a particular path.  Nobody wants to see that, in particular the Georgian people who were out on 20 June protesting and campaigning for their country to become a member state of the EU.  What is our position?  Georgia needs a friend.  The Government is in a position to be that friend.</p> <p>  My second question relates to energy security.  We are rightly no longer purchasing coal from Russia.  We purchased very little coal from Russia previously.  However, we are now purchasing coal from Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Columbia as are our European partners.  Has there been - and there should be - a human rights assessment in respect of those orders?  We need to take a role there.  I visited that mine.  It has a military basis.  There are people there who talk about being displaced, communities that talk about family members who disappeared and human rights defenders and indigenous peoples defenders who talk about living in fear as a consequence of the violence associated with the mine.  I accept that times are incredibly difficult in terms of our energy security and supply.  What role do we see for ourselves in ensuring that our further engagement in purchasing coal from that mine does not result in people experiencing further violence?</p> <p>  What is our position in regard to the situation in Western Sahara?  There was a scenario recently whereby a human rights observer was denied access to Morocco.  We should condemn that.  As our role on the UN Security Council comes to an end, we need to ensure that there is a human rights observation position added.  Hopefully, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, can increase its presence.  If it cannot do that, it can certainly increase its level of observation.</p></speech>

I concur with him regarding his first question on Georgia.  This committee has had a number of engagements with Georgia.  We are conscious of the support within Georgia for the European Union and its values.  There was disappointment, as the Minister will be aware, regarding the progress on the matter of its candidate status for accession.  It appeared to us that Georgia did not make the cut.  We hope that both the Georgian Administration and the European Commission will work closely together with a view to ensuring that progress can be made.</p></speech>

I add my voice to the support, recognition and credit being afforded to the UN staff for their hard work and diligence.  Sometimes we can forget the people behind the headlines.  It is important to recognise the job they do.</p> <p>  I will touch on an issue the Minister mentioned in regard to energy guidelines and complacency.  It is absolutely complacent that there has been a failure to publish the wind energy guidelines for so long.  These would have contributed quite positively.  That said, I am conscious that we may be wandering into the territory of the climate action committee.</p> <p>  On the Minister&rsquo;s comments in respect of the Defence Forces - I reference this matter simply because he referred to it earlier - he challenged people to look at the detail.

I would be interested in what the Minister sees as his immediate priority in regard to retention of members of the Defence Forces.  We have a serious job of work to do when it comes to recruitment.  However, there will also be an equally important job of work to do on retention in order to ensure that there is not a hollowing in respect of the specialists who carry out bespoke work on behalf of the Defence Forces.  Given the amount of movement there has been around the Defence Forces - between the Commission of the Defence Forces and the Minister's ask of Cabinet this morning - will the Minister confirm where the ruling from the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to Yvonne O'Rourke sits?  There were specific timelines and detail in respect of that ruling.  Where does that fit into all of this?</p> <p>  The Minister stated: " We are also advancing reforms that I hope will ensure the organisation's relevance in the years to come."  Will the Minister provide more detail on those reforms and indicate why they are essential at this point?</p></speech>

It is the third paragraph under that heading.  The sentence begins, "We are also advancing reforms that I hope will ensure ...".</p> <p>  In recent weeks, the committee has been hearing specifically from D&oacute;chas about the global food crisis.  The World Food Programme has been touched on in that regard, it is not what I wish to focus on.  I want to focus on UN Security Council Resolution 2417 regarding the intersectionality between armed conflict and conflict-induced food insecurity.  Will the Minister give a brief overview of Ireland's position on this in regard to the impact that climate change is having on conflict?  What became very clear from speaking with D&oacute;chas was that there were no doubt challenges before the war in Ukraine, and they now face fundamental difficulties.  As the Minister said, it is about taking food from the hungry to feed the starving.  I can see this changing even more dramatically in a number of years because of the impact climate change will have and the impact of conflict.</p></speech>

In the context of UN Security Council Resolution 2417 and identifying those early warning tools to ascertain the emerging risks, is that even possible at this point in light of the amount of movement in these areas?  By movement, I mean in terms of political influence, the level of conflict increasing and the migration of people who are either internally or externally displaced.</p> <p>  I would like the Minister's opinion on one final matter.  Again, referring to that meeting with D&oacute;chas, it was stated, "When we depart the Security Council, we do not depart leadership at the UN".  What does the Minister see as Ireland's emerging role at the UN following the our time on the Security Council?</p></speech>

I will very briefly refer, as Deputy Clarke has, to Ireland's current Presidency of the Council of Europe and request that perhaps consideration might be given towards advancing the application of Kosovo under our Presidency?  It is an outstanding matter and obviously there are procedures involved.  It would be most beneficial for Kosova if progress were to be reported on this matter during the course of our Presidency.  I am very conscious of the time and the fact that there are a number of outstanding issues for the Minister from Deputies Gannon and Clarke.</p> <p>  I see Senator that Craughwell has returned.</p><p>I will give the Senator a brief opportunity to ask some questions.</p><p> We have already discussed the headline of the Government's decision today on the report of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces.  We indicated that we would have a special meeting on that.  I anticipate that this is an area in which the Senator is going to major.  I ask him to be brief.  We have about ten minutes, because the Minister is due to speak elsewhere.  I need to give him an opportunity to reply to the detailed questions from Deputies Gannon and Clarke.</p></speech>

I am waiting for the fine detail but I congratulate the Minister on that.  He has put a lot into it.  I know I give him a hard time now and then but that is the nature of politics.  Credit where credit is due.</p> <p>  I have a few questions about the Minister's role in foreign affairs.  Now that we are talking about primary radar, has the constitutionality of overflights by the RAF ever been considered by the Cabinet?  Do we know where we stand on that?</p> <p>  We have provided non-lethal support to Ukraine by means of flak jackets, vehicles and the like.  What is the big deal about not supplying weapons?  Ukraine is a neutral country and we have claimed some degree of neutrality for decades.  At the end of the day, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have a massive role to play in explaining to the Irish people what neutrality is, what military alignment is and what being part of some sort of military organisation would involve.  A flotilla should be sent in to force the opening of the ports and allow grain to come out of Ukraine to stop world famine.  Where would the Minister stand on that?</p> <p>  The issue of Georgia has already been mentioned, so I will not bring it up again.</p> <p>  With respect to alignment, military or otherwise, the issue of cybersecurity is now the greatest threat to modern economies.  Whether we like it or not, we are going to have to align ourselves with nation states across the EU, and probably NATO members, in order to agree the sharing of information to protect vital resources in the cyberspace.  There is a lot more I would like to talk about in the area of defence but that is for another day.  I will wait until the Minister makes his final announcement tomorrow.</p></speech>

There will be very interesting debate on the detail of it.</p> <p>  I can understand the disappointment in Georgia.  I spoke to the Georgian ambassador here as recently as yesterday.  I hosted a lunch for all the ambassadors yesterday after the national day of commemoration.  Within the European Union, this is not seen as closing the door on Georgia.  It is actually seen as opening the door as it clarifies what is required in terms of reforms in order to be eligible for candidate status.  However, because it was announced at the same time as the decisions on Ukraine and Moldova, it was seen as making a distinction between the two groups of countries.  I can understand that frustration.  I have reassured the Georgians, and I will do so again, that Ireland is in favour of enlargement and that includes Georgia.  It is a relatively small country but in a strategic part of Europe and it needs our help, support and solidarity.  When I us the word "our", I am talking about the European Union as a whole.  Ireland is one of the strongest backers of enlargement generally, as a principle.  We want this EU stability, which is effectively a peace project that will then provide the platform for everything else, to seep east to countries that want to join.  Georgia is clearly one of those countries.  The accession process is difficult and sometimes prolonged.  I hope that, following the decision of the last European Council meeting, there is at least clarity for Georgia on what it needs to do to take the next step.</p> <p>  I have quite a technical answer on coal purchases.  My Department was informed of May of this year that the ESB has recently ordered coal from the Cerrej&oacute;n mine for the first time in a number of years in order to maintain a secure coal supply.  This is in the context of EU sanctions on Russian coal.  Until this point I understand that the ESB had not used any coal from that mine since 2018.  Matters relating to the import and export of coal do not fall under the remit of my Department.  The ESB is a commercial State company and Ministers do not have a statutory function in the day-to-day operation of the business.  However, we remain in close contact with the lead Department, which is the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, and the ESB on the issue.  I am aware of the issues that have been raised by NGOs and others around the operation of the mine.  My Department has been following developments on this topic closely.  Our embassy in Colombia has maintained regular contact with relevant stakeholders and has visited the mine in order to gain a greater understanding of the circumstances.  Our assessment is that this is a complex issue in a complex part of Colombia.  Needless to say, Ireland takes a very active role in supporting the promotion and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms in Colombia.  Addressing social, land-related and environmental issues is an essential component of Colombia's peace process and is part of the reason we remain so committed to supporting Colombia in the comprehensive implementation of the 2016 peace plan.  We will continue to monitor the human rights situation in the region in which the mine is located and across Colombia.  We will also remain actively engaged on these issues, including by remaining in contact with the relevant Department and the ESB.  We have not stopped it but we are watching pretty closely with regard to the concerns that have been expressed.  There are choices being made now because of energy security issues that may not have been made otherwise.  This could potentially shine a spotlight on the mine, which could ironically be a good thing as it would put pressure on it to ensure the kinds of issues that have been outlined are not continuing.</p> <p>  I am glad Deputy Gannon asked me about Western Sahara.  Our policy on Western Sahara has not changed, despite the fact that some other countries have changed their approach on it.  Our position is consistent with UN resolutions and a UN-led process, without a preconceived outcome for that process.  That is where Ireland still stands on Western Sahara and that position is not likely to change.</p> <p>  I am not going to get into wind energy guidelines.  Deputy Clarke can probably forgive me that.  It is a matter for another Minister, although I am familiar with the issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that the biggest challenge for the commission will be managing people, getting enough people into the Defence Forces, getting enough women into the Defence Forces, changing the culture and changing - I think quite radically - how recruitment is done and how people are managed in the Defence Forces.  That is why we are going to have a civilian head of transformation and a civilian head of HR working very closely with the chief of staff and his team.  In virtually any other sector, a turnover rate of between 7% and 10% would not be considered high at all.</p></speech>

It becomes a particular problem in the Defence Forces if disproportionate numbers of people in specialist areas are lost through headhunting.  That has a cascade effect on other essential functions.  That is why we are looking specifically at specialist areas.  We are looking at the role of the Reserve and we are looking at civilianisation to fill some of those specialist roles, where appropriate.</p><p>That matter is under discussion with a civil military implementation group detailed to look at it.  I have no doubt that the most difficult thing will not be buying new ships, helicopters, planes or a new fleet of armoured vehicles; it will be about managing people and getting the numbers we need over the next six to ten years to deliver the enlargement of our Defence Forces that we are looking for.</p><p> I do not have the Workplace Relations Commission ruling in front of me, but any ruling will be taken seriously and needs to be responded to comprehensively.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022071200002#L00300"><p>I would have to have the recommendation in front of me, which I do not.  I will not comment on something that I do not have in front of me.</p> <p>  Mary Robinson is heading up a body that we agreed to set up to look at the future of the Council of Europe and what it can do in the changed political environment on the Continent.  There are 46 countries in the Council of Europe.  Russia was expelled a number of months ago.  We need to look at the role the Council of Europe plays in promoting human rights and democracy, adherence to the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, and the reforms that are necessary to deliver in those areas.</p> <p>  We very nearly agreed a resolution on climate and conflict.  We worked incredibly hard on it.  We got 113 countries to co-sponsor it, which is almost unheard of in the UN, yet Russia decided to veto it anyway, because it has maintained that climate has nothing to do with security or the UN Security Council.  That is unfortunate because the view across the UN more generally is that climate is very much an accelerator and a driver of conflict.  The parts of the world most impacted by conflict are, for the most part, also the parts of the world most impacted by climate change.  I do not think that is a coincidence.</p> <p>  We are thinking about the role of Ireland in the UN beyond the UN Security Council because we want to try to make sure that we maintain as much influence as we can.  The UN has always been central to Irish foreign policy.  Multilateralism allows us to survive and thrive.  If there is no rules-based order, then we return to a might is right approach to running the world, where the large superpowers dominate their spheres of influence, which would be a disaster for countries like Ireland.  We will remain active within the UN system, but we will not be sitting on the UN Security Council where many of this key debates take place.  That does not mean we will not still be driving the same agendas relating to nutrition, education for girls, women, peace and security, and munitions being used in highly populated areas.  We have an active role relating to the UN Human Rights Council and we hope to be on the council from 2027 to 2029.  We will also drive the disarmament agenda.  These agendas are backed up by our development programmes and will be the kind of issues that we raise at the UN General Assembly and across many committees in the UN.</p> <p>  The Chair asked about Kosovo's accession to the Council of Europe.  We need to be a stickler for process in this and we will be.  I am taking legal advice at the moment.  I have spoken to the foreign ministers from Kosovo and Serbia, which are the two key countries involved.  They have different perspectives.  Our job is to follow procedure and process in a way that is legally sound.  I think we can do that.  I think this issue will come more to the fore from October onwards.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Craughwell for his comments on the decisions of Government today.  I look forward to launching the full detail tomorrow.  I know the Senator will read that with much interest.  As part of the Government decision, we have prioritised moving ahead with a primary radar system on the west coast, which is important.  We do not have overflight arrangements with the RAF, to be clear.</p></speech>

It has to apply to Ireland if it has an emergency reason to enter our airspace.  Notification procedures relating occasions on when that happens are in place.</p> <p>  The question about non-lethal support for Ukraine is fair.  The programme for Government is clear.  We had significant involvement in finalising the wording of the European peace facility so that every country could contribute to it, even countries that were not comfortable with supplying lethal weapons.  The European peace facility was not designed for a full-scale war like we see in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  It was designed for peacekeeping missions, interventions, post-conflict management situations and so on, where funding for armaments may be necessary to ensure that police forces and so on have the equipment that they need to be able to maintain stability and so on.  Ireland and a number of other European countries have always had a principled issue with funding arms.  When we put the programme for Government together, the three Government parties agreed that we would fully support the European Peace Facility but that we would confine our contribution to the non-lethal support part of that facility.  We make the same contribution as France, Germany, Spain, Sweden or Poland in percentage terms, on the basis of our allocation key, which is 2%.  For every &euro;500 million committed, &euro;11 million is from Ireland.</p> <p>  We have confined our money to being used for the non-lethal weapon element of support.  That is important too.  It includes body armour, helmets, fuel, medical supplies, food parcels and all the things that sustain a military in a wartime or conflict situation, but it does not include weapons or ammunition.  That is where Irish money is going.  In truth, we do not have many weapons to share.  If we were funding lethal weapons, we would effectively be paying for others to provide weapons.  We decided, in a way consistent with the agreement in the programme for Government, to fund the European Peace Facility but not the weapons.</p></speech>

It relates to ports.  The way to do this is not to try to militarily force our way into Odesa.  The way to do it is through negotiation.  The UN has invested much time in it, as have Turkey, Moscow and Kyiv, to try to find a solution that can get ships out of Port in Odesa safely without allowing Russian ships in to conduct a military attack.  I hope that plan will succeed.  I think I have answered all the questions.  I thank the Chair.  I am under a bit of time pressure.</p></speech>

I welcome back to the committee Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning division; Ms Mary Jones, principal officer; Mr. Eugene Waters, assistant principal officer, planning review section; and Mr. Colin Ryan, senior planning adviser.  I thank them for the time they have given to the committee on this.  Members have been circulated the opening statement and briefing and the previous meeting documents.</p> <p>  I will read a quick note on privilege before we begin.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Graham to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Mary Jones, Mr. Eugene Waters and Mr. Colin Ryan.  We will move to discussion paper 5 on environmental assessment, having already covered papers 1 to 4 in our previous two sessions, which related to plans and guidelines, consents, enforcement and planning bodies.  Yesterday afternoon we met with the planning advisory forum to consider the same discussion paper.  In addition to the standing members of the group, further representatives from the environmental NGOs, the renewable energy sector and colleagues from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications attended the meeting to discuss this important topic.<br/><br/>It should be noted that this discussion paper discusses the technical process for environmental assessment as it relates to planning.  Other issues concerning access to justice will be dealt with in a further discussion paper on the judicial review process.  It is our intention to prepare a paper on this topic in the autumn which we will discuss with the committee.<br/><br/>Environmental assessment is defined by the European Commission as the procedure that ensures that the environmental implications of decisions, including those related to planning, are taken into account before the decisions are made.  Three key directives are the driving force behind this process; the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive, the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, directive and the habitats directive.  The common principle of these three directives is to ensure that plans, programmes and projects likely to have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an environmental assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation.  Consultation with the public is a key feature of environmental assessment procedures.  In Ireland, the aims of environmental assessment are achieved using three key tools; strategic environmental assessment, SEA, environmental Impact assessment, EIA, and appropriate assessment, AA, pursuant to the habitats directive.<br/><br/>With this in mind, the challenge for the review working group, at its broadest level, is to balance our alignment with the European directives with robustly interrogating the current processes to identify any potential for increased clarity and streamlining and maintaining the appropriate levels of public participation and the ability of the system to make robust decisions in a timely and predictable manner. <br/><br/>The first theme of the considerations emerging from the review is clarity.  As mentioned at our first discussion, much has changed in the landscape of the planning system in the two decades since the Planning and Development Act 2000 was passed.  Not least among these changes is the emergence in importance, rightly, in the interaction between environmental assessment and the plan-making and project-consent processes.  It is our view that there is a need to integrate more clearly the scope and role of environmental assessments into plan-making functions, especially the consenting process for projects.  The question therefore arises, as is posed in the paper, of whether there is scope to further improve the carrying out, concurrently, of the various assessments of environmental reports for development proposals in order to reduce complexity in the decision-making process, while maintaining the robustness of the final decision.<br/><br/>The second theme is that of alignment.  Any changes in timelines need to be in line with the relevant EU directives, without being made unnecessarily complex by overly-intricate national provisions.  The planning system and the legislation that underpins it need to be agile enough to deal with the intersection of the various interdependent directives, such as the water framework directive framework directive, the floods directive and the Seveso directive.  Planning legislation should reflect the wording and intent of relevant EU environmental directives.  The AA process, especially AA in enforcement cases and imperative reasons of overriding public interest, IROPI, processes, needs to be reviewed to better reflect the intent of the habitats directive.  We therefore need to consider what steps can be taken to enhance alignment between environmental provisions and wider planning and development policies, while better meeting the objectives of European directives.<br/><br/>The third theme is around future-proofing.  The emergence at short notice of impactful policy changes, such as the EU Commission&rsquo;s REPowerEU statement on moving to independence from Russian fossil fuels, demonstrates the need for agility within the framework of the new Act.  The new Act needs to be structured to facilitate such new measures in a manner that dovetails with the system, rather than as processes that bookend a stand-alone planning process.<br/><br/>Environmental assessment and its implications have never been so important.  It is imperative that we enable the planning system, through the review, to be equipped with the correct tools to effectively implement new European policy initiatives, especially in the area of renewable energy and supporting infrastructure.  This needs to happen in a streamlined manner, rather than <i>ad hoc</i>, in reaction to emerging policies.  Therefore, environmental assessment and its related considerations must be integrated into the planning system, in order to enable agility within the system to successfully meet future challenges.</p></speech>

We then look at the shape of it all brought together.  There is considerable work around transitional arrangements, but that is at a highly technical level.

I note from Ms Graham's opening statement that the Department only met on Monday on this module.  I was looking through the membership of the advisory forum.  I note that the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance has written to the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, who is chair of the advisory forum, suggesting that it could have a role in or contribute to the forum.  I support that and I think members of the committee would be of the same view.  I ask that Ms Graham, in her role as vice-chair of the advisory forum, outlines that the committee supports the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance as part of civil society engagement, which is an important part of the process.</p></speech>

I am not as nimble as some of my colleagues.  I thank Ms Graham for such a succinct opening statement.  As the Chair rightly said, we have gone through several of the pillars of planning.  This pillar might have been the most difficult to digest or explain, but Ms Graham has set it out very succinctly and clearly.  The key point I take from what Ms Graham has said is that it is very much a case of ensuring that we align with EU standards.</p><p>At the same time, we must robustly challenge the legislation we have in place to ensure that we are doing the best for our environment, while also aligning with EU standards.  What are they key actions we need to take to enable the planning system to effectively implement EU policy initiatives?  On the area of renewable energy and supporting infrastructure, is it fair to say that there is a commitment at EU level to pursue offshore rather than onshore wind energy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022071200002#C00200"><p>In terms of the first piece, it is to make sure that we are aligned with the directives as they are now, and to note that things do evolve, so that we can come up to speed as quickly as possible.  Structurally, one of the ideas is that the environmental provisions would be a separate part in the Act so that they could be easily read and amended should new directives come about.  In that alignment, we also need to ensure that there is a signposting, particularly around timelines and the processes, so that they all work together.  One of the critical areas we are looking at is mapping them out to make sure those timelines are working well.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the renewable energy.  Yesterday, at the planning advisory forum, we had a presentation from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the EU proposals.  Members of the renewable energy sector were also present, as well as environmental NGOs.  We have to get extra discussion papers in, but one thing that struck about the debate was that there was a common view on being clear about the purpose of the directives.  There was a discussion about how many of the documents have become elongated to the extent that it is very hard for people to engage with them or to be clear on what the purpose is.  It was like the discussion we had on plans, in that there is a need to be more succinct and focused on the significant environmental effects are, for example.</p> <p>  The other piece is on timelines and certainty.  Obviously, proposals are emerging on the European front, but for the renewable energy sector and other sectors it is about certainty of timelines and that has implications on resourcing, skills and whether we put statutory timelines into the new Act.  This is something we touched on when we were talking about the consents.</p> <p>  At present, the renewable energy policy is set by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, taking into account all the elements.  They include onshore and offshore elements but, obviously, offshore will be a growing element of it.  We need to make sure that the planning system, which is around the process, can deliver on whatever the policy objectives may be, including targets for onshore and offshore over time.  I am not sure if that fully answers the Deputy's questions but there were some of the issues that struck me.</p></speech>

Have Ms Graham seen anything done at either EU level or in making our guidelines more robust, that is changing the guidelines to allow that to happen?</p></speech>

It is using processes that are allowed and provided for within the directives and how they are all brought together in order to deliver on the agenda.  There is certainly no sense that there is a rowing back.  That is my impression so far on the environmental directives as they stand.</p></speech>

It is about how they apply, in any national area, the implications of the environmental assessment.  That can relate to different topographies, geographical areas and population dispersion.  Similar to the planning Acts, the directives that influence planning are around the process and how these issues are surfaced, how the public participate in them and how they are dealt with rather than being prescriptive.  Let me just check with Mr. Ryan on whether he would agree with that.</p></speech>

There will be a confidence debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber shortly, so I will have to leave after my contribution, for which I apologise.</p> <p>  I want to take a step back for a second.  It is often expressed to us is that the State has a poor record in the transposition of EU environmental law across a range of areas historically.  Even where the transposition of that law happens, it is often delayed, and the way in which it is transposed can lead to significant EU enforcement actions being taken against the State.  This committee has dealt with at great length, issues about the water framework directive and the wastewater treatment directives.  The committee has also dealt with substitute consent, the Derrybrien case, elongated enforcement action and consequential fines.</p> <p>  In advance of considering a consolidated environmental section to a revised planning and development Act, has there been an audit of the number of those enforcement or warning proceedings from the European Commission on environmental planning matters to try to inform the work of the Attorney General and Ms Graham's team?  If so, will Ms Graham share the outcome of that because it seems to be that this would have been useful to do at the outset?</p></speech>

At various stages, there can be different actions that lead, ultimately, to infringements but sometimes letters of formal notice.  The question of infringements is a matter that is regularly considered by the ministerial management board within the Department.  Even apart from the review, there would be an ongoing check on where we are with different cases.  We can follow up with a note on that.  It would be a starting point and a step back, as the Deputy said, from this review.  One of the issues was the looking at the transposition of directives.  Have they been correctly done?  Have we over transposed?  Have we over complicated?  That step back is probably important in the sense that sometimes these things are done at speed.  This is an opportunity for us to look at how they all work together and how they are operationalised.</p> <p>  One of the issues we are conscious of over this time is that we have a different legal system.  We have a common law legal system compared to the European system.  I talked about the purpose of the directive and when cases go before the European Court of Justice.  The focus is very much on whether the purpose and intent of the directive is being met.  That is a good starting point for us to look at in any directive.  Is it clear that we are meeting the purpose of the directive?  Are all the steps that are there necessary and do they align with other steps in the planning process?  If it becomes over complicated, it becomes very hard for people to engage and easy for people miss a step in that process.</p></speech>

Without overburdening Ms Graham, could that note include an indicative list of where there have been those notices, infringements or enforcement, as well as costs to date?</p><p>That would be useful for the purposes of this, if the information is available.  The second point relates to both EIA directives and our obligations under the Aarhus Convention, where there is a set of very clear requirements for public participation.  In the piece of work the Department is doing around this module, what is the mechanism to ensure full compliance?  I ask because this committee has heard from various people at various stages concerns that aspects of our planning system, in the past or present, are not necessarily as Aarhus-compliant as they could be.  Is specific attention being given in the review work to ensure we capture areas where there may be a compliance issue or to ensure any changes are fully compliant and do not fall foul, intentionally or unintentionally, of those public participation and access to information standards?</p></speech>

We will be very clear around the Aarhus elements.  Obviously, access to information, public participation and access to justice are the three pillars of that.  They are very clear components.  As things evolve over time, you have to check that alignment is staying in place.</p></speech>

Given the very considerable body of work being undertaken by the Department's staff and the Attorney General's staff, which a colleague of Ms Graham's suggested in a briefing to us yesterday would not be concluded for another six months, how is that going to interact with the production and then introduction of the MPA legislation and the processing of that?  While the Department is trying to improve, streamline and clarify the existing Planning and Development Act and all the environmental elements of that, we have this other area looming, namely, our desire to move ahead with offshore wind to meet our renewable energy targets.  However, we are very far behind where we should be with the MPAs.  Is there a fear that the MPA element of the overall maritime planning piece could be delayed because of this other piece of work?  Will it happen in tandem?  How will the Department ensure the outworkings of the MPAs are adequately reflected in the environment section of a new planning and development Bill?</p></speech>

We have a number of pieces of legislation.  As the committee is aware, we have been keeping it quite busy in terms of the legislative frame.  There is nothing that is detracting-----</p></speech>

That, I suppose, when I touch on future-proofing, is always going to be an issue because there may be some MPAs that come in, similarly to SACs, and that evolves.  The processes we set out in the Bill must be robust enough to allow for that changing landscape with the underlying environment.  They would be taken into account, it is my understanding, at the environmental assessment stage.  Mr. Ryan does a lot of marine assessments.  He may wish to add something.</p></speech>

Strategic environmental assessments, SEAs, EIAs and the assessment on habitats have never been a more important component of the planning process as we all work to deliver action on climate change and to protect and enhance the natural habitats and biodiverse landscapes that exist within our communities up and down the country.  I welcome this review because it is so important that we are continually reassessing whether what we are doing is having the desired impact and how our rules, regulations and laws fit in with the EU directives or could be adapted to include them.</p> <p>  Future-proofing was highlighted in the opening statement as a key component of the review.  It is quite interesting to hear the officials speak about the impact the war in Ukraine has had with respect to independence from Russian fuel and how we transpose not just directives but also policy changes and statements of intent from the EU into our laws.  I would like the officials to talk us through what kind of challenges they had to overcome on that issue in particular and whether having flexibility baked into our Bills would have helped to mitigate those challenges.  I suppose I am really asking whether flexibility would provide future-proofing or whether it would leave Acts open to interpretation or misinterpretation and how we strike that balance.</p> <p>  The previous two contributors touched on renewable energy and supporting infrastructure.  We as a committee have done so much work around maritime planning, maritime protected areas legislation and all the frameworks that come with that.  I am interested in knowing how this review deals with that, not just in the context of the work this committee has done on our own national laws, but also in the context of European policy that might be coming down the tracks too.  Those are my two questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022071200002#D01200"><p>There are two aspects the Deputy has touched on that are important with regard to future-proofing.  The planning Act is really around processes like how you plan, how you consent and how you enforce.  What is important in tandem with that legislation is the robustness of the policy framework that sits around it and the degree to which the planning system can then take account of that.  In the renewable energy space, for example, that is what targets we have, what our overall ambition is and how that translates down to regional level so it can influence local development plans rather than local authorities having to look at this against a national target.  They will have some idea of what the regional target is as well.  That is an area the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working on.  Similarly, it will be looking at updating its offshore renewables plans as well, perhaps to look at issues around the sequencing of development areas.  We have a lot in the frameworks that allows flexibility if you have the policy.  If you have a clear policy at national level, and perhaps a clear policy at regional level, that can then influence the local authority element.</p> <p>  The other element we will be looking at is that the environmental assessment tends to relate to whether projects are over an environmental threshold.  I suppose over time you can look at whether those thresholds are fit for purpose and need to be reviewed.  The habitats directive is slightly different with respect to the tests, if you like, but there is provision within that directive for projects that have an overriding public interest.  If you discover there may be some damage, you look at whether it is a project of overriding public interest and at how to mitigate the efforts.  We have had one project in Ireland, which was Lough Talt in Sligo, where the question involved public health and environmental issues.  It was a matter of dealing with public health issues while trying to mitigate environmental damage.  That is an area we have not used much in Ireland compared with other European countries.  We may need to explore controversial issues or whether there is an overriding interest, for example.  That is what the Commission pointed to, perhaps, in renewable energy.  We will look at mitigation measures.</p><p>I am speaking in generalities, as Deputy Higgins will appreciate.  From a legislative perspective, it is a matter of ensuring the provisions that allow that process or thinking process to happen are sufficiently robust, are aligned with the directives, allow for the public participation and allow one to come to a balanced decision.  Finally, as I mentioned, if we have all the environmental parts in a single part of the Act, and if there are new changes to directives, we can more easily make that legislative change.</p></speech>

I will touch on a few issues.  I do not really have any questions.  I acknowledge and thank Ms Graham and her team here for leading off on the discussion papers and documents with the Planning Advisory Forum.  I note that we have dealt with the plans and guidance, the consents issue, enforcement and the planning bodies, and now we are on to the environmental issue.  It is a big issue which was traditionally very controversial.  I have been involved in a number of these challenges in my own planning authority and in bigger national issues, so I am quite aware of the issues.</p> <p>  The things I am hearing here again today are clarity and alignment, and I think we all agree on them.  Then there is the transposition of the EU directives - or their overtransposition, as Ms Graham rightly says.  Then there is our environmental law.  The Aarhus Convention is readily quoted in the D&aacute;il in debates on anything to do with planning or the environment, and rightly so, and in Seanad &Eacute;ireann we have similar debates.  Then there is the concern about people who participate in and are advocates for the environment.  Traditionally, they were seen as troublemakers opposed to development.  I do not agree with that.  I agree that people have a right to defend their environment.  We in Ireland have been assisted by the European Union over many years.  If you poll Irish citizens on European affairs, the first thing you will always find is that they have high engagement with the European Union and greatly respect its institutions, laws, policies and advocacy, particularly in the area of the environment.  There is a very strong connection.  We almost seek the EU to vindicate our environmental rights.</p> <p>  Then we look at the case law.  I know that the Attorney General is looking at a whole review of the planning Act.  That is good.  The Act needs to be consolidated.  It is a huge document and has been added to over time.  It is like the hotel with the hundred extensions on it that Francis Brennan was talking about last night.  The Act is all over the place.  We need to consolidate all that.  I therefore see the logic in the work the Department is doing and I thank Ms Graham for that work.</p> <p>  Before I go any further, I will endorse what the Chairman said about whether it is possible to include at this stage the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance.  It has engaged with us.  It is a really good organisation.  It is constructive, helpful and knowledgeable and has been involved with a number of planning challenges.  It is at the coalface of this and knows the issues as well as many of the people Ms Graham has on her forum.</p> <p>  We have talked about renewables.  Yes, the Government has targets, and rightly so, and objectives and ambitions.  Coming back to alignment, we want renewables.  The renewable energy space is where we are.  If we are not there, we are going there and should be there.  We have offshore challenges and onshore challenges.  It goes back to what Ms Graham said about the alignment of all those issues.  We need the tools to interpret that.</p> <p>  In preparation for today's meeting, I looked at some papers that have been done on various international planning organisations.  They refer to international SEA guidance and regulations, models and methodologies.  They also refer to the alignment of national, EU and rural policy and to international best practice.  They make it clear that in drawing on the practice of SEA, the aim is to provide a unique analysis of SEAs which have been undertaken, drawing in turn on a variety of methods and circumstances to illustrate how best practice can be achieved.  There is a lot of work out there on this and many people are thinking the same thing.  We have all come into this space slowly.  It all needs to be consolidated.</p> <p>  There are the SEAs, EIAs and AAs, as well as the Natura 2000 sites, of which there are many.  It is not that the Government or certain aspects of the Government may want to be seen to be pro-development.  Of course we have to be pro-development, in the best sense of the term, but we also have to respect our environment.</p> <p>  We also have a lot of issues with built heritage and the built environment that are really challenging.  I spoke to a number of senior counsel in the past few days about this.  There is a significant body of case law.  There have been a lot of successful challenges.  People have put their homes on the line to take litigation against the State and to take it to Europe and they have been vindicated, so people are passionate about this.  I therefore ask that we look at case law.  We will see where the mistakes were made.  No one is tripping anyone up, but there have been clearly stated and successful legal challenges in these areas, and we have to look there too.  I have no doubt but that the Attorney General will do that.  This is his area of expertise.</p> <p>  I wish Ms Graham and her team well.  This is important.  My sense of it, I think, is partly to do with the tripartite nature of the coalition Government.  I acknowledge that there are different aspects, challenges and priorities.  We definitely would not have had this conversation three years ago, when I was sitting as a member of this committee.  We discussed the EIAs, the AAs and issues like Natura 2000 sites and so on and did not get quite the same response.  We are all on a journey, including the Department and its officials.  The different dynamics at play in the Government have made this a real priority.  The brakes were put on.  I think that negotiations in the Government and the different strands in the Government have helped this.  I acknowledge that.  I think we are going more slowly, more methodically, more carefully and more strategically, and that is right.  The engagement with the forum and the listening to those stakeholders, who represent a broad group of people, is also very positive.  I get a sense and a good feeling that we are going in the right direction, and I thank Ms Graham for that.</p></speech>

They align with a lot of what I said.  One of the things that struck me while he was speaking is that I think we have previously talked about guidance and its importance.  These are complex areas.  The Office of the Planning Regulator has produced guidance.  The Department itself issued planning guidance on SEAs as well.  Our team that deals in particular with EU and international areas participates in a lot of the Commission working groups in this area because learning from best practice and from other countries is an important part of that evolving landscape.</p></speech>

The EU directives that we have and that we have transposed into law are there to protect the environment and our health and are there for our protection.  They are often held up as a reason for things not happening.  I think we have become slightly disconnected from the purpose of those directives.  Sometimes people get caught up in saying nothing can happen because of whatever bird or some species.  The famous case that is always referred to is the snail on the M7.  The snail was an indicator species of something else that was present at the time, namely an aquifer.  The snail is always portrayed as having held up the road, but it did not.  It was an indicator.  That is an example of the disconnect we have.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Ms Graham.  I refer to the complexity for local authority planners or An Bord Plean&aacute;la when they are dealing with these applications, which are highly complex, with much crossover between environmental law and planning and EU directives.  Does feedback go to each local authority when a judicial review is held or if something is refused because of a failure to assess properly an environmental impact assessment report or the compilation of that report in that something should have been in it that was not included?  I refer to a briefing stating, "Here is where the mistake was made."  It may become apparent, as such a mistake would in most organisations.  Does that happen at local authority level or with An Bord Plean&aacute;la?</p></speech>

It tends to be because the last step in the process of the judicial review would be at that stage.  It obviously happens in different ways depending on whether the court findings lead to legislative change which would require us to make a change to guidance or to legislation, for example.</p> <p>  One of the issues the Office of the Planning Regulator has been looking at with the local authorities is more formal systems of learning and development.  They have recently put proposals into us that we will be looking at in the context of this year's Estimates cycle.  That is around a programme of what people need to have at different levels, so we can ensure a more consistent approach to planning.  The first step in doing that exercise was looking to see what people felt their needs were.  It is an ongoing process but we are looking at formalising it into a more distinct programme.</p></speech>

If one reads a court judgment, one sees that it is fairly or highly complex.  I have tried to read a good few of them.  The executive summary aspect could just go out to the general public as well, so they would know that such a development failed or that something in an environmental impact assessment report was not done properly, for example.  This would create a better understanding.  I would like to see something along those lines.</p> <p>  There is a complexity now in the submissions for local authority planners or for the board to consider.  These are aspects such as water framework directives, flood risk assessments, habitats and birds directives, and severe time pressures.  Has there been feedback from local authority planners to say these things are getting way too complex for the planners to try to assess within the period of time?</p></speech>

People are conscious of the time, and everything that they have to do in the time, but there has not been a general ask for that time to be extended.  There probably have been questions around the resourcing, the learning and development, and the clarity of guidance.  They would be in favour of legislation that is clearer and guidance that is clearer so they know the framework within which they are making the decisions.</p></speech>

It is about clarity and the steps that need to be taken.  It is about the access to expertise.  It is about those operational-type things.  At the end of the day, the system has to make a good and robust decision that is timely and effective as well.</p></speech>

It is about ensuring the processes work seamlessly together so that one is not going in different places to look for what one should be doing.  It would be clear from the legislation and well signposted in the legislation that at a certain point in the process one needs to do X, Y and Z.</p></speech>

They have a number of systems around that kind of research role or areas, and have produced practice notes in different areas.  In consultation with the Department they have done a whole series of notes on various aspects of the planning system that are directed at the public.  They would also be looking at practice notes and specific areas where they believe people need to look more closely.  Another aspect of their role is a systems review they have done with four local authorities so far.  Apart from looking at an individual authority, that work can bring to the surface these kinds of issues where there may be learnings that are required.</p></speech>

That is good to know.  When a Part 8 application is done by a local authority that requires an environmental impact assessment, the decision is made by the board and not by the local authority members.  What is the rationale behind that?</p></speech>

The board would act as the final arbiter in relation to the environmental side of the house where the environmental assessment relates to that proposal.</p></speech>

That is the Part 8 system.  If it requires an environmental impact statement, it would go straight to the board.

A lot of the time we are worried about a lack of data and information on the marine environment, marine species and a lot of the habitats out there.  Is there an opportunity there?  All of these developments must go through stringent environmental impact assessments with a huge amount of data gathering.  These data can add to the body of knowledge that we have on the marine environment that we do not have already.  Is there an opportunity there for all of this data to be taken in by the Department, or whoever it might be, so we can start gathering a much larger database of marine environment data?  Has this been considered?</p></speech>

It is a new system with digital approaches looking at the different components and what the research elements are.  We can certainly consider the data set, how robust that is, and how it can be looked at and brought together.</p></speech>

That is the space where available data can be transmitted in the public realm.  Whether that evolves over time is something we will have to give thought to as well.  That is in place at the moment with the latest data we have.</p></speech>

Rather than just getting environmental impact assessment reports back from developers there is also the environmental data that come back in.  We could have all of the data and not just in a report.  There is a benefit that would accrue to the State over ten, 20 or 30 years of offshore renewable development.</p></speech>

There will be the establishment of the maritime area regularity authority, MARA.  The board will have planning functions.  There are also bodies such as the Marine Institute out there with a lot of research and data.  It is about how we use all of those resources together.  It is very much a collaborative space, which is the direction of travel on this.  As Mr. Ryan has said, that was the idea behind what we have at the moment with Marine.ie and the mapping layers we have.  If you want a consent in an area, you should be able to go on and find out what has already been consented for dredging, offshore or protected areas.  They will be delineated in time.</p></speech>

They have a lot of experience, expertise and knowledge.  A lot of the alliance members have professional experience of many years.  Engagement with them would be very useful.  In the overall area of planning, complex planning law is bad law.  I completely agree that it leads to confusion, delay and litigation.</p><p>Clear legislation has many benefits.  If legislation is clear, it is much easier for the public to participate and for people to hold the entire process to account.  It also means a reduction in delays.  In 2018, the Chief Justice made comments about the importance of clear legislation, especially in respect of planning law, in an environmental context.  He suggested that if legislation was done better in Leinster House, it would lead to much quicker decisions with less litigation and fewer delays on projects.  He was pointing to that as the issue rather than access to the courts and justice, which I think is absolutely correct.</p><p> When we hear words like "streamlining", there is concern that it could potentially be used to undermine people's access to justice.  That has been particularly important historically, as Senator Boyhan was saying, for environmental NGOs.  There have been great advances for the environment as well as in other areas including workers' rights and equality.  They have happened because of access to justice through the courts and through people looking for European Union law to be properly upheld and transposed.  Could Ms Graham talk us through the timeline for the overall planning review?  What are her thoughts and expectations at the moment?</p></speech>

The block we expect to receive quite shortly or in the near term is judicial review, which will be the final block we will want to talk to.  The Attorney General is still working towards this process all being completed by the end of December.  I think in September we will have to come to judicial review and what the shape of it is.  We are very much working to that end of year target.  We will no doubt be in the Deputies' hands as that process evolves.  We would hope in September to have a shape of the overall piece.  There are things around transitional issues, moving from one to the other, what is in flight, and how we deal with all of those issues.  We have been through these different elements with the planning advisory forum.  We take the points the Senator has made about the inclusion of the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance.  We have a couple of others that we are looking at so we will look at that one.  On the environmental question, we broadened it out on the theme.  We will look at that.  The other area we are looking at in September is probably with the planning schools, the academic piece, to deal with that aspect.</p></speech>

We have our own EU unit that can gauge us in a number of groups.  We also participate in the so-called five planning administrations, namely Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England and Ireland.  Being common law jurisdictions, there will be clearer commonalities with them.  We have met the European Commission and set out what we are doing.  It was agreed that we would go back and talk to them in more detail in September, so as to give them a flavour of what we were doing, and they pointed to some other countries that would be useful to talk to in terms of experience.

Senator Boyhan referred to case law.  We are very aware of what is coming from the European Court of Justice and the kinds of issues that have been coming up over the years.  We are watching those directions of travel.  In our engagement with the Commission, this idea came up of overcomplicating.  The possibility that we might have overcomplicated things in some of the ways we have transposed directives - that actually we may have complicated things too much - was a theme that came to me from the discussion.  The Chair referred to the purpose of the environmental directives.  This would be my sense of where they come from.  The purpose is to protect the environment.  It is important to come back to the main purpose and then ensure it is being transposed correctly from that point of view.</p> <p>  One of the things that is common in the European legislation is the concept of recitals, setting out at the beginning of the legislation what the intent is in doing it.  It is very informative in terms of the interpretations.  That is one of the things that may be important for us in concepts like planning and sustainable development.  I refer to the overarching terms.  It may be useful for the Planning Acts to be clearer at the outset as to what is it that we are trying to achieve.  I am not sure if there was anything else that came from the discussions with the Commission.</p></speech>

I want to focus in on a couple of pieces.  The Chair spoke about the marine area.  We all know the targets out to 2030 in terms of the 5 GW.  There is a special transition arrangement in place to allow for a number of projects to proceed through a process with the Department.  All others will require MARA to be established to go through the marine area consent process.  I am wondering where we are in that regard.  When that Bill was being passed, the one concern I had was that the establishment of MARA could be delayed, which could have an impact down the line on our targets for 2030.  I wondered if it was appropriate to allow for a number of additional projects to be admitted into that special transition arrangement.  I am wondering when we expect to have MARA established and whether our 5 GW target to 2030 is still a realistic goal.</p></speech>

We have set up a separate establishment unit within the marine planning area of the Department.  The unit is headed up at principal officer level and has a number of staff in the expectation that they will be deployed to MARA in the first instance.  We are starting an advance process.  They are going through all of the different elements that are required to establish MARA.  Shortly we hope to recruit the chief executive, put in place the board and assess the skills that are required for MARA, the accommodation and everything else as well as the processes.  There is huge work in hand and the Department is well resourced to do that.</p> <p>  We will have regular and structured engagement with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, which is leading on this.  That Department is considering the MAP process for the transitional projects.  We are also gearing up the board, which will have to take on the pre-application discussions in the latter half of this year for any projects, if any emerge.  Both my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications have talked to the board about its resourcing needs.  The project is very much a priority and we are looking at that.  In the meantime, projects remain with the foreshore arrangements.  By and large, what foreshore is dealing with is a lot of the site investigations and there are numerous requests in there that we are processing for site investigation.</p></speech>

What is the rationale for that?  Is there an intention that guidelines similar to what is place for wind energy will be applied to solar energy?  Are regulations being considered and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

The public consultation phase for that has just finished and findings are being finalised.</p> <p>  For large-scale projects, my understanding is that they are not mentioned in the directive and that is the rationale.  A renewable energy guidance policy and the need for it would be defined, in the first instance, by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The planning system is around the process and the guidance that one gives to the projects.  If it is determined that it would be useful to give guidance to ensure a consistent approach, whether that is for floods, childcare facilities or aspects of renewable energy, then we are happy to work through that process from a planning perspective but there must be a clear policy, which is articulated by whoever creates the policy, and an operational piece from planning.  I ask Mr. Ryan to comment on EIAs.</p></speech>

Many solar farm developments have been approved in my own county of Waterford.  I do not oppose solar farm development but some people in the community are concerned that no EIA was carried out as part of the process.</p></speech>

I appreciate the volume of work done by the Department, the legislation that is passing through Ms Graham's office and the pressure her office is under to deal with the matter.  I express my thanks now as our discussions can be robust, to put it mildly.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to talk to the delegation because a lot of legislation, regulations and guidelines arrive in a piecemeal fashion or are drip-fed through various schemes, amendments or new guidelines so it can be extremely difficult to be up to date with them, especially regarding environmental assessments.  That is why I welcome our engagement and appreciate all of the work done.  I know that something which might be appropriate now may not be appropriate in five years' time, which is the angle we are coming at here.  Future proofing is commendable and we need legislation to deal with that but is the Department looking at ways to ensure that changes and adaptations are quickly communicated? </p></speech>

Certainly that is something we are looking at with the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR.  We issue regular circulars and communication to local authorities when there are changes in legislation.  I agree with the Deputy that sometimes one looks at these things in isolation rather than as part of the bigger picture.</p> <p>   Returning to the idea of being very clear about what the intent of legislation is and the purpose of things can be useful to ground any changes, which is why we will consider a deeper process of learning and development to be made available to local authorities in a more structured way so that it is not all on the individuals and individual local authorities to do that.  We are exploring that piece at the moment because, particularly around case law and European case law, it is a changing picture.  I mean cases come up and new aspects and clarifications come.</p> <p>  I think the organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la mentioned that concepts change over time.  I mean what we call sustainable development now may not be what we termed sustainable development ten years go. </p></speech>

It is a lot to wrap your head around, especially for an ordinary member of the public.  A person like me would have a foundation or a basic understanding of the planning process, but a lot of people would not have, and it is complex even for me.  Is the Department going to ensure that the language is suitable for the public and that it is straightforward so that people can read and understand what is meant and what they need?  Ms Graham made a point earlier about what people need and what we have to do so that people can understand the legislation and that it speaks to everyone.</p></speech>

Deputy Gould mentioned IROPI.  I always struggle myself to remember what is meant but we get used to the language.  For example, what does "I" stand for?  It is "imperative" and "reasons of overriding public interest" follows.  We get used to using acronyms and it makes it a bit impenetrable for the public.  One of the specific roles of the Office of the Planning Regulator is to produce planning leaflets that describe these different elements.  That is an important piece.  The degree to which we can be clear about the language within the legislation and that it means the same thing when it is used is important.  Sometimes we say "take account of" and sometimes we say "have regard to".  Is there a difference in the meaning?  We are conscious of the jargon but there is probably a piece to make sure there is a plain speaking guide in terms of the leaflet.</p></speech>

There is one other issue.  I will not go into individual cases, but it goes back to a point that was made earlier about planning.  I was contacted by a person in a case where planning permission had been sought for a solar farm in an area.  A second planning permission was sought for a second solar farm in a different area.  Then a third application for planning permission was made which just happened to be in the middle of the two areas and connected them.  Should that not have been the one planning application?  Now there is another planning application to put in a substation.  What happened when it went to public consultation was that people were consulted on the applications separately when they should have consulted people on all the applications at the same time if it was open and transparent.  The reason there is sometimes a lack of trust in the public around planning is that they see things like this happening.  These applications should have been presented together.  Everyone should have had their ideas heard.  I support renewable energy creation such as solar, wind and wave energy, but when we see things like that happening communities feel it is an act.</p></speech>

There is case law around project splitting and ensuring that the totality of projects is known.  The leading case in Ireland related to a wind farm where the grid connection was not taken into account.  That is a fundamental piece of planning at the moment because sometimes there can be cumulative impact.  It can be difficult if the timing of the applications is different.  I cannot go into an individual case.</p></speech>

Senator Cummins asked a question about the environmental impact assessment report, EIAR.  The European annexes set out the uses that require an EIAR.  If you do not fall within it then you are outside of that regime.  That is not to say that you should not come together with one application.  People make decisions in terms of making planning applications in their own interests.  The planning authority is faced with having to make that decision on valid applications that are put before it.  As Ms Graham said, there are issues regarding project splitting, and without going into detail, that can present itself over time.  There is case law in that regard.  It relates to EIAR applications as opposed to individual applications.  You could make an application for one house today, then another house beside it and another house further down the street, so to speak.  The planning authority makes the decision to validate the application in accordance with the regulations and the Act.  If it is faced with a planning application today, it must deal with it, for better or worse, and make a decision.  If a similar application comes in the next day in the field next door then it has to make a decision on that as well.  It must decide on the individual applications before it.  I do not know if that helps.</p></speech>

There is the Brundtland description of it.  An Irish politician describes sustainable development as development which must be sustained.  I believe that is the case, although I never heard it said.  A well-known Irish politician was credited with that interpretation many years ago.</p></speech>

If farmers, for example, with a 100 acre holding release more than 49% of their land holding, they lose their single farm payment.  What happens as a result is that three or four farmers come together.  To make it viable to build a solar farm, you need between 180 acres and 200 acres with a high-power line.  Often, a company goes to more than one farmer and by the time the process is finished there might be three or four applications from the one company trying to make the whole unit viable.  That is a lot of the reason different applications go in at certain times.  A company might get one farmer and then get a second farm that is close enough and then it might try to link two or three farms together to make one project in order to make it viable.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for all the work it has done.  Planning and environmental issues are something I am interested in as I have been in construction all my life.  My question is on solar farms.  Up to what kilowatt level would the Department consider a small solar farm development to be exempt from planning?  The reason I ask is following Covid and the high rise in energy costs.  Is there a certain square metreage or kilowatt level of solar farm that will be recommended to be exempt?  At present, no matter what business you are in, if you decide you want to put up a 90 kW solar farm, you are guaranteed there will be an objection from an objection company from outside of the area that is objecting to all solar farms at the moment regardless of their size.  Objections are coming in even if it is only to produce electricity for one building.  Then the application has to go through the planning process.  In terms of the sustainability of a small business or a hotel or leisure centre, what would be considered an adequate size that would be acceptable within the planning framework?</p></speech>

The matter was just out for public consultation.  That is really in the domestic, community and schools' sphere.  Does Mr. Ryan want to come in on the size?</p></speech>

They deal, first of all, with domestic cases to increase the capability for domestic housing to be exempt for solar projects.  In regard to community, industrial and commercial activities, it is effectively the roof space that can be utilised for exempted purposes, subject to certain rules.  I do not have the details, but I think it involves setback.</p></speech>

The question is if hotels and other such areas are included.  Most solar farms at the moment are being put in fields because they are not recommended to go on roofs.  Many of the roof designs are not capable of accommodating solar panels because of the wind that could be trapped which would cause vibrations.  They are great for flat roofs with a slight slope, which is fine, but when you have an elevated roof at 25&deg; or 30&deg; many of them are not designed to accommodate them.</p><p>Often, if one goes out with a sheet of cardboard on a windy day, the wind has a certain amount of vibration.  It can loosen slates on roofs.  Many people are going to their fields now where they have a field.  Can they transfer the same size of the area of their roof space to a field and look for an exemption?</p></speech>

From the details the Department has at the moment, it probably has a footprint map of Ireland as a whole.  It can see the weak areas that do not have infrastructure and that are being taken out of the local area plans because of lack of infrastructure for forward planning.</p> <p>  In counties like Limerick, we are looking at it from the point of view that many areas do not have a proper adequate sewerage system.  A recent report showed that the biggest polluters in County Limerick are the local authorities from the amount of sewerage that is going into the rivers.  It is also stopping the planning and framework for rebuilding the likes of County Limerick in its entirety, however.  It is only going to areas now where local area plans show towns and villages - mainly towns - that have sewerage capacity, which takes out two thirds of County Limerick from the point of view of infrastructure.  It puts the rest of the county at a disadvantage when encouraging business into an area and bringing people home, having housing within an area and making it sustainable for sports, local businesses and local shops.  These areas are at a disadvantage.  In all the records it holds at the moment, does the Department have a detailed plan that shows the weak and strong areas within Ireland that need to be invested in and that could be put forward to the Government to show what the future could hold for Ireland if proper infrastructure was put in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022071200002#K00600"><p>We start from the national planning framework, which looks at an increase in population of 1 million by 2040.  That is paired then with the national development plan to look at the infrastructure and cost of investment that has to go into supporting that national planning framework.  Obviously, the national planning framework is based on growth of regional cities and brownfields and also growth in other areas.  There will obviously be a huge population increase to deal with.</p> <p>  I went to a conference a number of years ago in the OECD, during which the Secretary General talked about the importance of investment not being spatially blind and that any investment had to take account of the spatial impact.  The idea of Project Ireland 2040 was that we brought the national development plan and national planning framework together.</p> <p>  In terms of specific infrastructure then within it, each of the different areas would be looking at what provision is required to deliver on the national planning framework whether that is education, transport or water services.  My understanding is that Irish Water has done capacity reviews of where there is capacity and where it needs to invest, and that is reflected in its national development plan.</p> <p>  Obviously, when it comes down through the regional areas and into the local authorities when we get to the county development plan, there is an assessment to be made in the six-year timeline of where there is capacity, where there will be investment, where there needs to be development and how can that be sequenced.  Therefore, it is always about trying to make the best we can of the resources to meet that.  It will never be that 100% can be done but certainly from a planning perspective, we are anxious to ensure that sufficient land is zoned and serviced for the needs, whether that is residential or jobs, and probably that a second tier of land is zoned and serviceable in the period.  We are then consistently looking at that period.</p> <p>  I know there are always challenges.  We deal with the Town Centre First perspective in the planning side of the Department and I know Irish Water particularly has a towns and villages programme.  We are really interested in that development in towns as well as cities to make sure they grow.  We had quite a discussion earlier in the year around urban development.  There will always be gaps but there is significant resourcing, which I think is in the region of &euro;165 billion.  There are a lot of resources going in; it is making the best use of those resources in the time available.</p></speech>

It is important to express the confidence we have in delivering 5 GW of offshore energy and likely 2 GW to 3 GW of solar capacity plus the 4 GW to 5 GW of onshore energy.  We introduced one of the most complex and biggest pieces of planning legislation that went through this committee last year in terms of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 to be able to provide that fit-for-purpose planning system.  In fact, the planning Bill today introduces changes that will facilitate the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, and facilitate some of that design flexibility that is probably required in it.  We just need to be careful that the environmental impact assessments can take account of that design flexibility.  What we do not want to do is create further uncertainty in it.  There is progress on it, however.  Planning permission was given for the Youghal interconnector and recently for the onshore cable at Arklow Bank phase 2.  There is, therefore, quite good progress in that area.</p> <p>  I will briefly return to some questions.  This will probably be the final input unless Senator Cummins wishes to come in.  Assistance to local authorities to deal with maritime area plans for their jurisdiction goes out 3 km or 3 miles.  Have they put their hands up for assistance to deal with that?  I know there will not be that many applications but what is the thought process for local authorities to be able to assess environmental impact assessments for an area with which they would not necessarily have been that familiar before?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022071200002#K00900"><p>We are looking at that as part of the skills.  First, we are looking more broadly at local authorities and their skills and resourcing needs but specifically, for example, the potential within that marine space for sharing of services to do that kind of work for coastal local authorities because, obviously, those do not include all local authorities.  As the Chairman said, the frequency of application may be varied.  That is one of the areas being explored with local authorities in terms of the kinds of resourcing they may wish to have.</p> <p>  As I said, we are also looking at what resources may be available to the State that could be used and deployed in that fashion without counteracting whatever the purpose of the organisation may be and whether there is some way the existing resources can be shared.  That is ongoing at the moment.</p></speech>

Has consideration been given that we could do it on a regional basis or sub-regional basis with maybe two or three local authorities, especially as we are aligning county development plans now as well?  An SEA could be done to free up that resource.  It is kind of resource heavy to do one for each county.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022071200002#K01100"><p>The recognised environmental concerns, REC, are strategically environmentally assessed in the first instance.  The second issue then is that each plan stands on its own two feet and requires an SEA to be done in relation to that proposal.  The issue is that we might have to combine them, which poses issues from the point of view of the plan itself and the individual four walls of that plan, notwithstanding that there might be a number of plans taking account of one another.</p> <p>  Certainly, we would agree that skills and things like that would be utilised across local authorities to a degree.  It poses more fundamental questions to do with the sanctity of the plan that is going through, however, because there are individual requirements, policies and objectives that relate to that particular local authority, notwithstanding that fact it obviously has a wider context it works within.</p></speech>

Perhaps where national and regional policies have already been strategically environmentally assessed is the point from which we move off rather than the whole thing being subject again to an SEA.</p><p>There is a divergence there and a question of bringing it down to the next level of granular detail that is subject to an SEA.  That is something with which we have to grapple.</p></speech>

I cannot remember whether we discussed it with the departmental witnesses or with somebody else.  Where one is trying to perform an SEA on a ten-year plan, we will see deteriorations in environment and we will not see action on climate emissions.  Will it be necessary to have regular assessments of the SEA and how accurate it is if we are going to extend plans out to ten years?</p></speech>

We would be making an assessment at the review of how far we got and whether the challenges remain the same or had extended.  Mr. Ryan might comment on that.</p></speech>

We brought this up in regard to the development plan guidelines that were recently published.  They would reflect SEAs as well.  The SEA must be done for the period of the plan.  It is an assessment of the likely effects on the environment.</p></speech>

Will there be monitoring of the accuracy of the assessment of the SEA?</p></speech>

There would be an assessment of the consistency with the plan objectives and the consistency with the environmental effects of those objectives being operationalised.  That is how one would monitor the situation into the future.  As Ms Graham said, there will be a review process and we will have to look at how the SEA would sit in that context, whether it relates to the changes that are taking place or if there is a need for more overall SEAs.  We will have to give that some thought.</p></speech>

I have in mind the reports we get from the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, on how local government is performing.  Do we have something similar for SEAs for development plans?</p></speech>

However, local authorities, as they come to their new plan, would review where they stand with the previous plan.  At least the previous two plan cycles would have included SEAs and even possibly the previous four, depending on the period.  Certainly, the previous two to three plan cycles would have involved SEAs.  The local authority would look at each one as it comes along and build upon information it has to hand from monitoring and considering the previous plan that is being reviewed as part of the SEA process.</p></speech>

There is a question around whether the applicant is objective in respect of the findings, recommendations, mitigations or whatever it might be arising out of the assessment.  In some European countries, I understand, the assessment is not done by the applicant but is carried out independently by a third party.  Are the witnesses aware of that process?  All member states are governed by the same EU directives but, obviously, local and national laws govern how the directives are applied.</p></speech>

The requirements as to what goes into that are governed by EU directives and set out in schedules in planning law and regulations.  As I understand it, the requirement is the same across Europe but how it is assessed is a different matter.</p></speech>

All of our consent regimes have their own EIA process.  In the case of aquaculture or forestry, for example, it is incorporated there.  That is the choice we have made.</p></speech>

I do not have the directive in front of me.  We are happy that the system we are putting in place is compliant with the directive.

I apologise for the delayed start to the meeting.  Today is particularly busy in Leinster House, as the witnesses are aware, and a number of votes are taking place.  We were a little delayed getting back to the committee room to start proceedings.  Apologies have been received from Senator Martin and Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Alan Farrell.  On behalf of the committee, I send condolences to Deputy Farrell on the death of his father on Saturday.</p> <p>  I remind members, and inform the witnesses who are not familiar with proceedings, to mute their mobile phones or, ideally, to place them in aeroplane mode.  This is because they can interfere with the recording even if they do not appear to do so at the time.  It can play up afterwards in the context of the sound system.  I ask people to be aware of this.  Some members are joining us online.  They are very welcome.  I ask them to mute their microphones when they are not speaking and to remember to unmute when they are speaking to ensure that the proceedings flow smoothly.</p> <p>  I look forward to what I think is going to be a very interesting discussion.  The topic is an examination of the current approach to sanctions for the possession of certain amount of drugs for personal use.  It is a little bit of a long-winded way to say decriminalisation.  We are examining whether the current approach of sanctions, including legal sanctions, work appropriately or should other methods or approaches be considered.</p> <p>  I welcome Dr. Garrett McGovern, medical director of the Priority Medical Clinic in Dundrum.  From the Cannabis Risk Alliance, I welcome Professor Bobby Smyth and Dr. Hugh Gallagher, who is a specialist in addiction medicine.  From Patients for Safe Access, I welcome Mr. Kenny Tynan, executive director, and Mr. Martin Condon, director.  From Crainn, I welcome Mr. Brendan Minish, who is a board member.  Mr. Minish is joining us online.  I am delighted to have an international guest at today's meeting.  I welcome Dr. Nuno Capaz, who is the director of the Portuguese Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction.  I look forward to the benefit of his experience.  It will be particular interesting to see what is done elsewhere.  It is often good practice to look abroad and see what has worked or not worked elsewhere.</p> <p>  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.  If this occurs, it is imperative that they comply with the direction.  For those witnesses participating remotely the same advice applies, with the added caveat that even though we have had hybrid meetings for some time it is as yet untested what degree of privilege extends across an Internet connection.  As I often say, it is good manners not to disparage people who are not present and cannot reply.</p> <p>  The way we operate meetings is to invite a short opening statement from each organisation that comes before us.  We have set this at three minutes per organisation.  This might seem short, but there will be ample time over the course of the meeting to come back in several times.  After each organisation has had its three minute slot to make opening remarks, set the scene and give an idea of where it is coming from, we go to members in the order in which they have indicated.  The members generally have a seven minute slot which they can use for a monologue or for rapid fire questions and answers.  It is up to each member how they choose to use their time.  After seven minutes I will move on to the next member so that everybody gets to speak.  Generally, we find this conducive to good debate.  If organisations or groups are not asked a question I may invite their representatives to come in if they have not spoken as the debate goes on.  I hope this is all clear.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Minish to make his opening statement on behalf of Crainn.  I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p></speech>

We at Crainn have been working as advocates for policy reform, harm reduction and the safe regulation of cannabis for almost a year through various online outlets.  We have run a number of campaigns online and in person and we work hard to make the case for drug policy reform to the public and legislators.</p> <p>  Irish drug policy has failed society and the vulnerable people it was supposed to protect.  For many years, our drug death rates have been among the highest in Europe, at three times the EU average.  Hundreds of people in Ireland die every year due to our current approach to drug policy.  Addiction and substance abuse are health issues and not criminal ones.  Current policy is outdated and clearly does not recognise this fact.  A functioning drug policy is one that works towards reducing the harms of drugs.  This is possible and it has been done before.</p> <p>  Ireland has much to learn from jurisdictions such as Portugal, Switzerland, Malta, Vancouver and many more.  However, we should not copy and paste one programme and expect it to work here.  We must come up with our own plan, inspired and influenced by other policies and the latest data.  In our submission to the committee, we outline a number of recommendations, taking into consideration what has worked in other areas, what has not worked in other areas and what we hear from those who consume drugs and support services.</p> <p>  We propose that Ireland needs a clear, cohesive multi-year plan that outlines exactly how we are going to reduce drug-related harms.</p><p>We need to know where we are going to allocate funds, not only to services but to education as well.  Relevant Ministers should show steadfast dedication in diverting the direction of drug policy, not least by meeting with foreign partners and putting together a working policy and updating it in order to ensure it meets current needs.  Our future drug policy should also be centralised around a set of core pillars, similar to what is being done in Vancouver and Switzerland.  Harm reduction must be central to these pillars.</p><p> We also propose a rethinking of how we treat cannabis possession in Ireland.  Not only does personal possession of this drug account for the majority of drug-related court cases, costing the State much in funds and also ruining future opportunities for many people, but we have also seen alarming trends in counterfeit cannabis that has extreme adverse health impacts.  Regulation is absolutely necessary.</p><p> We need engagement across the country that will target areas hit by addiction while being flexible enough to adapt to emerging drug trends.  We see services in other countries, such as mobile overdose prevention clinics in Portugal, that can access areas in which infrastructure is not yet established.  Pragmatic solutions like this are necessary in Ireland.  Without a coherent, compassionate and health-led plan involving all stakeholders, Ireland will fail to make any progress in tackling drug-related harms to society and users.</p><p> We acknowledge in our submission the different kinds of drug use and how policy should approach them.  We can tackle the alarmingly high rates of addiction in this country.  It has been done elsewhere, but we cannot do it without a plan.  Our submission provides overviews and analyses of Ireland and the wider world, offers some concrete solutions and raises issues often not covered by the mainstream focus.  We hope the committee will consider what we have contributed with due care and will continue to engage with stakeholders on the ground in Ireland and across the world.</p></speech>

I have worked as a doctor in addiction treatment for almost 25 years.  In many ways, I started at the deep end in treating heroin addiction.  This was at a time when the methadone treatment protocol was implemented, which helped people address their addiction.  What struck me in those days was that almost all the people I encountered were in the criminal justice system for possession of drugs charges, many of them over many years.  Looking back to those early naive days as a doctor cutting his teeth in an area where there was little or no training, I would be lying if I said I thought anything of it at the time.  I did not.  I just accepted it.  People committed the crime and people did the time.<br/><br/>As the years progressed and I became more experienced and picked up qualifications through training, it began to dawn on me that I was treating a recognised illness, drug addiction, and yet the patients I was treating had to break the law to keep that addiction going.  Thankfully, opioid substitution treatment, with a stellar international evidence base of effectiveness, is able to treat the problem and remove opioid withdrawal symptoms and craving so the need to use large amounts of heroin is significantly reduced.  Without treatment, the problem is usually overwhelming and causes huge harm to sufferers, their families and their communities.  Why, in these circumstances, do we criminalise the very same people for showing symptoms of their disease?<br/><br/>I also encounter people in my work who do not have an addiction as such but who may have been referred to me or been required as part of a court order to seek help for possession of what are usually small amounts of cannabis, cocaine or sometimes other drugs.  They are irregular users but because of the illegality of the drugs they use, they find themselves facing conviction and a criminal record for an endeavour they would see as no more abnormal than going out to have a few drinks with their friends.  The implications of a criminal conviction can be severe.  Stigma, shame and potential restrictions on travelling abroad are real concerns.  To put one person through the criminal justice system for simple possession is costly in human and financial terms and yet the international evidence base shows it has little or no effect on the likelihood of that person using drugs again.<br/><br/>We need a fresh approach to this problem and one rooted in evidence rather than moral ideology.  We know from the experience in Portugal, where drugs were decriminalised in 2001 and a health-led system replaced a punitive one, that the country reversed its trends in overdose and HIV transmission prevalence.  Presenting for treatment for an addiction problem was no longer stigmatising.  It was normal.  While Ireland currently has no plans to regulate illicit drugs, it is worth noting that in countries that have taken this approach, with cannabis, for example, the sky has not fallen in.  In Ireland, people who use cannabis, many now for medical as well as recreational reasons, are criminalised for possession for personal use.  Many have had to go abroad to be able to access cannabis for chronic medical conditions.  This is inhumane and just plain wrong.<br/><br/>During the presentation of these statements, the committee will doubtlessly hear about how harmful cannabis is, that the drug causes psychosis and other mental health problems and that people who use it should be prosecuted and criminalised because that will be better for them.  I treat cannabis problems, and while the majority of cannabis users use the drug without many problems, a significant minority develop consequences of addiction, including mental health problems.  We must remember these problems are occurring in a paradigm of prohibition and criminalisation, so none of them can be blamed on a legalised, regulated system.  We do not have one in Ireland.<br/><br/>Whatever views people may have on legalising cannabis, there is no justification for criminalising people who use the drug.  I urge the committee not to be swayed by arguments contending that criminalising people is good for them because it acts as a deterrent for further drug use.  There is no evidence internationally that this is the case.  As Abraham Lincoln once said:</p> <blockquote> 	Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes.  A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded. </blockquote> <p>Many years later, another US President, Jimmy Carter, remarked - and this is particularly relevant to today&rsquo;s debate - &ldquo;penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself&rdquo;.  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

The Cannabis Risk Alliance, CRA, constitutes an informal group of doctors from a wide range of specialties who are concerned about the substantial increase in cannabis-related harms evident in Ireland over the past decade.  We have no funding and no employees.  I am a child and adolescent psychiatrist working in this area and my colleague, Dr. Hugh Gallagher, is a GP specialising in addiction medicine.  As doctors, we strongly support a health-led approach to cannabis and wider drug policy.  Laws and sanctions are used across many areas of public health to nudge the behaviour of citizens away from risky behaviours and towards healthier ones.  We recognise that the criminal justice system often plays a role in achieving positive outcomes in areas of public health, including in efforts undertaken to curtail mortality and injury related to road traffic collisions and, most recently, during the Covid-19 pandemic.  In our view, criminal justice and health are not opponents.  Consequently, there is no inherent contradiction in there being criminal justice input into our health-led drug policy.</p> <p>  There is evidence from Irish and international research that young people factor the risks of criminal justice sanctions into their decisions regarding drug use.  In an Irish study of third level students published this year, almost half of those who reported abstinence cited such concerns about criminal sanctions as being one of the many reasons behind their personal decision not to use drugs.  The public health risk arising from a reduction in sanctions is that we reduce the deterrent effect provided by the current system.  We believe there is a real risk that a reduction in sanctions could cause use and associated health harms to escalate.  The weight of evidence from national and international research indicates that sanctions have a small but important effect.  Please bear in mind that small effects across large populations are clinically important.</p> <p>  The Department of Health working group on this topic recommended in its 2019 report that there should be a tiered response when people are found to be in possession of drugs by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, commencing with a health referral.  When this topic is discussed in any forum, Portugal is usually brought up for mention as a model.  However, Portuguese drug policies are generally poorly understood.  Contrary to what most people believe, drug use is still prohibited in Portugal.  In 2001, Portugal moved to use administrative responses when people are found in possession of drugs for personal use.  What gets ignored are the profound changes that were made to the country's addiction treatment system in the two to three years prior to that change.  A move was made from a treatment model which demanded abstinence to one focused on harm reduction and that sought to provide wrap-around social supports to people in addiction treatment.</p><p>Across this range of policy changes, which included the modification of the treatment model, there were improvements in a number of measures relating to drug-related harm.  However, not all trends have been good in Portugal.  Adolescent cannabis use has approximately doubled.  Portugal now has the second highest prevalence of daily cannabis use among adults in Europe according to a recent report.  Rates of psychiatric admissions due to psychosis associated with cannabis increased almost thirtyfold and rates of treatment entry for cannabis dependence compare unfavourably with those here in Ireland.</p><p> When drug policy is discussed in Ireland, we tend to completely overlook our own successes.  Like Portugal and most of Europe, we altered our treatment response in the mid- to late 1990s.  This yielded a 95% decline in adolescent heroin addiction and huge falls in cases of HIV and hepatitis C among people who inject drugs.  Those falls have been of the order of 75% to 90% over the past 20 years.  My adolescent addiction service actually shut down the specialist heroin treatment service four years ago because it was no longer needed.  These notable achievements have occurred without any significant legislative change.</p><p> As doctors concerned about drug-related harm, which, of course, includes harm to others, we recognise that the criminal justice system can have a role in deterring drug use.  We see it used frequently in other areas of public health.  There is a significant risk in reducing this deterrent effect.  In the absence of any concrete specific proposed alternative, however, it is difficult to give a firm opinion as to whether we should move to an alternative regime of administrative sanctions.  A lesser sanction that is more consistently enforced could, in theory, have a similar deterrent effect.  With regard to the sanctions currently available to the courts, we view the option of imprisonment for personal drug use to be excessive and unreasonable.</p></speech>

I am here today as one of the directors of Patients for Safe Access.  We are a group made up of patients and cannabis experts.  We are dedicated to ensuring safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic use, research, protecting the rights of medical cannabis patients and ensuring that patients and medical professionals have access to up-to-date scientific evidence.</p> <p>  I am also here as an epilepsy patient who has no other choice but to rely on the black market to access cannabis to treat my condition. This is solely due to an overly restrictive medicinal cannabis access programme, MCAP, leaving me with no option in treating my condition.  Due to this, I am labelled a criminal by our society and our justice system.  I have a number of criminal convictions for my continued use of cannabis.  As a result, I was denied a travel visa to travel to the US where I would have had the opportunity to represent Cork Institute of Technology as part of the students for sensible drug policy society.  While there, I was to take part in the 2016 United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs, which was taking place in New York city.  I was robbed of this opportunity to learn and grow as a campaigner and to network with world leaders on this issue of drug use.  I wish I could say that this was the worst thing that happened to me as a result of cannabis prohibition but it was not.  I was unfortunate enough to get an all-expenses-paid stay at the five-star Cork prison at a time when prisoners still had to relieve themselves in a pot in their cells.  They would then have to empty those pots the next morning when the cell doors were opened.  I had to lie to my daughter, who was only five years old when this happened, about where I was because at that time she knew prison as a place for bad people.</p> <p>  When cannabis was made illegal in Ireland, this was done with good intentions.  The latter were much like the good intentions of those who also made condoms illegal and prohibited same-sex relationships.  Much has changed since then.  Condoms are available throughout society and same-sex relationships are no longer prohibited.  We see now that these prohibitions were wrong.  They caused much more harm in society and needlessly made criminals out of people who otherwise would have never committed a crime.  They say one of the reasons cannabis is illegal is due to its affect on a person's mental health.  With that in mind, I ask the committee to consider what affect taking a father away from his young family is going to have, not only on that individual but also on his loved ones and friends.  I also ask whether the harms  of carrying a criminal conviction and of having been incarcerated outweigh the harms of cannabis.</p> <p>  When brought before the courts, I could never apologise for my use of cannabis because my use of cannabis was beneficial to me.  By speaking on my own behalf in court while representing myself for personal possession of cannabis, I hoped that the judge would see I was not a criminal.  Sadly, that did not prove to be the case.  I wish this was an isolated incident but it was not.  We have seen many cases in Ireland where patients are criminalised for self-medicating with cannabis.  In one case in West Cork, a patient suffering with chronic pain was criminalised for being in possession of &euro;4 worth of cannabis.  This man had his name and address printed in the media, which added more undue stress to his life.  What happened did not just impact on his life, it also had an impact on the lives of his family and friends.  We have patients who feared being criminalised but could not go without access to cannabis to treat their condition, forced to pack their bags and leave our shores to become medical cannabis refugees in other countries.</p> <p>  I have listed a number of patients in my statement, but I will shorten it because I am aware that I am out of time.  Alicia Maher, who is also another director of Patients for Safe Access, suffers with long-term chronic pain as a result of complications from a series of surgeries she had as a teenager.  Alicia said cannabis has helped when other pain medications were failing.  She had to pack her bags and leave our shores and, as a result, is another of Ireland's medical cannabis refugees.  Alicia left Ireland in November 2019 and moved to Alicante, Spain.  She received a ministerial licence in May 2020 but because the medicine would not be reimbursed under the medicinal cannabis access programme, she had to stay in Spain.  Also, the products available under the MCAP were not sufficient to treat her condition.</p> <p>  There is no reason to criminalise people using or growing cannabis to treat their conditions, and there is certainly no reason to prevent access to cannabis for research and medical use.  Cannabis needs to be removed from the misuse of drugs Act and regulated in a similar way to alcohol and tobacco.  Patients who need cannabis for health reasons should be given access to cannabis in a safe, quality assured way in the same manner in which they have access to other prescribed medicines.  I will finish with a quote from our now Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly: "If a grown adult wants to grow a herb and then smoke it, and there are no negative consequences for other people, then they should be allowed to do that."</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for hearing us on this important issue.  We hope our contributions here today will help in some way to further break down the barriers preventing access to cannabis as a medicine and the needless criminalisation of people in Ireland.</p></speech>

The Dissuasion Commissions are the administrative authorities that were created in 2001 to deal with the procedures regarding the possession of illicit substances for personal usage.  In 2001, Portugal decriminalised the possession of illicit substances for personal usage as a part of very comprehensive change in our drug policy.  The basic goal was to deal with drug-related issues as a healthcare problem and steer away from the criminal and judicial system.  The drug policy change was based on the four-pillar approach and the Dissuasion Commissions were the law enforcement pillar.</p> <p>  Decriminalising drug usage for us meant we downgraded the possession of up to ten days&rsquo; use from a criminal offence to an administrative offence.  In our legal framework nowadays being caught with a small amount of any illicit substance is very similar to being caught driving without the seat belt on or talking on the mobile phone while driving.  It is illegal but is not considered a criminal offence and therefore there is no need to activate the criminal or judicial system.  The Dissuasion Commissions were created under the ministry of health and they work as a diversion scheme.  When a drug user is caught in possession of illicit substances for personal usage, he is notified to present himself in a structure under the remit of the Ministry of Health, which, after conducting a risk assessment screening, will determine if there will be any administrative sanctions applied or if any sort of suggestion of referral will be made.</p></speech>

As somebody who works in the criminal justice system, primarily as a criminal defence barrister, I come across people in different categories in regard to drugs offences.  Obviously, we are talking about people in a particular category, namely, possession for personal use.  I am extremely alive to what has been said about the criminalisation of individuals who make a personal choice, be that for their own personal enjoyment of for the reasons that have been outlined by Patients for Safe Access either.  I understand entirely what has been said in that regard.</p><p>We are losing the war on drugs.  Not only that, it has become a war of attrition.  If we think about the amount of money we spend fighting the kind of cases the witnesses are talking about and what could be done with that money, even if never left the criminal justice system and was reinvested in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular in diversion programmes or programmes to deal with crime in other areas outside of drugs, we would do a huge service to the country.<br/><br/>That said, it is not that simple.  One of the major problems I have with a policy that involves blanket decriminalisation of cannabis or a larger spectrum of drugs is that at the moment they are bound up with criminal organisations.  There is an inextricable link between the organised crime that is providing the drugs and the drugs themselves.  It is not the case that when a patient, for legitimate reasons, decides to obtain drugs that there are not victims as a result of that.  That is the difficulty I have.<br/><br/>Other people will make the argument about the slippery slope and all of the rest.  Leaving that aside, can the witnesses tell us how the logistics of this would work?  Let us consider what would happen if we said in the morning that cannabis for personal use is okay.  Who would provide it thereafter?  Who would profit from that?  We could put a place a regulatory regime; I would have no difficulty with that.  More importantly, what we do to prevent a situation where the country becomes a <i>de facto</i>source for the international trafficking of drugs?</p></speech>

Malta has a very good model whereby it allows a co-operative type model to be set up.  A local community can come together and grow cannabis for people in the community who need it.  That takes the money out of organised crime groups.  There will be very little market left over once patients such as myself no longer have to rely on them.</p></speech>

I do not think anybody is suggesting that cannabis or any other drugs are good for people.  The argument is that the consequences of cannabis use are worse for people than the damage the drug does to society or individuals.  Do we really want to promote a situation whereby the State is sponsoring the distribution of a substance we know is not good for people?  I am sure the witnesses could give me a list of other products that are equally damaging.  Alcohol is the obvious example.  Even products containing sugar can be dangerous.</p></speech>

The debate today is about decriminalisation.  We are not talking about legalisation.  I would be in favour of looking at the regulation of all drugs.  It is not going to happen in my lifetime.  It will happen at some stage, but I do not know when.  I take the Senator's point.</p> <p>  There is a suggestion from what he is saying that in order to have one thing we have to have the other.  I do not think that is the case.  There were almost 16,000 convictions relating to drugs last year.  Some 69% of the total number related to personal possession, as well as the distribution and sale of drugs.  We have to ask, for what?  It does not stop people in possession of drugs from using them.  There is no evidence anywhere that having criminal sanctions stops people using drugs or reduces their prevalence.  We need to separate the two issues.  They are, of course, related, but in 2022 there are no grounds whatsoever to criminalise people who use drugs for their own personal enjoyment or develop problems.  That is, arguably, even worse.</p></speech>

As Dr. McGovern said, they are related.  If we decide to decriminalise the personal use of cannabis, for example, the reality is that people who are using it for personal reasons will obtain it from people who grow it in contravention of the law, operate outside of the law and are, invariably, but not exclusively, involved in illegal organised criminalised activity.  This is the one difficulty I have.  Are we not, therefore, creating a market for criminal gangs to sell their product?  Is that not an unintended or unfortunate consequence of the policy of decriminalisation?</p></speech>

Whether illegal or legal and regulated, people will still use drugs.  The debate here has been a little dominated by cannabis, but we cannot forget other drugs.  Drug problems and use is not just down to regulation; there is a whole cultural and socioeconomic aspect to this, which includes social marginalisation and deprivation.  It is a complicated issue.  I do not think for one minute that if the issue we are discussing was addressed tomorrow that would solve all of our problems.  However, it would go some way to show that we are serious about a heath led approach to drug use.</p></speech>

The suggestion we have made around cannabis is that small-scale personal production of plant-based drugs should be tolerated.  In a decriminalised world, if we are not moving towards a legal regulated market, the model could allow the establishment of social clubs like what has happened in Spain.  While there is some criminality hanging around that, the State should be most concerned with the most violent and organised crime.  We have to realise that we have created and handed criminals the entire market it by keeping the substances illegal.  It will take time to replace that with something else.  Right now, punishing users is a wrong way to go after organised crime.  We should be working in a top down, rather than a bottom up, manner.  At the moment, a lot of criminal cases are simple possession cases which is a travesty.</p></speech>

In our submission we used the term "plant-based drugs" because this is about decriminalising the personal possession of drugs and there are other plant based drugs that people are consuming.  We want, where possible, for people to come out of the black market because it is causing a great deal of harm to society, more so, in many cases, than the substances themselves.</p></speech>

Some people use opiates and might wish to grow poppies and make tea.  I do not know.  My point is that it something is derived from a plant it seems slightly at odds to keep it illegal if we are allowing personal possession.  We are not dealing with the source.  We want to try to connect people with the source without the criminal element.  If people can produce drugs themselves individually or as a collective, that allows them to step out of the wider criminality that has taken over all of the markets.</p></speech>

I can see that cannabis herb and mushrooms are plant based.  Opiates are plant-based, but they are processed.  Where would you draw a line in terms of that distinction?  Are you referring to things which can be sourced in a relatively pure form, as opposed to things that have a chemical element or are processed?</p></speech>

Historically, people boiled poppy heads to produce weak opium teas and so on.  They might be less harmful forms of the substance than injectable forms and might help people find some sort of middle ground.  Again, our area of expertise is cannabis and that is what we spent most of our time looking at.</p></speech>

Although I agree with most of them, we are definitely on different sides of the debate and have been for a long time.  I want to recognise their contributions.  They are in a minority today.  I will try to be kind.</p> <p>  I do not misunderstand, in any shape or form, the Portuguese model or many other models.  However, I have concerns about some of the submission relating to the Portuguese model.</p><p>Rather than using up my time by going through the submission word by word, it might be more beneficial for me to engage directly with the witnesses at another stage about how particular research pieces are not in context, as I would understand or read it.  It would probably be too pedantic for me to do so in this session today.</p><p> I will give an example of what I am talking about.  When drug policy is discussed in Ireland, we tend to completely overlook our own successes and then we talk about opioids and the reduction in heroin use.  That is not because of legislation.  It is also wrapped up in drug trends and how drug use evolves and changes when different drugs come on the market and certain drugs become much more prevalent.  I do not think there is a relationship, in any sense or form, between the two.</p><p> Many people of the late 1980s and 1990s who were my friends and community are dead.  We talk about the success of heroin use changing but many people are dead, in prison or sitting at home at the age of 40, 50 or 60 because they cannot engage in employment.  It is not Ireland's success because those people are still there.  We do not have enough information about its being a success because they are not hindered by the convictions that they would have had been handed down while they were drug users.  Some of that stuff, which is not really related to prohibition working in any sense or form, or to harm reduction fully working, needs to be teased out.  I am uncomfortable with some references to success.  I do not know if we would frame a reduction in heroin as a success, because people whose lives were affected are still very much struggling. </p><p> We need to be careful on the committee, because there are three conversations going and I am sure it is quite confusing.  We are discussing the ideas of medicinal cannabis, legalisation and decriminalisation.  We also have another conversation, on which we all agree, in that sometimes problematic drug use is harmful.  I was a problematic drug user.  I frame myself as a drug user now, not a problem drug user.  I have developed drug services and now I work in the legislative framework.  I have had many journeys through this discussion.  I am very aware that there are three or four conversations happening now that are probably a bit confusing.  We might need to have further committees to separate those conversations out.  I do not think anyone disagrees that we need to have people working with problem drug use.  We just do not feel that they need to be in a courthouse or in prison.</p><p> I have a question for Dr. Capaz.  I do not know whether it is because of language, but people seem to be much more open when we talk about diversion.  When we mention decriminalisation, however, people seem to feel that somebody is getting off with something or that the justice system will disappear.  Is there a difference between a dissuasion service and decriminalisation?  Are they effectively the same?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.439" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nuno Capaz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#G00200"><p>In our case, they are the same.  The dissuasion commission is the administrative authority that we created because it is still illegal to have any illicit substance in one's possession in Portugal.  Therefore, there are consequences.  A procedure is opened when the police officer apprehends someone with a substance.  The difference is that it is not a criminal procedure.  It is an administrative offence procedure.  People are referred to dissuasion commissions.  That is the sense in which I have mentioned the diversion scheme.  Instead of sending people to court, we are sending them to a structure under the ministry of health.</p></speech>

I would like to clarify Professor Smyth's statement in his contribution that "drug use is still prohibited in Portugal".  I can be corrected on my understanding here.  Maybe Professor Smyth is right.  Drugs possession is not prohibited.  The substance is prohibited.  Is that not the differentiation between the two?  The substance is prohibited and is still illegal, but the possession of it for personal use is not, which means that drug use falls into the non-criminal category as long as it is within the prescribed ten-day amount.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nuno Capaz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#G00400"><p>Possession is also forbidden; it is just not criminalised.  No criminal sanctions will be applied to a person if it is possession for personal usage, but there are sanctions.  The list of sanctions is exactly the same as a driving offence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#G00500"><p>Great.  Portugal has had its model for 20 years.  If that model was to be revisited now, 20 years on, as part of an examination of what Portugal has or has not done or what it could do better, would Dr. Capaz have any updated references to how it would do decriminalisation now?  If it was looking at it again, what would it do?  Twenty years is a long time for the framework to be in place.</p></speech>

We put cannabis on the list of all the other illicit substances because, back then, the only condition that the government put on the group of experts that looked into the drug policy change that we were going for was that we should be inside the UN conventions that we signed.  Therefore, there was no talk about regulating cannabis.  Twenty years afterwards, that argument would be slightly different, not least because some countries decided not to follow the UN conventions and it was not a big deal.</p></speech>

It did not solve the problem, but it helped to manage it.  The question about drug policy and criminalisation is that criminalising a substance is based on the principle that the problem is the substance.  The substance is the chemical thing.  Addiction is not the chemical thing.  It is as simple as that.  Therefore, there is no point in criminalising a chemical substance, because it will not stop people from using it.</p></speech>

I have seen people criminalised or even brought to court.  One does not necessarily even have to have a conviction.  If one is going to the United States, the question on the form was always about whether one was ever charged with an offence, rather than whether one ended up with a conviction.  It led to loss of opportunity with regard to emigration and employment, consequences that were far in excess of what was done by a young man, usually, who was taking a substance and doing no harm no anybody else apart from himself.</p> <p>  Some changes were made over the years.  The adult caution system came in.  Close to the last minute, the possession of cannabis was removed from the list.  A local garda superintendent who was dealing with one of a group of lads who might have taken responsibility for some cannabis that was in between the seats of a car, even though he might not have had any more responsibility than anybody else, might have felt that it was a once-off.  However, there was no discretion, even for a local superintendent in a rural area, not to charge that person.  There is a lot of fundamental unfairness in that system.  At the same time, one sees people who are taking cocaine, in particular.  They are enriching the Kinahans by buying cocaine.  That has considerable consequences if one is balancing up the common good of society in general.</p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Capaz.  I am trying to figure out how the system works over there.  Who decides whether it constitutes possession or supply?  Does the tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, content come into it?  There has been concern over the past 20 years that THC levels have risen and that more harm is being done to young men whose brains are still physically developing into their 20s.  The concern is that they are, in effect, getting brain damage.</p><p> I also have a question for Mr. Condon and Mr. Tynan about their proposals.  It has been suggested that small amounts should be decriminalised, as opposed to the stuff coming into the market in larger amounts.  Do they think all drugs should be decriminalised?  At what level do they think it should become a criminal offence?  Those are my two questions.</p></speech>

We have a chart that quantifies what a personal dose is for every substance.  Then we multiply this by ten and if a person has more than that, it might be considered a criminal offence and they will be referred to a court of law.  If a person is below that limit, they will be sent to the dissuasion commission as an administrative offence.  The police officers also have to cross-check with other indicators such as if there is any surveillance material, if it is a trafficking situation, if the substance is divided into individual doses or if the person also has a lot of money in their possession.  The threshold chart determines where the police send the paperwork in the beginning and then either the courts or the dissuasion commission determines, after talking to the person, if it a personal use situation or a supply situation.  If it is a supply situation, it is always a criminal offence regardless of the amount of substance.  If it is a supply situation, the court keeps in mind the active principle contained in the substance to determine and fine-tune the individual doses of that substance and it can refer the procedure to us even though the person had more than ten days' usage.  The threshold chart is basically there to remove the discretionary power from the police officer on the street.</p></speech>

When it comes to how much cannabis a patient should be allowed, that should be decided between the patient and their doctor.  It is common practice that a patient would normally have a month's worth of their prescription on hand in order to do whatever it is that needs to get done within that month.</p> <p>  We were talking about wider adult use of cannabis.  I do not see why there is a need for arbitrary limits, which is what they are at the end of the day - just arbitrary limits.  When it comes to things like alcohol and tobacco in society, if a person goes down to the shop, they can buy as much alcohol or tobacco as they like.  It is not until we see that there is an intention there, or that they are breaking a law in terms of illegally selling that afterwards, that they become a target of the authorities.  Cannabis should be treated differently.  A person should be allowed to have as much cannabis as they would like to have at home, and as many cannabis plants as they would like to have at home.  The onus should be on the authorities to prove lawbreaking.  Simply having a huge amount of cannabis is not proof they were going to sell it afterwards and thus break the law.  When we talk about other drugs, personally I have no problem with the wider decriminalisation of all drugs.  I am not talking for Patients for Safe Access when I say that.  Arbitrary limits are only going to put pressure on people on the street.  They will not do much to tackle the problem of drug dealing.  We need a proper and safe supply of drugs to people who use drugs.  In such circumstances, the worry of drug dealers will go away.  If you can get safe access to your drug of choice through whatever regulated means that may be, you do not have to support drug dealers afterwards.  There should not be arbitrary limits on the amount in your possession.  The focus should be on the point of supply and the safety of that supply of the drug as well.</p></speech>

I have a couple of small points to make because some of my questions have already been asked.  It seems to me that the old adage about the war on drugs not working is very true.  That war has generally been on the supply side.  We have always been trying to stop supply, find the people who are supplying it, find the dealers and cut them out.  We need to look more at the demand side - why society continues to have a demand for all of these substances - and deal with that.  This means looking at it more from a medical and addiction perspective.  That is what the general consensus is around the table.  That said, the big anomaly that always comes up seems to be when the person who is in possession of drugs for their own use is also the same person who has possession of drugs to supply.  That is an issue.  That crossover will happen, particularly when we have people who unfortunately have an addiction problem and in order to pay for that problem are going to sell drugs to others who have an addiction problem.  What methodology is in place, particularly in Portugal, to deal with that particular issue?  Is it that the supply of the drugs is coming from a different source which is not the illegal source but one that is regulated and is in place and provided for through some mechanism of the State or with the sanction of the State?  I would like to get clarity around that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nuno Capaz" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#H01500"><p>We do not have any sort of safe supply of any illicit drugs.  We just decriminalised the possession.  We did not mess in any way with the supply side of the chain.  If people want to use illicit drugs, they still have to go to the black market.  As to the usage and supply situations, normally what happens is that this is very complicated to prove in court because very tiny amounts of substance and of money are involved.  Therefore there is no proof to be collected by the police officers.  We also noticed from daily practice in Portugal that those situations normally go away if the usage part is dealt with.  If we can get a user who is also supplying into a treatment programme, they will automatically stop supplying because they will not need money to support their own supply.  What happens is that the court knows it will not be able to convict a person because the user's supply is basically a friendship thing.  It is someone who lives outside the big cities but has a car and so is able to drive to the main city to buy substance and take it back to his own town for a couple of friends.  It is not really supply.  It is basically the same thing as someone buying a little bit of cannabis and sharing it with a couple of friends.  Is that supply?  Theoretically and under the law, it is supply.  They are handing out a substance for another person to use but are not getting rich out of it so it is not a dealing situation as we normally perceive it in court.  The answer to the question is "No".  We do not have safe supply in Portugal.</p></speech>

Everyone has different reasons, backgrounds and motivations to use a drug although the drug might be the same.</p><p>The reason that this change in policy worked for us was because we decided to change it from the criminal system to the healthcare system.  Naturally, that means the criminal system focuses on the substance, the drug, and the healthcare system focuses on the person, not the substance, and therefore we are able to apply the law differently to everyone.  It is the small supply or the user's supply.  Every case is the case.  There is not going to be a rule that will solve everyone's problem.  Dealing with it as a healthcare issue allows us at least to assess the situation by itself and according to the person.</p></speech>

That is useful.  I would like to hear the views of the other contributors on that issue.  As has been said, we use a lot of other drugs in our society all the time.  Tobacco has been mentioned.  Alcohol probably causes more harm in Irish society than most things because we have huge issues with it.  However, we regulate it.  We know the strength of the bottle of whiskey or the can of beer.  There is a regulated system in place which ensures that people are not going to be poisoned, although many would say that any of it is poison.  Is there a value in having a regulatory process in place?  What are our guests' views on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Bobby Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#J00300"><p>My response to that would refer back to alcohol.  We regulate alcohol and the quantity of alcohol is stated on the bottle.  The Deputy appears to be questioning whether we could do the same for drugs as if that system is working or is associated with low rates of harm.  Alcohol kills more people each year than all illegal drugs combined.  In the national drug-related deaths index and the drug poisoning data, the substance that tops the list in those deaths is alcohol.  That should remind us that simply legalising and regulating access to a substance certainly does not eliminate harms.  It suggests to me that one does not even reduce them and may actually increase them.  As one normalises the behaviour one massively increases the pool of the population who use that substance, as is the case with alcohol.  Some 80% of Irish adults use alcohol whereas only 8% in any given year will use any of the illegal substances.</p> <p>  The Deputy used the term "war on drugs".  That is an unfair characterisation of Ireland's drug policy over the last couple of decades.  Drug policy is now led by the Department of Health.  To say it is waging a war on drugs is unfair.  It is a reference that people who support drug legalisation regularly use.  It is a smear on European drug policy and relates, obviously, to the policies adopted in the United States half a century ago.  It is not really relevant to the modern discourse, which is health-led.</p></speech>

The drug use in higher education in Ireland, DUHEI, study that he cited in his introduction that showed some deterrent effect also showed that over half of our third level students have used drugs, and 37% within the last year.  I believe the figure of 8% is an old figure.  This follows more of a European trend and what we need to do is regulate around the harms.  There must be safe supply and we need to cross this bridge, particularly with some of the more addictive substances.  It will be a difficult conversation, but we had safe supply back in history when these compounds were supplied through pharmacies.</p></speech>

Obviously the sector of the population most likely to report drug use in the past year is adults and older teenagers.  Hence the figure in the third level survey that was quoted is higher than the proportion-----</p></speech>

If we were to remove prohibition, we would see an increase in the figure because people will not feel they need to lie because they feel like criminals.  Half of the Members of the Houses probably use drugs, but they are not going to say it.</p></speech>

I see people shaking their heads.  That is part of the process here.  We have a debate and people express their opinions.  They are entitled to do so.  Other people may have different opinions and are equally entitled to express them.  Deputy Costello has the floor.</p></speech>

On Deputy Martin Kenny's point about demand reduction, yes we had partial successes perhaps in the mid to late 1990s, as Senator Ruane mentioned, but much of that was driven by the Rabbitte report and by a concentrated effort to reduce demand for drugs.  That involved a great deal of investment in communities and community development and tackling poverty, with the Combat Poverty Agency and the like.  All these things have since fallen away.  There are incredibly important things we should be doing.  However, they are separate from the question of criminalisation.  Demand reduction is essential and I would like to hear what Portugal is doing about that, but we will come back to that piece.</p> <p>  The question is whether criminalisation is causing more harm or whether it is causing a benefit.  One of the things I look at is the huge number of drug deaths in this country compared to other European countries.  We were a lot slower in rolling out naloxone in this country, partly because of the stigma and illegality.  We have talked about the social impacts and the impact of criminalisation on supply for medical use.  I would like to hear from Dr. McGovern and Professor Smyth about the impact of the stigma of criminalisation on things such as naloxone and access to treatment.  I would also like to hear what Portugal is doing about demand reduction.</p> <p>  One of the questions from several members of the committee is one I echo and relates to the alternative supply routes, and if we have some time at the end we could explore that.  Obviously, we do not want to be supporting organised crime.  There are many alternative models.  We have heard about Malta.  I understand Spain has growing collectives and Switzerland allows personal growing.  I would like to give some space to hearing about the alternative supply routes that take the criminal out of it and might introduce a healthy amount of VAT into the State coffers.</p> <p>  Will Dr. McGovern and Professor Smyth speak on the negative impacts of criminalisation in respect of access, treatment, naloxone, overdose and the like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.482" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Garrett McGovern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#J01400"><p>First, the stigma associated with heroin use is far greater than that associated with any other drug I can think of.  It is slowly being matched by crack cocaine, probably, although not so much with powder cocaine.  I work with those people every day, as does Senator Ruane.  Many people were afraid to come for treatment back in the day.  We did not have opiate substitution treatment services and we did not have naloxone until recently.  When talking about stigma, some commentators have called it a form of drug apartheid whereby some drugs are treated differently from others.</p> <p>  I have never known a drug quite like heroin in terms of the way the people who use that drug are talked about by other people, who know very little about the drug and very little about the communities in which those people live.  When I started working in the late 1990s there were people who would not come to the clinic because it was in the neighbourhood in which they lived.  They asked me if there was another way they could see me because they did not want to come through the front door as many of the people who lived close to them did not know they were using that drug.  That is a horrible thing.  One is trying to help somebody with a health problem, yet the person is shying away from treatment.  Looking at the statistics there are probably almost 12,000 people on opiate substitution treatment.  It is climbing a little.  There are probably a lot of people, and I have met them, who would not go to a treatment clinic because of the stigma associated with the labelling of that disease.</p><p>I will not mention it in this room but we know what all that language is.  When we are talking about stigma relating to drug use, we are really talking about stigma relating to specific drugs and that drug is different from other drugs.  I would not say it is a developing problem but crack cocaine is a problem in many marginalised communities now.  We are late to the table with Naloxone.  We could have a whole debate about the way it should be wheeled out.  We should take a very low-threshold approach to Naloxone.  I am against the idea that it is on prescription and is given by a doctor.  I do not think there is any evidence whatsoever that Naloxone is misused.  It should be low-threshold because it can save people's lives.  It can save them immediately. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Bobby Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#K00200"><p>The question was if criminalisation impacts access to treatment.  I fully agree with Dr. McGovern when he said people who use heroine are viewed completely differently, from a stigma perspective, from users of other substances.  There is a clue in that in terms of the relationship between the illegal status of a drug and the stigma associated with it.  All drugs are illegal but people who use cannabis have a very stigmatised attitude towards people who use heroine.  Professor Jamie Saris from Maynooth University conducted research where he interviewed people at all levels within the drug use and supply network and what he found was a remarkable degree of stigma held by drug dealers.  They are clearly involved in an activity you would imagine should carry more stigma than any in the general population but their view of people who used heroine was phenomenally negative.  The stigma tends to be associated with the drug.  That is not to do with its illegal status.  It is to do with the degree of risk other people see associated with that particular behaviour.  There is huge stigma associated with alcohol dependence.  Dr. McGovern talked about people being reluctant to access methadone treatment within their own neighbourhood.  Dr. Gallagher might talk to the issues of alcohol treatment in adults.  People who are alcohol dependent are often reluctant to access treatment in their own area because there is a stigma associated with being addicted and having an addiction.  To say stigma is as simple as being linked solely to just the illegal status of a drug is grossly simplistic.</p> <p>  There is a sense that many people who use drugs are at very high risk of convictions.  I work with and meet hundreds of young people annually who use drugs and who access our service.  I honestly cannot think of the last time I met a young person, under 18 years of age as that is the primary age group I work with, who had a drug possession conviction.  I remember someone worried about it years ago but not in recent years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seems to have a lot of discretion, certainly for those under 18.  At most people get a JLO but generally just a caution.</p></speech>

This is a very worthwhile debate.  I want to go back to the future.  That future is in the mid-1970s, 45 years ago and relates to the Misuse of Drugs Act.  That is where we started.  Obviously that law is still prevalent today.  That law was introduced to do a number of things: to stop the proliferation of drugs and to give people criminal sanction for possession or the sale of that material.  In my opinion, it has done the opposite.  It has enriched a certain number of people in society.  It has created a black market and criminal gangs, and it has brought chaos to certain communities in Ireland.</p> <p>  Given all of that, one would have to ask whether the laws around drugs are working or whether they are working against people.  I say they are working against people.  Senator Lynn Ruane, myself and a few others played a football match in Mountjoy Prison last week.  It was a really educational experience.  I asked the governor how many people were in Mountjoy for drug related offences.  He said more than 80%.  He said 80% of people are in prison for one form or another of drug related issues.  It is obvious the law does not work.  Anyone who says the laws around drugs work is part of the problem.</p> <p>  Given that, we have to do something different.  I argue we need to do something very different.  The HSE and the Government have paid a lot of lip service to a health-led approach.  We are talking about the citizens' assembly next year and that is welcome but this has been talked about for decades.  Decriminalisation and even regulation are not a silver bullet by any means.  Drugs do terrible things to people who do things they would never do.  Drugs do terrible things to communities but drugs are a reality, whether they are illegal or not.  In that vein, I am of the opinion we need to do something completely radical.  We have to do the opposite now.  The more we criminalise people, the more this situation continues.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions to put to Professor Smyth.  Are there any circumstances where he could see a model of regulation being put in place rather than what we have at the moment?  As a medical doctor and a citizen of this country, are there any kind of circumstances that he could see being introduced, as this system does not work?</p></speech>

As I said, it kills more people than all illegal drugs combined.  It does so not because it is intrinsically more harmful or dangerous than heroine or crack cocaine.  It does so largely because its use is normalised and because there is regulated access to it.  We face challenges in terms of our alcohol policy.  We are where we are with alcohol and hence we had the public health alcohol Bill a number of years ago and it has slowly been enacted.  These are small steps in the right direction.  All of these increased restriction.  I would be very loath to move any other substance into that category of regulated sale until I saw our current legal drug regulated more effectively and the harms with it massively reduced.</p></speech>

While we have not got alcohol policy quite right, there is no doubt that if alcohol was made illegal tomorrow, there would be an exponential increase in the harms involved.  We cannot, in a vacuum, look at making alcohol illegal and leave it at that; we would need to compare doing so with what the alternative is.  That is what we are doing in the context of all the other drugs.  The problem is that whenever someone says that legalisation does not work, we cannot point to any examples in this country of a legalised system of currently illicit drugs.  Therefore, you have to ask the question as to what you would do to make the situation better if you are not going to regulate those drugs.  I can only read from this that you would make them more prohibited and make the sanctions greater.  I would like an answer to that because I never get an answer when that question is asked.  We tend to only talk about legalisation.  We have only known a paradigm of prohibition.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that, in the context of the most important metrics, the Portuguese model, while not perfect by any means, has put Portugal in a far better situation than is was in 2001.  Yes, regulation or changing drug policy is only one factor.  They increased the level of help and support that people got and the stigma around seeking help was reduced.  You look, therefore, at increased numbers in isolation.  When the level of stigma goes down, people admit things.  Senator Ruane made the point that people will lie.  They will do so for very good reason.  We can sit here today and continue to do what we are doing, but more and more people will come to harm and die.  That is a fact.  It is irrefutable.</p></speech>

He stated that there was a thirtyfold increase in cannabis psychosis in Portugal.  I know the paper in question.  There are issues about how the data was gathered.  It was gathered in the context of admission data, so it obviously relates to people feeling open.  If you take this paper at worst possible value and treat all the numbers with respect, it implies that approximately five in 100,000 cannabis users - or one in 20,000 - will develop psychosis.  In terms of deterrents, we have arrested for possession on average about 16,000 people a year.  Assuming that they all reform themselves and never use cannabis again, we are preventing less than one case of cannabis psychosis a year through our use of the justice system.  That seems a very unfortunate way to use a justice system.</p></speech>

I will invite members to come in a second time if they wish.  Before that, I will take the opportunity to put my own questions.</p> <p>  We have touched on this matter already but something that often comes to mind is that there is a drug which many enjoy socially, and have it with friends and family, at licensed premises and at home.  A small minority struggle with it and have it as a demon.  That drug, of course, is alcohol.  It has greatly varying strengths with some very low strength beers on the market going up to very strong spirits.  Then there is the small unregulated space, such as with poit&iacute;n, ouzo or grappa, depending on the country.  Some are for sale legally and some are not.  They have different potencies.  Were alcohol to have been introduced to the market suddenly now or in the past half century, would it be in the same category as cannabis, for example or would it be treated differently?  If it was to be introduced tomorrow and we did not have all the laws that we do, what could or should be done?  Would witnesses be saying that we should criminalise or ban it?  Would we say that people who have a bottle of Heineken in their back pocket should be sent to Mountjoy or would we say that they should use it freely?  What could or should we do, were that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Condon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#L02000"><p>There has already been an example of alcohol prohibition - not in Ireland but in the USA.  We saw the problems that were created.  It was not that someone was going around with a bottle of Heineken in their back pocket but that people moved to harder substances, with whiskey and spirits, because the volume became a problem.  Obtaining beer would have become a problem but whiskey and so on would have been easily available.  We have seen the effects of alcohol prohibition.  If alcohol was only invented tomorrow, we have seen the results that prohibition could bring to society with the machine guns, the tommy gun that became infamous because of alcohol prohibition.  When we apply that to other drugs we see the Kinahans, another infamous name.  That speaks for itself.</p></speech>

In terms of the ranking of harms associated with drugs and substances and the risks, alcohol is probably somewhere in the middle.  I do not think that it would be the substance plucked out of the lot that we would choose to regulate first.  As I said earlier, however, we are where we are with alcohol.  As Mr. Condon said, prohibition did not work largely because of enforcement and compliance issues.  You cannot put the genie back in the bottle.  I recognise that prohibition is not an answer for alcohol, we just need to regulate it better.  For me, that is an extra reason to worry about moving down the path of legalising other drugs because when things get worse following that, as I believe that they will, it will be too late.  You will not be able to put that genie back in the bottle either.  We will then have two, if not more, legal, addictive, intoxicating substances available and doing increased harm across the population.</p></speech>

A 2015 European survey of drug harms found that alcohol was about twice as dangerous as any of the other substances.  It ranks considerably more severe, both in its impacts to the users and to society than even opiates.  To say it is middle-ranking is incorrect.</p></speech>

Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I have another question that arises from something Mr. Minish said earlier.  It was an interesting observation on plant-based substances.  Is there an argument for considering materials that grow organically in the ground whether mushrooms, as he suggested, a herb or weed, rather than something such as cocaine, amphetamines or ecstasy which are produced chemically or in a lab, where there is an extra degree of processing or layer on top of that?</p><p>Is there an argument that perhaps one that is more naturally occurring, a fruit-of-the-ground type of thing, should have greater support or regulatory tolerance as opposed to one created for the purposes of influencing behaviours and chemical reactions?</p></speech>

When coca was traditionally used in places like Peru at high altitudes, it was very beneficial for people.  In the way they used it, it did not impose the harms we associate with cocaine today.  That was primarily because they used it in its natural form.  They were not extracting it and were not concentrating it.  That is a product of prohibition that came somewhat later.  In fact, it was a product of Coca-Cola.  Coca was being put in Coca-Cola.  This became a problem and the coca was then removed.  Prohibition came afterwards.  The market came first and the prohibition came afterwards.  Dana Larsen of the Drug Users Liberation Front in Vancouver has a coca leaf tea caf&eacute;.  People who might be regarded as problematic users of cocaine see that as a stepping stone and a way to reduce the harms associated with their overuse of or addiction to cocaine.  They drink the tea or a more traditional way is to chew it and keep it in the gums.  The harms are drastically reduced when it is used in that form as opposed to the more concentrated forms.</p></speech>

I do not underestimate anyone's intentions or how much people care about those they work with it.  I am getting more and more disheartened as this conversation goes on.  I have been in this conversation not only as a member of the Joint Committee on Justice now, but it is something I have worked towards for a long time.  I am becoming increasingly scared for my community because we seem to be having intellectual conversations going back and forth.</p> <p>  The drug user is not responsible for the black-market drug trade.  Deputy Gino Kenny and Senator Ward said that the State does not want to be seen to be facilitating a black market, but we facilitate our own pockets because of that black market.  The hypocrisy of that is unbelievable.  Those involved in the justice system, the legal aid system, probation and prison system are all benefiting and profiting from prohibition.  The people at the bottom of the latter are still suffering, are still going to prison and are still being stopped and searched on the street.  They still have to tell their child that they cannot go with them on their summer project because they have to be Garda vetted to go on that and they would be too embarrassed to tell the local community centre that they have a charge from 20 years ago.  When we talk about saving lives, it is not as simple as taking the immediate view.  In the long term, it can save lives because not having a conviction can help lives to flourish.</p> <p>  We should forget about who benefits from the black market in drugs and just talk about who is losing here.  We need to help them while we figure out what the harm reduction model is, what the drug policy is and what interventions people need as humans.  People in every society in the world seek pleasure through substance use.  There lies the problem.  We need to look at the human psyche and human development in the context of the need to seek pleasure or the need to medicate.  It may be environmental or a human involvement of our psyche.</p> <p>  Can we stop using poor people, mostly as a weapon, in the context of having this conversation?  All of us can agree that they are not criminals.  Mr. Condon is not a criminal.  Mr. Tynan is not a criminal.  I am not a criminal.  My family are not criminals.  All the friends I have buried who overdosed in hospitals because of poverty and their addictions were not criminals.  I think we all agree on .  Why do we continue to use them as a pawn because of intellectual medical conversations that are actually not serving them?</p> <p>  We need to look at our own prejudices, our own biases and our own understanding of human development and why we seek pleasure seek and self-medicate.  We need to look at poverty and marginalisation.  We need to stop using the criminal courts and to focus our attention on the people who need our support - the support of everyone in this room.  The focus is completely wrong and they need to be separated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.525" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Hugh Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#M00500"><p>Similar to Dr. McGovern, I have been working in addiction services for more than 20 years.  I started work in the HSE addiction services.  I have also worked in the Prison Service.  The training unit in Mountjoy which was a completely drug-free unit.  Unfortunately, it no longer exists.  It was a fantastic facility where people who detoxed could enter and stay.  They could go to work and so on.  It is a major deficit within the criminal justice system that such a facility and the services it offered no longer exist.</p> <p>  Within the addiction clinics, I used to write two or three reports every week for courts.  My patients were frequently dying back then from HIV, overdose and so forth.  Many of them were simply not living very long.  That has changed dramatically in the meantime.  I might write one medical report a year for a court these days.  While my patients are still going to court and prison, generally it is for theft or other reasons to gain the money to buy the drugs presumably in the majority of cases.</p> <p>  The service we offered was largely biological or medical initially.  People have spoken about the stigma.  When I started in the service, I was trained that if a person was not complying with their treatment, we were supposed to reduce their methadone dose.  It was barbaric, inhumane and ridiculous.  Unfortunately, that prevailed in some circles and did so for some time afterwards in certain services.  We have obviously altered that.</p> <p>  I would like to think I have spearheaded increased choice regarding treatments available for people with addiction, particularly opiate addiction.  The availability of injectable buprenorphine is significant and provides recovery in injectable form.  It provides many benefits and reduces the stigma of having to attend clinics and so on.</p> <p>  I have worked in the voluntary sector and the private sector.  In the voluntary sector the real benefit I saw in terms of presentations with drug problems, particularly in those marginalised communities, was in increasing the psychological interventions, which we had been doing all the time but which were very ineffective in many cases if not combined with social interventions.  Social intervention as part of treatment is key to success.</p> <p>  In recent decades, the Icelandic model has been successful in reducing drug use and social problems, as well as increasing participation in sports music and so forth.  What has happened in Portugal has also worked.  We have prevented the deaths of vast numbers of people through the social interventions we have undertaken.</p> <p>  I work in a part of Dublin where there are crack dealers on every corner.</p><p>It is very hard to escape it.  It is important to give those people something to do and in any areas Senator Ruane talked about as well.  Social interventions both in terms of protecting and assisting those using drugs are what is key to success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-12a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022071200002#N00200"><p>Again, focusing on demand reduction and why we use drugs can help.  Better interventions can help.  On Subutex &ndash; I will stick with the brand name because it is easier to pronounce &ndash; when I was working in Merchants Quay 20 years ago, it was widely used in the UK.  Yet it was said it is only coming in here now.  We seem to be quite far behind.  Better interventions are very important but, again, just like it is not a choice between demand reduction or improving interventions, it is not necessarily a choice between looking at the criminal aspects of it and better interventions.  We can do the demand reduction, better interventions and look at the criminal status of it all at the same time.  When criminalisation gets in the way of the harm reduction and better interventions, that is where it becomes a problem.  I refer to the delay to roll out Naloxone and things such as that.  I look at other services where testing of pills for quality and safety is not done in this country because of the issues of criminality around it.  Safe injection rooms are on hold essentially because of the criminalisation.  Those are two harm reduction things that are being impacted by the criminalisation.  The safe access for patients is being impacted by the criminalisation.  Again, these are all, in a way, silos.  They are all separate.  We should be doing better interventions, demand reductions and providing the psychological supports because it is not just a purely chemical reaction and all of that.</p> <p>  I will come back to where I was going with the question.  If the criminalisation - the prohibition - is getting in the way of the harm reduction and better interventions, surely we need to be looking at that so that we can ultimately have both better interventions and the demand reduction.  We could talk about demand reduction for hours and hours in and of itself.  It ties deeply into all the stuff Senator Ruane talked about in relation to poverty, exclusion and inequality.  There is a whole host of things we could talk about simply looking at demand reduction.  We could spend hours talking about better interventions, but they are not mutually exclusive.  I am just conscious that there are many things being mixed up here.</p></speech>

Certainly, the evidence from national surveys does not bear that out.  Again, the more recent general population survey indicates that rates of drug use are pretty much evenly distributed across the entire economic domain, so that is certainly not the only or even a massive driver of drug use.  At the end of the day, our drug laws are a very small but important component of our wider drug policy, which needs to look at prevention, which means looking at the social, family, individual, school and community-based determinants of drug use, which is where Iceland has been particularly strong.  We should have optimism about our ability to suppress demand for drug use.  It is not all about laws and legislative responses.</p> <p>  We need better treatment but we do not seem to talk about treatment.  The whole conversation about drug policy in Ireland for the past ten years has been completely overshadowed by this relatively minor issue, because those intent on drug legalisation will not let it go.  It is the only thing we are allowed to talk about within the drug policy domain over the past decade.  We do not talk about the big needs in terms of treatment and what we could or should be doing in terms of prevention.</p></speech>

Once you say something is a medicine, it has to have proven effectiveness and a proven safety profile.  Unfortunately for the cannabis plant, I do think it will ever reach those criteria.  I see cannabis more as an alternative therapy.  Many people are passionate about a whole range alternative therapies, such a homoeopathy and crystal therapy, and they will swear by their chosen treatment.  I think cannabis falls in that domain.  I do not see it as a genuine medicine in and of itself.  We currently have Sativex, which is recognised as a medicine and contains THC and CBD, which are obviously cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant.</p></speech>

We have not invested.  We have pooh-poohed medical cannabis in this country.  The medical profession largely has discarded it.  Therefore, one would think that because the medical profession is calling for a greater evidence base, that we would support the research around that.  However, we are not doing that.</p> <p>  My view on medical cannabis is very straightforward.  I refer to the people I have dealt with, met and the stories I have heard in relation to medical cannabis.  We need to understand the conventional medical treatments have not worked for those people.  The very treatments that have the strong evidence base, generally speaking, and are well researched, have not worked.  We have a situation, which I believe is inhumane, where people are forced to either break the law or leave this country to try something to see whether it works for their symptoms.  They are criminalised and have to leave the country.  My view on medical cannabis is very straightforward.  </p> <p>  We talk about its effectiveness, but what about its safety?  It seems to be fairly safe in countries that have medical cannabis.  I would accept Professor Smyth&rsquo;s comments about the evidence base in relation to medical cannabis.  It needs to be stronger.  However, that does not mean we do not use it.  There are many examples in the history of medicines when we did not wait for the wonderful evidence base to arrive.  Penicillin is probably one example.  However, also in the area that I work in, there is methadone maintenance treatment.  The evidence base was informed by practice and having to deal with an epidemic.  We could not wait around for the absolutely perfect evidence base.  I do not think medical cannabis is unsafe and I do not see any evidence that it is unsafe.  The people who are trying it have tried every other conventional medicine.  I just think in this country we need to show a bit of humanity towards those people.  It is not right for people and families to have to leave this country at great expense and face hardship to go to another country to access a treatment they cannot access here.</p></speech>

We are here because the rate of drug deaths in Ireland is very high.  We are three times the EU average.  We are the fourth worst in Europe for drug deaths.  If the policy is working, then goodness me, what else is going wrong?  We need to do better.  We are not serving these people.  Many people, obviously, who are getting into treatment are having reasonable outcomes.  However, there are many people who are getting missed, falling through the cracks and are dying from overdoses.  The problem here is, of course, in part, contaminated supply and all that goes with it in the black market.  It is premature to assume that our policy as is is working; it is not.</p></speech>

That concludes our examination of this topic.  It was a very useful debate with many strong views.  It is interesting that it is one of the more vehemently argued topics that we have had, and we have many topics across a range of issues at this committee.  Certainly, the strong views are on all sides of the House on this one, which is good, because makes for a more robust meeting.</p> <p>  We will, of course, produce a report.  Everything that has been discussed today, the written submissions received and what was received from others who were not present at the meeting but would have sent in their thoughts in advance will be distilled into a report that we will produce, probably in the new term, because we are approaching summer recess.  It will be documented by the committee but then produced later in a couple months&rsquo; time.  </p> <p>  I thank our witnesses.  I will just ask members for agreement that we would publish the opening statements on the committee website as per the norm.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As there is no other business, the meeting stands adjourned until 3 p.m. tomorrow for a housekeeping meeting in private session so that prior to the recess we get our ducks in a row for the new term.  I thank everyone again, particularly our online and in-person witnesses, and all who participated in the debate.</p></speech>
