There are unmicrophoned seats in each committee room which can be used and all members can participate remotely in each meeting.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join meetings remotely, that is, from outside the committee room but from within the parliamentary precincts.</p> <p>  I also remind members to turn off their mobile phones.  Members are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to airplane mode.  I ask committee members not to just put their phones in silent mode because that will maintain the level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  The agenda for today is a pre-Agriculture and Fisheries Council engagement and scrutiny of EU legislative proposal COM (2020) 668.  The purpose of today's meeting is to engage with Deputy McConalogue, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in advance of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels on 15 and 16 December.  The Minister will also be briefing the committee on EU legislative proposal COM (2020) 668 regarding fixing for 2021 the fishing opportunities for certain Irish stock.</p><p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and his officials.  Dr. Cecil Beamish from the Department is attending in person and Mr. Dominic Rihan, economic and strategic services director at Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and Mr. Ciaran Kelly, director of fisheries ecosystems advisory services at the Marine Institute, are attending remotely.  I ask the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120100002#B00200"><p>I should go ahead and make myself a permanent member of this committee again.  I have not missed too many meetings since the start of the year and it is good to be back.</p><p>I welcome this opportunity to present this sustainability impact assessment to the committee.  As in previous years, a rigorous assessment has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the EU Commission's proposals for the fixing of total allowable catches, TACs, for the coming year.  This year, our preparation for total allowable catch setting takes place against a backdrop of unprecedented change and uncertainty.  The disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic continue to make markets difficult.  There is also considerable uncertainty surrounding the impacts of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  With the UK as a coastal state for the first time, the EU Council, with the Commission carrying out the negotiations on behalf of the Council, will need to negotiate with the UK as a coastal State on a total allowable catch setting for shared stocks.</p><p>The EU Commission proposal was issued on 27 of October.  However, the stocks which the EU share with the UK were presented in the proposal as <i>pro memoria</i>, pending the timing and outcome of negotiations with the UK.  This means that, for the majority of stocks of interest to Ireland, the Commission has not made a total allowable catch proposal.  To ensure the sustainability impact assessment could go ahead this year, I decided to use the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, scientific advice as the basis for this year&rsquo;s sustainability impact assessment.  The ICES advice forms the basis of the scientific advice used by the Commission.  The ICES advice for the relevant stocks provides suitable guidance for the TAC figures, which would normally be proposed by the Commission.  This allowed for a meaningful public consultation and realistic engagement with our stakeholders.  It also allowed the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to produce the biological and socioeconomic assessments.</p><p>Ireland's total allocation of quotas in 2020 amounted to a total value of &euro;275 million.  There are also valuable inshore species which are not subject to EU total allowable catches, such as crab, whelk, scallop and lobster.  These are fished by the Irish fleet in our inshore waters.  The waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  We have a duty of care to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  The landing obligation, which aims to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding, is now fully implemented.  The practical application of the landing obligation has created difficulties for operators, requiring changes in fishing practices and behaviour.  However, my Department, along with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, continues to work together with fishers in order to adapt and develop the most selective and sustainable fishing methods.</p><p>Another key feature of the Common Fisheries Policy is the setting of total allowable catches and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield, MSY.  Fishing at maximum sustainable yield, FMSY, is the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions.  For 2020, 62 out of 78 total allowable catches discussed at the Council meeting of December 2019 were set at or below the level of the maximum sustainable yield.  That compares, for example, with 2009, when only five stocks were fished at maximum sustainable yield.  Therefore, we have gone from a situation in which five stocks in 2009 were fished at the MSY to a situation last year where 62 catches out of 78 were fished at a maximum sustainable yield.</p><p>This is a significant achievement and Ireland will continue to work with stakeholders, member states and the Commission to build on this tangible progress to achieve our objectives of healthy fish stocks and sustainable fishing for the years to come.<br/><br/>Management arrangements for three migratory species in the north-east Atlantic in which Ireland has an interest - blue whiting, Atlanto-Scandian herring and mackerel - are normally negotiated by means of a coastal states framework between parties in whose waters significant concentrations of the fish stock are to be found and who have normally had a track record in those fisheries.  The coastal states negotiations for 2021 commenced in October and, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, were conducted by video conference.  Agreement was reached on setting the total allowable catch, TAC, at 929,000 tonnes of blue whiting, just over 651,000 tonnes of Atlanto-Scandian herring;, and 852,284 tonnes of mackerel.However, the signed agreement is not yet in place for the mackerel stock.<br/><br/>The TAC for blue whiting is based on the advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, and is in line with the long-term management strategy for the stock.  This represents a cut of 20% in the catch.<br/><br/>The TAC for mackerel is in line with the ICES advice based on the maximum sustainable yield approach and represents a reduction of 7.57% compared with the current year.  The mackerel negotiations are still ongoing.  The current sharing arrangement between the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands, which was agreed in 2014, is due to expire at the end of 2020.  Last week, the heads of delegation for all of the coastal states involved met to further discuss sharing arrangements as well as a new management plan for the mackerel stock.  These discussions are separate from the ongoing negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, and any change in sharing between the UK and the EU that might arise.<br/><br/>Iceland and Russia have excluded themselves from the international agreement.  They have operated a completely unacceptable unilateral fishery ignoring the quota shares set aside by the main coastal states and taking high catches of this valuable stock.  We fully support all efforts by the EU and the main shareholders to take any available opportunity to control and end these unsustainable fisheries.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the stocks, which the EU shares with the UK, are presented in the proposal as <i>pro memoria</i>.  For Ireland, this means that all but two stocks are listed in the <i>pro memoria</i>method.  To inform my negotiations on the total allowable catch setting for 2021, I have had an assessment of the impacts of the ICES scientific advice for the stocks undertaken.  To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation<b></b>process was initiated whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission's proposal for fishing opportunities for 2021 and the ICES advice.  From 6 November, an online web portal, , was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  Six submissions to the public consultation were received.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on . <br/><br/>In addition to the written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders that included fishing industry representatives and environmental NGOs on 26 November.  The purpose of this meeting was to give a further opportunity to the main stakeholders to outline their positions on the many aspects of this proposal and the scientific advice.  I thank all of them for their contributions to this impact assessment.  They set out a range of positions.  However, there were also commonalities.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed through the consultation process, which all have the same objective of sustainable fishing, and the protection of our fishing resource and marine ecosystem for future generations.<br/><br/>There is a clear call for adherence to the advice on setting TACs in accordance with fishing at the maximum sustainable yield.  We must also make use of the provisions of the north-west multiannual plan to deal with stocks where scientific advice indicates the stock is in poor shape.  Last year, to reduce catches of depleted stocks in mixed fisheries, TACs were set as by-catches only at levels that help the biomass of these vulnerable stocks to recover to sustainable levels, and these were complemented by remedial technical measures in the Celtic Sea.</p><p>The Commission has advised that it plans to follow a similar approach for 2021 and this is welcome.</p><p> The Commission has not set out how the practical arrangements and negotiations with the UK will be managed and, therefore, we do not know when it will set down its proposed TACs for stocks shared with the UK and how these will be negotiated with the UK.  The timing of when the Commission would bring forward such a paper with specific TAC proposals will be determined by the developments relating to the current EU-UK Brexit negotiations.  Given the complexity and scale of the fisheries relationship with the UK, the future bilateral consultations between the EU and the UK cannot simply be an expansion of the current EU-Norway model, which deals with a much smaller number of stocks.</p><p> It will be important that the new negotiations structure gives member states and stakeholders a meaningful role in the process.  I want the EU Council to be involved so that it has real input into the negotiations.  Ministers must be satisfied that the TACs set respect the principles of the Common Fisheries Policy and support the future of coastal communities that are dependent on fishing.</p><p> The Marine Institute and BIM have made an invaluable contribution to the assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which is contained in the Sea Fisheries Sustainability Impact Assessment before members today.  I would like to briefly set out the findings contained in that assessment.  From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute's view, which coincides with the view of ICES, is that there has been an improvement in the status of some fish stocks.  However, others remain a concern.  The Marine Institute summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2020 stock book and compares this assessment with the same evaluation presented in previous years' stock books.  The number of sustainably fished stocks has decreased from 35 in 2019 to 33 this year.  In terms of percentages, this is a decrease from 47% to 45%.  However, the percentage and number of stocks overfished remains unchanged at 13 stocks or 18%.  The number of stocks with unknown status has increased slightly from 26 to 28.</p><p> It is disappointing to see even a slight decrease in the number of sustainably fished stocks, especially as this number had been increasing year-on-year since 2013.  This was due to benchmark assessments being downgraded for two stocks &ndash; sole in area 7hjk, in the southern and western Celtic Sea, and whiting in the Irish Sea.  These stocks were changed to unknown status this year.</p><p> There are multiple reasons stocks have unknown status, including short time series of biological data, conflicting input data, low catches or insufficient sampling data or missing catch information.  Over time, the percentage of stocks with unknown pressure and state indicators has declined.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the sustainability impact assessment, which will be laid before the D&aacute;il and in the stock book prepared by the Marine Institute, and is available on its website.</p><p> As I indicated earlier, BIM has based the socio-economic assessment on the ICES advice.  If the total allowable catches are agreed as the advice recommends, we would see a net reduction in fishing opportunity of 10% by volume in tonnes and 6% by value.  This amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;15.8 million.  For this demersal whitefish sector, this would mean an 11% decrease in volume of fishing activity and a reduction of 4% by value, with a direct income loss of &euro;6.2 million.  For the pelagic sector, this would result in a reduction of 10% by volume and 7% by value with a direct income reduction of &euro;0.4 million.  This is primarily due to the decrease in mackerel.</p><p> To touch on the regional analysis of Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and west coast stocks, it is estimated that there will be a minus 5% decrease in fishing opportunities for the whitefish fleet. This reduction is valued at &euro;1 million and will impact the ports of Clogherhead, Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Dingle, Castletownbere and Ros an Mh&iacute;l as well as other smaller ports.  However, increased Norway lobster prawn quota will have a positive impact for Castletownbere, Howth, Dunmore East, Clogherhead and Ros an Mh&iacute;l.</p><p>A regional analysis of the north-west area estimates a 32% decrease in fishing opportunity, valued at &euro;3.7 million, which would have an impact on the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs.  In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income is lost in the processing sector, as a direct result of reduced catches, and a number of ancillary industries, such as net making, chandlery, engineering and refrigeration.  These reductions will obviously have a knock-on effect on employment.  BIM estimates, on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, that these reductions could impact 383 full and part-time jobs.  This could occur either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies in the seafood sector. </p><p> The Commission's proposal does not include the Hague preferences, which are a safety net for the Irish fleet on specific stocks where TACs are in decline.  Essentially, these are additional quota that Ireland, and previously the UK, claims for important whitefish stocks.  Many member states object strenuously to their application as the additional quota comes off their allocations.  While we have been able to secure the Hague preferences in the past, we will have to fight harder for them at Council this year, and we are likely to face strenuous opposition for the member states that are negatively impacted.  As the UK also benefited from the Hague preferences, the UK's withdrawal from the EU may further complicate matters and will isolate Ireland at the internal EU fisheries negotiations at the Fisheries Council.  Ensuring that the preferences are applied will be a key political objective for me in the negotiations.  The loss of these allocations in 2021 would amount to the loss of at least 2,206 tonnes of fish, with a direct value of &euro;3.8 million.  </p><p> I fully concur with the findings of the Sea Fisheries Sustainability Impact Assessment.  I thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to its production.  While the assessment is based on the ICES advice, rather than TACs proposed by the Commission, it highlights the potential for significant impacts on the Irish fishing industry.</p><p> Regarding some stocks, ICES has advised zero catches.  However, with the implementation of the landing obligation and the requirement to land all catches, including by-catches, from such stocks, this would lead to "choke" situations in mixed fisheries.  In its proposal, the Commission refers to the establishment of specific TACs for by-catches of these stocks, as was done in the current year.  The proposal highlights the difficultly of fishing all stocks in a mixed fishery at maximum sustainable yield at the same time.  The Commission also points out the need to strike a balance between the potential for severe socio-economic impacts and the need to achieve good environmental status for stocks.  I will be supportive of an approach similar to that taken last year to these depleted stocks.  </p><p> The Covid-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption across all sectors of the economy.  Ireland's fishing industry was not unscathed because exports to our traditional markets in Europe and Asia were disrupted by the severe impacts of the pandemic on Ireland's top five export partners, namely, France, the UK, Spain, Italy and China.  Throughout 2020, however, our fishers have worked hard to ensure Irish shops and consumers continue to be supplied with fish.  This underscores the important role the fishing industry plays in the food supply chain and the need to support a sustainable fishing industry.</p><p> On the EU-UK fisheries agreement negotiations, I will update the committee on the ministerial meeting last Friday with the EU's chief negotiator, Mr. Barnier, and the fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Sinkeviius.  Significant challenges lie ahead over the coming week because the EU-UK future relationship negotiations are, I hope, likely to conclude.  The meeting involved fisheries ministers from member states most impacted by the UK withdrawal from the EU, including ministers from France, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium.  The purpose of the meeting was to hear directly from Mr. Barnier on the progress being made on the negotiations.  It is clear that progress on fisheries has been very slow, and the UK side is maintaining a maximum position in terms of quota shares and access.  Mr. Barnier has indicated that he has made some concessions on quota shares to the UK but he did not give details of the stocks involved.</p><p> I explained that our fishing industry is in a particularly vulnerable position because Ireland shares its main fish stocks and its waters on three sides with the UK and needs to retain access to UK waters and to shared resources.  I urged Mr. Barnier to stay firm on making full use of the link between the overall economic partnership and the conclusion of a fishing agreement.  Mr. Barnier advised that the UK has not to date compromised on its position and is still seeking to have its quota shares increased to reflect 80% of the fish caught by EU vessels in the UK zone and continues to seek an annual negotiation on access to UK waters.  The latter would mean that each year the EU would have to buy access by giving up quota.</p><p> I explained that any outcome in the future relationship negotiations that results in a loss of quota share for the EU would be damaging to Ireland's fishing industry.  I also made clear that in the event of a no-deal and EU vessels being denied access to UK waters Ireland could face serious difficulties arising from loss of access to important fishing grounds and displacement of EU fishing activity into our zone.</p><p> The meeting with Mr. Barnier was welcome and gave me the opportunity to set out Ireland's serious concerns regarding the potential impacts for Ireland's fishing industry if a fair and balanced fisheries agreement with the UK is not reached.  We all agree I believe that Ireland needs a future relationship and our fishing industry needs a strong and stable EU-UK fisheries agreement.  I have continued confidence that Irish and EU fishing interests will be robustly defended by Mr. Barnier and his team in this critical late phase of negotiations.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the members' view and answering any questions they may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120100002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute at this stage.  I thank the Minister for his detailed presentation.</p> <p>  I will start by dealing with Brexit.  As a Donegal man, I do not need to tell the Minister about the Irish fishing industry's serious concern regarding the ongoing talks.  As he will know, 34% of the entire catch of the Irish fleet is taken from what would be termed UK waters, or certainly what the UK would term as UK waters.  The impact of the British Government getting what it is seeking would be devastating.  Even the offer of 15% to 18% returns by Michel Barnier has gone down very badly with the fishing sector here.  The Minister will recall the presentations made by the fishing organisations to the previous committee on agriculture.  I pointed out to the then Minister, Deputy Creed, we would need to be very clear with our colleagues in the European Union that if the talks were to continue the way they were going and serious concessions were given to the British Government, we would need to renegotiate the Common Fisheries Policy as it applies to Irish waters.  There are major concerns about the European fishing fleet that will be displaced from British waters and that it will intensify the demand on the fishery in Ireland's waters.  I appreciate it is all termed an exclusive economic zone and as European waters but, in real terms, our job is to protect the interests of our fishing communities.  There is already real anger among all our coastal communities that we are not getting our fair share of what are Irish fisheries, therefore, we cannot concede anything here.  We cannot go backwards.</p> <p>  I want to get some clarification from the Minister.  What conversations is he having with his European counterparts on the next steps to be taken?  Even if 18% is the final concession, that will have a major impact, mostly on Irish fisheries.</p><p>We need to get a sense of the Minister's post-Brexit plan for engaging on the Common Fisheries Policy.  This matter must be reopened because it clearly cannot stay as it is.  The Minister referred to the total allowable catch and the annual quota negotiations.  The negotiations are ongoing but there must be a realisation that this will have a serious impact on Ireland.  I would like a sense of what is happening in that regard.</p><p> On the wider issues relating to quota, I recently undertook some investigations in respect of bluefin tuna.  I have submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on the matter.  We need to start talking about this.  Bluefin tuna is in very good health in Irish waters.  It is a predatory fish which feeds on a whole range of species in our waters.  We only have a catch and release agreement at the moment.  It is worth looking at the internationally agreed approach to this matter.  The market for this species, particularly that in Japan, is very lucrative.   The European Union's share of the international quota has increased by 73% since 2016.  An additional 800 tonnes are now available to the EU.  Of that, Ireland has not secured 1 tonne.  This is despite the fact that stocks of bluefin tuna are plentiful in our waters.  Our fishermen are out on chartered boats with tourists, with a catch and release policy for one of the most lucrative fish in the world.  These fish get fattened up in our waters and then head out and get caught outside the 12-mile limit of the Irish exclusive economic zone by a range of international boats.  We are fattening them up to enrich international fishermen and that is totally unjust.  We have to revisit the bluefin tuna quota.  What are the Minister's views on this matter?</p><p> We have to look at the sustainability of various species.  One cannot argue with the approach presented in the sustainability impact assessment and the work of the Marine Institute.  We have to look after and sustain the various species.  The science is the science but the problem is - and everything goes back to this - the share of the fishery available to the Irish fleet.  This is based on historical fishing practices from a time when Ireland was not equipped or resourced to avail of it.  This is our marine resource, however.  If we were ever going to take a complacent approach, Brexit has changed all that.  There is no room for complacency.  We need straight talking about what resource is available in the Irish waters and what share we will secure for the Irish fleet.</p><p> I refer to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  We are entering a new seven-year period.  As Donegal men and Inishowen men, it is mostly the inshore fleet that we interact with.  What is the Minister's vision for the inshore fleet to benefit from the next seven-year programme.  I know the inshore fishing organisations have corresponded with the Minister recently.  There has been a bit of a resource there for the aquaculture sector.  The tie-up scheme was completely under-utilised.  It was too late in the day.  They have experienced a huge financial hit from Covid.  What financial resources can the Minister provide now to the inshore sector now which has been hit really hard by the global pandemic and the crisis of the market?  It is a question about the inshore sector now and the next seven years.</p></speech>

It has also been one of our key concerns nationally with regard to upcoming negotiations and those which have been ongoing since last year.  The Deputy is right; there is a lot of concern on a number of fronts.  One concern relates to access to British waters.  As of now, this access has been strongly contested in all feedback and public commentary from the UK Government.  The Deputy will have seen in public commentary that the UK is seeking to take back up to 80% of the EU&rsquo;s permitted catch in those waters, which is obviously very concerning.  As to the need for stability for fishermen in the years ahead, the UK Government wants annual renegotiations and discussion on access, which would obviously lead to very significant instability for our fishing sector and would leave it in a very vulnerable position strategically.</p><p> Our national position has at all times recognised the importance of tying fisheries negotiations to other aspects of the EU free trade agreement.  This is something on which all parties have been co-operating and on which they have been very clear.  Since I was appointed Minister for Agriculture and the Marine, I have emphasised the absolute importance of ensuring that free trade negotiations continue to be tied to the issue of fisheries in all engagements I have had with fellow member states, the EU Commission and Mr. Barnier.  I emphasised this as recently as our meeting of last Friday.  It is even more important that this tie is maintained in the days ahead.</p><p> I do not want to go into the sensitive discussions that are ongoing other than to be absolutely clear on what the Irish position has been.  I have had many bilateral engagements with other EU fisheries ministers.  I have had opportunities in this regard at meetings of the European Council and in direct meetings with Commissioner Sinkevicius and Mr. Barnier.  We will continue to do everything we can, as we have been doing up until now, to emphasise the importance of both protecting our quotas and protecting access and to ensure that there will be stability into the future.  What is at play now will be really important in the future.  We want to maintain our fish quotas.  That is our priority.  This will allow our fishermen to do what they do.  The volume and quantity of fish involved is important with regard to the processing sector and the jobs associated with it and with regard to its export value.</p><p> On the Common Fisheries Policy, there is to be a review in 2021 and 2022.  It has been about ten years since the previous review.  The focus over recent times has been on solidarity at European level.  That needs to be the case in the important days ahead as well.  We must all fight hard.  There has been really strong solidarity among the group of eight coastal member states to ensure that our position is as strong as it possibly can be in these negotiations.  That has been important.  We will have an opportunity to engage and consult on our input into the next Common Fisheries Policy.  That will be important and timely.  That review is set for 2021 and 2022.</p><p> On the issue of bluefin tuna, the division of this stock between EU member states was decided many years ago, based on historical fishing activity.  The existing division of these very valuable stocks is set, pending the review of the Common Fisheries Policy post Brexit.</p><p>The question of the allocation of those stocks will be a matter for the 2021-22 review.  I know it is something which fishermen have been raising.  The review will be an opportunity to engage on that issue.</p><p> With regard to our inshore fishing sector, I know of its tremendous value and how important it is for employment, especially in our own county.  I know the pressure it has been under.  It is something of which I am very much aware.  There was a temporary fleet tie-up scheme earlier in the year but I will be assessing how we can assist in this area because I very much value the sector, which is really important to our fisheries sector overall.</p></speech>

I have just a few questions with regard to fishing.  I am from west Cork, which is obviously a significant area for fishing.  There are savage and serious concerns.  I have been meeting the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation.  My worry is that the Government will be once again caught off guard if it ignores warnings from organisations like the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation.  In his speech, the Minister said that our whitefish fleet faces a 5% reduction in fishing opportunities, which will cost in the region of &euro;1 million for places like Castletownbere.  This will have very serious consequences for the fishing fleet in that town.</p> <p>  I will ask the Minister a few questions.  Does he know how many UK vessels will leave our waters on 1 January?  Does he have any indication of that figure at this stage?  Will Ireland's fishing grounds be used as a bargaining chip for other EU fleets to gain access to the UK's coastal waters?  There is a worry that it seems like colonialism is returning.  Mr. Michel Barnier is offering 18% more fish to the UK.  Whose fish is he giving away?  </p> <p>  I concur with Deputy Mac Lochlainn with regard to the bluefin tuna quota.  It seems like this is eluding Irish fishermen.  Perhaps the Minister will explain in more detail why Irish fishermen have been continuously excluded from this quota while other European countries have been getting extra.  The catch and release policy is of no benefit to the Irish fishing fleet.  We need to seriously concentrate on that.  If we start losing ground in areas - and it certainly looks like we are, given the 5% decrease I have mentioned - where are we going to make up ground?  We have to make up significant ground somewhere.  The bluefin tuna quota is an opportunity.  It is something for which fishermen have been calling for quite some time but these calls seem to be falling on deaf ears.  Will the Minister explain that?</p> <p>  The inshore sector in rural areas, including on peninsulas such as Mizen Head, needs a lot of supports.  Will the Minister outline the supports these areas will get over the coming years?  They may not be affected by Brexit as severely as other areas but fishermen feel that the supports offered to date are insufficient.  They lost a lot equipment in the bad storms.  I called on the then Minister, Deputy Creed, to put in place a compensation package but he never did.  They lost gear.  These are people who give a great deal to the local economy.  They need to know if they have a future.  That is what it boils down to.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could answer some of those questions.</p></speech>

That is obviously being contested in the negotiations at the moment.  Access to UK waters is very important for our fishermen.</p><p>Many of our catches, particularly the more valuable catches, are caught in those areas, so that reciprocal access arrangement is key, and is something that we will be seeking to achieve, so that there are no vessels being put out of either our waters or the British waters. It is certainly something that we will continue to hold to and we hope to have reached a positive outcome on the issue.</p><p> On the issue of bluefin tuna, I think I mentioned it earlier on in relation to my response to Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  The Common Fisheries Policy will be renegotiated next year and the year after, and as things stand, the bluefin tuna quota is based on historical catches among member states and other international partners, and that is the current position.  Obviously any such long-standing positions are very difficult to change and require discussions on the Common Fisheries Policy, which will be up for review in 2012-22.</p><p> On the issue of the inshore fisheries sector, the Deputy&rsquo;s part of the country is like my own in its profile and that of inshore fishing and the value that it provides to coastal communities in particular.  Certainly, the sector is something of which I am very conscious.  The EU support regulation for the next European Maritime and Fisheries Fund is currently being negotiated and is yet to be agreed.  Funding secured under that regulation would form the programme for the next seven years, so in respect of ongoing engagement with stakeholders at European level in relation to the new regulation, it is something that I will keep in mind as Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120100002#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive statement.  Calling a spade a spade, we are speaking into a vacuum and we are taking a shot in the dark here because we know that nothing can be agreed until everything is agreed, and the allowable catch or the quotas cannot be agreed until we know where we are on Brexit.  So the brief questions that I have are more Brexit-related because I am aware that the Minister cannot and will not be able to negotiate the quotas until he knows where he stands on that issue.</p> <p>  Irrespective of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, and thinking about the Minister's own neck of the woods, for example, let us say that two trawlers leave the Foyle Estuary, one registered in the Republic of Ireland, and the other registered in the UK, and depending on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations they will head in different directions and there will be limitations as to where they can both fish.  Under the Irish protocol, when these trawlers return with their catch, can the Minister see consequences for markets, given that one is UK registered and is landing in Derry, and the other is Irish registered and is landing in Killybegs?  Irrespective of where the trawlers get their catch, what consequences does the Minister for foresee for the markets under the proposed Irish protocol?  How might those Northern Ireland based, UK registered trawlers have an input in our market going forward?</p> <p>  My other question concerns the statistics on the stocks that are under pressure.  I know that it might be too soon to tell, but based on the six to eight months of almost no activity that we have had due to Covid-19, could that inactivity have had a noticeable effect on the stocks that were previously under pressure?  As the stocks have not been fished as heavily as they would in other years, would they have had opportunity to increase and multiply, or would the effect of the inactivity be so small that it is insignificant and not noticeable?  Could the fact that some of the stocks have had a chance to increase change the figures when it comes to negotiating the total allowable catch?</p></speech>

Therefore, the respective shares that member states and the UK believe they should have of those catches is currently very much in the cross hairs in the negotiations.  Obviously our position is that they should remain as they are, in terms of access and share of the catches, if at all possible.  We will fight very hard to achieve that.  Going forward, regardless of the outcome of Brexit, on 1 January 2021, the concept of maximum sustainable yield in respect of waters in general and the amount of fish that can be caught by anyone, whether from EU member states or otherwise, is an important international principle that must be followed.  Moreover, it will need to be followed if we are to ensure that those fisheries continue to be healthy.  From a national point of view, it is really important that we maintain the quota share that we have and the access we have to those waters.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to elaborate on the timelines that he believes will be applicable to the actual Brexit issues going forward.  It is now 1 December and we are looking at a scenario where an agreement will either be put in place or not in the next 30 days.  The Minister will attend the fishing quota negotiations on 15 and 16 December.  Does he think that the Brexit negotiations will be completed before he attends those fishing quota negotiations on those dates in order that he can work the issues arising out of Brexit into them or will he have to come back to those issues at a later stage?</p> <p>  On the Common Fisheries Policy itself, and the review that is being undertaken in 2021 and 2022, what are the Minister's initial views on that or are they linked to the Brexit negotiations themselves?  In respect of the share of the mackerel quota in Ireland, specifically, where the actual mackerel quota is fished, will that be part of the negotiations or will it be a separate issue that the Minister looks at another time?</p></speech>

In other words, how does the split in the Irish mackerel quota work between the south and the west, and the north west.  Will it be part of the Common Fisheries Policy, or is it an internal issue for the Irish Government to address?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120100002#L00500"><p>First, on the timeline, it is our hope and reasonable expectation that there will be an agreement.  It is highly important for the country and for the fisheries sector because without an agreement, access and the quota share will become major issues.  Therefore, reaching an agreement is really important and hopefully it will be completed shortly.  If the negotiations are continue up to the 15 and 16 December, it will make it significantly more difficult to reach a conclusion in terms of ensuring that negotiations are completed in a manner that allows preparations to be made.  It is not an ideal situation, as we do not have clarity on the issue going into the decision-making for next year and that is why we have based the assessment to date on the ICES advice to be able make some preparations.  On the mackerel issue, I will ask Dr. Beamish to comment on that.  I can confirm that it is an entirely internal allocation.</p></speech>

At present, 34% of the annual catch of the Irish fishing fleet is caught in UK waters under the Common Fisheries Policy.  That is the scale of the threat to the industry here from these negotiations.</p><p>The industry is worth hundreds of millions of euro and 16,000 people are employed in the sector.  Over the weekend, a representative from the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation voiced his concerns that Michel Barnier's proposal that moneys be returned to the UK will see a significant part of that burden borne out by Irish fishing fleets.  Approximately 34% of our fish is caught in UK waters.  Was the Minister's attention drawn to this before Mr. Barnier made the offer?  Was he going to increase that percentage after the offer was initially rejected?  Do we have a cut-off point?  At what stage would any additional return from the EU to the UK be unacceptable?  What is being done to offset the disproportionate impact on Ireland?</p><p> The fact of the matter is that Ireland's fishing sector is going to be negatively affected by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  I appreciate that at this stage we do not know if the UK is in or out.  I do not know if Boris Johnson himself knows whether it is in or out.  When faced with that scenario, any other business would try to diversify into something else.  Do we have proposals that we can put to the Commission, as raised by several other speakers, about the bluefin tuna?  What other alternatives have we in that regard?  Our fishers have had a lot of mistrust in the EU down through the years.  I do not know whether that mistrust is even being addressed in the talks that are going on at the minute.  Are we now at a point where we need our Government, and the Minister, to take a hard line with both the EU and the UK on what will affect our fishing fleets come 31 December if there is a no-deal Brexit?  Either way, our fleets will be affected but this will impact on jobs and so on from 31 December.  Is there a point at which we will play hardball with them?</p></speech>

A no-deal scenario is one we must avoid because it would immediately impact on access and would also have a very significant impact on shares.  That is something we have to work to avoid.  Across the Government, we have been very forthright in all our engagements and communications with other members states, the EU Commission and Mr. Barnier on the absolute importance of protecting the quota shares we have, protecting the existing access arrangements and the crucial imperative of ensuring that fisheries negotiations are tied to other aspects of the free trade agreement.  That is more important at this point in time than at any stage.  Those fisheries arrangements and discussions must not get detached.  We are also clear that their being annually negotiated would not be acceptable because of the instability it would bring.  It is crucial that fishing and other aspects of the free trade agreement continue to be tied, particularly in the next number of days.</p></speech>

I will not be long.  I am by no means a fishing expert.  Many people watch different media reports and see ships coming here from Australia and different parts of the world, including massive fishing liners and ships that mop up more in half an hour than we would in the same time with 100 boats.  Why are Ireland and the rest of the EU tolerating that?  If Mr. Barnier agrees to a drastic cut in the amount of fish Ireland can fish in UK waters, will the Government accept that in an overall package of agreement or will it veto it?</p></speech>

At the moment, any boats that fish within EU waters have to be authorised to do so, must have quotas and are subject to oversight by the respective national bodies that manage control of those waters.  For example, any boats that come in to fish in Irish waters are subject to the oversight of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the Naval Service.  They are only permitted to fish if they have the permission to be there in the first place, as well as the quota to fish in that area, and are subject to the control and regulation of our respective authorities.  Any decisions around sizes of vessels would be up for discussion as part of the Common Fisheries Policy and would be discussed and debated at that point in time.  As things stand, boats must have a quota and the right to be in the waters in the first place in order to fish there.</p> <p>  Our absolute focus is on ensuring the outcome of the negotiations is a good one.  Let us be under no illusions.  A no-deal Brexit would be a bad one for fishing, as it would be for the rest of our economy.  It is important that we work to ensure an agreed outcome that is good for the fishing sector and protects its interests in every way possible.  That has been our absolute focus, my focus as Minister, and continues to be our focus in all the engagements we have had.  That is the clear engagement we have had with Mr. Barnier's team as well.  There is no doubt that a no-deal Brexit, which, as the Deputy suggests, could be the outcome, would be damaging for fishing and would mean massive challenges as regards access and quota shares.  An agreed outcome and one that is positive for the fishing sector is our absolute priority. </p></speech>

That is what I am trying to establish.  What if the British said there would be a 50% cut to all EU vessels in their waters?  At what stage would the Department reject that?  Is it at 20%, 30% or 50%?  When would it not accept any bigger cut to the fishing sector?</p></speech>

All the member states portioned together have emphasised the importance of solidarity in holding a very strong line on protecting quotas and access.  We then communicate clearly and input that to Mr. Barnier's team.  He is very clear on the absolute importance of quota shares and access being protected and of tying the negotiations to other aspects of the free trade agreement.  There is nothing more we can do than that, other than to hold that very strong line and work in solidarity to ensure the EU position is strong, in order to ensure a good outcome for fishing.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late and missing his opening statement.</p><p>I have a number of questions.  This is probably one of the most challenging and difficult times for the fishing industry.  Protecting our own quotas and Brexit are two of the major challenges that we face.</p><p> Speaking specifically about Brexit for a moment, I have been contacted by a number of people within the fishing industry, both people out fishing and those involved in the significant spin-off from the fishing industry on the island of Ireland, and they are very concerned about these negotiations.  Will the Minister inform the committee of the conversation that he has had with Mr. Michel Barnier so far?  What did the Minister stress as his bottom line in his conversation with him?  I am aware that the Minister had a Zoom call or online meeting with him and I believe it was last Friday week or whenever.  What is Ireland's position of acceptance in the Brexit negotiations?  I know that this is a European issue but I presume the Minister set out Ireland's bottom line on the Brexit negotiations on fishing.</p></speech>

Our priority has been to protect the fish stocks, quotas and allocations that we have.  We want our fishermen to be able to continue to fish and for that not to be diminished.  This has been our position in our engagements with Mr. Barnier and with the eight other member states with whom we have built up solidarity.  As to how the engagement with the UK is developing, we want to protect access to the British waters and the quota allocation that we have and, in doing so, very importantly, the ties between the other aspects of the free trade agreement and fisheries are absolutely essential.  We very much trust that Mr. Barnier will fight hard and he has been fighting hard in that regard.  It is going to be very important that in the next few days and at all times in that engagement with Mr Barnier that we emphasise the importance of protecting the quota and access.  That remains central in his engagement and negotiations with the UK.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020120100002#O00400"><p>We have to see first of all what is in the agreement.  What the British are looking for in terms of access to waters and their demand, which has been commented upon publicly, to retain 80% of what the EU vessels would catch would have a very significant impact on our fishing fleet.  The point that we have made at all times is that there is much more to the Brexit and future relationship negotiations than fisheries, although fisheries has been one of the most contested aspects.  It is crucial that those other aspects are taken in the round and that the other parts of the free trade agreement are tied in to it.  In that regard, if the British or the UK want access to energy markets, for example, in the EU, common access to waters and the sharing of fishing stocks is equally important for us as energy may be for them.  This needs to be a rounded and balanced free trade agreement in seeing that it protects our interests as to fish stocks, quotas and access to waters.</p></speech>

I take the Minister's point 100% on fishing.  The Department will have the annual fishing quota negotiations coming up at the end of the year.  This is going to be very difficult with Brexit.  If, going into those negotiations, we are not sure what the full fallout from Brexit is, what are the Government's plans if there is no deal by then?</p><p>Fishing negotiations usually take place over the next two weeks and continue right up to Christmas.  What will the Minister's priorities be going into those talks, either with or without a deal?  Can the Minister outline his position in both scenarios, please?</p></speech>

It is certainly far from ideal that there is a lack of clarity and certainty regarding the outcome of negotiations.  Hopefully, we will know by the time of the EU Council meeting what this will be.  As I outlined to other members, the assessments we carried out were on the basis of the ICES scientific advice.  That advice has allowed us to carry out impact assessments on stocks, etc., in order to make preparations for the EU Council meeting.  If there is no deal, member states will have to come to together and deal with that.  I certainly hope that we can proceed on the basis of a deal and that it will be a good one for fishing.</p></speech>

This is the final point I wish to make.  I come from Wexford.  There are other counties that have bigger fishing communities, but the fishing community that we have in Wexford is based predominantly at Kilmore Quay.  When one talks to the processors, engineers, the garages and takes everybody into consideration, they depend on this industry, as do a significant number of people in our coastal communities.  The fallout from Brexit will have a greater effect on people on the eastern seaboard than it will on those on the western seaboard.  Fishermen have told me that they do not want to be steaming from Kilmore Quay right around to the west coast of Ireland in order to fish because this will involve a great additional cost in terms of diesel and so forth.  I am aware that the Minister is very conscious of that and I ask that the Minister take the effects of this on the eastern seaboard fishermen into account because this is of significant concern in small rural communities who totally depend on the fishing industry.  Many strides have been made in the past number of years.  I worked closely with Deputies Coveney and Creed when they served previously as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I know that we will be able to do the same again here but I ask the Minister to be very conscious of that in the further negotiations.</p> <p>  On the SFPA and the arrests that have been made, does the Minister have specific figures for the number of fishermen who have been arrested, the number of vessels boarded, etc., in the past year?  Are the numbers up or down on previous years?</p></speech>

I fully recognise the importance of access to UK waters, particularly for fishermen on the south-east coast.  We have been very cognisant of that at all times.  A national position has been taken on the retention of quota share and access and this is an outcome that is essential for those fishermen.</p> <p>  On the SFPA, I do not have those figures to hand.  The SFPA operates on a separate statutory and legal basis to the Minister.  We can arrange for a note containing answers to those questions to be sent to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Will Ireland&rsquo;s fishing grounds be used as a bargaining chip for other EU fleets to regain access to the UK's coastal waters?  In the context of Michel Barnier's offer of 18% more fish to the UK, will the Minister indicate whose fish he is giving?</p></speech>

That is the leverage we want to use and we have outlined that it should be used at all times.</p><p>Obviously in relation to the content of the negotiations at the moment, there has been public commentary suggesting 15% to 18% but there has been no further detail in that regard.  Certainly our position at all times has been to stress the importance of retaining fish quotas and access.  I have emphasised and restated that in all of my engagements in recent times, and the negotiating team is clear on the importance of that.</p></speech>

It is really important that we ensure that stocks are fished sustainably and that means that the yield levels are higher for some stocks than in previous years and lower for other stocks.  In terms of the European Council meeting, we will have to try to balance the advice on stocks against socioeconomic impacts.  It is important that any decisions we make ensure that fisheries remain sustainable and the maximum sustainable yield is central to the approach.  If we do not ensure sustainability, then fish stocks will not be there in years to come.  It is a question of striking the right balance across all stocks.  I will be looking for a positive outcome that strikes a good balance.</p></speech>

The talks are between the EU and the British Government.  What can the Minister say to fishermen now to reassure them that we are doing our absolute best in the context of the Brexit negotiations?  Can he assure them, in three or four sentences, that he and the Government are doing their best to get the best possible deal for them?</p></speech>

We have also been working very hard in a joint effort with seven EU maritime states to put forward a strong and solid case for protecting the EU fisheries position in the negotiations.  That message has been put across and is very well understood.  Mr. Barnier is determined to ensure that the leverage of fisheries is maintained with other aspects of the free trade agreement.  Hopefully we will see an agreement because as all fishermen know, a no-deal Brexit will be very damaging to the sector.  It would have a significant impact on access to UK waters, on quota share and on our capacity to fish.  We need a trade agreement and a good one from a fishing point of view.  Our approach on this has been united, in terms of working with other EU member states and the Commission.</p></speech>

I remind members that the Select Committee on Agriculture and the Marine will meet on Thursday at 10 a.m. in the Seanad Chamber to discuss a Supplementary Estimate.  Our next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 8 December and we have invited the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, Bord Bia and the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society, ICOS, to discuss the impact of Brexit.  At our meeting on 15 December we will engage with the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, Dairy Industry Ireland, Meat Industry Ireland and the Irish Grain and Feed Association, IGFA, to discuss the same topic.</p> <p>  We have discussed swine fever previously and it is included on our work programme.  I had a discussion this morning with two or three pig producers who are extremely worried about swine fever.  It is in Germany at the moment and has prevented German pork products from being exported to China.  This is having a seriously depressive impact on the market.  Market conditions are one issue but another is the disease itself and the precautions the Department is taking to make sure that swine fever does not get into this country.  In that context, I propose that we give a pig producer who has been corresponding with us ten to 15 minutes to outline the issues involved and the steps required to prevent this disease from entering the country.  That will put us in a good position to ask questions of the Department about the precautions being taken.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As the format for the next two meetings is agreed, that concludes our proceedings for today-----</p></speech>

As members of the committee are aware, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body, which was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, as amended.  The OCO has two core statutory functions, namely, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age and to examine and investigate complaints made by, or on behalf of, children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that have, or may have had, an adverse effect on a child.</p> <p>  The rights and welfare of children with disabilities has been a strategic priority for my office since 2016.  In our strategic plan for the period 2019 to 2021, we committed to continue to pursue the progressive realisation of the rights of children with disabilities.  Published in October, the Unmet Needs report sets out the challenges experienced by children who may have a disability and require an assessment of their needs.  The report proposes actions that we believe should be taken to address these challenges in a child-centred, rights-based manner.</p> <p>  Every child with a disability in Ireland has the right, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, to the highest level of health and education so as to fulfil their potential as human beings.  This report raises serious concerns about ongoing violations of the rights of children with disabilities.  This includes the significant delay in accessing an assessment of needs, AON, despite the HSE's legal obligation to commence such an assessment within three months of receipt of a child&rsquo;s application.  Between 2017 and 2019, the OCO received 95 complaints from parents regarding their child&rsquo;s access to a statutory AON.  Parents related their concerns about the potential adverse effect of this delay on their child&rsquo;s development.</p> <p>  We are all aware that children&rsquo;s earliest years are the foundation for their physical and mental health, emotional security, cultural and personal identity, and developing competencies.  While the report highlights the stories of Andrew, Lucy, Michael and Sarah individually, we know that some 6,058 children are currently overdue an assessment, with less than 10% of assessments being carried out within the statutory timeframe.</p> <p>  As members know, in September 2004, the Government launched the national disability strategy, NDS, with the aim of supporting the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  It was envisaged that the NDS would lead to an equitable reconfiguration of disability services.  The Disability Act 2005 and its counterpart, the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004, the EPSEN Act, were key elements of the strategy.  The 2005 Act provided for an assessment of needs in order to determine the health services required by a person with a disability.  The EPSEN Act provided for an assessment of special educational needs so that a child with such needs may be educated in an inclusive environment.  While the 2005 Act was commenced in full, sections 3 to 13, inclusive, of the EPSEN Act, which concern the assessment of special educational needs, have, to this day, not been commenced.  In the absence of a procedure under the EPSEN Act, students who require an assessment of their special educational needs are applying for an assessment of needs under the 2005 Act.  This places enormous pressure on the 2005 Act mechanism.</p> <p>  A deficiency of resources allocated to meet the demand for AONs has also hampered the effectiveness of the 2005 Act mechanism.  There has been a significant increase in the number of applications for AONs over the last ten years, exceeding the capacity of services to meet this demand.  The HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for 2020 projected that only 9% of AONs would be completed on time.  In addition, there is a reported lack of consistency in approach to AONs across the community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  Furthermore, as members of the committee know, since the 2005 Act came into force, national policy and programmes have moved towards a needs-led, rather than diagnosis-led, service model.  For this reason, the 2005 Act mechanism, as drafted, is at odds with the principles that now underscore national policy in this area.</p> <p>  Having considered the perspectives shared by children and parents, we propose the following priorities for action to address the challenges arising with respect to AONs.  We call on this committee to advance a review of the 2005 Act, with particular consideration be given to: a section setting out guiding principles which must inform the interpretation and implementation of the Act, including the recognition that children with disabilities are entitled to enjoy a full and decent life in conditions which ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate the child&rsquo;s active participation in the community; the amendment of section 2 to a definition of disability which is rights-based, child-centred and inclusive; the amendment of section 7 to ensure a best interest, holistic, multidisciplinary, needs-based approach to assessment of needs; and the amendment of section 18 to expand the powers of the disability appeals officer to provide compensation as a remedy for breaches under the Act in an effort to drive the State towards a better adherence to its statutory obligations and timelines.</p> <p>  The commencement of sections 3 to 13 of the EPSEN Act must also be considered.  Legislative underpinning for the special educational needs of children is vital to ensuring that children&rsquo;s needs are identified and met in a timely and appropriate manner.  There must be a whole-of-government review of the access criteria for all services for which a diagnosis is still generally required, to ensure a clear pathway to services for all children according to their needs.</p> <p>  The OCO recommends that an independent expert group be established to review the 2005 Act, having regard to the EPSEN Act, and related legislation which impacts the provision and delivery of assessments of needs and special educational needs assessments.</p><p> The OCO is also supportive of the establishment of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters to assist in monitoring and implementing the provisions in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  The State&rsquo;s commitment to protecting and affirming the rights of people with disabilities would be further cemented by the ratification of the optional protocol to the UNCRPD, which would allow persons with disabilities to make individual complaints to the UNCRPD committee.</p><p> The OCO proposes the formal establishment of an interdepartmental group on children with disabilities, which should prioritise actions that address the early identification, early intervention and early treatment of children with disabilities.  The OCO considers that significant investment is needed in this area.  The current projected out-turn of only 9% of AONs being completed within the timeframes suggests that a tenfold increase in expenditure may be required.  The State, via the HSE, must ensure the provision of adequate financial, technical and human resources to the national disability children and family teams to manage assessments of need in a timely manner.</p><p> The OCO supports the development by HIQA of a new set of national standards for the assessment of need for children with disabilities.  We have proposed that these be aligned with wider national children&rsquo;s standards to improve the experiences of all children using health and social care services.  Unfortunately, we found out only yesterday that this will not happen, as HIQA is putting its resources elsewhere.  We find that very disappointing.  The OCO recommends that the State ensure that a functional and accessible complaints mechanism remain in place and that the reimbursement of private medical fees incurred by a parent in securing alternative services, as a result of delays in receiving an assessment for their child, be considered.</p><p> The OCO also recommends that the HSE collect and create a central database of AON data to identify problems, assess progress in strategy implementation and inform national policy development.  We also recommend that the HSE create informational materials on the AON process for both parents and children and commit to meaningful engagement with children regarding the AON process.</p><p> It is clear from our report that the international children&rsquo;s rights framework offers significant guidance to the Government on the general and specific measures it must adopt to ensure that all children&rsquo;s rights are respected, protected and fulfilled in Ireland.  As members of the committee may be aware, the UNCRC committee urged the State to incorporate the UNCRC into domestic law as a matter of priority in 2016.  It remains an unfinished project and one I recommend that we complete.  Incorporation would give children, young people and their representatives the power to go to court to enforce their rights, with the effect of building children&rsquo;s rights into the fabric of decision-making in Ireland.  I emphasise that assessment of need is simply a gateway to receiving services and the importance of the subsequent availability of services should be recognised.</p><p> I again thank the committee for inviting my office to attend.  My colleagues and I are happy to take any questions if we can be of further assistance.</p></speech>

The report states that the average waiting time for an assessment of need is 19 months.  Despite legal requirements to the effect that the HSE commence and complete an assessment within three and six months, respectively, of an application having been received, this is not being done.  What does Dr. Muldoon recommend be done to improve the service?  Parents are at their wits' end trying to get assessments of need for their children in order that they can access the appropriate services.</p><p>Are long wait times for assessments of need occurring throughout the State, in each CHO area, or are there differing levels of waiting lists among the CHOs?  If there are areas where the system is working, can we examine what is happening there and try to replicate it?  We need to move away from this post-Covid politics and provide the same level of treatment for everybody, irrespective of where in the State the person lives.</p><p>An hour or two ago, I received copies of letters sent to parents of children in my area of Dublin West in respect of Covid.  One might ask what impact Covid-19 has had on assessments of need.  One letter is to the parents of Teddy, a young boy from Clondalkin on the waiting list to be seen by the children's disability team.  The letter states:</p> <blockquote> 	As some of you are aware we are operating with a much reduced team in recent months.  Some of our team are supporting Covid-19 testing part-time while continuing to work with the team.  Recruitment for more permanent staff for testing centres is taking place and we look forward to our team testers returning to us full time in the coming weeks.<br /><br />To support the processing of the backlog of Assessment of Need (AON) requests in this Community Health Organisation (CHO) some of the team have been redeployed temporarily to assist colleagues across the CHO with this backlog. </blockquote> <p>Testing and tracing is vital, as we have heard since day one, when this pandemic landed on our shores, but it cannot be to the detriment of a child's development.  It seems that the unmet needs that Dr. Muldoon mentioned are being pushed further down the line due to Covid.  He might comment on the impact that Covid is having on the service, which was already not meeting the needs of children.</p><p>I will read out one of the stories that was told to me in order to put it on the record.  It is well documented that early diagnosis, intervention and access to services greatly improves the development of the child.  There were four stories in the report, one of which, about a girl called Sarah, stuck with me more than the others.  The report states:</p> <blockquote> 	Sarah has been privately assessed as having ASD.  She also has sensory issues, is unable to wash or dress herself, and her co-ordination is poor.  When she was four years old, her mother applied to her local HSE Early Intervention Team for an AON.  She was informed that Sarah would have to wait at least 27 months for an AON and that, when she turned five, she would be transferred to the School Aged Team waiting list.  Sarah would not receive any priority on that list, despite &lsquo;aging out&rsquo; of the Early Intervention Team waiting list. </blockquote> <p>This seems to be the case across the spectrum.  When kids get to a certain age and have not had their needs met, they put back to the bottom of another list.  That needs to be addressed.  The report goes on:</p> <blockquote> 	Sarah&rsquo;s mother complained to the HSE regarding the delay.  Her complaint was upheld but Sarah has still not received an AON. </blockquote> <p>The report states that 100% of complaints in 2018 were upheld.  That is a damning indictment of the system.  All the complaints were upheld, yet still there have been no changes.  If a child gets treatment when he or she needs it, he or she will be less likely to need acute adult services.  Prevention is better than the cure.</p><p>The OCO could probably write another report to answer my questions but I am not asking for comprehensive answers to all of them.  What are the problems with the assessment of need process?  I acknowledge that our guests have mentioned some of them.  Is it a funding issue or a lack of resources?  Is there an issue with the recruitment and retention of staff?  Are there systemic failures or is there a lack of political will?  Is it all of the above?  How can things be improved?  That is the question that parents have been asking me today.  They are at their wits' end and some of them are pulling their hair out trying to get the services their children deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120100002#B00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions, which I am happy to address.  On the Covid-19 implications, we certainly know from complaints we have received that children with disabilities have been left behind again in this case.  The redeployment of staff to various roles relating to Covid-19, whether testing and tracing or whatever it might be, has left a gap of seriously experienced and qualified individuals not being available to children who need assessment.</p><p>That is not even robbing Peter to pay Paul, it is just robbing Peter and leaving nothing for Paul.  That was an unfortunate decision and, especially at this stage, we should be able to bring back our professionals.  Health and social care professionals should be back working on the front line of their areas, whether as an occupational therapist, OT, speech and language therapist, SLT, or therapist of any other kind.  The situation that the Deputy talked about in his constituency is mirrored across the country, where healthcare professionals were moved into Covid-19 support.  My instinct is that we have a lot of people who are not working and I would have thought we could have trained them up quickly to do testing and tracing.  It is a shame that we use professionals who would otherwise be treating our children.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about funding, resources, retention of staff and political will.  What we are seeing here is decades of dereliction of duty by previous Governments when it comes to funding and resourcing disability services.  No Government can stand proud and even though funding has increased over the past ten years, the service and system have not changed.  The Deputy mentioned the case report of Sarah and that was a great example of a system that set itself up to ensure that children do not get in.  A three-year-old child goes on a waiting list which expires when they are five.  If one knows that the waiting list is two and a half years, then that system is geared against the child.  The Government and the HSE needed to have changed that over the past ten years and it has not happened.  That is a matter of political will to push things to change.  It is also a matter of political will to fund it in the right way and to get the right number of professionals on board.  There need to be staff resources, retention of staff, an increase in the training programmes earlier on so that enough social workers, SLTs and OTs come out of the system.</p><p> The Deputy also asked what we would recommend when the average waiting time is 19 months.  There are a couple of things to recommend.  The Government should stop taking parents who challenge it to the High Court and paying huge legal costs to bring parents who are suing on a legal obligation that the Government has in legislation to court.  That would save money that could be diverted in the right direction.  We need to look at how the system has adapted.  We need to find enough appropriate professionals to do the assessment of need.  I am very much aware that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, have put together &euro;7.8 million to try to reduce the waiting list.  I hope that works but it must work in a way that does not just move people from one waiting list to another.  That has been an old-fashioned, three-card trick of the system that has been played by the services.  We cannot allow that to happen anymore.  Our eyes are open now and we cannot be tricked again.  The situation needs to be clear for the future for every child.  Coming off the waiting list has to mean the child is accessing services and not just having the assessment done.</p><p> The Deputy also asked about differences in geographical region and community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Ciara McKenna-Keane, on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara McKenna-Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120100002#C00200"><p>There is a lack of consistency between CHOs, as we addressed a little bit in our report.  From the HSE quarterly reports, we know that there has been an increase in the volume of assessments of needs within all the CHOs.  There is certainly a divergence and disparity in terms of the final number received, how quickly the assessment reports are completed and how quickly the service statements are finalised and the services provided to those children.  It reflects a lack of cohesion and consistency in approach across assessments of needs within and between CHOs.  We deal with it a little in the report.  As Dr. Muldoon has stated, the standards for assessments of needs were actually devised during the interim HIQA in May 2007 and I think HIQA itself would say that they are outdated.  We had put in a proposal for that to be prioritised.  That will not happen and perhaps it will go in the mix in August 2022.  In the meantime, we need to look at what can be done to standardise approaches and make sure that the actual care received by the children is measured against optimal care.  These children need early intervention and services to meet the needs assessed.</p> <p>  The other issue in this area is the standard operating procedures that were introduced by the HSE.  They now have preliminary assessment teams who are doing a 90-minute assessment with two professionals within a three-month time limit.  While they are keeping within the time limits of the Disability Act, the actual substance of the assessments is, arguably, not as sufficient as that envisaged within the Act.  Timelines are being met but obligations under the Act are not.  That is another issue.  As Dr. Muldoon has stated, we would be in favour of an expert group on children with disabilities to look not only at a review of the Disability Act and how it would align with the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which is a little more needs based, but also how, in practice, that legislation and those regulations are implemented in terms of the assessments themselves and how services flow from those assessments.  While it is disappointing that HIQA will not be looking at this, there is still something that can be done in this area.  We can also align it with policy changes that have taken place since 2005 whereby there has been less of a diagnosis-led approach and more of a needs-led approach that looks at the child holistically.  That is required under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p></speech>

It is an important piece of work that brings together all the issues, stories and concerns of parents.  It is a complex area for parents to try to navigate.  It is an incredibly frustrating and worrying area for parents and I imagine many of them are appreciative of the work our guests have done and the light they have shone on the area.</p> <p>  There is a series of recommendations in the report.  Has the Minister or the Department sat down with our guests to go through the recommendations in the report to see what progress can be made on them?  </p> <p>  When one goes through the report, what stands out are the stories of the four children, the impacts on them and their families, and how long it went on for.  The report states that Lucy is now 11 years of age and is still not receiving any of the clinical services assessed to meet her needs as a six-year-old.  How difficult that must be for Lucy and her family.  While Sarah's complaint to the HSE was upheld, she still has not received an assessment of need.  Our guests brought the issue as far as a point where they could highlight those cases, but has anything happened for those children since our guests raised the matter?  Do they think that the office of the ombudsman has enough power?  It can highlight these sorts of things, but is there anything that would benefit the role and office of the ombudsman to try to bring these cases forward a bit more, rather than just highlighting them and leaving it to the Department or the Oireachtas to resolve?</p> <p>  A new system is being brought into play.  I have been talking to many people in the area who are concerned about what it will mean for children accessing the correct resources for their needs and that it might be a tick-box exercise that will put everything for children on the long finger and further disadvantage them.  What are our guests' feelings about the new system that is being brought in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120100002#C00400"><p>I appreciate the Deputy's kind words about the report.  We have not yet sat down with the Government.  The report came out in October and we decided to wait and see where disability was going to sit.  I have a letter for the Department and I hope soon to have a meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.</p><p>I met the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, prior to the report going out and I flagged it with him.  They are certainly happy to engage with me but I have not set up a meeting to do that yet, because I was not sure whether it was the Minister for Health or the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that I would need to engage with.  I hope we will try to do that before the end of this year, and that we can sit down and thrash out what can be done from here.</p><p> The four case studies are there but the latest figures we have, which were reported in a Sunday newspaper, is that more than 6,000 children are waiting for an assessment of needs, so any one of those could have a story like this.  It is heartbreaking to see it consistently.  I have been in office for five years and I was working as director of investigations before that so I am aware of this being a situation for the past eight years.  There is a lack of progress and a lack of planning to get the resources in place to allow the assessment of needs to go ahead so that, in turn, children get the services.  There is no point in giving platitudes to parents to say how brilliant they are doing.  We need to make it as easy as possible.  It is such a tough job looking after a child who has additional needs.  It should be made as smooth as possible to get all the services that are needed.  One parent described herself as a psycho parent.  In order to get anything, one has to scream loud and consistently and that is not the way we should set up our system and society.  It is a really difficult one.</p><p> As regards the standard operational procedure, my colleague outlined the new process.  There are question marks over whether it will provide what we want it to provide in terms of the 90-minute assessment.  I worked previously as a psychologist and I am aware of what was involved in the previous level of assessment of needs.  It could take up to three months to do it, with three or four professionals involved.  One might see a child for the first day and he or she might just run around and it is very difficult to make a call for the first half an hour or hour and then when one meets the child the following week, he or she might trust one a little bit more.  One builds up a rapport and one can see what the child is doing.  One might go to visit the child in school.  It takes time to get a sense of where a child is at.  It is unusual and difficult to do it in 90 minutes.</p><p> I will hold judgment on what happens because I am very aware that there is supposed to be a review of the standard operational procedure within the first 12 months.  I look forward to seeing what the health and social care professionals will say about this.  I know there has been some disquiet, but we will have to see if it works and if we get 6,000 children off the waiting list with a proper assessment of need that outlines the services they require.  One of the points made by the Department two years ago when it was expecting to move in this direction, is that the preliminary assessment would provide a gateway for children who did not need a full assessment of needs to get into other services to have their needs met.  As long as we see that sort of diversion, that will be progress, but I am concerned that some professionals might decide they cannot make a decision in 90 minutes and then all we are doing is kicking the can down the road.  It is something I have heard concerns about but I will not make a call on whether it is good or bad yet.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms. McAuley, who will speak about the extra powers and any concerns we might have in that regard.</p></speech>

As the committee is aware, our role as an office both in terms of our statutory complaints function and our role to promote the rights and welfare of children is a means through which we can independently assess issues affecting children and children's rights across the country, and not only to identify problems but to identify actions that we feel need to be taken in order to address those problems.<br/><br/>In working to highlight issues affecting children and their rights, including the assessment of needs and children with disabilities more generally, what we are trying to do is influence positive change with and for children.  While the office is trying to influence change, it is not necessarily our statutory role to make those changes so, for example, it is not our role to legislate and we have no power to make budgetary allocations or to recruit staff or ensure services are adequately planned, co-ordinated and resourced to meet the needs of children and young people.  I am not sure if there is a problem with our powers <i>per se</i>, but the reality is that what we are there to do is to highlight problems that children and young people across the country are facing in different aspects of their lives and to try to identify measures we feel are needed to address those problems, some of which may be implemented in the short term and others which may take more time, with a view to encouraging those who are mandated and have responsibility to deliver for children and young people through those measures to do just that.  We are going to be initiating a review of the Ombudsman for Children Act very shortly.  All going well, we hope the work to review the Act will be completed by quarter 2 of next year.  We are going to be considering a wide range of matters in terms of whether the powers of the Ombudsman for Children's Office under the Act are adequate.  Without trying to sound smart about it, it is important to bear in mind that we are not mandated and, ultimately it is not our role, probably rightly so, to do the job that others have responsibility to do.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Muldoon for the publication of his excellent report.  I wish to touch briefly on special educational needs.  An area that is not talked about much is the lack of autism units at both primary and secondary level.  Parents find it extremely difficult to get places for their children.  The places are at a premium.  Children remain in the ASD unit until their schooling ends, so the challenge is that there is not room for additional children.  The issue is whether they can be facilitated in whatever school or community setting they are in until the older student leaves.  It is becoming a major issue among the parents I meet.  They face the worst possible news that there are not resources or a place for their child.  The lack of early diagnostics or assessment of need is a significant issue.  Children in ASD units thrive in primary school and when they leave they possibly do not have a place in a secondary school.  It is a challenge to be put into a mainstream classroom.  It is not appropriate and does not meet their needs.  I ask the witnesses for some of their expertise or feedback in this area.  How do we face this challenge and meet the needs of parents and children?  How can we rectify the situation?</p></speech>

It is something I am in the process of looking at separately at the moment.  We heard of a high profile situation last year in Dublin west where more than 80 children were due to start national school and there were no spaces for them.  That led to the utilisation by the Minister for Education of a special power to designate a school to take children with special needs.  That is a nuclear option which suggests that the system has let the children down again.  Most of the children would have been identified as requiring a place from the day they were born, or very soon afterwards.  The fact that the Department of Education's building unit did not have the spaces in place is a real indictment of poor planning.  My understanding is that it happened in a number of places again this year in Dublin south and in Cork.  We need to commit public servants to find a way to make this happen, to plan ahead, to understand what the needs are, to know what the population is like in the local area and to provide for those children in a proactive manner, not retrospectively or by forcing principals on the last day of June to come up with a space by September.  It is a failure of the system when one gets to the stage where the Minister has to press the nuclear button on a designation.  We are going to take a look at that and see if there is any way we can push the Government and the services to do better in that regard.  It is a real indictment of the service provided to children and to parents.  Parents are the ones to push.</p><p>Even where designation happens, it does not always happen in the area that is most suitable for the children.  Many children, especially in Dublin, will travel 15 or 20 miles to attend the nearest school that provides a service.  That is a long journey on public transport in a Dublin setting.  In rural areas, children might have to travel 40 or 50 miles on a school bus or in a taxi.</p><p> We need to commit to planning ahead with multi-annual budgeting so that, knowing the number of children being born who are recognised as having additional needs, the schools will provide for them ahead of schedule.  All new schools being built are being designed with special education classrooms.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is considering a plan for the future of education for children with special needs.  That may include more campus-type settings where all of the children would be on the same campus.  All of these initiatives are positive but the simple question is, how many children in our respective areas need special classrooms or supports?  That information should not be difficult to generate in this day and age.</p><p> I am sorry for the parents who find themselves in this situation.  I have engaged with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, on this matter.  I brought it to her attention the first time we met.  I will follow up on that in the near future.</p></speech>

Distance to services is a significant challenge.  Many people are travelling from Mayo to Galway just to access a special needs school.  The challenge down the road will be deciding where these kids will go after primary school.  Is there a possibility of building extensions to secondary schools to not only accommodate them in a special setting, but also integrate them in the overall education system?  We probably need to meet this challenge head on.  I acknowledge Dr. Muldoon's comments and appreciate them.</p></speech>

It has given me some riding instructions on where to pursue the specific issues.  On foot of the report, I have been submitting parliamentary questions that seek to gain answers in respect of metrics and where moneys will be allocated across the CHOs for assessments of needs.  What is becoming apparent to me is that there is a major disparity between individual CHOs.  For example, if one is living in CHO 1, the funding allocated from the &euro;7.8 million is &euro;214,000, but if one is living in CHO 9, the allocation is approximately &euro;1.9 million.</p> <p>  My question is on processes and standardisation.  This is a small country and I do not understand why there is such disparity between the CHOs in terms of the progressing disability services, PDS, programme for children.  I am still unclear as to how the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, will be able to work effectively based on the funding allocations they have received.  Has Dr. Muldoon's office been able to critique that model in any way?  I rely on his office and we rely on the replies from the HSE, although it must be said that the HSE has a way of responding to Deputies' questions and couching the language in a particular way that does not always give us the answers to the questions we asked.  Based on the allocations provided, I remain sceptical about the ability of each CHO to deliver on the assessment of needs and diminish or tackle fully the lists for initial assessments in the first instance.  I would dearly love to hear what the witnesses have to say about whether the teams are the right structures to tackle this problem.</p></speech>

PDS teams were being discussed at the time.  I remember someone describing the situation as the NGOs and service providers currently providing a Mercedes-level service and being asked to divide it up across other areas so that everyone got a Skoda-level service.  I mean no disrespect to Skoda.  Everyone got a different level of service, but there was no additional funding, administration, building or office supports to allow providers to do that.  This is where the difficulty lies.  We believed we could take everything we had, put it into a single pile and divide it equally across the country.  That looked good on paper, but then came the negotiations on the division.</p> <p>  That there are different services in each area is an historical issue.  Where was the best charity and where was the most funding coming through charities?  Did St. John of God, the Daughters of Charity or the Brothers of Charity have better fundraisers?  Were they better negotiators of service level agreements, SLAs?  It started there and has been retained in that way.  That is how it has been in CAMHS and mental health more widely.  For example, if there was a psychiatric hospital in an area, that area got more funding when the hospital closed down.  We tried to build on top of rocky foundations and adjust from there.</p> <p>  Each team can work effectively, but we must acknowledge that we will probably have to provide it more funding and services and better administrative teams and allow the professionals to do their jobs.  The principle behind PDS so that CHOs have equal opportunity is right, but a greater level of resourcing needs to be considered.</p></speech>

It called on the HSE to reconfigure the CHOs, recruit additional therapists for disability teams and provide those teams adequate resources without delay.  Dr. Muldoon will agree that all of that needs to take place.  There is a lot of great stuff to be found in PDS.  For example, it considers needs as opposed to diagnoses purely.  In this way, a child is not just reduced to his or her impairments and is instead seen as a whole person.  National access policy is all needs led rather than diagnosis led.  There is some good stuff involved and there are great professionals on the ground.  As Dr. Muldoon stated, however, that if they are not being empowered with the requisite staff - Covid has presented an issue in this regard, with people being diverted elsewhere - and resources to conduct assessments of needs, as prescribed in the Disability Act 2005, with a focus on needs as opposed to a pure diagnosis focus, their hands will be tied.  Unfortunately, we need to consider the issue of resources again in respect of this aspect of our report.</p></speech>

Dr. Muldoon mentioned CAMHS.  Is it his view that it operates differently depending on the region?  It could be argued that there is a perception that the culture within CAMHS in some regions - these are my words - can be enclosed and silo based depending on which party of the country one is in and there is a protectiveness about each region's work such that it might be difficult to deconstruct the culture in order to deliver the service where it is most required.</p></speech>

That is probably a product of history.  Each consultant psychiatrist has a way of running it and children have fallen foul of that at times.  We have many complaints about a child being recommended to go to a CAMHS bed by a consultant psychiatrist, then when the child gets to the CAMHS bed, the consultant psychiatrist there disagrees with the diagnosis and the child is sent home again.  These things make one think that this is not child-centred and not about the best interests of the child.  Having not prepared for that today, I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

This would chime with many of us who want to see children get the services.  If there was a mechanism for reimbursement by the State for those services, that would assist us greatly in dealing with these issues.</p></speech>

I do not see it as a core pillar for the future but it is a way of driving change.  If people are being punished in some way by a lack of services, this is the way to go.  It is in line and could be thought of like treatment abroad and other systems that we already provide, such as the treatment purchase fund.  Our rationale behind it is to try to improve the system.  It is not needed but we have parents who are able to access that, and if they know that they can access it without having to borrow from the credit union, put themselves into debt, or go without food, it would make things much easier.</p></speech>

The new standard operating procedure for assessment of need was addressed in a reply to a parliamentary question of mine, which stated that the HSE has developed a standard operating procedure for the assessment of need process to ensure that children with disabilities and their families access appropriate assessment and intervention as quickly as possible, and the approach of assessment of need is consistent across all areas.  This ultimately comes down to funding, resources and money.  We know what the price of an assessment of need is in the private sector.  I do not know if there is a costing in the public sphere.  If there was an internationally recognised cost, depending on the needed level of intervention, that would help us in our understanding when interrogating the figures that the Minister, whoever that might be, puts before us.</p></speech>

I am not sure where one would get that.  Perhaps the health and social care professionals might have a figure such as that, being closer to the matter than me.</p></speech>

I have read it.  I was delayed in the Seanad so I have missed much, and I apologise if I ask anything that has already been said.  I am quite transfixed by the line in Dr. Muldoon's report about children which states:</p> <blockquote> 	They are instead &lsquo;reduced&rsquo; to their impairments.  In contrast, the rights-based model of disability recognises that disability is a social construct and impairments must not be taken as a legitimate ground for the denial or restriction of rights. </blockquote> <p>That paragraph is fantastic and encapsulates everything that I have ever believed regarding disability and children, and being children-centred.  I would value the witnesses' input, as opposed to me asking questions.  Representations that I hear when I am out and about relate to babies born with a disability that does not require later diagnosis.  For example, if a child has Down's syndrome, it is apparent from birth, yet within the health-based model and it being a health matter, we find that there is an initial support in hospital and supports then fall away.  A medical card needs to be applied for.  There is a delay in assessment by a child psychologist.  People are advised to go to private services because they may be in a postcode lottery for whether they will get a child psychologist.  When it comes to cr&egrave;ches, they need to fight for an access and inclusion model worker to work alongside the child.  I am interested in levels of complaints, investigation, and the witnesses' general view on that and what could be done to arrest this quickly.  What would the witnesses say about where I should go next as a Government Senator?</p></speech>

We continuously recommended to various Departments that there is an ability to plan ahead for children like that and recognise what they will need on an ongoing basis.  If children are severely or profoundly disabled, it will be known whether they will need wheelchairs or hoists, and as they get bigger or older, the parents will need different transport.  All those things can be planned for.  It is time to move in that direction.  The HSE needs to get multi-annual budgets for such children.  We fought long and hard with regard to Molly.  There were more than 400 children in foster care with severe and profound disability, and the HSE and Tusla are going to work on a ring-fenced budget for that.</p> <p>  Last week, we presented a case regarding Jack, where we are looking for a ring-fenced budget for a child who was in hospital with severe disabilities, and stayed there for more than two years because the HSE and Tusla could not organise or agree who was going to look after the child.  We now have commitments from both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration that that ring-fenced support will be there between the two agencies.  I always give the example that if the parent of a child sues the State and wins, the High Court will come up with a figure of &euro;5 million, &euro;6 million, &euro;10 million or whatever it might be.  We can produce that figure from the first day and say that we will allocate as it is needed and support the child, whether it is with a medical card, transport or education.  We do not need to make it as difficult as we do if we plan ahead and ring-fence those budgets.  It is a matter of rearranging how we plan things.</p> <p>  At present, we have a system from 30 or 40 years ago that has never caught up with the real world and children's rights at the centre of our system.  Reducing them to their impairments allows a person to be impersonal and make decisions that just relate to the system and say that a child does not tick the box.  We have to put the child at the front of every decision that public servants make, so they see the child, whether Jack, Molly, Sarah or any child in a case study in this Unmet Needs report, and make decisions accordingly.  The essence of children's rights and of human rights is that decisions are made based on the needs of that individual.  If a child is born with a disability, those needs are predictable.  While we will not get it right all the time, if we budgets &euro;100,000 for that child and it is not used this year, then it will roll over to next year.  The parents can come and say that their car is five years old and ask for help, or that they need a new wheelchair, and we can say yes to those requests, since it is in the budget.</p><p>Those sorts of things can make life so much easier for children and their parents.  There is a fallout for siblings and other members of the family as well when families have to fight and struggle for these things.  It is heartbreaking for other family members to see this and to see their parents struggling to get basic needs for their child.  I would say that we need to start revamping the system so that we can budget for the predictable needs and put them in place.  Obviously, the members, as politicians, like to be able to adjust budgets accordingly, which is fair enough.  We all work to long-term budgets and then reduce them as circumstances change.  Again, the principle is established that if one is born with a disability, one is entitled to X, Y and Z and that should be a given.  It can be discussed from there on in as opposed to fighting every two years, when a medical card needs to be renewed, to prove that one's child still has a short foot or still needs the use of a wheelchair.  These are distressing things that do not need to be there and are not in the essence of children's rights.  Perhaps I will leave my comments there.</p></speech>

Any business nowadays is looking that way and considering how all of the units help each other, what can be learned from unit A to unit B, and how one can cross-fertilise information so that we can all do a better job.  The rationale for the data gathering is that every healthcare professional feeds into it and then the Government, as a whole, understands that.  At the moment the data is not gathered.  In the Molly case, we asked how many children with severe and profound disabilities are in foster care.  Three years later, the HSE still would not agree how many there were after Tusla had said there were over 450.  The HSE will not agree because if it does, it will have to deal with the issue.  It is the gathering and naming of data that allows one to make decisions and if the HSE does not gather data, it can avoid making decisions.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Muldoon for his report and the important work he does on behalf of children and their families.  Being a parent is probably the scariest thing that most of us can do as it brings enormous responsibilities and none of us knows what visible or invisible challenges our children will have.  The report confirms the sad reality for many parents and children, which is unacceptable.  I know many parents and young children with challenges that range from not so significant to significant.  What Dr. Muldoon said about a failure to focus on the child, and a failure to allocate resources and responses based on the child's need, is spot on.  We need to change that if we are going to value all of our children equally.  We need to organise our resources to respond to the child's needs as opposed to all of the other things that are going on around that child's life.  Dr. Muldoon has given examples.</p> <p>  In terms of the battles I have seen parents having to undertake, it is enough to be rearing, caring for and nurturing one's child, while possibly having other children as well.  These parents should not have to battle and constantly justify.  The default in my part of Dublin is for many parents to borrow money from credit unions or grandparents to get a private assessment of needs, which should not be the case.  That at least gives many parents an assessment of need but it is not enough because they must undertake all of the other battles that follow on from there.  There is often an insidious insinuation that if people can pay for a private assessment of need, what else can they pay for?  It should not be like that.  The child cannot pay for anything.  These are young children.  As a committee, we need to forward this report to the Minister and seek a response.  The report contains some strong recommendations which we should champion and progress within the Government.  There is a new Minister so let us try and do that. </p> <p>  I wish to mention two areas that I would like the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to keep an eye on and maybe undertake some work on, if possible.  One is the assessment of special educational needs.  The housing needs are enormous as well, but this is not necessarily recognised or taken into account.  We have a housing crisis but the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the approved housing bodies and the local authorities need to standardise.  A child's diagnosis of special needs should be recognised as a qualifying housing criterion and resourced accordingly.</p> <p>  I have come across a number of cases in which there has been a real gap in the progression of care and response to the needs of children as they have become teenagers, young adults and then adults.  While I appreciate that Dr. Muldoon is the Ombudsman for Children, I believe it is worthwhile to flag this gap with him.  I ask him to come back to the committee to debate this issue at a future date.  I am experiencing quite a number of families who have young adults now but once a child reaches 16, 17 and 18 years of age, and then reaching their 20s, there is a bit of a gap.  Their parents and families are having to start the process all over again.  That introduces a whole new stress and disruption for the individual child and the family.  I thank Dr. Muldoon for all the work he is doing and for his report.</p></speech>

She highlighted the failure to focus on children and allocate resources for them.  From our point of view, one of the recommendations that would go a long way would be the incorporation of the UNCRC.  As a nation, moving in that direction should not be so scary because the Scottish Parliament is debating whether to do so this week.  Our incorporation of the UNCRC would put children at the centre and be a step further than the constitutional referendum of 2012.  That is something that the committee, as legislators, could think about moving forward on.</p> <p>  In terms of future work, we have had complaints relating to disability involving the adjustment and renovation of houses for children of certain ages and certain styles of problems.  Again, that feeds into the concept that I mentioned.  We know these children are going to need help and will need to have the doors in their homes widened.  One of the greatest regrets that I have is still the story of a child who grew up immobile.  By the age of 12, he was 6 ft 3 in. and his mother was still washing him in a kitchen because she could not carry him upstairs.  Those kinds of things can be predicted, funded for and planned for across the board through intergovernmental, interagency and interdepartmental work.  Certainly the housing need is crucial from that point of view, with disability being a criterion.</p> <p>  Forward planning is needed as the child moves into adulthood.  Different services will deliberately avoid taking responsibility.  I have seen situations where the HSE will allow a child to stay in a residential centre until he or she is 19 knowing that Tusla will not evict him or her, but that is playing Russian roulette with a child's life and not planning ahead.  The same things applies to children who still live at home as they move from a child's service to an adult's service.  That is about predictable transfer.  The child's mental health and well-being, and the family's mental health and well-being, can be facilitated enormously by knowing from 16 years of age that we are planning for this, we know how it is going, we are ready to go and we know what will happen so the child has a real sense of progress.</p><p>It should not be beyond the wit of our services to provide that sort of thing, once there is a commitment to putting the child first.</p></speech>

I am listening through headphones and watching on screens.</p><p>Dr. Muldoon will be glad to know that I have saved the best meeting for last.  I read his statement last night and I thank him for all the work that he and the Ombudsman for Children's office are doing for children.  I am a father to three young children aged five, four and two, and when they go beyond our front door in the morning, we entrust them to teachers, who are excellent, but we also rely on offices such as Dr. Muldoon's to be guardians for all children in the country.</p><p>I wish to make a number of points.  To put them into context at the outset, I was a primary school teacher for 16 years until February 2020, so I have seen the best and worst in State supports.  I also have seen the very best in respect of how teachers and parents cobble resources together, deliver and do their best for children regardless of the circumstances.  First, I want to focus on the private assessment of needs, which has been mentioned already today, whereby parents with the financial wherewithal have private assessments done.  This introduces a degree of financial elitism and an element of &quot;we have it, so we can do it&quot; into disability, and disability should not be like that.  There was a time when a parent could drive a few miles down the road, fork out a few hundred euro, and come away with a decent psychological report on their child.  However, given the spectrum of special needs, they would probably have to get an occupational therapy report next, and could end up forking out &euro;1,000 or &euro;2,000 just to get to the bottom of the cause of the child's difficulties and the supports that are required for that child.  There was a time when a parent could go, armed with those reports, to the school principal, and could feed the findings into the chain, right through to the Department of Education, and see the supports slowly trickle into place.</p><p>Increasingly, however, private needs assessments are not being accepted and only those referred through the school mechanism are being forwarded onwards to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  NEPS staff have come to my local school and the work they do is fantastic but there are not enough of them.  They receive a shortlist of children who have been referred for assessment.  Around a week before they come to a school, the principal will ask staff if there are children in their classes that they or the parents feel need to be assessed or reported.  A shortlist is then drafted but the psychologist will have neither the time nor the resources to see all children on the list, so each year, there are children who should be seen but are not being seen, who have been referred through that mechanism.  That is a very serious issue.</p><p>I also want to highlight that there is an overemphasis on the more visible disabilities.  Physical disabilities can be seen, and what can be seen can be tackled.  That has always been how humankind has seen difficulties and challenges; it is seen and fixed.  However, there are many children with conditions such as dyspraxia and others which are unseen and can remain undetected for many years.  I know of one local parent who told me that around one week after her son's leaving certificate examinations, he had decided to get his own assessment done, and he realised in adulthood much more about who he was as a person.  Through no fault of his parents or the school, he had missed out and this was the fault of the mechanisms of support provided by the State.  It is wrong that he left the education system and discovered a week later what his challenges were and how they could have been met in those years before that.</p><p>I will conclude shortly but I will make a few more points.  I have a huge problem with special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  I do not have a problem with them personally but with how they take reports, which contain hours and days of work on the part of educational psychologists - which are hefty, solid reports that dig deep into the needs and challenges of a child with special needs and that contain recommendations on how the child could be supported - and, without qualifications to equal or surpass those of the educational psychologists, interpret the reports and strike out paragraph after paragraph, ruling out support and recommendations.  That this is happening shows that there is a problem with the law.  If we took the political hats off some of the members attending the committee today, we would see that they have professional expertise.  I would not for a moment stand up in any court of law and begin to question their integrity or ability to provide certain professional services, unless I was equally qualified.  It is wrong that SENOs are empowered by the State to dismantle and dissect the reports of educational psychologists when they are not educational psychologists.  It is fundamentally and legally wrong.  I am surprised there has not been a case taken to the High Court on this issue.  Recommendations for physical aids and appliances and assistive technology are also being struck out by individuals who are not as qualified as the professional who has recommended the use of these aids and appliances.  There is something fundamentally, legally and morally wrong in that.  </p><p>I want to address a few other points.  Irish language exemptions are the bane of the lives of many teachers and parents.  I know that people watch these meetings, and before there are comments on Twitter, I wish to state that I am not anti-Irish language.  I love the Irish language but I do not love to witness a child struggling with a language that is causing them huge difficulty, aggravation and stress every day.  The criteria for exempting a child from learning Irish are too strict.  The child must attain results in standardised tests below the tenth percentile in a literacy attainment, which can be in word reading, reading comprehension or spelling.  The gauge is too narrow and does not factor in the stresses caused by dyslexia and other issues that could be making it a colossal challenge for the child to learn the language every day.  There are children who could function much better at school if that stress was taken away from them.  If a child is able to learn Irish, then they should plough on, and I support them in doing so.  It was said 20 or 30 years ago that one needed Irish to become a garda or a teacher.  That is codswallop.  If a child is suffering from stress and does not want to go to school because learning the language is too much for them, then the exemption criteria should be widened.  </p><p>The last point I wish to make is that there is a deficiency in ASD units in schools, particularly in secondary schools, and some schools are passing the buck.  There are large towns in Ireland with populations of 25,000 to 35,000 people that have an ASD unit in a school that only has capacity for six children.  I would not even attempt to break down the percentages of that but it comes up well short of what is required.  Finally, I wish to echo the point made so eloquently by Senator Fitzpatrick.  It is an issue which is close to my heart, although I will not bring personal experiences into it, but there is a real drop off in supports provided when a child reaches adolescence and becomes an adult.  They are treated by the general mental health services and psychological support services and overall, there is a shortfall in respect of the support provided at this stage.  There are many aspects to a child, teenager and an adult coping and grappling with special needs in their life.  The intellectual aspect is just one part of it.  A person could be physically or emotionally healthy or the imbalances could be calibrated in a different way but the State supports are not meeting the needs as the children move beyond childhood and adolescence and into adulthood.  </p><p><i></i>I have said enough.  I am here to support Dr. Muldoon, not to grill him and I have full faith in him.  If there is an issue that needs to be tackled and highlighted by this committee, it is that people who are not qualified enough are striking out recommendations.  I would not tell a plumber or a mechanic how to do their job.  A SENO should not look at of a volume of reports that are pivotal to a child's life and strike out the recommendations others have made.  It is wrong, and I ask that the issue is championed by Dr. Muldoon's office.</p></speech>

I know that some of the issues raised concern education, for example, I am not sure that Dr. Muldoon will be able to respond on the issue of the Irish-language exemption.  I ask him to respond to the issues raised that he can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020120100002#H00400"><p>I appreciate Deputy Crowe's kind words.  For me, the simple answer would be for the Oireachtas to push forward on the incorporation of the UNCRC.  This would mean that if anyone who wanted to strike out recommendations made by a qualified professional would have to consider the best interests of the child and determine whether the rights of the child are still being supported without the recommendations that had been put forward.  That is something that could be championed across the Oireachtas and it is how I hope this issue could be tackled.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned schools and I have come across many high-quality schools, particularly at primary level, in relation to the assessment of needs, where often boards of management will fund private assessments for children and where the teachers and parents work together to make things happen.  That is an example of Irish people finding a way to make things happen, despite the system, and it should not be this way.   The gathering together of funds to make a private assessment, and then to find that the assessment is not necessarily accepted, regardless of the standing of the person who is writing the assessment, is a real step backwards. </p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about how visible disabilities are more easily championed.  Dyspraxia and dyscalculia are just as traumatic for children and young people and harder to find and diagnose.</p><p>Even having to think about being diagnosed in this regard can be difficult.</p><p> The physical aids and assistive technology have the same principle.  If everybody in the system is making a decision based on the best interests of the child, it should be easy to follow the logic and pattern behind it.  It comes from the system allowing it.  It comes from legislation and parents having the right to sue or take up the statutory obligation to their child's rights.  If we can provide a system such as this, it really will be supportive of the child in this regard.  This is a real way of thinking about and believing in our children that would support them.  Similarly, it would change the way they enter the adult services.  If we have statutory obligations to follow the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and put children's rights at the heart of our decision-making, there will be no way they should get as far as the age of 18 or 19 without knowing where they are moving to and what systems and services are in place for them at that stage because we will have set ourselves up as a society that really puts children at the heart of decision-making.</p></speech>

As has been said, we genuinely appreciate Dr. Muldoon coming before the committee, the report and his work in general.  I have always found a very proactive approach from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  It is very much needed, unfortunately, because as I am sure many people will agree, a child with additional needs is almost a second-class citizen.  It is acceptable to wait for a school place, and it is acceptable to have to wait for resource hours and, particularly in rural areas, for transport.  Everything is a battle and parents say this.  Then we have situations where some parents may be able to take on that battle but not every parent can.  There is a small reference to this in the report.  People may be able to make a complaint and an appeal but they get worn down by this.  It seems it is paperwork after paperwork.  We welcome the report, even though it is difficult reading in the sense that it is terrible to think that in 2020 this is where children with additional needs are.  However, it needs to be highlighted and addressed.  In this regard it is welcome.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the comment that Dr. Muldoon made earlier about HIQA.  Did HIQA give a reason in the letter?  Perhaps Dr. Muldoon cannot go into it, and I respect if he cannot do so, but it seems to be another example of second-class citizens whereby children with additional needs will not be considered immediately.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Dr. Muldoon spoke about amending section 18 to expand the powers of the disability appeals officer to provide compensation as a remedy for breaches under the Act.  Will we have to get to this stage before we see any real progress?  At the end of the day, it is money.  Unfortunately, it is when people have to pay out money that they sit up and pay attention.  It should not have to get to that stage but it seems as though it will.  I can think of so many people who could potentially fall into that category if it were the case.  What does Dr. Muldoon think about this?</p> <p>  We all get many representations from parents who are heartbroken trying to get an assessment of needs, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy or ASD class places.  It is overwhelming.  I thank the members for their contributions today as they touched on many important points.  I thought the point on housing was excellent as often we have a battle with local authorities on children with autism.  There might not be a need for a wheelchair ramp but children need space.  Perhaps they need their own room or a breakout room.  I cannot think of the exact word.</p></speech>

I know there is a name but I cannot think of it.  This is just as important and sometimes it is dismissed by local authorities.  It is great that we have had the opportunity to raise these issues today.  If Dr. Muldoon is able to do so, I ask him to answer my question on the HIQA letter.  I believe we will have to get to a stage where there is financial compensation before we see changes and I would like Dr Muldoon's opinion on this.</p></speech>

I will deal with the question on financial penalties and hand over to my colleague on HIQA.  I struggled with putting the financial penalty into the recommendations because I felt it was such a draconian old-fashioned way of doing things, whereby we have to use a stick to get some sort of compliance in moving forward.  However, if that is the way we have to do it, and we find we are paying penalties of X million euro every year instead of diverting those millions to making the system work, that is fine if it is what we need to do for a certain period of time but it is a shame that we even have to think that way.  From our point of view we should be well past that.  We should be progressive.  We should be thinking about the future.  We should be future-proofing these systems.  There should be no question as to whether a child will get what he or she needs in the time set out in the legislative books.  As I said previously, instead of spending money to fight parents who go to the High Court just to get an assessment of need in the time the law says it should take place, we should divert the money to creating resources and funding them.  If the financial penalty works I will be delighted.  It would be a shame if it does work but anything that moves things forward and makes it less intractable would be a positive.  I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. McAuley, to discuss HIQA and give an outline on it.</p></speech>

It can speak for its own process but it has a prioritisation process to decide what types of new standards to develop and when to do so.  Consideration was given to our suggestion that new standards be developed on assessments of need in the context of this process.  One of the issues in this regard is that, as the Chairman is familiar with, there are existing standards since 2007 but there seems to be broad consensus that the standards are outdated, too generalised and not aligned with HIQA's current methodology for standards.  In some cases, they are factually inaccurate.  The difficulty we have is they are the only standards we have.  Despite their flaws they are what we have got.  They cannot be retired, as we understand it, until new standards are put in place.  We are in a funny situation really and in a sense what it comes down to is the importance of standards.  Standards are there to do various things but one very important thing they do is establish clarity on what is expected, whereby services know what they are expected to do and families, parents and children know what they are entitled to expect from services.  It is a real problem that there will not be new standards developed allowing that the existing standards are widely regarded as deficient.</p></speech>

I am director of housing services for Cl&uacute;id Housing Association as well as chair of the Beacon South Quarter Owners' Management Company and the Construction Defects Alliance.  The reason I have taken up these roles is to use Cl&uacute;id's property expertise to help resolve an issue that is crippling many ordinary households and negatively affecting the reputation of apartment living, which is a key component of long-term planning for our urban centres.</p><p>On behalf of the Construction Defects Alliance, I thank the committee for giving us this opportunity to address the real-life experience of homeowners who are having to deal with structural defects in their homes which have arisen through no fault of their own but for which they have been left holding the baby.  We hope that the committee's deliberations today will contribute to the delivery of the relevant commitments in the programme for Government.<br/><br/>The Construction Defects Alliance is an informal grouping, which has the support of the Apartment Owners Network, AON, currently involving hundreds of owners and owners' management companies, OMCs, from over 80 different developments around the country which are affected by construction defects.  We also have active involvement from some of the professionals who are working with the owners and OMCs concerned.  Our panel is made up of Mr. D&oacute;nal Nugent, Mr. Barry Mulhern and Ms Ciara Holland, who are owners of apartments that have experienced defects, as is Mr. Des McCabe from AON, and Mr. Stephen Scott from Scott Murphy, who is managing the remediation of many defective apartment developments.<br/><br/>The alliance&rsquo;s campaign has one very simple aim, which is the implementation of this committee's Safe as Houses? report.  Most of the members of the alliance own homes in apartment developments, the majority of which were built during the Celtic tiger era.  However, some predate that era and some defective homes were also built after 2008.It is worth bearing in mind that Central Statistics Office, CSO, data shows that over 131,000 apartments were built during the period 2000 to 2008, just before the financial crash and deep recession which hit this country.  We simply do not know how many are affected by defects.  Indeed, because of the consequences in terms of potential remediation and insurance costs, loss of property value and difficulty in selling their homes, many homeowners simply do not want to know if their apartments or houses are affected by fire or other defects.  From a health and safety point of view, this is an appalling vista.  We cannot continue with a hear no evil, see no evil approach to the issue of fire and other defects.  We do not even have to mention Grenfell Tower to see to where that road leads.  Earlier this year, Eamon O'Boyle, fire engineer and one of the expert witnesses before this committee in 2017, wrote in the <i>Engineer&rsquo;s Journal</i>:</p><blockquote>	Fire safety of apartments is one of the many &lsquo;legacy issues&rsquo; to be faced by government and it cannot be long-fingered until there is a tragedy.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It is essential that high-risk buildings be identified, and the initial focus should be on buildings where people sleep overnight. These include apartments, hotels, hospitals, dormitories and student accommodation blocks.  </blockquote><p>It is important to point out that while a review of high-risk building was undertaken at Government&rsquo;s behest post Grenfell, it only covered buildings over 18 m high so the vast majority of multi-unit developments in Ireland were not part of this review&rsquo;s remit.  In real terms, the process of identifying high-risk buildings has yet to be carried out.  In terms of the metrics of the problem in Ireland, Eamon O&rsquo;Boyle estimates that 75% of Celtic tiger era apartments are affected by fire defects which would mean, based on CSO statistics, that almost 100,000 apartments have legacy defects.  The cost of remediation is unknown but, based on experience, it can vary between &euro;5,000 to &euro;60,000 per apartment, with &euro;15,000 seeming to be the median cost.<br/><br/>It is important to step back and look at the nature of defects and they largely fall under two headings, namely, fire and water ingress.  The fire issues arise because insufficient fire stopping was put in place during the construction process or it was put in incorrectly.  This is a critical issue for people living in multi-unit developments as fire stopping is the material used to compartmentalise one apartment from another and from the common areas and to impede the spread of fire if one breaks out.  Fire stopping allows a conflagration to be tackled at its seat and also facilitates an orderly evacuation of the affected premises.  If there is insufficient fire stopping in place, then fire and smoke spread more quickly than they should, which makes the task of containment and safe evacuation much more hazardous, or worse.<br/><br/>The problem with fire stopping is that it is hidden behind walls, around doors and in between floors and ceilings.  Therefore, nobody purchasing an apartment can see whether it is in place or not and they take the fire certificate at face value.  The issue of inadequate fire stopping generally comes to light when people smell smoke or cooking fumes from another apartment, hear louder noises than they should, see light coming through from someone else's home or experience water breaking through from the common areas or another apartment.  By the time these issues come to the fore, the builder, developer or both, are long gone.</p><p> Rectifying fire stopping issues requires taking down plasterboard, lifting floors and ceilings, going behind service shafts and risers and putting in additional material.  It is time-consuming and costly work.  The only way one can ensure fire stopping is properly installed in the first place is by having on-site building control oversight and supervision at intervals during the construction process.  Once the building is completed, it is too late and, of course, the State has failed to ensure the level of building control required to capture fire and other defects was in place.</p><p> As public representatives sensitive to their constituents&rsquo; concerns, I am sure members are aware that apartment defects cause the owners involved huge stress because of the financial burden, considerable worries about the spectre of fire safety and also impacts on the relationships between owners, their OMCs and the agents acting on behalf of the OMCs, all of which undermines the very idea that one&rsquo;s home is a sanctuary.  Some of my colleagues who are online will attest to that later in these proceedings.</p><p> I want to address the worries over fire safety first.  As members can imagine, all the talk over recent years about Grenfell Tower has had a profound effect on people living in properties that are not secure from a fire perspective.  It is a well-founded worry.  There have been eight fires in recent years in Beacon South Quarter with some apartments being absolutely gutted.  We know people died as a result of a fire in Verdemont, Blanchardstown.  A terrace of houses in Newbridge, County Kildare, was destroyed by fire in the not too distant past and considerable damage was done to the Metro Hotel in Ballymun when people were resident in it.</p><p> It is because of this threat that OMCs are obliged to act to remediate fire defects and to take additional fire safety measures while undertaking remediation works, including employing additional fire wardens on a 24-7 basis as well as installing additional fire alarms.  All this costs money and leads to hikes in annual service charges on top of mortgage payments, massively increased insurance costs and the remediation levies.</p><p> On the financial side, OMCs need to get in as much money as possible upfront to get the remediation works done.  There is no point in starting works without the funds in place to pay the contractors concerned.  The need to get money upfront places huge strains on owners who must find the resources to pay the levies, averaging &euro;15,000, in addition to all the other costs.</p><p> Coming back to the issue of the financial burden being experienced by homeowners, it is only fair to say it is placing huge stress on many people and we know some are really struggling to pay their levies.  Another aspect of this stress is that many homeowners are worried about the impact on their lenders and insurers if and when they find out about the defects, as well as the real concern that they may have difficulty selling their property.  Experience is that apartments affected by defects only change hands on a cash basis as financial institutions will not lend for their purchase.  These worries are why so many of the people involved in the alliance are happy to talk to their public representatives but will shy away from the media, and it is why many of them are sitting in the Gallery and not before the committee this morning.</p><p> The various stresses experienced by homeowners are also, in turn, impacting on relationships within the different developments.  For example, the agents of OMCs are tasked with collecting the levies.  This is not easy and can sometimes involve legal proceedings, which are not pleasant for all concerned.  In other cases, the OMC directors, who are only volunteers after all, have to levy sums against their neighbours.  They are deeply unhappy about this and it causes much difficulty for relations.  Let us remember that all this stress and strain arises through no fault of any of the people involved, yet they are left to mop up after other people&rsquo;s failings.</p><p> The commitments in the programme for Government to examine the issue of defective housing in the first 12 months having regard to the recommendations of the safe as houses report is the first serious effort by Government to address the matter of legacy defects, and that is why the alliance warmly welcomes it.</p><p> As members will be aware, the Government has proposed to establish a working group to conduct this review with a specific focus on legacy defects.  We are particularly pleased that the programme sets a time limit on this review process, requiring it to be completed by July 2021.  Adherence to this timeframe is crucial so that whatever recommendations come from the working group can be put to Government in sufficient time that they can be taken into the calculations for budget 2021.</p><p> We understand from what the Minister said that the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners&rsquo; Network will have one representative each on the working group and we look forward to playing our part in this process.  We also know from our ongoing dealings with the Department and the Minister that they are in the process of appointing a chairman and once this is completed, the rest of the appointment process will be undertaken.</p><p>Members might recall that at the outset, we said our aim is to campaign for the implementation of the Safe as Houses? report.  As members know, this reports sets out a range of options for tackling the costs of legacy defects, including a redress fund to be paid for by the State, the construction and insurance industries, as well as access to cheap loans and tax breaks.  The alliance's preferred solution is a redress fund and there is a precedent in terms of mica and pyrite.  We have had to address the loans issue publicly because it has been raised with us by various Oireachtas Members and political parties.</p><p> It is important that committee members and the Government are absolutely clear on our position.  Access to cheap loans on their own, whether with no interest or very low interest, would not be acceptable to the Construction Defects Alliance as a solution for tackling the costs of remediation.  While they would ease the cash flow pressure on OMCs and owners, they would still leave the owners 100% on the hook for remediating defects they did not in any way cause.  The very least the alliance would accept would be a combination of soft loans and tax breaks or a financial equivalent.</p><p> It is also important that everyone is clear that the financial solutions which arise from the working group process would have to include a retrospective element.  It is a fundamental principle for us that apartment owners who have done the right thing and have taken on the burden of paying for remediation works have to be included in whatever scheme is proposed by the Government.</p><p> I hope this opening statement sets out in broad terms the issues facing tens of thousands of homeowners around the country, in particular the stress and strains that the thing they most dreamed of, namely, having a home of their own, is now causing them and their neighbours.  As I said earlier, my colleagues can and will outline much more eloquently the nature of this lived experience during the questions and answers to follow.</p><p> It is critical that the committee and Government are aware that the full ramifications of the defects crisis in our multi-unit developments have yet to unfold.  If OMCs and apartment owners are left unassisted in the process of tackling legacy defects then this problem has the potential to completely undermine the national strategy for high density living.  The public must have confidence in apartment living and for this to be the case, they need to know that the State will intervene to ensure that high density residential accommodation works for all concerned.</p><p> I again thank the committee for asking the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners Network to appear before it this morning and we look forward to engaging with members' questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to address them today on residential building defects and proposals to help homeowners with defective homes.</p> <p>  I am a practising barrister specialising in construction law and was formerly a solicitor specialising in commercial and residential construction and infrastructure projects.  Last year, I was awarded a PhD from the law school at Trinity College Dublin on the subject of liability for building defects.  My research was prompted by the many thousands of Irish houses and apartments built during and since the Celtic tiger years that have been found to have serious defects.  From my professional experience, and as is clear from media coverage of developments around the country, there are many apartment buildings that have serious defects, including deficiencies in fire-stopping, inadequate separation between units and water ingress.  Some of the problems that have emerged with houses include pyrite damage, mainly in Dublin and the surrounding counties, and the failure of brickwork caused in part by muscovite mica, which is particularly acute in counties Mayo and Donegal.</p> <p>  The major findings of my PhD are that there are significant substantive and procedural deficiencies in the system of legal remedies for housing defects.  By substantive, I mean that a homeowner will typically find that the original building contract with the builder of their home will often not provide him or her with a remedy.  The builder may be insolvent.  If the homeowner is not the first owner of the apartment, he or she may not be able to rely on that contract.  There is a long-standing practice of builder-developers setting up a different limited company for each development that they build.  The money comes through the developer and the building company is just a shell.  Even if the owner can sue the builder, the builder is unlikely to pay for the defects in the home.  Builders are also not required to carry insurance in respect of defects.  Instead, homebuyers are steered towards latent defects policies that have significant limitations on what is recoverable.  The main home defects policy in the Irish market does not cover pyrite damage, for example, which is one of the reasons the pyrite remediation scheme was set up.</p> <p>  Homeowners also face many hurdles in securing a remedy even if they have a good legal case.  The building contract they signed may have very unfair terms in it.  It is likely to have an arbitration clause in it, which is a process the homebuyer may find difficult, and that usually will not involve other parties who might also be responsible for the defects, such as architects or engineers.</p><p>Litigation, if available, is extremely expensive and the value of the home defects would often put claims in the monetary jurisdiction of the High Court, which is a very slow and expensive process.</p><p> Some attempts have been made to hold receivers responsible for building defects.  In two recent cases, the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that receivers were not bound by the obligations of developers to complete multi-unit developments in accordance with planning and building control requirements.  This will present further obstacles for management companies and apartment owners to obtain any assistance with the costs of fixing defects.  There are many examples throughout Ireland of receivers being appointed in respect of developers&rsquo; borrowings to sell unsold parts of developments, including commercial and apartment units, and realise the lender&rsquo;s security.  If the receiver is not liable for any repair costs in respect of the defects in the development, the apartment owners will be left to pay the costs of fixing the defects.</p><p> The other major finding of my PhD thesis is that the building control system failed to prevent the occurrence of widespread building defects in Ireland.  In my opinion, the system was designed to be a light-touch regulatory system that appears strong but that has never been enforced in a robust or consistent way.  The building control system, which forms the backbone of Irish construction regulation, operates without oversight from an external building regulator and is not enforced consistently, in contrast to other regulated industries.  Failure to give proper consideration to the appropriate regulatory model for construction led to design failures in the system that have compromised its legitimacy and effectiveness since its introduction in 1991.  Insurance models in respect of building defects are limited and unsatisfactory, which will undermine any law reform to improve remedies.  </p><p> These problems are not unique to Ireland.  In many other jurisdictions, there are licensing and registration requirements, insurance obligations and regulatory powers that are visible and enforced.  In Ireland, there is no licensing or registration requirement for construction work and the regulatory system operated by local authorities is under-resourced and underfunded compared with other sectors.</p><p> There have been some developments in the UK since the Grenfell Tower fire which will be of interest to the committee.  Following this fire, the Irish Government established a fire safety task force which reported in 2018, but which failed to address the underlying causes, both in industry practice and in regulation, that have led to widespread residential defects, including fire safety-related defects.  There has been a comprehensive review of building regulations and fire safety in the UK in the two reports of the Hackitt review, which was initiated following the Grenfell fire and resulted in the 2020 building safety Bill.  This proposes a regulator for building safety within the UK Health and Safety Executive, responsible for ensuring the safety of persons in all new multi-occupancy buildings in England over 18 m high.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a new homes ombudsman, which had been recommended by a parliamentary committee some years back, and makes provision both for the publication of a code of conduct for developers as well as criminal liability of officers and managers of bodies corporate for offences committed under the Act.</p><p> I am happy to deal with the committee&rsquo;s questions.</p></speech>

Some of the witnesses will be familiar with this committee, having appeared before us in 2017 and 2019.  Many members are new to the committee and this is a good opportunity for us to engage with the witnesses again.  When we were discussing our work programme and themes for the committee, this issue was high on the agenda for many members to follow up.  I welcome, as outlined by Ms Cottier, the commitment in the programme for Government to address this issue and the establishment of the.  We can discuss that later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and submissions.  As the Chairman said, as new committee members, we were very keen to address this issue early in our work programme.  It has to be every homeowner's worst nightmare to find, having finally bought a home, that the security of the property has been undermined, not knowing how badly it has been undermined or how much at risk it is.  I am a former city councillor and I am also from Dublin city.  It is very important, not just for the individual homeowners, that this issue is urgently addressed by the Government.</p><p>For the city's development and urban development generally we have to take real and decisive action to re-establish some level of confidence in apartment living in dense residential high-rise buildings and offer some security to homeowners and society at large.</p><p> The Government has committed to quite a tight timescale.  It aims to have the working group established and for it to have reported  by July of next year so that the work can then feed into the budget of the following year.  I presume that the groups are ready to engage with that process.  It was mentioned that they have already had discussions with the Minister.  I would be interested to know what feedback the Minister has given it in terms of the timelines.  I suggest that the committee write to the Minister after this meeting and advise him that we have met and are seeking the urgent establishment of a working committee so that the timelines in the programme for Government can be met.</p><p> I can understand why homeowners do not want to self-identify their properties as being at risk of fire or being affected by other safety issues.  The establishment of some form of register of affected properties will be critical to dealing with this issue so that there is transparency.  Homeowners will only be willing to do that when they know there will be support for them in responding to the issues identified.  When the witnesses reply, perhaps they could talk about how ready homeowners are to participate in that process and if it is likely that some form of register of affected properties can be established.</p><p> Until we can quantify the legacy issues, we cannot deal with them and have some form of redress.  I accept the point Ms Cottier and the members of the Construction Defects Alliance are making on the redress having to remove the burdens from, rather than adding an additional burden to, homeowners.  The focus of the working group needs to be on ensuring that all future construction works avoid the mistakes of the past, that controls are put in place and that certification and regulations are robust and enforced.</p></speech>

The key to that is defining the scope of the committee.  That has been done by the Department.  One key aspect is identifying the scale of the problem.  We are happy with the make-up of the committee, which includes people with lived experience from the Apartment Owners Network and the Construction Defects Alliance.  It also includes legal experts and construction professionals.  The make-up of the committee is important, as is its scope.  The scope is about construction defects rather than broadening the scope, which will be vital to ensuring that the committee delivers its report within the timeline specified.</p> <p>  In terms of self identifying, over the past few years more people have been willing to come forward because they are not feeling as alone.  Having a forum like the Construction Defects Alliance means that people can come forward anonymously and there is a voice for them.  We have to remember that, in the context of my comments on relationships, there is never a uniform situation in an owners' management company where people want to out the situation they are in.  That was our experience in Beacon South Quarter.  There was a lot of animosity when people chose to go to the media but others did not want that.  That caused a severe breakdown among neighbours and in the owners' management company.</p> <p>  The more this conversation is had in the public sphere and as the committee progresses and we keep a close eye on that, we will find more and more people will come forward and outline their experiences.</p></speech>

Mr. Stephen Scott is working on a number of schemes and there are people who are aware of this issue.  The more professionals are involved, we will begin to see a scope of work materialise.  I do not want to underplay how difficult that is.  The reality is that until one starts opening up walls, one cannot always check on the scale.  One might know a development is affected.  Mr. Stephen Scott might be able to give more information about that.</p></speech>

As has been discussed among the surveying fraternity, there could be a role for engaging with professional bodies, such as the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and Engineers Ireland, to canvass their members without necessarily having to identify specific apartments or get the consent of owners.  This would give some sense of the number of schemes which have been remediated and their costs and those which are currently under investigation and their likely budget costs.  That would be some mechanism of getting a sense of what the problems are to date, even though there are other schemes which have not been inspected yet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#G00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for the two presentations.</p> <p>  The issue of latent defects is a scandal.  The committee has to understand the extent of the scandal.  The previous committee did significant work and agreed unanimously on a good report in 2017, which set out clearly what we felt the Government needed to do in this area.  It is not just bad builders and developers that caused the problems which the homeowners experienced.  They were able to do that because the regulatory regime was weak.</p> <p>  If one goes back and reads the D&aacute;il transcripts from the late 1980s and early 1990s when the regulatory regime was introduced, a small number of Deputies said not to allow this form of self-regulation to be introduced or, at a future point in time, homeowners would be left with huge bills and no legal protection.  The Oireachtas was warned when the old system was being passed into legislation and ignored that advice.  Unfortunately, the correct predictions of that small number of Deputies came to pass.</p> <p>  It is regrettable that the previous Government, despite the fact that we had cross-party unanimity in this committee, held the line that latent defects was a private matter between purchasers and sellers, meaning the Government had nothing to do with it.  Conversely, I welcome the announcement by the current Minister and the content of the programme for Government for this issue to be examined.  The working group is a good development.  We will all want to play constructively any role we can in supporting that.</p> <p>  I am less optimistic about the timeline because it is ten months before recommendations will be produced.  Much work has been done on this, both by this committee as well as the Pyrite Resolution Board.  I am even more concerned that we are not looking at any redress into 2022.  People have bills to pay and insurance policies on their apartment blocks which are being withdrawn but they do not have the money to pay for that.  That is affecting constituencies across the country.</p> <p>  It is also important to acknowledge that this is not only a Dublin issue.  There are currently live latent defects in at least five counties across the State.  It is a rural and urban issue and one affecting all of the State in different ways.  Accordingly, the quicker we can get a good scheme in place, the better.</p> <p>  I am also concerned that the programme for Government refers to accessing low-cost finance.</p><p>Large numbers of people with latent defects will not be able to sustain debt and, therefore, the issue of grant aid directly from the State and industry, as well as tax relief, has to be on the agenda, and I will actively push for that.</p><p> For members who might not be as familiar with this or may not have come across it in their constituencies, will Mr. Scott talk us through how defects occur?  What are the more common kinds of defects and what kinds of costs are there?  I do not mean at the extreme end, because that can be &euro;60,000, &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000, but the more common costs.</p><p> My next question is on behalf of the various homeowners in a number of developments who have appeared before us.  They have previously expressed to the committee their concern that the developers directly responsible for the defects in their properties subsequently get planning permission to build new developments.  Does Mr. Scott have a view on that?  Without asking him to comment on individual developers, will he share some of his views on the law reform that may be required or how it makes him feel personally?</p><p> Ms Cottier might confirm whether there is yet a timeline from the Minister as to when the committee is going to start meeting.  Will it be this year or is it unlikely to be until next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Scott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#H00200"><p>To respond to the question about how these defects have happened, every development or dwelling in a multi-unit scheme has to be a self-contained fire compartment. The regulations stipulate the required level of compartition between units.  Generally, a fire in one unit should be contained for one hour within the walls of that unit before it spreads anywhere else, which is to give time for the occupants to escape and for the fire brigade to deal with it.  The requirements for fire resistance increase depending on the height and complexity of the development, such as the number of escapes.  In some areas, fire protection could be required for up to two hours.  Achieving that requires a particular form of construction, with multiple different products, such as plasterboards, blockwork, brickwork and so on.</p> <p>  At the outset of the construction process, a fire certificate is prepared by a fire specialist, who outlines the requirements for that specific development, dictated by the height of the development, the number of escapes and lifts, the fire-fighting systems and so forth.  That document is approved by the fire officer and handed to the design team, who then take responsibility for implementing a design that will satisfy each of those requirements.  They will decide on the construction of the walls, the door types and so on that will, supposedly, achieve those fire requirements.  That is a relatively office-based or desk-based system.</p> <p>  The plan is then handed to a contractor, who has to construct it.  In doing so, he or she will employ various specialists to supply and install the material.  One problem is that during the installation, multiple firms or trades could be working on a particular item or area of the apartment.  There might be electricians following plasterers, for example.  Multiple pairs of hands are on the construction.  My sense of what happened during this period is that while, invariably, the fire certificate was correct, sanctioned and signed off by the relevant authority, and while the design in most cases was probably compliant, when the process went on site, with the constructing of the doors and the risers that pass through the apartment, that was where a breakdown in the process occurred, in terms of both the knowledge and understanding of those involved as to what they were doing.  In the majority of cases we see when we go into developments, we can see the fire products that have been used.  The correct plasterboard, fire compound and floor levels may have been used, but they may have been installed incorrectly and may not meet the requirements.</p><p>There are gaps, holes and openings.  There was obviously some sense of doing the right thing by the contractor, using the materials that had been specified, but how that was put together was where there was a failure.  That points to a failure of the inspection, monitoring and sign-off regimes.  Because of all these different components and moving parts, that is where it fell down, in my view.  </p><p> On the costs of units, we have been involved in schemes where costs for apartments have been anywhere between &euro;10,000 to &euro;20,000 per apartment.  We have had schemes where apartment owners have had to deal with the internal aspects of their apartments only, to do with entrance hallways and so on.  They have been at the lower end, at &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 per dwelling.  That is a broad assessment of what the costs are.  </p><p> On developers subsequently being given consent to go on and build-----</p></speech>

This is an important issue and I am pleased that we have strong commitments in the programme for Government on bringing forward law reform to improve the legal remedies for home owners dealing with defects, to assist owners of latent defect properties by identifying options for those impacted and to address low-cost, long-term finances.</p> <p>  Construction defects are serious issues and affect tens of thousands of home owners in 80 different developments across the country.  I am acutely aware of that because I am one of those people living in one of those developments.  Yesterday, I packed up my home, laid down dust sheets and temporarily moved out to facilitate fire safety works.  As we speak, there are builders in my home dissecting our ceilings to make the apartment I live in safe.  Those works are urgent, essential and will counteract fire safety construction defects.</p> <p>  I am a renter so, while fire safety has been of personal concern to me since I first learned of this, I have not had the financial burden of paying upfront to rectify these defects.  My landlords and my neighbours have and that is wrong.  They purchased their apartments on the understanding they were finished to the highest and, most important, safest spec.  As Ms Cottier said, defects like these have come to have a significant impact on homeowners through no fault of their own.  It is clear that the regulation or self-regulation of the construction industry has failed them and, therefore, it has failed us as a nation.  We saw that when it came to pyrite and we see it now when it comes to fire safety, one of the most important aspects of construction.</p> <p>  Homeowners across the country have acted as quickly as they could by saving, borrowing or investing to make their home safe.  I agree with Ms Cottier that whatever financial supports we put in place to support homeowners in this situation need to be retrospective.  The people who acted early are the people who did the right thing at the earliest possible time, at huge personal cost and inconvenience.  The working group is the best way of getting under the hood of this issue, not just in terms of shaping the redress scheme, but also in terms of making recommendations on how to avoid future construction defects.  This Government has committed to delivering record levels of homes across the country in the coming years.</p><p>It is imperative we make sure those homes are built to the safest specification.  I would like to learn more from the witnesses about the redress scheme they propose, how soft loans and tax breaks would work, the likely cost of such a scheme and how it would be funded, and the role insurance companies would play in funding works as we move forward and also retrospectively.</p></speech>

We call not only on the State for a response but on people involved in the sector to be able to do that.  Regarding tax breaks, everything can be vouched.  Everything can be properly calculated in terms of the costs involved and also service charges and levies that are applied.  There are ways in which tax breaks can be done effectively.</p> <p>  On soft loans, we know there are Government agencies which can give very low interest loans.  That is not our preferred option because it does not give financial release or remove the financial burden.  However, it could quickly give the owners' management companies, OMCs, the ability to make people's homes safe.  That is where the soft loans would be of benefit.  However, there are very few mechanisms for OMCs to borrow money.  They have no assets.  The way that would be worked would be quite complex and the other options would be far more preferable for many reasons.</p> <p>  In terms of quantifying the issue, that is the reason we need the working group.  If there are, on average, 100,000 homes affected and the average cost per home was &euro;15,000, that would give a guesstimate.  I do not have the figures with me and I do not know if any members of our group have them.  It is one of the key outcomes from the working group.</p></speech>

To emphasise Ms Cottier's point, the working group is quantifying the number of homes affected and that will be one of its key outputs.  More precise costs should be obtained from that but we are currently looking at a cost in excess of &euro;1 billion.  That is a realistic estimate based on 100,000 units.  It is a significant sum of money at this stage.</p></speech>

I have been involved in construction all my life and I am still a contractor.  I welcome this engagement.  I have listened to many Deputies speak on this issue and to the witnesses' briefing.  They hit the nail on the head when they spoke about the way certain buildings were built using a main contractor and many subcontractors who carried out works.  With respect to the oversight of fire-stopping, different contractors were involved.  They may have drilled a hole 45 mm in diameter, which is too big as it is only supposed to be 40 mm for fire-breaking.  Pipework may have been installed without fire stops around it.  I welcome that this issue is being highlighted.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned Dublin and Cork but homes in Limerick are also affected.  I received a phone call yesterday from a man who bought an apartment three years ago in a building that was built 20 years ago.  When he discovered there was an issue he did not know where to go.  Underneath his apartment is a seven-storey car park.  We can only imagine what would happen to the apartment above if a car were to go on fire in the car park.</p><p>He came back from working abroad to buy this apartment and felt he was set up for life only to find out that he is in a seven storey apartment block over a car park and he has this huge bill.  He cannot sleep at night.  There has been a failure with regard to these type of developments, most of which happened during the Celtic tiger times when they were not properly supervised.  </p><p> I am a contractor and most of my business is one-off houses but I have been involved in the industrial side also where fire-proofing is done and there are different ratings between detached and semi-detached houses.  The biggest problem I find when people come to me for advice, help and my experience on issues they have with other buildings is the lack of what I would call a one-stop-shop.  There is a phrase, "doctors differ and patients die".  We need a dedicated engineering service that people can avail of that will deal with pyrite and fireproofing issues.  They should have a list of services that they can avail of rather than ringing around everywhere to try to find out who will give them the best advice possible.  Somebody should be able to provide such a service in, say, Limerick, Cork or Dublin.  We need somebody who understands those people's problems and can send out a task force to the particular areas to examine those problems.  That is the only way to deal with this issue.  I deal with engineers on a daily basis.  I could be dealing with 20 different engineers and every engineer is slightly different in terms of their thoughts.  We need a task force that will deal with these issues and give answers directly to people, perhaps through a help line that they can ring about a specific issue and get a costing.  If such a task force had all the collective experience and all the studies available to it, it would then be able to give somebody a definite answer, probably at a lower cost than somebody directly involved in that area.  I welcome this and I will give 100% support to it but we need a special task force to deal with this issue county by county where people can ring a phone line.  I have a list of names and I will be the first person to ring a task force to find out who can help.  I can at least hand on the details to somebody and give them that experience.  I am willing to learn also.</p></speech>

Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn might want to comment on this because with legal advice as well as construction advice there is a gap in terms of addressing this issue and helping individuals and companies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#L00300"><p>I would be happy to do that.  On the previous occasion I was before this committee I specifically raised the fact that there was not even a helpline that people could call with these problems.  In my experience, taking the example of apartment developments, when these defects are discovered, and we have heard from Ms Cottier about the prevalence of those defects, all those management companies retain their own professional advice.  They will engage Scott Murphy Building Surveyors or one of the firms or people involved in this field.  They will find out what has to be done.  They will hold meetings with residents and tell residents about the scale of the problem.  I have been to several of these meetings.  The process is entirely repetitive.  They will explain that they are taking legal advice and that the developers have gone bust.  There might be a receiver in the picture but, as explained, it is likely that the receiver will not have to discharge the cost of rectifying those defects.  There are some proceeds of sale of units in development.</p> <p>  To put that in context from the perspective of homeowners, with one of the developments I am aware of in south Dublin a receiver was appointed to the developer.  The development had been left half finished.  The residents had been living in a development with hoardings and unfinished sites for a period of years.  The receiver appointed by NAMA had started to complete the development and was marketing the homes for sale.  Those homes were going to be sold and there was going to be a return to the State.  The residents of that development were watching all of this from their windows knowing that, in their case, they were struggling even to find the funds to pay for the assessment work that would have to be done to determine the remedial works necessary for their development, which is quite an exercise in itself.</p> <p>  I absolutely sympathise and feel the frustration of owners because this is a problem that calls out for a nationwide response.</p><p>Exactly as Deputy O'Donoghue said, there is no need for each owner's management company to reinvent the wheel each time.  The Construction Defects Alliance and Apartment Owners Network are voluntary organisations that have gone in to fill the gap.  The have done so because of a failure of leadership and because there is not a centralised resource, provided by local authorities or the Government.  There has been a consistent response but the problem has been one for private individuals and the people they sold their homes to.  One of the main findings in my PhD research was that homeowners really had no power at all in the transactions.  They were represented by solicitors, but the solicitors were going through a conveyancing process that follows a particular format and is not really equipped to identify the problems.  The solicitor will advise that one should retain one's own surveyor but, as Ms Cottier said, surveyors were not able to open up internal finishes to find out whether fire-stopping had been done properly.  Therefore, people really lacked power in the relationship.  People buying their first home have a great sense of hope and optimism and they do not enter the process believing they are taking on a risk that will be with them for the following ten or 20 years of their lives.  That is the truth of it, however.  This has been occurring in a context in which builders and developers have been insulated, by the legal system, from the risks related to what they build.<br/><br/>I would really like committee members to understand that while there has been regulatory change, the circumstances that gave us all the defective apartments are largely unchanged from a legal point of view.  There has been some regulatory reform but some would call this reform industry led and essentially comprising self-certification by the industry.  I encourage members to read the evidence being given to the Grenfell inquiry to really get a sense of what happens when industry is left to police itself.  We do not allow other important industries to regulate themselves.  The regulatory failure is still with us.  Even a redress scheme, which is essential and very much welcome, must, in order to be effective, be accompanied by regulatory reform to address this.  The pyrite scheme was a sticking plaster for a particular type of problem.  The mica scheme is a sticking plaster for a particular type of problem but we must ask how many times we need to have such schemes and how much money we need to invest in solving these kinds of problems in an <i>ad hoc</i>way without addressing the underlying problem, which is that we are not regulating our industry properly and robustly or providing legal remedies to home buyers.</p></speech>

I congratulate them on their resolve and continued campaign for redress.  I hope to continue to assist them, as the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has done to date.</p> <p>  As noted in the delegates' presentations, addressing housing defects is part of the negotiated programme for Government.  A commitment was made to examine defects in the first 12 months.  As discussed here today, a working group is being set up by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to determine how to deal with building defects.  The aim is to "Assist owners of latent defect properties, by identifying options for those impacted by defects, to access low-cost, long-term finance" and other suitable measures.</p> <p>  My question has been partially covered.  Do the delegates believe the timeline of the working group is sufficient?  Will the work conclude in time for next year's budget?</p></speech>

It will require genuine focus on the part of everyone who is part of it.  They will have to be very clear on the outcomes and outputs we need.  The working group has to meet within the timeline in question, as far as we are concerned, because we are relying on some sort of financial redress in the budget.  We will be keeping a very close eye on progress.  While there are many aspects that we want to close off in the future, our focus is really on solving the crisis people are currently experiencing and keeping the promise in this regard.</p> <p>  On the timeline, the Minister has told us he is appointing the chairman.  The next phase will involve the committee members.  We have actively engaged in the process.  It is behind.  Obviously, the Minister would have to answer for himself but I believe he would like to be further ahead than he is now.  There is still hope, however, that a committee will be formed before Christmas.</p></speech>

One thing we said clearly was that the lived experience of people who were there had to be a strong voice on that committee, supported by professionals.  There is a commitment that a member of the Apartment Owners Network and a member of the Construction Defects Alliance would be on that.  Ms Ciara Holland, Mr. Barry Mulhern and Mr. D&oacute;nal Nugent are owners who are living in those apartments and can quite clearly state why they think that is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Mulhern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#N00300"><p>As Ms Cottier has pointed out, the important thing is lived experience.  I can come back to the issue around insurance at a later point.  One of the things I would point out is that about four days into the first lockdown, we had a fire in our development.  It was quite a scary experience because at that time, each individual owner was facing into a &euro;75,000 fire excess for each and every event.  We had a fire in a first-floor apartment and there were apartments above and below and an apartment beside it.  It would essentially have meant &euro;75,000 for each owner.  We feel it is vital to help people who are dealing with this and are putting their heads on a pillow inside an apartment that just does not feel safe.  We absolutely have to be part of any committee that deals with this issue because, too often, our voices are not heard.</p> <p>  I hear talk about ambitious timelines.  From my perspective, &ldquo;ambitious timelines&rdquo; might be the description used but we had to vote in a levy for all of our owners only recently, and the letters have gone out asking, in my case, for just shy of &euro;15,000, which is a massive undertaking to try to get hold of.  It might be referred to as an ambitious timeline but, from my perspective, it still seems somewhat vague.  I would like more.  I would like to get a set timeline so we can get redress or financial assistance in place for everybody.</p></speech>

The problem is we have six-block apartments and four-block apartments and if we do not get everybody within those particular blocks to pay, the work cannot start.  As of yesterday, we had 32 people committed to paying the levy out of 86 but that does not include one full block.  In one block, five people are ready to go but one person has not got back yet.  If that one person cannot get the money together, the repairs cannot be done, so there is no insurance, no fire cover and the apartment cannot be sold or rented without it being on the owner's conscience.</p> <p>  We need help with a lot of different issues.  It is not just a case of introducing a levy and collecting money.  Even one person can stop the works from happening.  That is the position we are in at the moment.</p></speech>

I also want to thank the Construction Defects Alliance for all the work they have done.  I know this is very stressful and challenging for everybody involved.</p><p> One of the lessons from this matter is that we need much stronger regulation, enforcement and licensing in the industry and that there must be repercussions for and accountability on the part of developers, in terms of both future planning and defects.  I looked into this matter in some detail when it arose in the area that I represent.  I went through thousands of pages that I obtained through freedom of information requests from my local council in order to try to get to the bottom of it.  I saw quite clearly that in one instance my local council had known about this and failed to act in its role as a building control, planning and fire safety authority.  It is important that there is fairness and justice for homeowners and part of that has to mean that it is retrospective.  I agree that this needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  If it is not retrospective, we will be looking at a double injustice visited upon those who have been affected and who have been most responsible in putting in all the work in order to get works to go ahead.</p><p> I ask Mr. Nugent and Mr. Mulhern in particular to outline what the effects were for them of finding the defects.  What was the impact on insurance costs?  How much are the defects costing the owners and what is it like?  It has been mentioned what it is like trying to collect money from the other owners.  What was the reaction of the witnesses when they found out that their local authority had known about the defects for six or seven years and had not told the residents in the estate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Mulhern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#O00200"><p>I will speak on the insurance matter and Mr. Nugent can then go through the timeline of what we discovered.  We had an underwriter in 2016 that was charging us &euro;22,000 for 86 units.  In 2017, that went up to &euro;24,000.  As the 2018 renewal period came up, we were summoned to that underwriter's office and basically told that we had to have a substantive plan in place and works under way, otherwise it would withdraw cover from us.  What was meant by substantial works was that we had to have work under way to get it done and that feeds back into the issue whereby we simply did not have the money and even if we had voted in the levy, which we had not done up to that point, then getting that money together was going to prove impossible.  That left us with the insurer of last resort, which was a firm that traded out of the United Kingdom.  It hit us with a &euro;31,500 renewal premium, which was an increase just shy of &euro;10,000.  With that came the &euro;75,000 each on every excess.  We were essentially hit with a 30% rating increase and in return for that we got substantially less cover.  In 2019, the cost of the insurance went up again to &euro;33,500 and that was with a &euro;75,000 excess.  That particular underwriter has left the market and is no longer writing business in Ireland.  It took hours of phone calls from directors.  Mr. Nugent and I are directors but we have our own jobs and we do all of this in our spare time away from friends, family and leisure activities.  We managed to get another insurer that has come in and the cost of the insurance is down.  For the time being, this insurer has given us a reduced excess but if we do not get the work done and if we do not get blocks brought up to the safety standard required, the excess will go back up again.</p> <p>  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan mentioned a double injustice.  We are facing a situation whereby there is no guarantee that we will be able to complete the work.  If we cannot complete it, then I, as an owner, am facing into a situation whereby if there is a fire in the apartment above mine and my apartment is left uninhabitable, I will have to find &euro;50,000 of my own money just to get the work started.  Once those works are done, I would still be facing into a substantial excess.</p><p>That is what one faces each and every day.  I will defer to Mr. Nugent who will go through the timeline of what we faced with our particular county council but I have given the realistic lived experience of someone who is in this situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&oacute;nal Nugent" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#P00200"><p>Yes.  In 2007, our county council discovered that there were fire safety defects within the apartments that it acquired in the estate.  Between 2007 and 2015, the county council repaired its 44 apartments but did not notify everybody else in the estate until 2012 in a letter sent to the management companies.  In 2012, I was not a director so I do not know whether that is true and have never seen the letter.  In 2016, we received a letter in our letterboxes from a local Deputy stating that there could, potentially, be fire defects within the apartments.  In 2007, Fingal County Council knew but did not notify everybody in the estate.</p> <p>  On the cost of repair works, our estate is made of different blocks - six-block timber frame and masonry built and four-block timber frame and masonry built.  There are 42 six-block timber frame, which will cost &euro;14,696 per apartment.  The four-block timber frame, which is 28 people, will cost &euro;13,503 per apartment.  The six-block masonry will affect 12 people, which is &euro;4,197 and the four-block masonry, which will affect four people, is &euro;4,298.  The all-in cost for the 86 apartments is in excess of &euro;1 million to do repair works.  The problem is that we need everybody in one block to agree to get this repaired or the work will not be done.  The issue has been very stressful and taken hours, days and weeks of my life.  To be honest, this has been the most stressful three years of my life.</p></speech>

What we have found is that the fire safety material simply was not installed at all.  I heed the Chair's comments about defamation and so on but I do not know if that was cost-cutting or time cutting.  It was not a case of stuff not being done properly; it was simply a matter of things not being done at all.</p> <p>  I will go back to what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.  I have a safety certificate that says my apartment is fire compliant.  I know for a fact that my apartment is not fire compliant and I know for a fact that the county council did not conduct even one inspection.  So it goes back to the comments that have already been made about light-touch regulation or self-regulation.  It was entirely predictable that this was going to happen.  We know, for a fact, that the developer who built our apartments is trading under a different name but doing substantial works.  We have asked the question but it has not yet been confirmed.  We believe that they have received work from the State to do work.  To go back to what Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, it is not a double injustice but a quadruple injustice because the developer has done this to us yet the State has turned around and handed them money to build things, which is an exceptionally bitter pill to swallow.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for coming in.  The debate has been really informative but it has also been difficult to hear the lived experiences of the witnesses.  It is worth noting what was said by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in that the timeline is ambitious but there are people who are there now who must get money upfront.  This time has been very difficult for people many of whom have lost their jobs but people owe money now.</p> <p>  In the July stimulus package &euro;10,000 was added to the help-to-buy scheme.  Is the scheme effective and targeted or will it simply increase the price of housing?</p><p>The priorities are mixed up.  My colleague, Senator Wall, told me about a situation he is dealing with.  There are 34 apartments in Kildare and they will have approximately &euro;7,000 to pay for it between now and January.</p><p> There are a couple of questions I want to ask specifically of Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn regarding the underlying regulation because I am concerned that there are houses being built now that we will suffer the same fate with.  There are two separate elements - a redress scheme for past construction defects and the type of regime that we have going forward.  Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn talked about a new homes ombudsman.  What powers would she see the ombudsman having?  Has she any examples of other countries that might have something similar?  If it is a case of producing a report, I am not so sure that would be sufficiently robust for the construction sector.  I ask her to elaborate.</p><p> I would also like to ask about homes that are being built and current builders.  Has Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn any suggestions for a legal regime whereby a builder one cannot change his business's name or continue to trade under the same name?  Reform of section 35 of the Planning and Development Act has been mentioned but we can put more robust measures into procurement policy to essentially exclude people who have shown that they have been ignoring the defects issue or have produced shoddy work.</p><p> Finally, I want to ask if they have any suggestions.  As there seems to be a move toward build to rent and institutional investors, we might see cases of owner-occupiers and institutional investors that have come through a number of legal entities and might be difficult to get at.  I encounter this a lot when it comes to issues such as derelict sites.  Does Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn have any suggestions for a legal regime to tackle that, if there are institutional investors and money needs to be ponied up?  Something each of the owner-occupiers is talking about is that everybody who is involved has to agree before works can begin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#Q00300"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  I might start at the end and the point the Senator raised about institutional investors and owner-occupiers.  As our multi-unit developments system works, if one has a single institutional owner for an entire block with everyone living in the block a tenant of the block, that is much simpler in one way.  The Senator might recall that approximately five years ago, the media reported on a block that had defects in Dundrum, Dublin 14 that was all owned by a single pension fund.  All the tenants were decanted out of it, the work was done and they were all decanted back into it because there was a single payer and a single purse.  In theory, that should be more straightforward.</p> <p>  Going back to the questions the Senator raised in order, the new homes ombudsman was a recommendation of a parliamentary committee report in the United Kingdom from approximately four years ago.  They had a similar type of report to our safe as houses report.  I draw the committee's attention to the date on it, which is December 2017.  I was a fellow to that report.  That is almost three years ago.  Around the same time, a parliamentary report in the UK recommended a new homes ombudsman.  One of the reasons for that is that, as I said, when individual house owners or apartment owners find they have a problem, they have to go through this very convoluted system that is not too different from the legal system that would apply for somebody who is a big commercial developer or a big commercial tenant.  The homeowner has to go through the same route.  It is High Court litigation or it is arbitration.  It is really expensive.  There is not a simpler way to get access to a remedy.  When I spoke to the committee previously, I talked about a system they had in Australia where one can ring up a local regulatory tribunal, which sends an inspector out to look at the house, and the inspector puts a price on the work that has to be done and makes a recommendation.</p><p>The tribunal also has the power to impose sanctions if the builder does not go back and fix the problem or to make an award in favour of the homeowner for the cost of fixing the defect.  The homeowner pays approximately $400 and the process is simple and quick.  The process in Ireland is the opposite of that.</p><p> The position of new homes ombudsman is proposed in a section of the UK's new building safety Bill, which was introduced in light of the regulatory review after the Grenfell fire.  It proposes that a position of ombudsman be set up.  The ombudsman could direct particular types of businesses to subscribe to a scheme that the ombudsman will set up.  The ombudsman could receive complaints, make compensation awards and provide further types of remedy such as an apology or another type of relief, but the principal relief would be compensation.  It is outside the court and arbitration systems so it should be faster and cheaper.</p><p> In a way, this is a good time for us to start looking at regulatory reform because we can examine what is being proposed in the UK.  Substantial proposals are being made for the reform of the building control system in the UK.  Mr. Nugent mentioned the fire authority and building control authority.  In England, they are proposing that local authorities will have the building control authority function taken from them and given to the new regulator for high-rise residential buildings.  That regulator will have oversight of the entire regulation of safety in high-rise buildings and will focus more on the safety of people living there rather than whether they are an owner or tenant.  Those are some of the things that we might consider.</p><p> It would be relatively simple to establish a new homes ombudsman and the idea is that it would provide a simpler way of making a complaint, somebody for people to call and a way of getting compensation.</p><p> The Senator also mentioned-----</p></speech>

I have to move on to the next round of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#R00300"><p>My contribution will follow on from that of the previous contributor.  I completely support the principle of funding homeowners.  I have heard the absolute pain and annoyance of Mr. Nugent and Mr. Mulhern and I stand in complete sympathy with them.  I have experience of trying to get a group of owners to pony up for engineering costs to establish fault in an estate of houses, one of which was my home, and one homeowner did not row in which meant that the rest of us had to pitch in and pay.  That is all the more difficult in an apartment complex.  I completely sympathise with all of the difficulty and annoyance of that.</p> <p>  On the other hand, I can see why the proposal is for a loan regime, albeit that is unfair, in particular, to owner-occupiers who own only one property.  However, in the case of professional or institutional landlords with more than one property, if the Government was to provide grants, it would become disproportionate and may open the floodgates.  Will Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn address how to discriminate legally so that the people who really need money are prioritised and given grant aid?  The unfairness will be colossal if that does not happen.  I would value Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn's opinion on that.</p> <p>  To elaborate a little on Senator Moynihan's view, has consideration been given to something akin to a tax clearance certificate that attaches to an individual in construction whereby the individual must produce a defect clearance certificate?  That may be a way to overcome a temptation for phoenix syndrome within construction to avoid retrospective liabilities.  Has any consideration been given to that?</p> <p>  Should we consider a scheme of certificates of compliance to certify a development as free of construction defects?  That might incentivise management companies to have blocks of apartments declared free of defects or to encourage those blocks of apartments to have themselves declared free of defects, assuming we have some sort of a funding regime in place.  Would that encourage people to declare where there are deficits and address them and then get this certificate and all of the insurance that would flow from it?</p><p>Finally, from an insurance point of view, has consideration been given to a State underwriting regime of some sort?  I appreciate that is all very pie in the sky but, at the same time, in principle, I am happy to advocate for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#S00200"><p>I am happy to come in on that.  In the first instance, I thank the Senator very much for her questions.  Regarding the first question on how one discriminates as to priority for grants, I believe that will be one of the things the working group will have to look at.  We already discriminate in a way because institutional and commercial owners of apartments, for example, can write off all the remedial costs against their tax liability arising from their income, which a homeowner typically cannot.  That is one issue for the working group.  There is, however, an in-built discrimination in the system as it stands, so the working group will have to look at how a fairer system can be created for individual homeowners who are dealing with it and getting the types of bills we have heard about this morning.</p> <p>  Regarding a defects clearance certificate and the phoenix syndrome, one of the issues the committee considered in the past was the general scheme of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill 2017, which contemplates a registration scheme where an individual, for example, who is convicted under the Building Control Act would have to tell the registration body he or she has been convicted and might not get a registration the following year.</p> <p>  One of the comments I made to the committee about it at the time was that to my knowledge there had never been a conviction under the Building Control Act.  I am sometimes asked about sanctions and whether we should spend some of this discussion on improving sanctions and making sure there are sanctions against developers.  There are sanctions in the Building Control Act in respect of anyone who constructs buildings that are not in compliance with the building regulations.  They look robust and have been regularly recited in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They say that if a body corporate, for example, is in breach of building regulations and in breach of the Act, then individual managers and directors of that body corporate can be held personally responsible and can be convicted of the offences under the Act, which all sounds very robust, except it is never done.</p> <p>  There are, therefore, various ways to address this issue of phoenix syndrome but, as of today, I can set up a company called Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn 2020 Limited.  If I have a site, I can apply for planning permission.  I might even get fast-track planning permission for it.  I can commence building on it by submitting a commencement notice.  I do not need any kind of approval from my building control authority.  The only people who must be regulated on that site are either regulated by their own professional bodies, if they are architects, engineers and surveyors, or by an external regulator if they are gas installers and electricians.  I am not regulated.  I do not need to carry insurance or a licence.  I can sell those homes and disappear next year.  If anybody sues me, I can sign the certificate of compliance on completion, which is required under the building control regulations, in the name of my limited company and then if there is a problem with it, the person who is the assigned certifier, such as the architect or engineer, will probably be at much greater risk.  We are aware of these issues and there are ways of dealing with them but that is the position today.</p></speech>

I see Deputy &Oacute; Broin nodding.  Is the deficit because the chain of liability means, in legal terms, it is not the beginning and end of attributing liability to any one party?  Is that why there is a failure of prosecutions?</p></speech>

A senior building control officer for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea gave evidence to the Grenfell inquiry that ten qualified building surveyors had been let go from that authority and one graduate trainee had been taken on to do the same work.</p> <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned, this system was designed in the 1980s to minimise any liability for building control authorities.  That is clear from the D&aacute;il debates and it is clear from a memorandum that was sent to the then Taoiseach following the Stardust nightclub fire.</p><p>The system was set up to be light touch and the Building Control Act itself does not require a building control authority to go out and inspect any building.  It specifically states a building control authority does not need to read and verify the information it is sent with certificates of compliance and all the information that has to be sent in.  It is a bigger problem than has been referred to.  It is not really just about the chain of liability.  It is that there are pockets of liability, such as architects and engineers who sign certificates and typically carry insurance, and then there are pockets of virtually no risk and no liability, which are the builders and developers who can set up what we used to call &euro;2 companies and build and develop without carrying any insurance or having to have any money in the bank, as they do in Queensland, Australia for example, and without having to have a licence from any regulator that is external to their own industry.</p></speech>

This is a basic rule but not for the single most expensive purchase in people's lives.  It beggars belief that we are even having this discussion.  I am not at all criticising anybody here because this is a useful discussion but we are still discussing the fact there is not a proper remedy.  To summarise for members, the safe as houses report recommended a one-stop-shop to address this issue whereby once people discovered they had potential latent defects there would be a body they could go to, which would be a free information service that would tell them exactly what the law stated and what the liabilities were, and it would provide them with advice.  This does not exist today.</p> <p>  In the first instance, the principle would be that the developer or builder responsible for the defects has to pay.  This is the fundamental principle of the proposition.  Not unlike the Residential Tenancies Board, the one-stop-shop redress board would have the ability to mediate between the homeowners and the developer and-or adjudicate where mediation was not possible.</p> <p>  One of the issues, of course, is that some companies are still trading as the original entities responsible for defects but others have closed companies and opened new companies while some have gone bust.  There is a legal question, and it would be great if the Government and Attorney General could look at it, as to what extent individuals still trading but under different names may be subject to that adjudication regime.  We do not know the answer to this but it is crucial.  Where developers are still trading they should be forced to pay if they are not willing to do so voluntarily.  Where the developers are not trading and have gone bust, and are no longer living in or are out of the State, a fund will have to be there to be drawn on.  Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn rightly said landlords can already write off the capital cost of remediation against their tax liabilities.  The question that Senator Seery Kearney rightly raises is easily resolvable because we can continue this regime and the grant aid would be for private home owners.</p> <p>  One of the difficulties with the loan is that the developer walks away.  He or she gets off scot-free and this has to be an issue or a focus.  We are not arguing as advocates of this that the taxpayer should pick up all the tab.  In fact, the idea of the redress fund would be for the taxpayer to pick up as little of the tab as possible.</p> <p>  I want to go back to the D&aacute;il debates I mentioned earlier.  There were two reasons some Government and Opposition Deputies supported the light-touch regulatory regime that Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn rightly said was proposed following the Stardust tragedy.  The first was that our local authorities did not have enough staff.  Repeatedly, we were told by Ministers from two parties, because the legislation took almost a decade to pass, and by backbenchers, that local authorities could not take on the burden of doing the inspections and that they were not properly resourced.  The second was that it would be too expensive for builders, that it would add exponentially to the cost of building and, as a consequence, that it was not a good thing.  To re-emphasise, a small number of backbenchers from a number of parties stated when something went wrong the homebuyer would pick up the tab.  This is why the State cannot say it has no responsibility.  People legislated for a regime that was inadequate.</p> <p>.  Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn may remember a very important legal decision that was taken by the High Court on latent defects in Maynooth.</p><p>This was where a receiver was ordered by the courts to pay for the remediation works with proceeds from future sales.  I ask Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn to talk a little bit about that, please, because that was a significant judgment which has relevance to this.  I am conscious that Ms Holland has not come in at all and, as she has a significant level of experience, I would like her to be given the opportunity to do so.  She is one of those people who has paid for defects that she did not cause and if she can share her thoughts and feelings with the committee, that would be useful.</p></speech>

It was overturned by the Court of Appeal earlier this year.  This year we had two similar decisions, one from the High Court in April in the Paddy Burke (Builders) Limited (In Liquidation and in Receivership) <i>v </i>Tullyvaraga Management Company &amp;amp; Ors case decided by Mr. Justice Denis McDonald; and one from Ms Justice Costello in the Court of Appeal in July overturning the decision in the Grehan Business Services case.  <br/><br/>In this case in the High Court it had been found that a receiver in a multi-unit development, which was not a residential but a commercial development and where similar issues arose, there was an agreement with the original developer for the management company to take a transfer of what is called &quot;the common areas&quot; after the development had been completed.  It was a condition of the transfer, however, that the development be completed.  The management company said that it was not required to take over the common areas until the builder had completed the works and these works had not been completed because there were defects.  That was successful in the High Court but was overturned in the Court of Appeal.  <br/><br/>In the Paddy Burke case it was a residential multi-unit development and the management company had got an order in the Circuit Court under the Multi-unit Developments Act for the receiver to discharge the cost of remedial works from proceeds of sale.  Often, a receiver is appointed in respect of the developer's interest, which is the block, the car parks, the outside areas, the corridors and the lifts, and it often also includes a number of apartments that the developer has retained, which they used to do in order to try to keep control of the management company.  If a receiver is appointed in respect of that, it concerns quite a significant part of the development.  With the receiver, the developer is still essentially the landlord because of how we sell apartments which is via long leasehold.  <br/><br/>The court said in both cases that a receiver takes free of the management company's entitlement to require a development to be completed.  There is a statutory provision in the Multi-unit Developments Act whereby the original developer can be ordered to complete a development in accordance with planning and building regulations which should be very good news except that the right by the management company, if such an order is received against a developer, is treated essentially as what is called an unsecured creditor.  The lender who lent the money to finance the construction of the development can put in a receiver, extract whatever value they can by selling the remaining units, and can force the management company to take over the development in its defective state and not have to pay out from the proceeds of sale.  These are two very significant decisions that really close off what management companies thought was an avenue of getting some moneyss from receivers.</p></speech>

Does Ms Holland wish to comment on that, as requested by Deputy &Oacute; Broin?</p></speech>

As mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I own a two-bedroom apartment in Stillorgan that had fire defects.  We were informed in December 2018 and were levied with &euro;16,250 a month later.  We were in the fortunate position that most of the people had paid up and in the summer of 2019 all of those fire issues were remedied.  My developer is still in operation and was recently granted planning permission just down the road from me.  I objected to that planning application to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on the basis of section 35 of the Planning Act but it unfortunately did not uphold my objection and the developer was granted planning permission.</p> <p>  The county council was fully aware that developer had previously built defective homes and had not complied with the fire certificate that was granted to it but the council granted the developer planning permission in any event.  I feel completely let down and I am shocked and disgusted that this was allowed and that the regulatory environment just does not work.  It does not protect the innocent people.  I have two little girls and I put them to bed all of their little lives in a fire- defective home. It is not right. Safety is more important to me than getting any money back from the &euro;16,000 I have paid to make my developer accountable and responsible for what he has done and ensuring that this does not happen again. When my little girls grow up I can say to them that I fought for something to improve this and make it right and ensure they could buy an apartment in the future.</p><p> The way things stand at the moment I would advise people not to buy apartments because they are not protected and do not know what they are buying.  I bought my apartment second hand.  I did everything right.  I engaged a surveyor who inspected and signed off on the property.  Unless he had taken down the ceilings, walls and vents, he would not have known the deficiencies in the property.  The only person who did was the developer.  We have been utterly failed not only by the developer but also by the Government.  I have been in touch with everybody.  When I first found out about this in December 2018, I got in touch with the council, the fire officer and the then Minister.  I looked for support on Google.  I have done everything and anything I can to try to get justice and I have vowed that I will keep working on this until I do and my developer is held accountable for what he has done to us.</p></speech>

In many ways, it is poignant that they are joining us from their homes, which are the subject of today's meeting.  Many of those who have spoken have said they were not in a management company at a particular time.  That is partly because the group of people which has been asked to take on many of these issues comprises those who voluntarily contributed to their owner management companies.  They are the organisations that ten years ago would have dealt with unfinished estates, the liquidation of developers and issues around the Multi-Unit Development Act.  They then discovered issues around defects.  It was like a third wave.</p> <p>  All of that has taken a huge toll on people who have voluntarily contributed to the process to, in effect, co-own the developments they live in.  We have talked a great deal about co-living, but apartment owners effectively co-own properties.  It is important that we acknowledge the work that has been done by homeowners.  There has been a significant departure in the programme for Government in the direction relating to this issue.  While previously the Government relied on the view that it was a private matter, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, there has been an indication that there is a significant State involvement in this and that it is not a purely private matter.  I welcome the hope that we can deliver some new scheme in next year's budget and that the working group will help to deliver that at the start of next year.</p> <p>  I know that the witnesses have met with departmental officials and that the relationship with the new Minister is positive.  They will want to see the detail of what that will actually mean.  It is easy for a new Minister to support them, but that has to be delivered and I hope we will start to see that.  I have spoken to the Minister.  He has moved quickly to deal with issues such as pyrite and mica.  I hope he will also be able to move in this area.</p> <p>  I want to discuss what Ms Holland referred to, namely, accountability.  I remember some of the early meetings with Ms Deirdre Fox of the Apartment Owners Network in the atrium in Dublin City Council.  The witnesses have been forced into a very difficult position whereby they have had to take a pragmatic approach to try to resolve their issue rather than going down the chain of accountability to which Senator Seery Kearney referred.  The problem with that is while we might be able to find a resolution, the people who caused the problem may not face consequences.</p> <p>  Trying to get a resolution for each owner is important and we must focus on that first.  However, we also have to let the industry know that it failed and that there must be accountability.  If it is not forthcoming in supporting the funding of this problem the Government will have to go further and force it to do so.</p> <p>  I suggest that the legal mechanisms which will be introduced may not be retrospective.  That will pose a significant challenge.  Ms Holland's contribution was important because the issue of accountability has to be addressed, as well as remediating the financial costs involved.</p> <p>  I refer to multi-unit developments and the legislation relating to them.</p><p>This idea of neighbours forcing other neighbours to do certain things is emotionally difficult.  There has to be a legal resolution.  We need to revisit the multi-unit developments legislation and ensure that it is progressed by the Department.</p></speech>

They wanted the contractors and the developers to be held to account.  We spent hundreds of thousands of euro getting legal advice only to be told that the mark for recovery was so poor and the risk was so high to members in terms of levying to take legal action that we could not, as directors, make that decision to take it forward.  Our commitment to the owners is to lobby.  As Ms Holland said, that accountability is really strong.</p> <p>  Multi-unit development legislation reform is an area that dovetails in this regard.  We talk about building control reform but there is a need to reform of how we manage multi-unit developments.</p></speech>

There is a key report that was produced by the Housing Agency and Cl&uacute;id Housing on apartment living and management companies.  We would like to see the recommendations of that report implemented.  One of the report's main recommendations concerns the setting up of a regulator for OMCs.  Currently, there is no regulation of OMCs.  It relies on the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 and company and contract law .  This are all mismatched.  There is no one regulatory body or organisation or one-stop shop to which owners of OMCs can go.  We would like to see a regulator set up.</p> <p>  From personal experience, I note the fire defects issue has created a huge amount of tension between apartment owners and their OMCs.  In the past, much of the tension was between the management agent and the owners.  Now there is a lot of tension between owners and OMCs.  Owners do not feel they have anywhere to turn to.  From a governance side, they cannot pick up the phone and say there is a problem with their OMC.  The Property Services Regulatory Authority licences managing agents but there is no equivalent for OMCs.  It is for a different time and a different debate.  We are keen, however, that the Multi-Unit Developments Act be reformed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for their contributions.  The lived experience which people have spoken about has been enlightening to me as a new member of this committee.  It is critical that they are part of the working group going forward.</p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to address this matter.  My colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, referred to positively discriminating for those need who need support, such as those on the MS Teams call with us this morning.  We have tax write-offs for PAYE workers with the living city over ten years and the cycle-to-work schemes on a limited basis.  Perhaps PAYE workers could avail of tax write-offs for latent defects and the cost of their remediation.</p><p>That may be one that our guests can take up with the working group.  The tax write-off available over ten years through the living city initiative is considerable.</p><p> Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn mentioned legal changes being needed now but later noted that while the legislation was strong in this area, there have not been prosecutions.  Will she give a little more information on what specific legal changes may be required?  I am conscious that while we are talking predominantly about cases arising from the Celtic tiger period, the issue is not related solely to them.  Cases could be developing on other construction sites as we speak, where actions may be being taken that are not in compliance with the guidance and regulations.  There are good and bad builders and we have to acknowledge that.  Will Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn outline what legal changes are needed to ensure that what has happened previously will not happen again in the coming years as we ramp up our construction sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre N&iacute; Fhloinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020120100002#X00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his very good questions.  The reference I made to sanctions under the Act was not to suggest that the Act is perfect as it is.  I have a concern about the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which introduced a mandatory system of inspection and certification by developers and their appointees.  For most developments of any significant size, developers must appoint competent people who are registered with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, the Society of Chartered Surveyors or Engineers Ireland to act as inspectors and to sign certificates at various stages during construction and on completion of developments to say that the correct steps have been taken and that the development complies with building regulations.  That certificate, on completion, has to be signed by the builder as well.  That all sounds very positive but all the people involved are employed by the developer.</p> <p>  This committee, in the safe as houses report, recommended that this function be carried out by local authorities and that local authorities be properly funded to do it.  Based on my research and on what I have seen in other countries, there is certainly scope for having a private element in inspection and regulation of construction, which most countries have.  The really important part, however, is that somebody ensures people are doing what they are supposed to and to have visible and effective enforcement of sanctions.  One of the main comparisons I carried out in my PhD was with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which has a similar system of inspectors who are entitled to go into restaurants and places where food is being prepared or where animals are being prepared for slaughter, carry out inspections and issue notices if things are going wrong.  A national regulator can take enforcement and monitor what is happening.  There is no national regulator for buildings.</p> <p>  When I was conducting my PhD research, I wrote to every local authority to ask how many enforcement notices they had issued, because they are supposed to keep a register of enforcement notices, which is their first responsibility under the Act.  When they see a breach of building regulations, the register is the first regulatory tool they have.  Most of the local authorities I contacted, however, either did not have a register of enforcement notices or had a policy of never issuing enforcement notices because they were worried about being challenged by developers or having legal challenges they could not afford to fight because they had such small teams.  There is a bigger question here, but the really important aspect of reform is to ensure that somebody is checking that the correct steps are being taken and that there is some accountability.  Accountability will not come from changing our law and then never enforcing it; it will come when people know that it will cost them money, or that they might be convicted and prevented from tendering for other work, or even sent to jail because of what they are doing.</p><p>That is the experience of other regulated industries.  Members might consider how the Revenue Commissioners act.  In California, for example, members will be familiar with the tragedy of the Berkeley balcony collapse.  The company responsible for that had its licence revoked.  The two individuals who were the owners of the company were personally sanctioned.  They cannot get their licence back for, I think, five to ten years and in order to get their licence back to build again, they have to pay the $100,000 it cost to prosecute them.  They publish a register of those on whom sanctions have been imposed.  They publish names, naming and shaming as the Revenue does in Ireland.  All of those things are important to demonstrate that the regulatory system can be enforced.  If there are a few bad apples, one still has to be able to demonstrate that one has taken action against those few bad apples to make sure everybody else complies.  Otherwise, there is a system where people know they will never be caught and will not have to pay out if they are caught.  There are a hell of a lot of developers being sued at the moment in relation to all the apartments we are talking about and they will never have to pay out.  They are essentially being sued because otherwise the plaintiffs bringing these actions might face problems of their own for not having sued them.  Their names are on High Court litigation but they will never have to pay out for it.</p></speech>

I will try to wrap it up.  I am conscious I did not get an opportunity to speak.  We spent a lot of time discussing the legalities and remediation for this issue and possibly not enough time discussing the stress and tension it has placed on people who have lived with this issue for many years.  Ms Holland's submission dealt with the worry when she is putting her daughters to bed.  When one buys, rents or lives in a home, one expects to be able to live in a safe place and many people do not feel that way when they are affected by this issue.  When one buys any product, it is CE stamped and there is rigorous testing done on it to give confidence that it is reliable, robust and suitable for purpose.  People who have purchased into many of these apartment blocks have not been given the benefit of that.</p> <p>  I wanted to address section 35 of the Planning and Development Act.  We will not have time to answer that now but perhaps Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn, or somebody else, could give us a written submission on that.  I refer to developers who have been found not to be compliant with planning conditions in the past.  I am conscious of the line between planning conditions, fire regulations and construction oversight.  Where there is an architect, a designer, a developer and a number of subcontractors on site, who is responsible for not complying with the planning conditions?  Who has the ultimate sign-off on it and would that be the person who is responsible for non-compliance with that?</p> <p>  We are talking about historical issues.  What comfort could people take as we look at apartments being built at present?  There is an objective in the programme for Government for the large-scale construction that will be required and it will have to be high density and multi-use.  What comfort can people take, looking at that, that we have learned lessons in this regard?  Ms N&iacute; Fhloinn or Ms Cottier could wrap up on that.</p></speech>

I will make a short comment about it.  As long as we have planning authorities and building control authorities operating in silos in their local councils, we will have these problems.  It is ridiculous that one can apply for planning permission and the planning authority actively disregards what one has done on one's last development in terms of compliance with building regulations, as if such regulations are much less important than planning and planning regulations.  I am happy to submit a note to the committee secretariat.</p></speech>

Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose, the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to Members in Leinster House, any other location in Leinster House or Leinster House 2000 or the Convention Centre Dublin on days on which the relevant House sits there.  I ask members to note that they may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed above, as privilege for their utterances only applies when participating from these locations.</p> <p>  It is also important to note that in order to participate in a division, the committee member must be physically present in the room.  Voting cannot be done from a remote location. In view of the remote participation of members and in order to ensure that their contributions are accurately recorded, it is essential for people to wait until I call them by name before commencing any contribution.  Members joining remotely can use the "raise hand" facility on the screen, or if they are physically present they can put their hand up in the committee room.</p> <p>  Members are reminded that, due to Covid restrictions, each session must conclude within two hours and that no extension of time is possible.  We are conscious of that in terms of the scheduling for today&rsquo;s business and I will speak more about that in due course.  I advise the committee that we have a new member.  As I mentioned at the outset, Deputy Niamh Smyth is joining the committee.  We will welcome her when she joins us.</p> <p>  Today's business is the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill.  The meeting is for the purpose of discussing Committee Stage of the Bill.  We are limited to two hours so, in effect, we will conclude after 85 minutes because of the Covid restrictions.  We have reserved this Thursday at 4.30 p.m. as a back-up session if we need it.  We will see how we get on, but members should note there is a fall-back position if we do not get through the business today.</p><p>There is a bit of history to this Bill.  It began life as a Law Reform Commission, LRC, report in 2015.  I contributed to that consultation at the time, but more pertinently for the purpose of today's hearing, it was a Private Members' Bill sponsored by Deputy Howlin.  He has put in the hard yards on this for more than three years to get it to this Stage.  It has moved through First and Second Stages to get to where it is now.  I compliment Deputy Howlin on doing that.  It is the first Private Members' Bill we will take through this committee.  I look forward to its passage over the next couple of weeks or months, or however long it takes and, certainly, the next two hours.</p><p> I wish to also mention Ms Jackie Fox, who myself and Deputy Howlin met outside the Oireachtas at the start of the summer and whose daughter, Nicole, tragically fell victim to cyberbullying.  I know she has a great interest in this Bill.  I welcome her support and interest in it.  We can all do justice to that by working together to make sure this passes as efficiently and smoothly as possible. </p><p> As I mentioned, due to the limited seating, a number of members are participating remotely.  They may join in at different stages to move their amendments.  I welcome the Minister and her officials, and all members.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is online, I believe, and will join in at the relevant time.  She is welcome as well.</p></speech>

There are also amendments to the amendments.   We have, therefore, quite a bit to get through and will do our best to get through it in two hours.  If we do not, we have Thursday afternoon as a fall back.

First, I am grateful to be here.  It has been a long three years since April 2017 and the Private Members' Bill.  Not too many get in sight of the finishing line and I hope we can get it there.</p> <p>  As the Chairman rightly said, the Bill builds on the work of the LRC and deals with regulating a public space, that is, cyberspace, which is largely unregulated now.  It has many arms and it deals with the issue of online bullying and harassment, and the issue of exchanging intimate images, so-called "revenge porn", among others. </p> <p>  It is not comprehensive and all of us will have received submissions to try to make this Bill as comprehensive as we can.  I am conscious that even when this is enacted, there will be issues that require will further consideration.  I am aware the original LRC report, for example, wanted to deal with the non-justice area of a regulator.  That is being progressed in different legislation now.  People have contacted me and I am trying to explain that to them.  They should be aware of that.</p> <p>  I am grateful to the Minister for Justice for accepting the framework of the Bill and agreeing to enact it.  An extensive redrafting of the Bill is proposed by the Minister, in essence, to achieve the same objectives, by and large, but in a different style.  There is now a conventional and evolving style.  Even some of the proposed amendments regarding the location of Long Tittle and Short Title have changed in my time in the House.  There is, however, a prevailing style now for justice legislation.  As long as the elements of the Bill are achieved, the language used is secondary, as far as I am concerned, although I have a general view that we should, as far as practicable, speak and write in plain English and where we can say something directly, we should not, as far as we can avoid, put cross-referencing to legislation where it is not necessary so people can read legislation and know what it means.  We will get to the specifics of that when we are dealing with it.  I thank the Chairman for supporting this and for meeting others who are lobbying for the Bill.  Let us see if we can get it done.</p></speech>

On a housekeeping note, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, who is online, has sent a message stating that she has tabled amendments but does not propose to move them on this Stage.  Perhaps, there is some confusion on that; she may come in later with them.  As Chairman, I meant amendments tabled as a member.  As I am in the Chair or today's session, however, I do not propose to move my amendments because it would be difficult to do so for obvious reasons.  The Vice Chairman has also tabled amendments so the same difficulty will apply to us to vacate the Chair and swap with the Vice Chairman for the purpose of the session.</p> <p>  I propose to simply mention and flag my amendments at the relevant times and we may return to them on Report Stage if the Department wishes to make an observation or engage on them again.  I will not press them because I do not believe it would be appropriate to do so.  Perhaps, the Minister wishes to make some opening remarks as well.</p></speech>

I look forward to a speedy passage of this Bill and the support of all committee members and the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I thank Deputy Howlin for the huge volume of work he has done on this issue and I agree with him that while the stylistic approach might be different, the intention is exactly the same.  To be clear, the intention of the original Bill as set out is very much the same and, obviously, where we can develop and where there are potentially other areas that need further discussion and engagement, I am very much committed to doing that at a later stage in other legislation if needs be.</p> <p>  This issue has come to the fore in recent weeks as one that needs to be addressed.  That is why, working with Deputy Howlin, I have prioritised it and look forward to, hopefully, passing it as quickly as possible, much quicker than a few months.</p></speech>

Does she wish to come in on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-12-01a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2020120100002#B01300"><p>I will comment on amendments Nos. 1 and 2 initially.  I do not believe that such a change is necessary or required because the Title, that is, Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill, encompasses most of what the Bill tries to do.  Sometimes, if one gets too prescriptive, one does not widen the base but narrows it.  Given the fact that this legislation is specific to image-based content, I understand the reason for this.  However, as the Deputy said, there is an amendment to delete this section and insert it later in the Bill.  Again, that is a stylistic approach.  It is a technical amendment allowing for the relocation of the Short Title to the end of the Bill.</p><p>This is the drafting style used by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for Bills that are not set out in individual parts.  The Short Title and commencement provisions are contained in the amendment, creating a new section 19 retaining the original Short Title.</p><p> It is normal practice when drafting criminal legislation to include the commencement provisions.  This means the law does not enter into force immediately when signed by the President.  A commencement order will need to be signed by the Minister after the relevant criminal justice agencies have been notified of the enactment and given time to establish whatever new procedures are required to implement it.  I accept that this may be brought in on Report Stage later.  It is, therefore, something I am willing to, perhaps, consider later as part of the amended section.</p></speech>

As I said, I have no stylistic preference as to whether the Long Title and Short Title are put at the front or the back of the Bill, as long as they explain to any reader what the Bill is about.</p> <p>  The amendment I am putting now is important because it has an enormous emotional attachment.  I am aware I am asking the Minister to cross a threshold.  The main advocate among many, however, and the visible face of this campaign across the country for the past number of years, has been Ms Jackie Fox, who gave a moving and passionate account of her suffering outside the D&aacute;il at the start of this term.  Her beautiful daughter, Nicole, was driven to suicide by vicious online bullies and took her own life.</p> <p>  In memory of Nicole, she has asked that as well as having the normal Title of the Bill, we also use a shorthand, which is that this Act, when it is enacted, can also be known as Coco's Law.  It is a shorthand used in many jurisdictions in memory of people who have contributed to fundamental legal change.</p> <p>  I know from my years on the other side of the table how resistant the system is to that sort of move.  It would, however, mean a huge amount.  I cannot describe to members how much it would mean to Nicole's family, particularly to her mother, her extended family and all her supporters, if the Minister could agree to that.  I hope we can make that small adjustment and add the amendment I am suggesting that this Bill may also be referred to as Coco's Law.</p></speech>

I sincerely want to extend my sympathies to Nicole's family and to her mum, in particular, who, as the Deputy said, has campaigned for this tirelessly on the basis of what happened to her beautiful daughter.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, having taken advice from the Attorney General on this, and for the many reasons the Deputy has alluded to, there are important considerations in law and legal policy, and notwithstanding the position of the Short Title of the Act, it should seek to reflect the contents of the legislation in a succinct manner.  Obviously, what happened to Nicole was specific and is part of what the Bill intends to address.  Other areas are covered in this Bill as well, and that creates a challenge whereby there will be legislation that encompasses a number of specific offences and the Title itself is only related to one of those.  The legal advice, therefore, is that we would, as the Deputy said, be crossing into a different threshold, which would present significant challenges.</p> <p>  I completely understand this is something that people want to be connected with Nicole and her legacy.  I believe that it will be known as Coco's Law, even if it is not in the Title.  On the advice I have received I cannot, unfortunately, include that as part of the Title.  I genuinely believe, however, the reason for bringing this legislation forward and pushing it will be very much linked to Nicole and her family, and it will be part of their legacy.  I am sorry.  I would like to give the Deputy a different answer but the position as set out makes it difficult for me not to.</p></speech>

It is completely understandable why they would want that.</p> <p>  Could the Minister commit that in internal documents in the Department and in the presentation and explanation of it in conferences and as we go around talking about the law from now on, rather than it being strictly within the Title of the Bill, there is a way in which the Department could commit to using that phrase in its non-statutory language as part of the development of explaining the Bill over the next period?  Perhaps, that is something to reflect on over time.</p></speech>

As I said, in terms of how this is presented, it is clear for many people where this is coming from, the intention behind it and the personal work that has been done over the past number of years.  To reflect that is reasonable whether it is going through the House or in the commentary afterwards and as it is being enacted.  Perhaps, therefore, there is a way we could ensure that does happen.  I can certainly do that in my own commentary.</p></speech>

I appreciate both Deputy Carroll MacNeill's helpful suggestion and the Minister's response.  I believe that will happen.  I will continue to refer to it as Coco's Law in any event.</p> <p>  I am sure many Ministers have been here and referred to the legislative tradition or legislative advice given by the Attorney General.  We are the Legislature and we ultimately determine these issues.  I recall having a discussion with somebody who said that would create a precedent.  We are here sometimes to create precedents.  Every Bill would not lend itself to something like this but I believe this does.  We could create a precedent here without doing any harm or injustice to anybody.  The learned judges and practitioners in the courts would be able to manage to understand the full import of the Bill, even if it has a shorthand Title.</p></speech>

The comments were made that it will forevermore be known as Coco's Law in any discussions, on social media, in other debates and other interactions in any event.  There is no doubt of that.  That amendment to the amendment No. 48 will be taken towards the end.  Deputy Howlin may, therefore, wish to indicate if he wants to bring it forward at Report Stage, for example, or revisit it then.  He can indicate this at that time.  For now, however, we will take amendment 1.  I believe Deputy Pringle indicated he is not pressing the amendment at this Stage.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The fact that a lot of what we are talking about is not a criminal offence is where the problem lies but there is already an EU regulation from 2011 which clearly sets out a legal requirement for any of the platforms to remove what is illegal content.</p></speech>

I understand what the Minister is saying but is it the case that if the image is up there, one has to wait until the criminal offence is proven before it is removed?  It could be a long period from the victim in this situation saying that he or she wants the image taken down until it is proven that a criminal offence has occurred.</p></speech>

The onus is there when something is illegal and is brought to the attention of the authorities.  My understanding is that even without a code of conduct, the social media platforms ask their members to adhere to rules and that something like this should be in contravention of those.  It is about making it a criminal offence on our side to strengthen it and also making sure that the online safety commissioner that is being proposed as part of the other legislation would then have an oversight on where the companies are not adhering to their codes of conduct or to the elements around illegal content.  There are  a number of pieces that have to come together but what we have in this Bill will support the other work by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are alternatives to No. 7.  Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are alternatives to No. 10.  Again, we effectively have a block of amendments.</p><p>I move amendment No. 7:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 4, to delete lines 13 to 19 and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;(3) A person commits an offence where he or she, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, stalks another person (in this section referred to as the other person) by&mdash;  	(a) persistently following, watching, pestering or besetting the other person,<br /><br />(b) persistently communicating by any means of communication with the other person, or<br /><br />(c) persistently communicating with a third person by any means of communication about the other person. (4) For the purposes of this section a person stalks the other person where&mdash;  	(a) he or she, by his or her acts intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with the other person&rsquo;s peace and privacy,<br /><br />(b) causes alarm, distress or harm to the other person, and<br /><br />(c) his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would seriously interfere with the other person&rsquo;s peace and privacy and cause alarm, distress or harm to the other person. (5) A person who commits an offence under this section is liable&mdash;  	(a) on summary conviction to a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or<br /><br />(b) on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>The first amendment in this section, No. 7, is in my name.  As I indicated at the start, I will not press any amendments I have tabled myself.  I may return to them on Report Stage but I solely want to note that this pertains to the standalone definition of &quot;stalking&quot; as a separate offence.  It was contained within the Law Reform Commission report as one of the other options for this legislation but it is not contained within the current Bill.  As I said, I will not press that amendment or speak to it any further other than to indicate it and perhaps we will return to that on Report Stage, depending on how the Bill develops in between.  I withdraw amendment No. 7.</p></speech>

I am not going to move the amendment but I will briefly outline the rationale for it.  The Bill already covers the position of relationships and of people known to each other.  This pertains to a position where people may not know each other but content, images or video may come into the possession of somebody through his or her occupation, perhaps in law enforcement, such as a garda, or the medical profession, and there are different scenarios where there could be a trust issue and a breach of trust may ensue.  That could be an aggravating factor.  Again, I just put it out there and I reserve the right to reintroduce the amendment on Report Stage.  I would ask that, if there are any views on this, perhaps they could be communicated in advance of Report Stage so we could consider it then.  I will not press it and I will withdraw amendment No. 12.</p> <p>  Is Deputy Smith pressing amendment No. 8?</p></speech>

That is probably the biggest challenge in that it has a knock-on impact on many other sections of the Bill.  I understand we are taking Government amendments and Opposition or party amendments quite close together because we are trying to progress the Bill as quickly as possible, and it leaves us in this situation where there is a shorter timeframe.  My only concern is that it will have a knock-on impact on the rest of the Bill or elements of it.  I ask that the amendment would not be pushed at this stage, on that basis.</p></speech>

(2) For the purposes of this section a person stalks the other person where-  	(a) he or she, by his or her acts intentionally or recklessly, seriously interferes with the other person&rsquo;s peace and privacy, <br /><br />(b) causes alarm, distress or harm to the other person, and <br /><br />(c) his or her acts are such that a reasonable person would realise that the acts would seriously interfere with the other person&rsquo;s peace and privacy and cause alarm, distress or harm to the other person.  (3) A person who commits an offence under this section is liable-  	(a) on summary conviction to a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or<br /><br />(b) on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>This arises from a recommendation from the National Observatory on Violence Against Women for the definition of stalking to be more concise in the Bill.  That organisation feels strongly that this does not honour fully the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report or those specialist front-line and advocacy services that have called for a separate and specific offence of stalking to be included.  It is important that it is included and that people would not need to be in an intimate relationship in all cases.</p></speech>

What we are trying to do here is strengthen that even further by amending this legislation so harassment is not just to a person but about a person, and where there is a particularly severe element, or where it is of a persistent nature, the maximum penalty increases from seven to ten years.  In terms of creating a new offence, there is a feeling that what is currently there is very good and this will only strengthen it.  Creating a new stalking offence will not change or improve things, given what is already encompassed in the language around harassment.  In previous cases, judges have given decisions under harassment law but have referred to it as stalking, so it is already happening that stalking is being connected with harassment legislation.</p> <p>  In the engagement with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is very much their view that what they have is strong enough.  What we are proposing is to strengthen the harassment piece.  In the language that has been used to date, stalking is very clearly understood to come under the harassment element.  I am not sure that creating a new stalking offence would improve or help things any further.  Again, I understand the intention but what we are being told is that it is not necessarily needed.</p></speech>

I am aware of cases where garda&iacute; are prosecuting people for persistently sending images or persistently following up with people, and that is done under existing laws, so it is not perhaps necessary to create a separate offence.</p><p>The value of the amendment is to be able to raise and clarify that and ensure that it can be addressed in the other legislation.</p><p>  To follow up also on the aggravating factor in the Domestic Violence Act, I see that the Minister has an amendment on that as well which covers the other point that I was also making.</p></speech>

The introduction of the title of stalking does not actually change the Act itself and what a person necessarily has to do to be convicted.  I do not have in front of me the number of cases or times it has been used but through engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the legal profession, and in preparing for this, it has been made clear that this legislation, which we are strengthening and adding to in this Bill, is sufficient to deal with what we are talking about here, namely stalking.  It is perhaps just a different terminology.</p></speech>

Over the past ten years, in particular, the number of cases that have been taken in the court under section 10 has increased greatly.  The offending behaviour in a great number of them seems to cease with either a bail condition or under section 10 (3) where an order can be made.  That tends to remove the problem.  I would have to be convinced that a separate offence of stalking, on top of the new section 4 and the section 10 as exists already, needs to be created with a potential seven-year penalty already in existence.</p></speech>

From my perspective I was very happy to put this amendment down because it gives us an opportunity to have this discussion and to get the clarification from the Minister on the sentencing side of this.  The powers are clearly there but I use this opportunity to call on telecommunications and social media companies to be of greater assistance to An Garda than they have been.</p></speech>

I returned to the point that I made earlier to Deputy Carroll Mac Neill, which is that this is very much thinking of it as not just a physical act of violence but as a continuation of that type of intimidation and abuse against women, mainly, which we are discussing here.

The sense is that this is too prescriptive and makes it more difficult as one has to prove all of this.

That in itself narrows what I am proposing, in the sense that there is a requirement one knows somebody.  What we are proposing here is that there are two separate offences, namely, that a person puts out an intimate image of somebody without his or her consent with the intent to cause harm and then without intent to cause harm.  What is being proposed here is that it would have to be proved that one knew the person.  We are proposing that it is a criminal offence in itself regardless of whether one intended to cause harm or whether one knew the person.  The amendment would mean it would have to be proved that somebody knew the person, even if an offence has been committed.</p> <p>  We are dealing with the issue of a relationship as an aggravating factor in the Bill.</p></speech>

The initial proposals by the Law Reform Commission in its 2016 report on harmful communications and digital safety was to have two separate offences to deal with the distribution of intimate images with the intent to cause harm and the taking or distributing of images without any requisite intent to cause harm.</p><p>This amendment sets out the different offences and penalties as set out in section 4(1) as initiated to intend to accommodate the various different behaviours as have been outlined.  This is considered problematic in terms of the prosecution of such an offence if there is no distinction made in the offence itself as to whether there was an intention or recklessness to cause harm to the victim of the offence.</p><p>What I am proposing is more appropriate to deal with the intended behaviour separately and to provide separate penalties proportional to each.  Where there is an intent to cause harm, the maximum penalty is an unlimited fine and up to seven years in prison.  If it is without intent to cause harm, it is a &euro;5,000 fine and up to 12 months in prison.</p></speech>

The difficulty with the phrase is, of course, that it is a subjective test as to how it impacts on a person.  One of the consequences of this type of offence is that people do not necessarily want to admit it has had a serious effect on them.  If that is the threshold for reaching a prosecution or getting a conviction, it will be difficult.  This may have happened to me without me asking that it happen and I do not want to concede it has had a serious impact.  What does that mean anyway and how do I prove it has had a serious impact or an impact on my relationship or my peace of mind?  People have different thresholds for what interferes with them.  This has a different impact on different people.  I hope I am expressing myself properly.  I appreciate the definitions in the 1997 Act but from the victim's perspective perhaps the word "serious" will create a barrier to making a complaint or complaining at a sufficient level for it to be heard.  It is a barrier for victims.  It may not be something that can be addressed within the timeframe but it is something that has to be looked at from a victim's perspective overall.</p></speech>

The victims in a case like this may not want to admit, make a complaint or do anything.  Perhaps it will be on their minds and cause damage for years afterwards.  A complaint may not come to the surface for quite a length of time.  The reckless and serious interfering with the person's peace is something that could go on for a long time before a complaint is made.  In this context, I wonder how it can be dealt with in the definition.  The person may keep this as a very private hurt and damage.</p></speech>

We are trying to highlight that this is a serious issue, which is why we are making it a criminal offence.  My understanding is there are tests that have to be adhered to in terms of interpreting the impact it has had, and taking into account the language being used and the possible implications for the individual concerned.</p></speech>

The word "seriously" should be removed because intentional or reckless interference is very serious.</p></speech>

There had been some suggestion that consent could be defined a little bit more specifically, such as what is contained in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.

The definition as was included in the sexual offences legislation is quite specific in terms of people being asleep or where there clearly is not consent, which does not really apply in this instance.  We would be creating a separate terminology.  For the purpose of this measure, it might place a more cumbersome onus on the person to have to define it.  The legal advice is that it would be simpler without it, obviously understanding the reason behind the proposal for it.  I do not think it would work when connected to the other definition because it is quite specific to sexual offences.</p></speech>

The offence is intended to criminalise all forms of such communication, including messages distributed, published or sent online through social media platforms, for example, but also in any other manner.  Significant concerns were raised by various stakeholders during the drafting of the amendments about the offence provided for in section 5 of the Bill as initiated.  The main concerns are that a very broad provision on the sending or distribution of threatening, false, indecent or obscene messages could see a lot of online posts or communications between persons come within the remit of the offence.  While there is a requirement for intent to cause harm or to be reckless as to whether harm is caused in the distribution of a message in paragraph (a) of the offence, there was no requirement in respect of paragraph (b), which is considered problematic.  My officials have consulted extensively with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this regard in the development of the offence.<br/><br/>I am aware that it is necessary to try to strike a balance between the right to freedom of speech and the need to protect members of society from significant harm.  The offence I propose involves a lower penalty than that proposed in the Private Member's Bill as this offence will criminalise the sending of one single message.  As such, it should not incur a similar penalty to those incurred by crimes such as harassment, which require persistence.  Any sanction imposed proportionate to the crime committed and the proposed new sentence is considered to be in keeping with offences currently laid out in the Statute Book.<br/><br/>I also propose to narrow the scope of the offence to one which is targeted solely at those who seek intentionally to cause harm to another individual through the use of offensive or threatening communication.  This is to avoid a situation in which there is a large quantity of material, potentially online, which may be offensive in nature but where the person involved did not intend any harm and will not come within the scope of the offence.<br/><br/>Finally, consideration was given to the offence contained in section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act as what was contained in the Private Member's Bill sought to replace this entirely.  Officials from my Department have consulted extensively with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the matter and it was agreed that the offence in the 1951 Act should be retained along with the creation of a new offence which would run in tandem with the Act to address circumstances not entirely provided for in section 13 offence.<br/><br/>This matter will be dealt with in more detail in the context of amendments to delete section 15.  I have discussed it with Deputy Howlin.  I am sorry for the long explanation.</p></speech>

However, if people look back to the original Bill I proposed, in section 5, relating to the sending of threatening messages, was based, as the Minister indicated, on section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951, which goes back a long way.  The 1951 provision related to a person committing an offence by sending any message by telephone which was grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing.  This was restated in the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007.  I sought to incorporate that and replace it with this section of the Bill.  This is one area where the Minister's proposals are probably considerably lesser than the proposals in the original Bill, probably - if I recall - for reasons of ease of prosecution.  The Minister's version stipulates that an offence is committed only where a person distributes or publishes threatening or grossly offensive communication with another person or sends any threatening or grossly offensive communication to that person with intent to cause harm, where that person intentionally seriously interferes with the other person's peace and privacy, causing alarm and distress to the other person.  In other words, the issue of intent in the original Bill was as per the previous section, which refers to being reckless as to whether alarm, distress or harm is caused by the action.  It is quite a big move to prove that the intention to cause harm was deliberate.</p> <p>  The formulation now before the committee, in the Minister's version, is that a defendant would not be guilty of an offence if the prosecution could not prove that that person set about to cause harm intentionally, as opposed to being reckless as to whether or not harm was caused.  My concern is that this would be difficult to prove.  The subsection states that the accused person is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences.  This section would be a saver clause under the Criminal Justice Act.  I mentioned to the Minister that if this were to be inserted into the Bill and if there were a presumption that the natural consequences did in effect cause harm, this would be presumed to be the intent of the perpetrator.  If we could put that saver clause in the Bill, which is, as I said, taken from the Criminal Justice Act 1964, I think it would make this section more robust in prosecutorial terms.</p></speech>

It is important in terms of prosecution.  Again, the issue of seriously interfering with the other person's peace is repeated here and it seems to speak to the impact on the person rather than the seriousness of the act.  The two combined may make it very difficult perhaps not to prosecute but certainly to achieve a prosecution.  It is probably worth looking at the language used because, again, it puts the onus on the victim to prove that it was a serious interference rather than the act in itself being serious.</p></speech>

(1) Where a person is charged with an offence under <i>section 4* or 5**</i>, any person who publishes or broadcasts&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) any information, <br /><br />(b) a photograph of, or a photograph that includes a depiction of, the alleged victim of the offence, or <br /><br />(c) any other representation of the physical likeness, or any representation that includes a depiction of the physical likeness, of the alleged victim of the offence, <br /><br />that is likely to enable the identification of the alleged victim of the offence, is, subject to any direction under <i>subsection (2)</i>, guilty of an offence.  </blockquote>(2) Where a judge of the court in which proceedings for an offence under <i>section 4* or 5**</i>, as the case may be, are brought considers that the interests of justice so require, he or she may direct that such information, photograph or representation referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>as he or she specifies may be published or broadcast in such manner and subject to such conditions (if any) as he or she specifies in the direction. <br /><br />(3) A direction given under <i>subsection (2)</i>shall be in writing. <br /><br />(4) A person who contravenes a direction given under <i>subsection (2)</i>, including a condition in such a direction, is guilty of an offence. <br /><br />(5) A person who is guilty of an offence under <i>subsection (1)</i>or <i>(4)</i>is liable&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) on summary conviction to a class B fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, or <br /><br />(b) on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both.  </blockquote>(6) It shall be a defence for a person who is charged with an offence under <i>subsection (1) </i>or <i>(4)</i>to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the person was not aware, and neither suspected nor had reason to suspect&mdash;  <blockquote> 	(a) in the case of an offence under <i>subsection (1)</i>, that the information, photograph or other representation published or broadcast was information, a photograph or other representation referred to in that subsection, or <br /><br />(b) in the case of an offence under <i>subsection (4)</i>, that the information, photograph or other representation was published or broadcast in contravention of a direction given under <i>subsection (2)</i>, including a condition in such a direction.&quot;. </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This amendment deals with the anonymity of victims under the Bill.  Section 11 of the Bill, as initiated, provides for restrictions on reporting akin to those provided for in section 7 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981, as amended, which would prevent the publication of information with regard to a person against whom an offence has been committed.  Any exception to this must be authorised by the court.</p><p>It is considered that section 11, as drafted, is overly cumbersome.  It is proposed to introduce an &quot;interests of justice&quot; test for a judge to consider whether he or she would lift the requirement not to publish or broadcast information likely to identify a victim.</p><p>Furthermore, if we look at the categories of persons who may be guilty of an offence, under subsection 7 it is considered to be unnecessary and it would be unfavourable to punish anybody who publishes or broadcasts, as defined, information in contravention of the provisions of the Bill.  It also accommodates the changes to the definitions of &quot;publish&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot; in the interpretation section.</p><p>My amendment proposes to cover the image-based offence under the Bill only.  Deputies will agree that any restriction on reporting with regard to criminal matters should be proportionate and, obviously, not taken lightly.  While I am of the view that the anonymity of a victim of an offence relating to the distribution of intimate images should be protected, I am not entirely convinced these restrictions on reporting are justified with regard to the offence of harassment.  This offence encompasses many types of behaviours and scenarios, not all of which justify any restriction on reporting.  This is obviously within the power of a judge in terms of restricting reporting in any criminal trial where he or she feels it is necessary to do so.</p><p>I know this is an area we discussed in terms of having harassment included with sections 4 and 5 as part of the anonymity element.  We need to do a little bit more work and we gave Deputy Howlin a commitment to come back.  We are still working on it but I hope it is something we can address by the time we get to Report Stage.  It is something on which we are working and with which I have no issue.  I suppose we just need to clarify the legality or the implications of it.</p></speech>

This section deals with providing anonymity to victims of offences under the various sections.  The Minister has agreed, in terms of the offences regarding intimate images and so on, that anonymity will be important because, basically, there would be an incredible barrier to people coming forward with complaints if they thought there would be a public discussion about personal images of them and they would be identified.</p><p>In the original proposal, I included victims of stalking and harassment in that level of anonymity as well.  I believe there is a good case for that.  I genuinely believe people, and I may be wrong to say so but I believe it is largely women, who are subject to online harassment and stalking should have the protection of anonymity if they wish to take a case.  It would be a significant barrier to people reporting crimes of this nature, and having those crimes prosecuted, if they felt the level of harassment they endured would be a matter of public discourse and they would be identified in a court.</p><p>I fully accept the point that judges have discretion in these matters.  I believe, however, the Oireachtas should signal that this, as a comprehensive Bill, would include each of the strands we are trying to cover in protecting people from harassment and an anonymity provision would apply here.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to look again at this.  I am interested in the views of other committee members on this point.</p></speech>

Detailed policy discussion with the sponsors of the Bill highlighted that the intention behind this section is to ensure that there would not be any issues with prosecutions in Ireland due to the location of servers in other jurisdiction.  So, for example, there might be an excuse that material was on a server in Dallas, France or wherever else it might be.  The intention behind the section was not to claim extraterritorial jurisdiction over citizens or residents abroad and it does not do so.  As a result, I am satisfied that there are no issues with prosecuting in Ireland where somebody has been harmed or where the offence has been committed in Ireland.  I know that was the initial intention of this section and after further discussion with Deputy Howlin, he has agreed to remove it.  Once the crime is committed here, it is not needed.</p></speech>

It removes the time limit for convictions under the Act and states that there is no time limit.  The test should be as soon as the victim becomes aware of the offending image being used.  That might not necessarily happen within the time limit of two years from the offence taking place.  An image could be shared for two-and-a-half years before the victim becomes aware of it.  As I read the Bill, that means that it could not be prosecuted from that point on.  I want to make sure that the victims will always be able to have a comeback if they discover that the image has been shared.</p></speech>

As it is a summary offence, it is not seen as being as severe an offence.  One could have something which would be quite disproportionate 40 years later come under the same rules as a much more severe or harmful incident.  All the other offences are covered without time limits in the rest of the Bill.  Two years is the maximum increase from six months that has been provided for in the 1851 Act, so I am minded to stick to the two years for this specific offence given that it is a summary offence.  As it is the District Court, it is a lesser offence than the others we are discussing.</p></speech>

There was a request by the Victims Alliance to include the amendment.  Due to the nature of harassment, the person against whom the offence was committed may not have been known to the perpetrator, and the person may not want his or her address disclosed in the documentation.  The perpetrator may not have known the person's address and may just have developed the obsession online, so disclosure of the dwelling address could put the person in greater danger.  The definitions in the section are taken from the Domestic Violence Act 2018.  The Rape Crisis Network of Ireland, RCNI, has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	This amendment to the existing Section 13 [...] as initiated sets out protections for anyone seeking an order under this Section who is afraid of disclosing their whereabouts because they are fearful about their safety and that of their dependants, and also, sets out a procedure to be followed in any case where an order under this Section is needed very urgently.  <br /><br />We are well aware from our work with survivors, including survivors of intimate partner violence, in whose case sexual violence is part of a wider pattern of domestic abuse, that harassment behaviours including image based sexual violence online, are extremely common and also very harmful [...] To counter harassment effectively, urgent action is sometimes needed because of a specific threat or other risk that a potentially devastating course of conduct will be embarked upon whose effects may be difficult, or even impossible, to reverse or mitigate. </blockquote> <p>Without the amendment, it would be difficult for the person's address not to be disclosed in court proceedings.</p></speech>

That was not contained within the new provisions to replace the harassment offence.  From my reading of the section, the provision appears to stand alone.  An order does not necessarily have to follow from a prosecution and can come from an application in its own right.  I presume it is still open to a judge to make that part of a sentence or of the outcome of prosecution, or to make an order on foot of an application in its own right.  Is that the Minister's understanding of it?</p></speech>

This section concerns orders that are not based on a conviction.  As I said by mistake in respect of the previous section, it is being proposed to extend the availability of an application to any court in that regard.  I am minded to support this section but further work needs to be done to amend the provisions.  I would have said that could be done on Report Stage but the indication is it will take longer, into next year.  I propose we return to the issue and perhaps address it in a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  We will give that commitment.  If Deputies are agreeable to developing the matter at a later stage, I propose we delete the provision on Report Stage and deal with it in a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  That will take much longer, however, potentially until January or February next year.</p></speech>

It is currently available to the Bench to do that and it is often done.  It is a very practical measure.

Concerns have been raised about this section which could have broader implications than what is simply being criminalised in the Bill.  The existing section 14 includes communications that are "abusive, threatening, offensive, false, defamatory or an invasion of another person's privacy".  This could potentially include communications that fall outside of the scope of the Bill itself.  We have consulted on this section and the general consensus is that it is not appropriate for inclusion in the Bill for the reasons I have outlined.</p></speech>

I remind members to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.</p> <p>  I welcome members to this first meeting of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It is a great honour for me to have been appointed Chair of the committee and I will work with all of the members to ensure that this committee fully discharges its remit.  At the outset, I apologise for the short notice in calling this meeting.  As members know, we have a very tight timeframe for our work to be completed and it is necessary to have a discussion on how we will organise that work and agree on the invitations to issue for the first meeting.</p> <p>  In this regard, I also want to advise members of the arrangements for committee meetings for the duration of Covid-19.  Many will already be aware of the arrangements which apply, and these relate to keeping 2 m distance at all times, sanitising desks in the usual way and keeping our meetings to two hours.  Members are also requested to wear masks except while contributing.  Second, if anybody wishes for their administrative assistant to have access to the documents for this meeting of the committee, please let the secretariat know so the necessary forms can be completed and returned.  On that point, I welcome our new clerk, Christy Haughton.  We look forward to working with Christy and I am personally very grateful for his help in the last number of days in getting things up and running.</p> <p>  We will continue our discussion in private session.</p></speech>
