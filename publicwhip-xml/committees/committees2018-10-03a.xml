I am pleased to be joined by Ms Laura Magahy,  who was recently appointed as executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.  She was appointed following a comprehensive recruitment process and brings a wealth of experience to the role.  I formally welcome her to the position and assure her of my full support in this challenging but exciting role.  She took up the post officially on 1 September and has hit the ground running since then.  I will ask her to outline her immediate plans for implementation and progress to date shortly.</p> <p>  Just as the Government and I value the cross-party support that produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we recognise that the same support and cross-party co-operation will be required to successfully deliver the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  Every party and grouping in the Oireachtas, bar perhaps one, has said that it is in favour of Sl&aacute;intecare and the implementation thereof.  We need to all work together now to make that a reality.  As I have said to this committee previously, we will only  succeed in bringing about change if everyone, including politicians, clinicians, patients, service users and others, is united on the overall goal and we are all pulling in the same direction.</p> <p>  The publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy in August marked another important step in this process.  The strategy provides an implementation framework for the transformation process and it outlines 106 specific actions that will be taken over the next three years, which are the first three years of the strategy.  I firmly believe that this process is different from others that came before it because this is not my plan and it is not just the Government&rsquo;s plan; this is the long-term plan, everyone's plan and the only plan.  Change of this magnitude cannot be delivered overnight and it is important that we acknowledge this is a strategy that will take time to implement.  The publication of the strategy was an important step, but this is a process that will have many steps over its lifetime.  We have also paid particular attention to getting the implementation governance and structures right, which was rightly important to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  In the past, this has been lacking.  We have had many strategies previously and the lack of an implementation structure has often caused challenges.  I will return to this later.</p> <p>  We are committing to the development of detailed action plans each year and we will measure our progress transparently with twice-yearly progress reports.  This is a new departure in health reform and we are trying to use a model that has been used in the Action Plan for Jobs, for example, where we will not just say that we will do something but we say that we will do it and then report against it.  Every six months, we will publish a progress report to show what we said we would do, who we said would do it, to check if it is done and if so that is great but if it is not why is it not done.  That transparency in reform is something that has been lacking in our health service over many years and it is a focus that I hope we can bring to it.  </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report will be delivered over a 10-year period and, at its core, it will do a number of things.  It will move our system to a population-based approach of healthcare planning and delivery.  This will involve the development of a citizen care master plan for the health service, which will inform service planning, resource allocation, workforce planning and policy prioritisation.  This is important because, in the past, we have tried to develop the health service to suit the health service.  It was the system for the system but what we are trying to do now is find out what services our citizens need, what is the citizens care master plan and  then put the structures in around that rather than the other way around.  Informed by this framework, new models of care will be designed that are structured, coherent and tailored to population need.  It will continue the focus on promoting the health and well-being of our population through the implementation of Healthy Ireland, the framework for improved health and well-being.  A priority action is the publication of the Healthy Ireland outcome framework this year.</p> <p>  A significant part of Sl&aacute;intecare will be the focus on bringing the majority of care into the community.  This will require a much stronger system of community care, with increased resources and an expansion in the range of services that are available.  The initial focus will be on developing capacity to manage chronic disease in the community, development of community intervention teams, which we have made some progress on by increasing investment in, and access to, community-based diagnostic facilities and the development of community nursing services.  We will also move towards a health service where care is provided on the basis of need and not on the ability to pay.  This ambition must be planned carefully and introduced over a period that is appropriate in terms of making sure we have the workforce and the investment in place.  If we get the sequencing of this wrong, all we will do is end up rationing care in the community rather than ensuring that people can access it.  Progress is being made in extending entitlement, including providing medical cards to those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, and GP visit cards to those in receipt of carer's allowance.  The Government has also committed to the introduction of a statutory scheme for home care to support people to live in their own homes.  It is my intention that this scheme will be operational within this first three-year period of the strategy under discussion today.</p> <p>  Under Sl&aacute;intecare, we will move our system from long hospital waiting times to a timely service, especially for those who need it. There is no single solution to this but additional bed capacity both in hospitals and the community is a big part of it, along with investing further in home care services, multi-annual plans for reducing waiting times and considering how best to introduce a waiting time guarantee.  One development that I believe will be significant, which is mentioned in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, is the development of elective hospitals.  We have funding to deliver three elective hospitals with one each in Galway, Cork and Dublin.</p> <p>  I had the opportunity to visit Golden Jubilee Hospital in Scotland just last week with Ms Magahy to see exactly how an elective-only hospital was developed.  The good news is that the hospital administrators have managed to significantly reduce their waiting lists.  When the hospital first opened, people were waiting three years for a hip or a knee replacement but that is down to 12 weeks while people were waiting two or two and a half years for cataract surgery but that is down to an average of four weeks.  We must move on with the development of our elective facilities.  We have seen that it has worked in Scotland and we now need to reproduce that model here.  We will pick the sites for these three hospitals next year.  Our focus is always on driving down waiting lists and ensuring patients can have access to services as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare will also bring about improved governance, performance and accountability, which is something that this committee spends a lot of time talking about and scrutinising for very good reason.  This will be achieved through the establishment of a HSE board, defining new organisational and operational structures for the future reconfiguration of the health services.  The HSE board legislation will be introduced in the Seanad on 10 October and I hope to pass it through both Houses of the Oireachtas this year with everyone's co-operation so that it can take effect at the beginning of next year.  I was pleased to announce Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane as chair-designate of the new board.  He brings a wealth of experience to what will be a challenging role and I look forward to him having an opportunity to come before the committee to be scrutinised on his views and plans for that role.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the importance of implementation governance and structures and I would like to briefly outline a number of key elements.  There is widespread agreement that significant change and reform requires a well resourced programme office to champion, lead and manage the process.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended the establishment of such an office and a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office has now been established.  It will be led by Ms Magahy and it is being resourced with the skills and expertise necessary to lead the reform programme.  The programme office is, as I said in August, working on a detailed action plan which will be published before the end of the year.  This will include a review of all the actions and associated timeframes, the development of detailed milestones and, crucially, the assignment of responsibility for each action.  In the Sl&aacute;intecare report produced by the committee, it asked that when we published the plan, it would then be reviewed by the executive director.  That is the process we are undertaking and it will be published by the end of the year.</p><p>There are two other structures which I wish to draw to the committee's attention.  The first is the Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council.  It is important that we get the stakeholders and ask experts here to help us out in the delivery of this plan because it cannot be something merely owned in the Oireachtas or in the HSE.  I am eager that an advisory council would be in place.  I am delighted that it will be chaired by Professor Tom Keane, an eminent clinician and clinical leader, who came to our country and worked with my predecessors and previous Governments to reform our cancer services, and we are seeing the benefit of those outcomes today.  I am delighted that he has agreed to lend his services to Ireland again.<br/><br/>Professor Keane will chair the advisory council.  It will comprise 23 members.  I am pleased to be in a position to announce the membership of the council.  For the record of the committee, the membership is: Professor Tom Keane, the former director of the national cancer control programme; Ms Laura Magahy, executive director; Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly, consultant geriatrician; Dr. Anthony O'Connor, consultant gastroenterologist; Professor Patrick Broe, general surgeon in Beaumont Hospital and clinical director in the RCSI group; Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer of the HSE; Ms Annette Kennedy, president of the International Council of Nurses; Dr. Ronan Fawsitt, a GP in Kilkenny who has done excellent work in the development of primary care; Ms Gillian O&rsquo;Brien, director of clinical governance at Jigsaw; Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy, an incredible patient advocate with a wealth of experience in this area; Mr. Brendan Courtney, a patient advocate who shone a spotlight on the importance of getting home care and looking after our older citizens' rights in this country; Ms Sarah O'Connor, CEO of the Asthma Society; Mr. Brian Fitzgerald, former CEO of St. James's Hospital and deputy CEO of the Beacon Hospital; Mr. Liam Doran, former general secretary of the INMO; Mr. Leo Kearns, CEO of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI; Dr. Josep Figueras, who, I believe, appeared before the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and is a director of the European observatory; Ms Joanne Shear, former national primary care clinical programme manager at the US Veterans Health Administration; Dr. Heather Shearer, clinical governance expert; Dr. Eddie Molloy, management consultant; Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of Fingal County Council, who brings a wealth of experience in change management; Professor Mary Higgins, obstetrician, National Maternity Hospital; Dr. Anna McHugh, GP registrar, Donegal; and Dr. Emily O'Conor, president of the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine and a consultant in emergency medicine at Connolly hospital.  The committee is almost gender balanced, with a split of 12 to 13.  There are a wide range of skill sets, from a patient advocacy point of view, from a change management point of view and, importantly, from a medical point of view.  I thank those people for stepping up and serving, and offering us their wealth of experience.  The first meeting of the advisory council will take place, and be chaired by Professor Keane, on 24 October.  I hope this committee will at some point have an opportunity to engage with him on his role and how he envisages the advisory council helping us deliver it.<br/><br/>The second structure is the high-level delivery board.  This will comprise the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform and Health, the director general of the HSE and the Sl&aacute;intecare executive director.  This is important.  The Committee on the Future of Healthcare stated that it wanted a whole-of-government approach to this and having a high-level delivery board that the executive director can feed in to and that can then feed in to the Cabinet Committee on Health, chaired by the Taoiseach, is crucial.  Having in the room the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Health and Public Expenditure and Reform is important and very much in line with the committee's strong recommendation on the need for cross-government support.<br/><br/>We have begun progressing a number of recommendations.  We moved ahead with the establishment of the HSE board.  That legislation will commence in the Seanad next week and I would appreciate co-operation on that.<br/><br/>Crucially, we have carried out a public consultation on the geo-alignment of hospital groups and community healthcare organisations.  This has been completed and I will publish the results shortly.  I want to move ahead with outlining what geo-alignment will look like this year and I will need the committee's support on this.  Drawing lines on maps is never the easiest exercise for any politician to do.  The Sl&aacute;intecare committee helpfully left it to my Department to work out how best to divide up the country, but what the committee was keen on, and what I am keen on, is that we move away from this siloed approach that there are duplicate management structures for community care and hospital care.  If we are to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, we need geo-alignment.  We need a singular budget for a certain part of the country to deliver the whole spectrum of care.  That is what we need to get to.<br/><br/>I have taken the decision, in consultation with Ms Magahy, to move forward on that at a quicker pace than originally envisaged and I intend to announce my proposed geo-alignment this year.  This is the potential game-changer that the committee wants to see in terms of Sl&aacute;intecare because one can no longer have siloed budgets with somebody saying that patient X needs to remain in the hospital because it will cost him or her to care for that patient in the community or <i>vice versa</i>.  One budget with a board for each regional entity holding people to account at a regional level is an important way.  It will help deliver integrated care.  However, if we are to legislate for this, I will need cross-party support to deliver this.  I would be happy to discuss with the committee the public consultation document in advance of that or to send that to the committee so that it could consider it.  I would very much welcome, in the spirit of bipartisanship, the committee's consultation.<br/><br/>The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was also clear on the role of private practice in public hospitals.  Let me be clear, because sometimes I hear myself described by my opponents wrongly in this regard, I am in favour of the removal of private practice from public hospitals but, like the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, I am in favour of doing so in an intelligent, phased way.  I have made my views on this quite clear.  Our current mixed model system is an outlier.  We cannot convince ourselves it is the norm.  It is not the norm.  It is an outlier that one can have a public hospital full to capacity and a patient who is in greater need of care not getting that care because somebody is carrying out private practice in that hospital.  We cannot stand over that, but we also have to do it right and we cannot do it overnight.  The committee asked me to set up an independent review group to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system.  I have done that and it is being chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir.  The work is ongoing and I expect to receive that report by the end of this year or shortly thereafter.  This will provide valuable guidance and I would welcome an opportunity to discuss with this committee.  However, my policy objective is clear.  I believe we need to remove private practice from public hospitals but we need to do it in a way that makes sense.<br/><br/>I will briefly refer to the role general practice needs to play in this.  We cannot deliver a decisive shift to primary care or community care and more services if we do not resource general practice.  The committee will be pleased to hear that I have reached agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on significant multi-annual funding for general practice and I expect intensive engagement to commence on this matter in the next few weeks.<br/><br/>Finally, I have mentioned capacity.  The health service, even when one implements reforms, does not have adequate bed capacity.  We do not compare favourably internationally in this regard.  The Government's national development plan, NDP, commits &euro;10.9 billion, much of which is directed at Sl&aacute;intecare.  This will include 2,600 additional beds, the elective hospitals I mentioned and 4,500 community care beds that have been identified.  It will also include the roll-out of eHealth, which is so important and which was a key recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare, and putting diagnostics into our primary care centres.  There are 124 primary care centres in operation throughout the country.  The key now is what more can they do.  Can we put more X-ray facilities, more ultrasound facilities and more staff into these facilities?  I am pleased that the development plan will deliver that.<br/><br/>I am confident that the plan that many members in this room worked so hard on and engaged on for such a long period of time is the right plan and that if we implement it, we will very much be on the right track.  We agreed on a vision and we now have an implementation strategy.  We have dedicated staff, led by Ms Magahy, to deliver and implement this strategy.  We will report twice a year.  We will publish detailed annual action plans and resource this through the budgetary process as well.  This will require a broad coalition of support and I look forward to working with all stakeholders on the important agenda.<br/><br/>With the Chairman's permission, I will ask Ms Magahy to say a few words.</p></speech>

I very much look forward to working with all of them over the next number of years to deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare objectives and on the principles outlined in the original Oireachtas report.</p> <p>  The robustness of the Sl&aacute;intecare structure gives a sound underpinning and I suppose I am the little circle in the middle.  The implementation office is in the middle and will be supported by the advice from the advisory council, which I very much welcome, reporting through to the other structures that the Minister has outlined.  I believe it gives a strong link back through to the system, and down and out to the people who are delivering the services.</p> <p>  The remit of the programme office is to establish the programme of reform to develop a strategic and programmatic approach to implementation working with all parts of the system to ensure that everybody is following the strategy and to work collaboratively with all the stakeholders, support the work of colleagues in their reform efforts and report progress.  I am keen not to duplicate any effort that is under way and, therefore, I proposing to have a small tight office, which then connects to the people who are doing the work, and to have a strong focus on implementation.</p><p>I am mindful that everyone here has a part to play in the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Key to its delivery is continuing political buy-in and the leadership that was shown by the cross-party Oireachtas committee.  That support is very important to me while the implementation process is going on, and I look forward to working with the members of this committee.  I hope to continue to have their support.  I am very happy to meet the members individually if they would like more details on what I am proposing.  I encourage them to get involved in the process.</p><p> Citizen engagement and empowerment is key, and I am beginning a programme to that end before the end of this year.  It is essential that there is buy-in to this process.  Enabling those on the front line who are delivering services is also key, and also the wider determinants.  We tend to focus on the HSE and those structures, but we need to involve the wider determinants for prevention purposes, in particular, for the health and well-being of people.

The office was established, and I am now engaged in beginning discussions with people about what is important to them and identifying their priorities.  Key to my job is to come back before the end of December with an action plan for 2019 setting out who is doing what, where, when and how.  That is what I am focused on.  There are 106 actions in this strategy, and I am intent on delivering within the set time limits.  The advisory council has been established and it is meeting for the first time in October.  I have finalised my approach to the citizen care master plan, and the citizen engagement and empowerment process will roll out before the end of the year.  The budget is under discussion at the moment.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet it.  I look forward to working with it.</p></speech>

Every member will have seven minutes to interact across the floor.  We would appreciate it if members could be concise with their questions, and perhaps the Minister would be concise with his answers so that we can move along speedily.</p> <p>  Why was the Sl&aacute;intecare office not set up in the Department of the Taoiseach rather than in the Department of Health, as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report?  Given the nature of building in Ireland, particularly the building of hospital beds, when does the Minister expect the first new hospital bed to be built and available?  I understand that most of the capital resources are going into the completion of the children's hospital at the moment, which will not be completed until 2021 or 2022.</p> <p>  Why is there no reference whatsoever in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy to the setting up of a national health fund, which was a central component of the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations on how this would be funded going into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#G00500"><p>The question as to whether the office should reside in the Department of Health or the Department of the Taoiseach was discussed at this committee, and I made my views very clear on that at the time.  The Minister for Health is accountable to the Oireachtas for the delivery of the health service under Sl&aacute;intecare, subject to the health Acts and the powers and functions of the HSE.  The Minister for Health is also accountable democratically in terms of answering parliamentary questions, Topical Issue debates, Private Member's motions and legislation.  To hive off responsibility for reform of the health service from the Minister for Health of the day would have been a very peculiar construct, in my view, and the view of the Government, taking into account the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  We made sure there was a structure in place to try to achieve the same objective.  I flagged that with the Sl&aacute;intecare committee in advance of publication and at this committee post publication.  People can agree or disagree that we have achieved that, but it is what we endeavoured to do.  Ensuring that there is a high-level delivery board involving the three secretaries general of the crucial Departments - the Department of the Taoiseach, representing the Taoiseach of the day, the Department of Health, representing me, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of resourcing - is the way to go.  The Taoiseach will chair the Cabinet committee on health, and the Sl&aacute;intecare office, including Ms Magahy and me, will account to the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  The question about beds is very valid.  I can assure the Chair that I ask that question several times a week.  I asked the HSE to produce a document detailing the number of beds it could deliver over the next three years using a combination of modular build, existing space in hospitals and a degree of internal reconfiguration to make more space or to use space more efficiently within hospitals, and it has responded, stating that it could deliver around 600 hospital beds.  I can send the Chair a detailed note, because I do not have the exact details to hand, but the answer to the question asked is that over the next three years approximately 600 of the 2,600 beds can be delivered.  A big chunk of those beds will be delivered towards the latter half of 2019.  The Chair is familiar with Limerick, geographically and medically.  Delivery of modular builds would create 60 beds for University Hospital Limerick.  I am very committed to doing that, and I have discussed it with the CEO of the hospital group.  That is an example of the delivery of the first tranche of 600 beds.</p> <p>  It was decided, when we published the implementation plan, not to make any decisions that are matters for the budget outside of the normal budgetary cycle.  However, we will require an integration fund for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  There is a lot of funding in the Department of Health already, and any extra funding through the budget will be Sl&aacute;intecare-proofed.  Almost &euro;11 billion has been allocated in the capital plan.  My analysis of the plan suggests that &euro;6.6 billion of that is for Sl&aacute;intecare, whether through elective-only, diagnostics in the community, bed capacity in the community hospitals or eHealth.  Above and beyond that, I have to empower Ms Magahy and her team to deal with the large-scale roll-out of projects to take services from the acute hospitals into the community.  The Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council will assist in that.  The Sligo eye care model is one that people often talk about.  It has been piloted for so long that everyone accepts that it works.  At what point can we roll it out?  In Deputy Kelly's constituency there is the Nenagh cataract theatre.  If it works in Nenagh, we should be able to roll it out nationally.  We know that community intervention teams, CIT, work, and they should also be rolled out nationally.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare recommended that funding would be allocated to the plan annually, providing between &euro;306.85 million to &euro;450 million to cover the expansion of entitlements and a &euro;3 million transition fund to make up for the lack of infrastructure over recent years.  However, in the implementation strategy there is no reference to funding whatsoever.  A reference is made to an integration fund, but no value is put on that fund.</p></speech>

When the implementation plan was launched in August, I made the point that the Government has decided that the resourcing of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is something in which all political parties have a role to play in a minority Government, is a matter for the Estimates process.  The budget is next week.</p></speech>

She has taken on a Herculean task.  Fianna F&aacute;il has signed up to Sl&aacute;intecare.  It helped to write it and would like to see it implemented.</p> <p>  Healthcare reform is difficult and complex and regularly fails in different jurisdictions around the world.  One of the things it requires is credibility of leadership, and I am worried by parts of the statement the Minister has made.  Understandably, he is looking to the future, but there is no reflection on the problems we have at the minute.  Since 2011, healthcare spending has gone up every year, per person and when adjusted for inflation, and yet waiting times across the board for men, women and children all over Ireland are worse than ever.</p><p>For the third year in a row there has been a massive budgetary overrun and it is fair to say that clinicians all over the country are at their wits' end.  </p><p> I will focus on waiting times because the issue affects patients the most.  Children with special needs are waiting three and half years for treatment.  Young children with scoliosis are waiting three years for treatment.  In the rest of Europe spinal curvature is not allowed to exceed an angle of 45 degrees but in Ireland the limit is 100 degrees.  For the first time ever, the number of people on waiting lists has exceeded 1 million.  When one adds the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, figure to all the other figures, the number totals 1 million people, which has never happened before.  In spite of annual increases in funding, the position is worsening.  Let us take the number of people waiting for surgery for more than a year.  In 2010, that figure was slightly more than 700 people but now stands at 14,000.  For every one person in Ireland who was waiting over a year for surgery in 2010, there are now 20.  This goes to the heart of credibility.</p><p> My real fear is that the responsibility for fixing these failures is now being put on Sl&aacute;intecare.  The presentation lists seven Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.  I will not read them all but I put it to the Minister that four of them should have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare as they are the job of government.  Promoting the health of our population is normal healthcare.  Moving our system from long waiting times to a timely service has nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare and is the job of the Government.  Waiting times were falling drastically and were 20 times lower in 2010 than they are now in certain areas.  Accountability and performance is also the normal job of healthcare management.  I am concerned that there is a lack of acknowledgement of just how bad things have become in healthcare for patients and clinicians.  Sl&aacute;intecare is being given the role of system reconfiguration and moving to a more modern model of care.  That is its responsibility but I am concerned that Sl&aacute;intecare is being tasked with fixing the problems that are the normal job of Government to fix, for example, waiting times and avoiding significant budgetary overruns every year.</p><p> In the spirit of trying to get this right, does the Minister accept the failures in the healthcare system today, particularly in terms of waiting lists which are longer than they have been since records began?  Does he agree that in order to implement a very serious and ambitious programme of change, we will need much more competence in delivery by Government based on what patients are facing every day?  How does he plan to provide that competence given that what we are facing and what we have all signed up to is a complex, difficult and important programme of change?  </p></speech>

I thank Deputy Donnelly.  Certainly, when I look to reform I will definitely look to the future and I will not the past.  The way that people have endeavoured to reform the health service has created many of the current problems.  The establishment of a national entity, an idea most political parties agreed with, was botched.  As a result, we have layers of bureaucracy that often make it impossible for citizens to find answers.  I welcome the cross-party approach to how we should reform the health service in a way that is very much better than the reforms that have gone before.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly listed a number of objectives which he claimed have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.  They are very much in the programme, as the Deputy knows.  Sl&aacute;intecare deals extensively with the issues I raised in connection with waiting lists and calls on me to address them.  What I am doing is accounting to this committee today for my intention to do that.  </p> <p>  I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that everything in healthcare has worsened.  It depends on what one measures.  For starters, let us talk about waiting lists.  Some of the figures now published on waiting lists were not published before the Government took office.  Outpatient figures were not published before 2014.  When speaking about current figures the Deputy is not comparing like with like.  There are challenges in terms of waiting lists.  In line with a commitment agreed by Deputy Donnelly's party and my party in the confidence and supply agreement, the number of people waiting for inpatient day-case treatment has fallen by 13,000.</p> <p>  Outpatient services are a major challenge.  One of the main ways to address the issue is through the Sl&aacute;intecare model by identifying who can be seen locally in the primary care centre by a general practitioner or an advanced nurse practitioner.  Many of the metrics are much better than previously.  I do not suggest the Deputy did this but blaming Government policy for all of the failures in the health service and crediting everything but Government policy and investment for everything that is good in it does not stand up to scrutiny.  Children with cystic fibrosis will, thank God, live an awful lot longer than they would have done heretofore.  That is as a result of great clinicians but also the significant investment we have made in drugs such as Orkambi.  The same applies to outcomes for cancer, stroke, heart conditions and life expectancy.  While having one person on a trolley is one too many, the HSE TrolleyGAR number fell by 5% in September.</p> <p>  I accept that there is a substantial body of work to do and very many challenges in healthcare.  However, I do not accept that everything in healthcare is in crisis because every single day many people have a positive experience.  We surveyed patients who stayed at least one night in an acute adult hospital last year.  When we asked how they found their experience from the moment they walked into the emergency department to the moment they were discharged, 86% of respondents indicated their experience was good or very good.  However, I need to be worried every moment of every day about the 14% who did not have a good experience.  If we are to address that issue, we need to implement Sl&aacute;intecare. </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare plan has credibility because it has something we have never had before in healthcare.  First, all of us support it but, more important than the political support for the plan, it has a decent chance of being given the time it will need to function.  In case Deputy Donnelly is ever appointed Minister for Health, I should point out that what people in the health service despair about is another new Minister arriving with a bright shiny plan.  We now have one plan and we are all pulling in the same direction.  It will require resources.  To answer the Deputy's question on delivering Sl&aacute;intecare and accountability for its delivery, as the Minister for Health, I am accountable for delivering it.  Ms Magahy is charged with running the Sl&aacute;intecare office but I am accountable to the Oireachtas for the delivery of this plan.  If we publish an action plan at the end of this year and say we will do this, that and the other and report against that every six months, I will be accountable to the Deputy and he people of Ireland for achieving those commitments. </p></speech>

My concern is that Sl&aacute;intecare will be tasked with solving problems such as waiting lists.  We do not need Sl&aacute;intecare to reduce waiting lists, promote the health of the population, drive accountability and performance or deliver a healthcare system that has the ability to plan and execute.  We need Sl&aacute;intecare for reconfiguration.  Reducing waiting lists and helping the men, women and children on those lists have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Most of these problems have worsened in recent years.</p> <p>  How much money will the Minister seek explicitly for Sl&aacute;intecare activities over the next one to five years, as opposed to the normal expected increases in healthcare expenditure that we would expect to see?</p></speech>

While I take the Deputy's point, I do not agree that Sl&aacute;intecare is not the key to addressing many of these challenges, including waiting lists.  Delivering what Sl&aacute;intecare calls on me to deliver is key.</p> <p>  With one week to go before the budget, I cannot answer the Deputy's question on how much I am seeking, or perhaps his party is seeking, in the budget for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I can give one example of multi-annual expenditure.  Of almost &euro;11 billion provided for capital expenditure, &euro;6.6 billion is what I would describe as Sl&aacute;intecare funding for the delivery of its capital elements.  The current expenditure elements will be a matter for budget day next week and the HSE service plan thereafter.  I will be happy to continue our interaction on the Deputy's questions later.</p></speech>

There is an awful lot riding on the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.</p> <p>  I listened to the previous exchange on which Government made the biggest mistakes in the health service.  We could play that game all day but it probably will not advance the discussion.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has measured trolley waits for a long time and its figures do not always concur with the figures produced by the HSE's TrolleyGAR.  The INMO figures show the position is getting worse.</p><p>Will the Minister confirm that the overspend and the carrying over of recurring expenses will be addressed in the budget?  We talk about investment but months after the previous budget the Minister received a letter from the head of the HSE saying that it was in trouble as a result of underfunding.  Deputy Pearse Doherty pointed that out to the Minister but he did not listen.  Maybe he listened this year, and I hope that he did.  Will he confirm that?</p></speech>

I have seen no evidence that any progress has been made on the renegotiation of the GP contract.  Will the Minster update us on where that process has reached?  I have repeatedly asked questions about staffing for primary care centres, and each time I receive the same answer.  It is a real cut and paste job which says services will be provided from within existing resources.  I can even quote it from memory.  There are no new staff.  If the Minister has a vision for how this will work without staff, I would love to hear it.  I doubt he does, however, so we must hear about where the staff are going to come from and, specifically, what the Minister will do in regard to GPs.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare provides that there will be legislation for entitlement for all residents to access health and social care and a guarantee on waiting lists underpinned by legislation.  The implementation plan has changed that slightly and uses the words "expand eligibility on a phased basis to move towards universal healthcare".  If it is universal, then we do not have to discuss eligibility.  There seems to be some contradiction.  There has also been some slippage with the universality but also the legislation to underpin guaranteed waiting times.  I echo the previous comments.  It is very much bound up with the waiting lists, because it is a mechanism, but the waiting lists must also be addressed separately.</p> <p>  Will the costings that the Department of Health will use in the implementation strategy be published along with the implementation report?  It is important that we see that and that we see real progress.  No one wants this to be merely a tick-box exercise.</p></speech>

On the overspend, as my colleague, the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure said, possibly at a Committee on Budgetary Oversight meeting last week, he and I are actively engaging in addressing what will be a requirement for supplementary funding for the health service this year.  I am very confident that we can reach agreement on that.  That issue will crystalise and I expect that it would be resolved in the next few days.</p> <p>  I would need to come back for a separate session on overspend versus value for money because I could use almost my seven minutes on that.  There is a need for accountability on the resources that are given and a need to ensure that we have an adequate budget each and every year within the resources available.</p> <p>  On GPs, as I said in my opening statement, in recent days I reached an agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which gives me a mandate to engage with GPs on a multi-annual investment programme.  It is a very substantial programme, both as the subject of negotiations and the budget, so I cannot be more specific.  That said, I genuinely expect very intensive engagement in coming weeks with GPs and I expect to be in a position to be able to increase significantly the investment in general practice starting next year, subject to agreement.</p> <p>  The Deputy, to be fair to her, regularly raises the issue of the staffing of primary care centres.  I will see if we can get the Deputy some specific information on this.  When I open primary care centres, I am regularly told about the additional staff working there and the additional specialties being undertaken.  I will try to get Deputy O'Reilly a note and will be happy to come back and debate that with her.</p></speech>

There may be new staff moving in from other areas, say in Balbriggan, where they closed the health centre and moved them into the new health centre, but that does not represent additional staff for a town with the fastest growing population in the State.  That is only shifting staff around.  No new services can be developed just because someone is taken out of a building that is derelict and put them into one that is shiny.</p></speech>

I would point out, however, that there were extra occupational therapy posts this year, extra speech and language therapy posts recently, and more than 140 assistant psychology posts.  I will ask Ms Magahy to do some work on that.  I also ask her to speak about how we will plan for the workforce for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

It is around the needs of the population, and that is what the geoalignment will facilitate.  It will need a combination of approaches based on whatever the needs are.  We will talk to the different training bodies about training extra GPs and practice nurses, for example, training advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, and community nurses, and cross-training for multidisciplinary team approaches, and about trying to get that in the colleges at an early stage rather than everyone being trained in their own specific area and then being expected to work in a multidisciplinary way later, by miracle.  There is also clinical managerial training.  We are starting to engage younger professionals and enlisting their views, because of the disaffection that many have expressed about working in the system, to hear what they have to say.  It will have to follow the model of care and what that will look like when we start to move types of work which are taking place in the hospitals into the community.</p></speech>

It is in the Sl&aacute;intecare report but it is not in the implementation plan.  I am conscious of time and do not want to eat into others&rsquo; time.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy O'Reilly on the word "entitlement" rather than eligibility and we will revert to using entitlement.  The idea is that every citizen in this country should be entitled to access care in their community.  We want universal entitlement and universal access to primary care.</p> <p>  The second thing is important, and is outlined in actions in section 6.2 of the 106 actions that we published.  Sl&aacute;intecare does say that it should be low cost or no cost.  That is a direct phrase in the report, and Sl&aacute;intecare refers specifically to that.  Actions 6.2.1 to 6.2.3, inclusive, outline three very specific actions that we will undertake in establishing the framework and developing the roadmap for achieving universal access, both of which will start next year.  That is still the position.</p> <p>  We are committed to guaranteed waiting times.  The implementation plan is committed to doing that.</p></speech>

I will come back with the specific number in one moment.  However, I do want to legislate for waiting times.  I spoke to the Scottish health minister about this last Friday.  I want to do it and make sure that we can deliver them.  The elective-only model was how they did it in Scotland.  We have given a commitment to picking three sites next year for the delivery of elective-only hospitals.  I want to see if we can move ahead more quickly with one of these so that we have a demonstrated project, and then we can legislate for the waiting times.  However, I need to ensure that the capacity is there before legislating for the waiting times.  I will return to the Deputy in a moment about where this is written.</p> <p>  Did the Deputy ask me another question?</p></speech>

The first is directly for Ms Magahy and relates to her.  I do not know how many people in this room were involved in writing the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  To be fair to the Minister, the specific structures put in place - the advisory council, where it fits within Government, structures and everything like that - are those for which we asked.</p><p>What is the programme office going to have as its own resources?  Ms Magahy referred to a small team earlier on; what is it?  Within those structures there is no doubt that there will be frustrations from time to time, dare I say some of them with the man sitting beside Ms Magahy or whoever is in his role.  How is she going to deal with them?  How is she going to ensure she can get traction within the structures that have been put in place when she is missing deadlines, timelines are not being put in place, and resources are not available?  There will be absolutely an element of that.  How is she going to use those structures and what is she going to do to ensure that she is getting what she wants when she wants it?  </p><p> On the 106 actions, there is the whole area of the first number of years and prioritisation.  For instance, one of the biggest priorities, which I insisted on, was bringing forward community care, all the issues in respect of home help and the whole range of stuff there, which is common sense, as well as bringing forward diagnostics because it is creating blockages all over the place.  I know she is only in her role 25 days, but could Ms Magahy use that as an example in her answer as to how the programme office is going to interact within the structures to make it achievable within the three-year timeframe?</p><p> My next question is for the Minister and concerns the hospital capacity review and its implementation.  I think I must thank him for his news, as he more or less said the 60-bed unit in Limerick is to be part of the plan he is going to announce.  I appreciate that he has confirmed that.  With Clonmel and Limerick on either side of me, I get the benefit of having the two worst situations as regards accident and emergency departments and people on trolleys in the whole country.  On the actual capacity, I presume there will be some process whereby the alignment of this work with the alignment of Sl&aacute;intecare is going to be engineered because that is critical.</p><p> The Minister might outline a little bit more - best of luck with this one, I mean that in jest - the whole issue of geo-alignment.  He said he had timelines for that, what are they?  Again I agree with him that it has to be brought forward.  I do not think Ms Magahy's work can progress until that alignment happens.</p><p> When will the report from the committee of Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir be available in respect of public-private?  The Minister made a statement about GP contracts, I presume in respect of multiple annual funding.  Senator Swanick will probably have questions on this.  We all know the level of progress is not what it should be.  Is the Minister saying that since he has got this agreement now, he is going to see progress moving at a different pace imminently?</p></speech>

This is just work in progress.  The first is around the citizen care master plan, so I will need population health planning expertise as part of my team but will also be working out in the system with people who have that expertise.  In terms of co-ordination, governance and value for money, which is my second work stream, I will need finance and governance advice coming into my team.  My third work stream is about teams of the future and I have talked a little bit about that; obviously, I will need workforce planning expertise.  Finally, I have the sharing progress work stream which is about communications and engagement.  Through those, we have some service design people, some project managers, critically.  I will also need input from different people at different points in time, for example with an economics background or whichever pieces are needed at the time.  Between now and the end of the year, I am working out how the action plan is going to be structured and what my team is going to be in-house.  I am going to keep it tight because there is expertise out in the system and I am proposing that the office is a kind of bridge out to the system just to make sure everything is co-ordinated and happening in the right sequence.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

What is she going to do?</p></speech>

Being serious, one cannot do something unless one knows one has the right resources behind it.  I will not be promising that I can deliver something unless I have the right resources.  I will not know I have the right resources for the next number of months.  To be fair, until the end of the year, when I have worked out what the priorities are, which I have committed to doing and which I will do, it is hard to predict exactly what they will require.  The things the Deputy outlined in terms of bringing the community care closer and making sure it works properly is definitely and the other things he outlined, the home help, diagnostics and so on, are absolutely priorities.  If the whole system is going to work, that has to be a first focus.</p></speech>

The Deputy has highlighted it here many times.  They are working very hard at hospital level to develop and deliver on a modular proposal.  My understanding is that they sought planning permission and that there may be a further appeal there.  That information is subject to correction; I just read it somewhere.  Subject to that being rectified, I want to see this progress urgently.</p></speech>

I want to thank the hospital group CEO.  She put a lot of work into it and ploughed on with it as well, which was very important for being ready.  In Clonmel, the 40-bed modular is progressing.  My understanding is that it is due to open very early in the new year.  I will confirm that with the Deputy.  I hope to be in a position to visit it shortly.</p> <p>  On geo-alignment, what the Deputy said is 100% correct.  If the idea of Sl&aacute;intecare is to reduce bureaucracy, increase accountability and move more services locally where appropriate to do so, we need to have regional entities with joined-up thinking and a continuum of care for the patient.  Until we grasp that nettle, we cannot move forward much further.  That is why we have taken a decision and there are a number of actions.  The first strategic action is to consult and finalise decisions on the geographic alignment of hospital groups and community healthcare organisations by the end of this year.  I will announce by the end of this year what I would like to be the regional entities; ultimately, it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to legislate.  In 2019, in another specific action, we will introduce modifications to the hospital groups and community health organisations to ensure geographic alignment and will begin to develop processes for integrated performance management on an interim administrative basis.  We will let them bed in and test.  We will start in 2019 to devolve decision making.  We have done this already with the hospital groups.  We will devolve decision making and autonomy in line with their functionality.  The action plan states that in 2021 we will legislate for these revised structures but, if I am to be very honest, if there was a willingness in the Oireachtas to legislate a little bit earlier I would be very open to doing that as well.  I would like to do it quickly.</p> <p>  The other action on the alignment piece is for next year and is a really important one.  As well as doing this, it is also envisaged to define the new organisational operation structure in terms of what the new slimmed-down HSE will do over time and what the Department of Health will do over time, the Department in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare and the HSE in the context of new regional entities.  There are five specific actions there on geo-alignment all taking place by the end of next year.</p> <p>  On Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir's group, publicly he has stated that he will have his work completed by the end of this year.  I would hope to receive that report by the end of this year or very early next year.  It is going to be a very important piece of work.  As the Deputy knows, there are many vested interests arguing as to why we should not do this.  There are many people whom the Deputy and I represent who need us to get it right.  We need to get it right on a phased basis and in an appropriate way.  I will be very much influenced by the work of that expert group which includes a lot of really good expertise.</p> <p>  On the GP contract, put bluntly, yes, I expect to be in a position to see progress if there is willingness on both sides, which I really think there is but it takes two sides to negotiate.  I have a mandate now from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and from my own Department in terms of policy objectives being aligned with the funding stream.</p></speech>

I especially welcome Ms Magahy and wish her well with what will not be an easy task.  If there is anything I can do personally, my door will always be open to her.  Well done to everybody involved in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Much hard work went into the plan.  It is fantastic that health is now above politics and, through Sl&aacute;intecare, it will remain that way and we will all be on the same hymn sheet.  Other Departments should take note and act accordingly.</p> <p>  I apologise if I repeat any of the questions asked by other members.  I had to step out to meet some farmers who travelled from west Cork.  The Minister said the Sl&aacute;intecare programme will move the health system to a population-based approach.  Will he elaborate on that statement?  He stated "new models of care will be designed that are structured, coherent and tailored to population need."  When does he expect this to occur?  Could it not have been started already?</p> <p>  The Minister also stated the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare will require a stronger system of community care.  Has a decision been taken on what that system will be?</p> <p>  The Minister emphasises that Sl&aacute;intecare will be "for those who need it most".   I find that description abstract and I wonder what the criteria will be.  Who will decide who needs it most?</p> <p>  This may not be the correct forum but, on a personal level, I ask for the Minister's permission to contact him about a matter.  I was contacted this morning by a constituent who has been waiting for 17 weeks for the result of a smear test.  An initial test came back unclear so the patient was advised to retest.  She has now been told she will have to wait another 17 weeks for the second result.  May I contact the Minister on that matter?</p></speech>

We will look at a map of Ireland not just in a geographical sense but in terms of where our citizens live and what needs they have.  Ms Magahy spoke passionately about citizen engagement and empowerment.  What do the citizens of Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's region or my region want their health service to look like?  We need to develop the structures around that, rather than continuing, as we have often done in healthcare, to put up the structures and then tell patients to come and access them.</p> <p>  On why new structures are not yet in place, that is a valid question and one that many people at home are also asking.  The Deputy made the point that Sl&aacute;intecare is above party politics, which is exactly the answer.  The risk is that if I, as the current Minister, or another Minister before or after me, tinkers with and starts changing the structures, they then become the structures of this or that Minister and often do not last the test of time.  There has been far too much chopping and changing in health, and all of us in the political system are collectively guilty of not allowing the health service to properly bed in to a programme of reform.  The beauty of and difference with this programme is that while I, as the incumbent, will implement it, in all likelihood those who come after me will also have signed up to it.  This means there is a good chance it will be done and will stand the test of time.</p> <p>  On community care, we have made progress on some of the issues.  We have given a commitment, for example, to a statutory home care scheme.  I know the Deputy has a strong view that, as politicians, we say we want everyone to be able to grow old at home in his or her own community with dignity but the only statutory scheme we currently have is the fair deal for nursing home care.  Home care around the country is variable in its delivery.  The idea that there would be a statutory home care scheme is one example of the community care.  The model we need to roll out for our nurse practitioners and the general practitioner contract is still ongoing.</p> <p>  What do we mean by "those who need it most"?  The authors of Sl&aacute;intecare, many of whom are here today, are trying to move away from a position where the ability to pay trumps medical need.  This is a move with which I agree.  We want to ultimately have a system where nobody lies awake in bed at night wondering if he or she has the money to access healthcare the next day.</p></speech>

They need all the luck and assistance in the world.  The structures that are now emerging are not exactly my first choice because the question that comes up all the time is whether the HSE is the appropriate structure to evenly deliver throughout the country the services that are required.  I still hold that view although I note the implementation group has a minor version of what I had in mind, and hopefully it will work.</p> <p>  The population of the country has increased significantly in the past ten or 12 years, and it will increase more.  It is double what it was in the early 1960s and that should be taken into account.  If we rely on community care and primary care systems, we need to know whether we have the capacity and capability to do the job that is required at that level.  However, we have not yet found out if that is the case because it has not been identified if we have that capacity.  We do not know whether we are making the best use of the available resources, such as theatres, consultants and so on.  This will not happen unless services are delivered around the clock.  People do not get ill from Monday to Friday only.  The problem is serious and unless we do something about this issue, it will worsen.</p> <p>  I am glad to see the bed shortage issue is being addressed.  Various people have stated repeatedly before different committees of which I have been a member, including this one, that we have too many beds.  We still hear this argument from time to time.  I am glad it has finally been recognised that we need to have sufficient beds and accommodation and we need to ensure patients are not parked on trolleys around corridors, which creates a health and safety issue for patients, staff and everyone else.  We also need to compare our costs and expenditure with those of other OECD countries.  There is no use spending more on average than everyone else while delivering less.  We must deliver on a par with our competitors.  Otherwise, we have a problem.</p> <p>  There are specific areas where treatment has been lacking in recent times.  Scoliosis is one case in point.  I cannot understand how it took a survey by RT&Eacute; to identify the extent of the problem and its most acute aspects.  That should not happen.  If the system had been vigilant, internally capable and doing the job it is supposed to do, we should have seen the problem long before we reached that stage.  We need to be able to deliver services in a much sharper fashion for children and other patients on waiting lists who have acute problems.  There are countries that do that with fewer facilities than we have.  Will the Chair please tell me when I my time is up?</p></speech>

I have raised the issue of primary care centres before.  I am not certain they are capable of delivering the quality, level and extent of community care that are required.  I do not know as I have not yet seen them do so.  In some of the primary care centres there is not equal participation from the public sector nor equal access.  That is not much good to us if we are trying to deliver a service to the general public.</p><p>That is enough for the moment.  I said I would pull the handbrake a bit earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#M00200"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan for affording me the time to reply within the seven minutes.  I do not disagree with the Deputy at all that the current construct of the HSE is not fit for purpose.  That is not just my view but it is the view of the HSE.  The former director general of the HSE said that at this committee, calling it an "amorphous blob", as reported in the national media.  The HSE, as constructed, is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  There is a need for a national entity, and this is echoed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  There are many good things in our health service that would not be achieved without a national entity, including the national maternity strategy, the national cancer strategy and potentially procurement and human resource elements.  These are issues where it makes sense for them to remain in the national core, although that core is far too big and bloated.  The idea is to devolve as much as possible to the regional entities, with those entities having a board and being accountable.  Although it is not a criticism of people and I can find myself in the same position, all too often people in the Oireachtas raise questions because they cannot get answers at a local or regional level.  Affording people the chance to access information about their own healthcare in a local or regional setting makes sense.</p> <p>  The Deputy is entirely correct to raise the idea of population increases as everyone speaks about the health service as though it is static.  I am thankful we have a growing and ageing population.  People are living much longer in Ireland and we want them to be able to live good, healthy lives, with a good quality of life.  I should be clear that the mantra that there are too many beds in the Irish health service is gone, over and dead.  We have far too few acute hospital beds and it is highly regrettable that we went through an era of people deciding we had too many beds.  It was not an economic argument but rather an ideological argument.  They believed everything could be done in primary care.  Much more can be done in primary care but we have the evidence with the bed capacity review that many more acute hospital beds are required.  The person who needs an intensive care unit bed will never be seen in primary care so increased acute capacity is required with the primary care element.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to ask the question about primary care centres.  They have the capacity to do much more.  I will give the example of the one I visited and opened in Castlebar, where there is now an X-ray facility.  Under the governance of the hospital in Mayo, as Senator Swanick knows well, there was a position where many people had to go to the general hospital and there was a waiting list for X-rays.  The operation of the X-ray facility I mentioned has effectively eliminated the waiting list for X-rays.  We have all these fine buildings and there is much good work going on in them.  I do not mean to in any way downplay that.  There is an ability to do much more.  Deputy Donnelly and I represent a constituency with a primary care centre in Carnew and before it was in place, people from Carnew and south Wicklow were travelling to the Mater hospital for wound management.  That can now be done locally.  There is a definite ability to do much more in primary care, and that is what Sl&aacute;intecare is about.  It is also what our capital plan is about in the form of putting diagnostic infrastructure in place.</p></speech>

I will speak initially about primary care.   I welcome the Minister's comments on the funding of primary care, particularly multi-annual funding.  Does the Minister see any possible rowing back on the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts applied to general practice?  I agree with Deputy Durkan and I welcomed the primary care infrastructure plan, which produced more primary care centres around the country.  However, I have said on multiple occasions that it is not necessarily about bricks and mortar but rather the activity that happens within the primary care setting.</p></speech>

That is basically what it is all about.  As we know, general practitioners on a daily basis often carry out nursing duties.  Many of my GP colleagues around the country would agree with me in saying that even a small 10% refund of the FEMPI cuts could facilitate the sending of staff on training for nurse prescribing, for example.  Too much emphasis has been placed on the provision of primary care centres around the country when it is the provision of care that is important.  Does the Minister agree that any possible unwinding of the FEMPI cuts in the general practice sector should be kept separate from contract negotiations?  Will that process occur in an aligned fashion?</p> <p>  We speak of marrying primary and community care, as well as providing more new beds in the hospital sector, which I agree with.  The Minister mentioned the HSE's indication that there is capacity to provide 600 new beds between modular units and reconfiguration of existing wards, etc.  There is a major under-utilised resource, which I have spoken about on numerous occasions, which is the community hospital sector across the country.  Is there a specific fund within the implementation strategy for the community hospital sector, in particular?  The Minister mentioned the X-ray department installed in the new primary care centre in Castlebar but there are four district and community hospitals in the Mayo region.  There is an X-ray department in Belmullet hospital used once or twice per week, and there is an X-ray department in Ballina hospital.  Community hospitals should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era.  There is a major resource of beds not being used and they should not be seen as glorified nursing homes.  They help facilitate discharges from hospital and they prevent admissions to acute hospitals.  There is no reason somebody who has a hip replacement done at Mayo general hospital could not be rehabilitated in Belmullet, Castlebar or Swinford a couple of days later, for example.</p> <p>  We need to specifically consider the redevelopment of our community hospital sector as a way of taking pressure off the acute sector and opening access to GPs to admit to the community hospital sectors directly.  For example, people could be admitted and have a medication review, a chest X-ray or some blood work done.  An elderly person might have a brief admission for one week, and that would prevent an admission to the acute hospital sector.  It would save much money.  It is something that should be examined as it may have been overlooked in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#M00600"><p>I agree that bricks and mortar cannot be, and is not, all there is to primary care.  The buildings can be enablers for change, integrated care and multidisciplinary working.  I opened one in Grangegorman only a few weeks ago and, as the Senator knows, it brought together many healthcare professionals who for the first time were working together under one roof, providing integrated care for a patient.  That is the benefit I see in the bricks and mortar aspect but it is not the end of the conversation.  It is what happens within those buildings that is really important.</p> <p>  I do not want to negotiate with GPs through this committee and they never like that.  Nevertheless I make the point that there are three elements to any discussion we must have.  There is an element about sustainability.  The Senator referred to FEMPI.  I am talking about sustainability but we are both speaking about recognising the fact that GPs in many cases today feel they are in need of supports to keep their current practice and services sustainable.  We need to talk about that.  I hope the Senator notices I am separating this and making it a distinct point from new services.  We need to talk about sustainability of our existing general practice service.</p> <p>  The second point we need to discuss is crucial and I referenced it in my opening statement.  It is throughout both the committee's Sl&aacute;intecare document and my implementation plan.  This is chronic disease management.  If sustainability is one leg of discussion, chronic disease management is another.  What can general practice do in chronic disease management if those GPs are resourced to do it?  I know from my conversations with GPs that there is a willingness and desire to do more but they must be resourced to do it.  The third leg of the stool is a conversation around access to primary care and how to advance the Sl&aacute;intecare ambition as it relates to access.</p> <p>  The three elements are sustainability, Sl&aacute;intecare chronic disease management and Sl&aacute;intecare access.  They are the three legs of a stool about which we, as a State, need to have a very serious conversation with general practice.</p><p>The State must be able to come to that conversation with significant resources.  I am now in a position to do that.  We need GPs to come to the table with a willingness to engage, which I believe is there.  I hope that re-engagement will shortly commence.</p><p> I agree with the Senator on smaller hospitals.  We are underutilising our smaller hospital network.  It is important that we provide the right care in the right place, which Senator Swanick, as a doctor, knows better than I do.  Smaller hospitals have the capacity to do more, whether in terms of diagnostics, elective procedures or otherwise.  I refer to the reopening of the cataract theatre in Nenagh hospital, a so-called small hospital, which will serve the people of the mid-west and reduce cataract waiting lists.  I visited Kilcreene hospital in Kilkenny, which has sufficient staff to do more hip operations and sought funding to carry out such operations.  I am pleased that we were able to facilitate that.  Some smaller hospitals have the staff, capacity and eagerness to do more.  Part of Sl&aacute;intecare is to consider how best to utilises all assets and capacity within the public health service.  Senator Swanick made a fine point regarding the role of smaller hospitals in that regard.</p></speech>

Services such as pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation could be carried out at such hospitals, which would mean that patients would not have to travel for an hour or an hour and a half to a main acute hospital.  The provision of such services would facilitate the preservation of our district hospital network.  With a little lateral, solution-driven thinking, it is very simple to put in place good services that benefit patients at very little cost.  I am be happy to work with the Minister to further such measures.</p></speech>

When the Government came into being, it indicated that reform could not be discussed until after the Sl&aacute;intecare report was delivered.  It took six months longer than anticipated to deliver the report, for which the Committee on the Future of Healthcare must take responsibility.  The report was published 17 months ago but we are still talking about devising a plan.  I am concerned that there is a lack of urgency.  We are locked into that system which perpetuates the waiting lists and trolley queues raised by Deputy Donnelly for the next three years.  The Minister stated that trolley numbers reduced in September but the trend is upwards year on year.  That is a symptom of what is happening in the wider health services.  Trolley queues should not be the focus but they are a symptom of what is happening.  I am concerned that there is a lack of urgency because demographic change is continuing as our population is aging and requires more healthcare.  The older population require the most healthcare.  Demographic change will not wait.</p> <p>  On the point made by Senator Swanick regarding the GP negotiations, almost no GP negotiations took place this year.  There were two or three meetings, which is nothing.  As we approach the budget, there is a sudden surge of activity, similar to that before last year&rsquo;s budget after which nothing happened.  I am concerned that the budget cycle stimulates movement which then peters out for another year.  I ask the Minister to address the urgency with which he will approach the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p></speech>

I hear his frustration and know that it is genuine.  As I stated, some of the timelines in the Sl&aacute;intecare report were unworkable.  It would be incorrect to contend otherwise.  Although I do not wish to end on a sour note, I must point out that the report was produced in May and suggested that an executive director would be appointed by July.  That is not how the world works in terms of recruiting highly skilled professionals such as Laura Magahy.  One cannot hire such a person within two months.  The report suggests that we should extend access to free GP care to 500,000 persons per year.  While I do not speak for either of the GPs in the room, I have yet to meet a GP in my constituency or in my role as Minister for Health who believes that that would be sustainable, rather than resulting in very lengthy general practice waiting lists.  Although I fully subscribe to the agenda and endpoint of Sl&aacute;intecare, a relatively substantial amount of work remained to ensure its correct sequencing such that waiting lists in primary care settings are not created.  If we accept that general practice is one of the best functioning parts of the health service-----</p></speech>

I am not here to be negative and I want to get on with this.  However, the timelines were somewhat contradictory in this regard because while the Chairman is correct that the report recommends increasing capacity, it also states that we must ensure that eligibility is extended in a very short period of time.  That would not have worked.  I want the committee to know that I, my Department, the Sl&aacute;intecare office and the HSE believe that Sl&aacute;intecare is the only plan on health reform.  We are moving beyond conversations regarding my view of Sl&aacute;intecare to a point where we have an implementation plan and, better still, by the end of the year will have the action plan which will detail what we are going to do and who is going to do it, which will be of assistance to the committee in its scrutiny and accountability role.  We will then publish reports measuring that every six months.  There will be nowhere to hide in terms of progressing the reform agenda.</p> <p>  I am particularly keen to pursue geographical alignment.  It may not be politically advantageous but it is crucial in terms of providing regional integrated care and singular budgets.  I will invest political capital in trying to bring that forward more quickly than was originally envisaged.</p> <p>  The Chairman and I regularly discuss the GP contract.  It has taken much too long for it to be put in place.  I now have an agreed mandate on multi-annual funding, and we will go at this hammer and tongs and try to have it agreed.</p></speech>

Fundamentally, the current waiting lists have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.  They have grown beyond recognition to levels never seen before in the history of the Republic of Ireland.  Does the Minister accept that solving the waiting lists is possible without Sl&aacute;intecare and doing so is simply a responsibility of the Government?  Regardless of whether the Oireachtas published a Sl&aacute;intecare report and what is progressing in that regard, does the Minister accept that it is his role to bring down those waiting lists, which have reached hellish levels?</p> <p>  On funding, the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the team from Trinity College Dublin from whom the committee will hear this afternoon state that Sl&aacute;intecare is predicated on approximate funding growth of 7.5% per year.  That amounts to approximately &euro;1.1 billion per year for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare assuming a base of approximately &euro;15 billion.  I acknowledge that the budget will be delivered next week and I am not asking the Minister what he is pitching to the Minister for Finance for next year.  However, is he seeking to meet a broad funding goal in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the view of the team from Trinity College Dublin that the approximate cost will be an additional &euro;1.1 billion each year for approximately ten years?</p> <p>  Obviously, the funding overrun for this year which may amount to more than &euro;600 million is very serious.  Is it likely to impact on the ability to invest in Sl&aacute;intecare for next year?</p> <p>  On assets, both in terms of people such as clinicians, doctors, nurses, speech and language therapists and so on and physical assets such as beds, hospitals, primary care centres, diagnostics, etc., when does Minister believe he will be able to present the committee with a year-by-year forecast indicating how many doctors, nurses, paediatric consultants and primary care centres there will be in various parts of the country?</p><p>When will the Minister be in a position to present a forecast in this regard?</p><p> The Minister said earlier that the HSE is not fit for purpose.  There is danger in a Minister for Health making that statement and not setting out a definitive plan for a replacement.  In the UK, Mr. Andrew Lansley, on his appointment by former Prime Minister Cameron said that one of the first things he was going to do was disband NHS trusts, with no proposals regarding what would replace them.  This caused chaos.  One of the greatest mistakes of the former Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, was his statement on taking up that Ministry that he was going to get rid of the HSE, with no proposals on what would replace it, and that caused chaos.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said that the HSE is not fit for purpose, which I believe many people would agree with in spite of there being some phenomenal people working therein every day to help people.  When does he expect to have a new organisation in place?</p></speech>

I believe - I am not being pedantic - the policy shift that Sl&aacute;intecare represents will help improve waiting lists.  If we did not have Sl&aacute;intecare, it would lessen the pace of progress.  I think that is a fair comment.  For the benefit of those watching the proceedings, I want to be clear that we are not waiting for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare to work every day to try to improve the waiting lists.  I do not want to be pedantic because the waiting lists are too long, but many of these waiting lists were never before published.  That is a point worth making.  For example, in light of the RTE "Prime Time Investigates" programme, we now publish pre-planned and what are known as TCI waiting lists.  As far as I am aware, prior to me becoming Minister, these were never before published.  Prior to 2014, outpatient lists were never published.  There are still too many people on waiting lists but this needs to be factored in.</p> <p>  As I said at the launch of the implementation plan in Government Buildings, largely speaking, the costs outlined by the TCD team and the committee are correct.  However, as I said earlier during my engagement with the Chairman, a significant proportion of the costs is dependent on contractual negotiations, and not only with GPs.  We will also need a new consultant contract at some point, and there will be negotiations on the decisions taken by the Government and the Oireachtas on public and private services.  As the Deputy will be aware, private health insurance contributes significantly to our public hospitals and this is factored into the figures provided.  Some of the costs are capital and others are current.  Largely speaking, I am not engaged in a row with the TCD team or with the Sl&aacute;intecare committee about the figures, but I am making the point that some of the policy decisions that we have yet to make as an Oireachtas will have a bearing on the costs.  For example, Sl&aacute;intecare recommends the removal of private practice from public hospitals but it also recommends that before doing so, we should do a particular piece of work on it and revert to the committee with a roadmap.  This represents a big chunk of money in terms of the overall impact on a yearly basis in regard to the health service.</p></speech>

The Minister's response is that he is broadly in agreement with the Sl&aacute;intecare/TCD figures of approximately &euro;1.1 billion.  The question was slightly different in that I asked if, notwithstanding any negotiations with the Minister for Finance this year - I appreciate where we are at in the budget cycle - taking a five to ten-year view, that is the approximate funding for which the Minister is making the case in respect of implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

What a Government or the Oireachtas will be able to deliver in 2019 and 2020 is a variable.  It will be dependent on the choices the Deputy's party makes and on the choices and decisions of the Government.  I expect that we will have funding allocated to Sl&aacute;intecare this year that will enable progress.  I want Sl&aacute;intecare implemented in full over the lifetime of the ten-year strategy.</p></speech>

He has made clear that he believes the funding overrun in health, which sadly is not a new phenomenon and is a reflection of the need for Sl&aacute;intecare and a more efficient accountable transparent model of funding and delivery, will not affect his spending or taxation plans for 2019.  I take him at his word in this regard.</p></speech>

On the assets, I will ask Ms Magahy to respond later to that question because she has a body of work to do in mapping out people need and the capital and infrastructural need over the next number of years.</p> <p>  On the comment that the HSE is not fit for purpose, it is reassuring that it is not just me, as Minister for Health, who is saying that.  The director general of the HSE also said that.  I am happy to echo the Deputy's point that there are many brilliant people working in the health service, such that saying the HSE is not fit for purpose is not a jibe by me or any political at the staff of the HSE and the work they do or endeavour to do but a recognition that the HSE, as currently set up, is not fit for purpose.  I want it to be clear that under Sl&aacute;intecare the HSE will continue in existence but it will be slimmed down in that many of its functions will be devolved to regional entities in line with the strategy.  Unlike the UK Minister referenced by Deputy Donnelly, I make my comments in the context of the plan we are discussing.  On when I expect to make the changes, by the end of the year I will be in a position to return to this committee or the D&aacute;il to set out what I think, based on the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the geo-alignment should look like. </p> <p>  In 2019, we will begin to devolve some of those functions on an administrative basis.  The implementation plan states that to allow the system to bed down, we should legislate for those changes in 2021, but, as I said in my earlier engagement with Deputy Kelly, I have an open mind and instinctively would like to legislate earlier if there was a majority view in the Oireachtas that we should do that.  By the end of this year, what the map of Ireland from a structural point of view will look like will be published.  From 2019, we will commence administrative changes and from 2020 to 2021 we will begin legislating in this regard.  That is my proposal, which is very much in keeping with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

The question that people in the HSE will ask, as they did when the Minister's predecessor, Senator Reilly, said he was going to get rid of the HSE, and as happened when Mr. Andrew Lansley said he would get rid of the primary care trusts, is, "Will I have a job?"  Slimming down means fewer staff, which means some people will be on voluntary or compulsory redundancy unless there is natural attrition.  We have a lot of very good people within the HSE.  We all agree there are layers of bureaucracy that should not be there in the organisation and, the same applies in some of the acute settings as well.  Many good people will watch this process carefully and think their job or post may not exist in the new slimmed down agency.  When will people know if they will have a job in the new HSE?</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy will agree that I could not make announcements in that regard in such a public forum.  These are conversations to be had with representative bodies at an appropriate time.  This is about where people work.  Many of the people working in the HSE today may work in a devolved regional entity into the future.  The HSE has employees throughout the country.  An analysis will be conducted on the needs of the health service, such that we will not know for two years or more how many staff are needed.  The HSE is involved in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is the policy direction for the HSE and it is embracing it.  We will get this right.  When we did big programmes of reform in the past, for example, the abolition of the health boards and the creation of the HSE, this is an area where we did not get it right.  That is an objective comment.  We have to get it right this time.</p><p>We have to look at these issues sensitively and carefully.  We must not do so in a knee-jerk fashion.  We are talking about something that will happen over a number of years.  To answer the Deputy's question, it will probably take around two years.</p></speech>

I suppose that is what I will look at between now and the end of the year.  I have been tasked with a series of 106 actions and looking at the dependencies between those actions.  I am thinking of rolling it out over a number of years using the concept of a citizen care master plan.  This will involve looking at population needs on a geolined basis and looking at service design care pathways, before then looking at the infrastructural needs and e-health needs that will be required to support the newly developed service design care pathways and, critically, looking at the resources needed by the teams of the future - what the teams will look like and what the numbers will be.  That will take some time to sort out.  It will need to be done in an orderly fashion.</p></speech>

We are not starting from scratch, but we almost have to start from scratch as we determine the ideal way to plan for the projected increase in population from 4.6 million to 5.2 million over the next eight to ten years.  We will start by looking at where the various sectors of the population are located, what they look like, what their needs are, what their age profiles are, where they stand on the deprivation index and what their requirements are.  Then we will build up a service in respect of that population.  It was mentioned earlier that it is better to do it that way rather than setting out where the buildings are and asking the service to respond to that.</p></speech>

I was dealing with the Minister for Justice and Equality on a Commencement matter in the Seanad.  I would like to ask the Minister about Project Ireland 2040 and the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It has been identified that additional hospitals are needed in certain locations, including Cork.  I understand that a group of people from various agencies in Cork, including Cork City Council, Cork County Council, UCC, the voluntary hospitals and the HSE, has been put together with a view to identifying a site for a new hospital in Cork.  The identification of a site is a crucial issue.  There have been 25 years of delays in developing a new children's hospital in Dublin.  Even though all of the people who should be on this group were identified six or eight months ago, I understand the HSE has made no effort to call the group together.  I am a little concerned about that.  The first issue is identifying a site.  The next issue is going through the planning process.  These issues have to be dealt with before budgetary commitments are made.  It should be simple to identify the pros, cons and disadvantages of a number of sites.  I will explain why I am concerned to ensure this is treated as a priority.  The population of Cork city and county has increased from 410,000 to 542,000 or by 130,000 over the past 30 years.  It is growing at a phenomenal rate.  Within the next eight years, there could well be a population in excess of 700,000 in the area in question.  For that reason, I this serious issue is a priority.  I would like to know whether the Department of Health can communicate with the HSE on this issue.  We are talking about building additional units.  At what stage do we start looking at sites?  I am a little concerned about that.</p> <p>  I would like to raise a second matter.  Over the past three years, the HSE has taken on more than 12,000 additional people.  The number of staff in the HSE has increased from over 99,000 to over 110,000.  I have concerns about the number of people being taken on in administration and management.  I accept fully that they need support.  If one looks at the entire staff of the HSE, more than 17,600 people work in administration and management and a further 7,500 are in nurse manager roles.  Technically, there are more than 24,500 people in these positions.  In fairness, nurse managers also provide nursing services.  We seem to have a management structure everywhere.  One of the problems I find with the HSE is that I cannot get anyone to make a decision.  I recently dealt with a case in which 12 people from the HSE and Acquired Brain Injury Ireland were summoned to a meeting to make a decision on one person.  Just 24 hours before the meeting was due to happen, one person announced that he or she had moved to a new job in the HSE and would not attend the meeting but did not set out who would attend in his or her place.  As a result, the meeting was cancelled.  I find that astonishing.  I have come across many cases in which a medical practitioner who is trying to make a decision about a particular patient reports to management the issues he or she is dealing with, only for three different groups of people in administration to tell him or her how he or she should manage the patient in question.  This is causing significant morale problems for nursing and other staff in hospitals.  It seems that no one can make a decision on a particular issue.  I raised this last week when Dr. Holohan came before the committee to speak about the proposed patient safety Bill.  Doctors and nurses are being held accountable for every step they take, but we do not have any accountability on the managerial side.  I refer not only to the decision-making process on the managerial side, but also to the delays in making decisions.  When was the last time a HSE manager was disciplined?  It is right that doctors and nurses are held accountable when errors are made.  I wonder what process we can set up to deal with this issue if we want to have reform.  There is resistance to reform.  How do we propose to deal with this issue in that context?</p> <p>  I would like to mention a final issue.  We met Professor John Higgins from Cork last week to discuss gynaecological services.  A second theatre needs to be opened in Cork to deal with such services.  The HSE ended up renting space from the Mater Private Hospital in Cork and the consultants moved to that hospital.  Public patients were dealt with there in an organised way.  More than 1,500 people were taken off the waiting list as a result of an initiative led by management and consultants.  It seems that problems have been encountered in opening the second theatre in Cork University Hospital so that this service can be provided.  We have the space and the theatre, but we seem to have a problem getting it opened.  If we want to implement Sl&aacute;intecare, how do we deal with all of the issues that will arise?  We are trying to get people to accept that change must come about, that they must take responsibility for the decisions they are making and that they must take the people around them into account.</p></speech>

I fully agree with him that the hospital in Cork needs increased capacity,  There is a particular need for acute hospital space.  As the Deputy has rightly said, the population has grown significantly, but the bed base has not.  That is why we announced an acute hospital development for Cork in the capital plan.  We also said that Cork would receive one of three elective-only hospitals, to which I referred earlier in the context of the Scottish model following my trip to Scotland last week.</p><p>I take the point the Senator makes about the next steps in these capital projects and ensuring that, when capital funding becomes available, we will be ready to go in having the sites available and planning permission obtained in order that we will be able to go to tender.  In the next few weeks I will convene the relevant stakeholders in Cork to seek an action plan on the next steps to be taken.  I will keep the Senator, as well as other Oireachtas Members from Cork, informed and updated, as necessary.</p><p> Making sure we have clear management structures in place at regional level is at the core of Sl&aacute;intecare.  They have been lacking to date, but we will have geoalignment and one integrated structure for the community and hospitals in order that people will not get stuck in one part of the health service.  There will also be a regional board in order that we will be able to look at decision makers in the eye and demand that they account for their actions.</p><p> I am pleased that we have increased investment in Cork University Hospital.  We have also supported clinical autonomy in the budgetary process.  The hospital has made great progress in dealing with gynaecology waiting lists.  I thank Professor John Higgins and the clinical team for the work they have done in that regard.  I am keen to see if we can do more to support their good work in the context of the budget.  I will be happy to discuss the matter further with the Senator.</p></speech>

If Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Bernard J. Durkan combine their questions, we can allow the Minister to leave.</p></speech>

That is not true.  I remember dealing with cases in my constituency in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, when people had been waiting for up to seven years for a hip replacement operation.  I remember one case in which somebody had been waiting for nine years.  They were in extreme pain and had repeatedly tried to gain access to the service.  Whatever blocked it at the time did so seriously for persons who were in acute pain.  Some people were unable to access the service before they died and they died in pain, which was a terrible reflection on the system at the time.  This, therefore, did not start in the last couple of months.</p> <p>  I disagree with Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly on the abolition of the HSE.  The Minister's predecessor was right, but he did not press ahead with the next phase to replace it with the structures required.  I pointed this out at the time.  The HSE was the wrong structure and the decision to replace the health board system was the wrong one.  However, it was based on expert opinion from the United Kingdom, based specifically on the situation in the greater Manchester area which had the same population as Ireland.  Some of us pointed out that it could not be done in the same fashion because the two were chalk and cheese.  One was a vast geographical area, while the other was a compact urban area that was ideal for the delivery of concentrated services in the shortest possible time.  The sooner we recognise that we are dealing with a very different system from the one in the greater Manchester area, the sooner we will move forward.</p> <p>  In the control centres of big transport operations worldwide operatives have big screens in front of them on which they can see the movement of traffic.  Whenever there is a stoppage they know instantly what to do.  The same should apply to the health service, although obviously in a different format.  We need to identify the snags which slow the system, thus denying a patient access to it.  The HSE should not be regarded as an employment agency but as a vehicle with which to deliver services to patient, the needs of whom are paramount.  If we do not realise this, all the talk, re-evaluation and restructuring will come to naught.  When there are snags, as with traffic, they cause problems to back up and they get worse and worse.  What action can be takem to deal with this issue?  Can we focus on it?  We could carry out an audit of the weaknesses in the system, but if it does not work for even some of the time, we will not deliver anything.  The sooner we recognise this the better.  We can play around with it all we want and blame one another for it, but we need to develop a smooth, free-flowing system that will keep patients moving in a circular movement to have them dealt with quickly.  What provisions does the Minister have in mind to identify the snags for individual patients and take action to deal with them?</p> <p>  My last point is about overruns.  There have been overruns in the health service for the past 20 years.  Which disciplines are the most seriously affected and which are guilty of having overruns every year?</p></speech>

Durkan is right that overruns are not new in the health service.  Denying that there are overruns is new, as is pretending that they are not recurring.  I can play the game of which previous Government made the biggest mess of the health service, but it will not profit us much.  I asked the Minister how the overruns were related to recurring costs.  There is a difference between recurring and once-off costs.  A once-off cost can be incurred to deal with an event that places unprecedented pressure on the health service.  I am not referring to the flu but other unforeseen events.  Mr. Tony O'Brien wrote to the Minister earlier this year about the issue of recurring overruns.  Does the Minister accept that there are overruns and is it his intention to deal with them?  I am not asking him to divulge the fourth secret of Fatima, about which we read a lot in the newspapers.</p></speech>

Were his figures correct?  Were they exactly right or roughly correct?  Are the actual figures worse?  Is it the Minister's position that there are recurring overspends and that there is not a single incident which places unprecedented pressure on the health service?</p> <p>  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan was also right to say patients had to be at the centre of health services, but there will be no health service without staff to work in it.  There will just be big empty buildings with a lot of sick patients in them.  We need some strategy to deal with the issue of recruitment.  We might disagree on whether the Minister's strategy is failing, entirely or in part, but staff will be required to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  Nurses are engaged in consultations and have signalled that this issue may lead to industrial action.  I understand doctors and consultants are more or less in the same space.  The health service is haemorrhaging staff and potential industrial relations difficulties are mounting up.  This makes the service a very unattractive place in which to work.  In some respects, the purpose of Sl&aacute;intecare is to ensure those who are graduating and bright health professionals working within the system, as well as all other staff who keep it going, will see that there is a plan and that in time the HSE and the health service will be an attractive place in which to work.</p><p>There was a very unfortunate incident where the number of student nurses increased overnight from 435 to 870.  They had been counted as 0.5 equivalents and then they were counted as a whole-time equivalents.  That does not add a single extra person but it makes the figures look good.  It does not add a single extra body to a ward.  We do not need any more of that but we do need honesty regarding where the recruitment challenges lie and about a detailed plan to be put in place.</p><p> The D&aacute;il supported a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on nursing recruitment and retention and it was very clear in saying that pay has to be at the heart of it.  We spoke to Kevin Duffy, the chair of the Public Service Pay Commission last week at another committee, and he said he was explicitly told not to focus on pay and that it was not a pay review.  We can all pretend that pay is not an issue but we are ignoring the nurses, doctors and allied health professionals who tell us that pay is definitely an issue, not simply in the health service but also in the section 39 agencies and other sectors.  I understand there was some progress in that regard.  I do not wish to put Ms Magahy on the spot, particularly as she has only been in the job for 22 days, but I would be keen to hear if she has any thoughts on how she is going to be able to crack this nut because no plan will work without the staff to implement it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#R00200"><p>I agree with much of what Deputy Durkan stated.  One of the things we are lacking in the health service is data.  I think that is the reason the Sl&aacute;intecare committee put such a focus on ehealth.  I am pleased that we are going to be able to deliver the ehealth agenda in full because of the ability it provides in tracking that to which Deputy Durkan referred in terms of where the blockage lies.  If one has a clinical director in a hospital who realises there is congestion in the emergency department, he or she should be able to check on the needs of the patients and say, whether, for example, there are 20 people in beds who need MRI or CAT scans and that if they get those scans, 20 beds will be freed up.  The inability to have all the data collated is a blockage in the system and the ehealth agenda is very important in that regard.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the agreement that has been reached at the Workplace Relations Commission in respect of section 39 organisations.  I hope it will bring stability and certainty to the staff working in the sector and to those for whom they care and provide services.  That is something we welcome.  I thank SIPTU, led by Paul Bell and others, for their further engagement.</p> <p>  On the overrun or overspend, I will provide some figures.  The Estimates for 2018 provided for gross expenditure of &euro;15.332 billion for health services.  Of that, &euro;14.839 billion is for current expenditure and &euro;493 million is for capital expenditure.  The last available position at the end of June shows that the HSE's income and expenditure position is &euro;341.7 million above profile.  While there are offsetting surpluses and deficits, to respond to Deputy Durkan's question, a large proportion of the overall deficit is in the acute hospitals division.  As regards the exact figures in Tony O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s letter or anybody else&rsquo;s commentary, we do know yet because the year is not yet over.  I have said on a number of occasions that there will be an overspend or an overrun, whichever way one wishes to classify it, and that will need to be addressed.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I are seeking to address it and I hope the matter can be resolved in the coming days.</p> <p>  When the HSE publishes a service plan, there is a legal requirement under the legislation for it to say that it is going to deliver said plan within budget.  It knows the funding available at that stage.  While I accept the point made, it is easily conflated with a failure to deliver everything within a service plan.  In fairness, Deputy Durkan is not doing that.  People have legally signed up to deliver the service plan with the knowledge of the funding they have available.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Magahy to comment on Sl&aacute;intecare, staffing and how she intends to proceed.  She replied to Deputy Donnelly on the issue.  I respect the processes being undertaken by the INMO and the PNA and I do not want to say anything to interfere with their consultation with their members.  It is important that the process runs its course before I make further comment, other than to make one point.  In terms of recruitment and retention, there is a retention challenge in particular for nurses and that is what the Public Service Pay Commission found.  We are putting forward proposals in line with what the Public Service Pay Commission said to try to address the challenges.  The new entrant pay agreement will ensure the pay of new, often younger nurses restored to an equivalent level to that of their colleagues.  That should be welcomed by nurses, teachers and other sectors.  I am pleased agreement has been reached in that regard.  We also want to see somebody be able to become a senior nurse quicker than is currently the case.  There is a financial benefit to that, and also to the specialist qualification allowance.  I will not interfere in the process but nurses will have to make an adjudication on those proposals.  The executive made comments on that in the aftermath of the EGM but that needs to go through a process and then we need to engage.</p> <p>  Mr. Duffy, of the Public Service Pay Commission, does also say in his document that there may also be at some point in time, which he does not specify, where there should be further engagement.  He specifically references Sl&aacute;intecare because, as the Deputy correctly indicated, the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare will require healthcare professionals, including nurses, and may also require people to take on different roles and tasks and to work in different structures.  I am conscious that the line is there in the report of the Public Service Pay Commission and I am eager to explore it further but I am respectful of the process.</p></speech>

That is grand, but does the Minister not accept that the time might be now?  The recruitment and retention crisis is happening now.  We are discussing things that we say are new but that are not such as, for example, waiting lists.  Perhaps the position is worse now, perhaps it is not - I do not know.  I represented nurses for years and we did not have challenges with recruitment and retention.</p></speech>

I stated that in the D&aacute;il and at the IMO conference and I say it here because it is the truth.  We have an issue with the retention of healthcare professionals.  One could argue the toss about recruitment because the stats show that people sign up to be nurses and doctors but the length of time people stay in the health service is a cause of concern.</p> <p>  Mr. Duffy and the Public Service Pay Commission have made some more general comments, including the one I referenced on Sl&aacute;intecare, but it also made specific commitments we want to extend to nurses such as the qualification allowance and the senior nurse&rsquo;s scale, and coupled with that is the position regarding new entrants.  I would like nurses to consider that in the context of their discussions and following the outcome of the discussions I look forward to engaging with them.</p></speech>

We are delighted to be here.  I am accompanied by Pathways team members Dr. Sara Burke and Dr. Bridget Johnston, whose assistance has been invaluable.</p> <p>  The committee asked us to evaluate the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and present our work on re-phasing the original Sl&aacute;intecare costings.  This research was presented at the final seminar of the pathways to universal healthcare project, funded by the Health Research Board, HRB, which took place a week ago in Trinity College.  It also draws on our experience of working with the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare at the end of 2016 and early in 2017, when we had the privilege of working closely with some members of this committee.  </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy was published on 8 August 2018 and Ms Laura Magahy began as the executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office in September 2018.  The implementation strategy has four goals and ten interlocking high-level strategic actions, each of which have further specific actions.  A brief critique of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy follows, using the framework which structured the work of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We compare the treatment of vision, principles, entitlements, integrated care, funding and implementation in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy with the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy refers regularly to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and restates the principles contained in the original report.  The Sl&aacute;intecare vision as specified in the Oireachtas report was for a universal health system accessible to all on the basis of need which is free at the point of delivery or at the lowest possible cost.  The Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report defines what it means by universal healthcare and outlines the services that were to be included in the universal system.  It specified that all residents would be entitled to these services and that this entitlement would be backed by legislation alongside a wait time guarantee.  Everyone in Ireland would be entitled to a full package of services, free or at low cost, within a set period of time.  It detailed the phasing and costings required to deliver such care.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy is much more conservative, referring to eligibility rather than entitlement.  Action six refers to expanding eligibility on a phased basis to move towards universal healthcare.  It uses the term "universal eligibility" which is, at worst, an oxymoron and at best, only a conditional commitment.  It goes on to state that the vision is that all citizens "will have universal access to healthcare, in both the acute and community settings.".  These statements appear contradictory implying either a lack of understanding of the terms or a watering down of the commitment to universalism as laid out in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report. </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy upholds the vision of integrated care as specified in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  In particular, an imminent decision on the alignment of community services with hospitals groups as well as the allocation of resources through regional integrated care structures on the basis of population health need are both positive aspects of the implementation strategy. </p> <p>  Goal No. 3 of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy is to ensure the health service is financially sustainable.  It has a strong emphasis on productivity and achieving value for money.  However, there is no recognition of household financial sustainability, little about eliminating or reducing charges and no national health fund as specified in the original report.  There is a specific action to "design, establish and resource a multi-annual transition fund with appropriate governance to support the change process".  While the capital aspects of the Oireachtas report transition fund are included in the national development plan in terms of community diagnostics, eHealth, primary care centres, new hospital capacity and elective-only hospitals, there is no mention of the funding required to train increased numbers of healthcare professionals for strong primary and community care service as detailed in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Neither is there any specification of the additional money required to fund the expansion of entitlements and to support the reform process as specified in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report. </p> <p>  The Pathways team has reworked the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare cost projections to provide another option for funding.  This extends the implementation period to 12 years and elongates some of the phasing of specific components within that.  We would be delighted to show members some slides of these after this opening statement. </p> <p>  Goal No. 1 of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy is to "deliver improved governance and sustain reform through a focus on implementation".  This puts implementation up front and centre, with a map of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation structure.  However, the implementation strategy critically lacks the specifics of the original Sl&aacute;intecare Oireachtas report in terms of targets, phasing, timelines, milestones and the budget needed to deliver it.  It is important not to reinvent the wheel. </p> <p>  In conclusion, the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, the appointment of Laura Magahy and the establishment of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office are all necessary and important developments.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy begins to do the important task of weaving together reforms that were happening anyway with the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  However, there is a need to keep an eye on the Sl&aacute;intecare Oireachtas vision and ambition and the essential components of entitlement and funding which are lacking in the implementation strategy.  Nevertheless, the strategy progresses the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report by integrating clinical and corporate governance.  The emphasis on public engagement on health and well-being, a workforce engagement plan and the development of a citizen care master plan are welcome additions and may well be critical to triggering the political commitment and leadership that is needed to fund and deliver the vision as laid out in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p> <p>  We look forward to further discussions with the committee on this.</p></speech>

We have selected slides that we believe will provide a useful focus for the committee.</p> <p>  In terms of the first slide, one of the issues that has come up with Sl&aacute;intecare is whether it is too expensive to implement.  Obviously, a further question is whether it is too expensive not to implement, given the current overruns in the health budget.  The original Sl&aacute;intecare report was focused on a ten year implementation plan.  A lot of the activity, particularly around entitlement, expansion and the transition fund was front loaded into the first six years, with a maximum amount of &euro;460 million expansion related to entitlements per year, from year three.  In our work we consider what might be the effect of changing some of the assumptions behind that.  We keep the basic costings and basic items but shift some of the underlying assumptions and look at a 12 year implementation plan.  We do not frontload it into the first six years but spread it out more evenly across the timeframe.</p><p>We push back the start dates of a couple of items, for instance, the inpatient hospital fee removal to year two and the emergency department fee removal to year 11 from year eight.  We stretched some of the phasing, particular around universal primary care, which is now elongated to six years for implementation rather than five years.  </p><p> With the freeing up of GP care and replacing private income in public hospitals, we looked at both phases and took them back a bit and stretched the phasing to get our house in order for preparing and implementing those policies.  We try to change some of the underlying assumptions.  It is interesting to then look at what impact that has.  </p><p> On the bar chart, I show the entitlement expansion cost required for each year on the left hand axis.  We are running at approximately &euro;250 million for the first five years.  By the end of the 12 years, we still arrive at the figure of 2.8, which is shown by the line chart.  On the right axis, members can see the total amount coming to &euro;2.8 billion, so that is consistent with the current entitlement expansion detailed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  That will give members a slight idea of the rephasing.  </p><p> If one goes to the next slide, one can do a comparison with the original Sl&aacute;intecare costings, which are in orange, and the revised and rephased Sl&aacute;intecare costings in blue.  Substantially less is required upfront but, at the tail end, there is more investment, so it is more evenly focused.</p><p> On the next slide, we can do it for the transition cost because if we have a 12-year period rather than ten years and we are elongating the phasing, or delaying the phasing of some of the components slightly, we can redistribute some of the transitional costs as well.  The impact of this is to reduce some of the initial burden on the budget.  Interesting work was done by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, particularly for year one.  There may be budget constraints but subsequently there will be enough fiscal space to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  This way of rephasing may get around some of the initial problems with affordability.</p><p> I will ask my colleague Dr. Bridget Johnston to follow on.</p></speech>

Currently about 68% to 70% comes from general taxation and the remainder of funding comes from private health expenditure.  That is what households either spend out of pocket at the time they access health care or the reimbursement that comes from private health insurance companies back into the system.  They contribute about an equal pot each, about 15% each.</p> <p>  Some of the work I have done for the pathways project is to look specifically at the affordability of this spending by households.  Using the household budget survey provided by the CSO, I have been able to estimate that 14% of households were not able to afford what they were spending on either out of pocket charges or private health insurance premiums in 2009 and 2010.  By the year 2015 to 2016, this had grown to 17.3% and that probably should be seen in the context of rising charges throughout multiple budgets, but also the increase in private health insurance premia.</p> <p>  What is interesting to look at on this slide is who is mostly affected by this, what these households look like, and what kinds of protection are they supposed to have from the system so that they do not experience this financial hardship.  The top bar for the years 2009 and 2010 shows that the majority are medical card-GP card holders.  Those represented by the blue bar are considered double, so they not only have a medical card but also private health insurance.  They are meant to be protected by the medical card system as well.  We can see they are the overwhelming majority of people who are not financially protected, experience financial hardship, and are pushed further into poverty or into poverty because of their spending on either of these items.  We can see this grew substantially by 2015-2016, not only for the proportion of households but the breakdown within.  We can see that the safety net that is meant to be provided by the medical card scheme is failing those households.  This is the overwhelming majority of those who are experiencing financial hardship.  In its current form, this system is not protecting people as well as it should.</p></speech>

I will ask the same two questions that I put to the Minister when he appeared before us this morning.  First, we had a long discussion in the Sl&aacute;intecare committee about where the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office should sit and it has been placed in the Department of Health.  We were strongly of the view that it should be placed in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  Where does that leave us regarding the political buy-in?</p> <p>  There is no reference to a national health fund in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  A major component of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan was that there would be a national health fund which would be comprised of earmarked taxes and specific funds.  In his reply, the Minister said that the funding for Sl&aacute;intecare would come through the normal budgetary process.  We were quite strong that this would not be sufficient funding to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sara Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#U00400"><p>There are two separate issues.  One relates to where the implementation offices sits and the second to the political buy-in.  I was present for lots of heated discussions privately at the Committee on the Future of Healthcare as to where that implementation office should be.</p> <p>  I was in a minority and favoured it being in the Department of Health, because I believe very strongly that the Department is there to drive the strategic direction of health policy in Ireland.  If the Department is not driving Sl&aacute;intecare, what is it doing?  It is positive that the implementation office is under the Department.  It is critical that there are structures in place to support that work and political buy-in.  The implementation strategy has done a pretty good job on the map of the governance structures for Sl&aacute;intecare and the high level committee with input from the Secretaries General of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach, which reports to the Cabinet sub-committee, and an independent advisory group are all positive developments.  That is a strength of what has happened since the work of the committee.</p> <p>  The question of political buy-in is a separate issue.  It was evident from the Minister's presentation this morning that he is wholeheartedly behind Sl&aacute;intecare.  There is an issue as to how far that political buy-in goes.  There are political hearts and minds to be won across the Oireachtas, and not just in government, to support for Sl&aacute;intecare.  The international evidence is clear on this.  Unless we have political buy-in from the Taoiseach down, and particularly from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe having a key role, then it will be difficult for Sl&aacute;intecare to happen.</p></speech>

It is difficult and probably without precedent to get the current tax base to deliver sufficient resources for the scale of change required to transition the system and reconfigure it.</p> <p>  There is a strong case for making a one-off investment in reconfiguration.  As we have seen, even though elements are included in the capital plan, important elements of the new system relating to primary and social care professionals are still lacking.  The danger is that with tax, one will always get squeezed out.  We have even seen the overrun issue having an effect so there will be a squeezing out.  Yet there is no protection and there is no earmarking.  It is difficult to protect the necessary space to do that.  There probably needs to be a conversation with the public about the earmarking of particular tax into the fund and allocating from that for reconfiguration and  entitlement expansion purposes, otherwise the danger will always be that it gets crowded out.  However laudable the ambitions, the danger is that they will get crowded out by the immediate need.</p></speech>

We hear a great deal about how Sl&aacute;intecare needs to be funded within the usual annual budgetary frameworks.</p><p>That says a lot about the absence of political buy-in because if there was political buy-in at the most senior level people would get that this cannot be done within the annual budgetary process and that it needs not just multi-annual funding, but this additional transition fund to shift the provision of healthcare in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is worrying.  The witnesses have been forthright and have called out the areas about which they have worries.  I am going to make one nakedly political point to which I do not expect them to respond, although it is relevant to implementation, and then I have four questions.  The political point is that healthcare has been extremely badly managed at a political level over the last few years.  A lot of that is down to poor implementation and an inability to get things done on the ground - to open up an intensive care unit bed here and there, as required, to make sure that a surgeon gets hired where needed and so forth.  I see that incompetence - and this is my view, I am not transposing it onto the witnesses - rolling into the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and it worries me.</p> <p>  My four questions are as follows.  The public does not really care about Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is a reconfiguration strategy and it is very important for the future of healthcare and Fianna F&aacute;il is fully signed up to it, but the public does not care.  The public cares about getting access to medical care, be it in their home, their local GP clinic, a primary care centre, an acute setting, a rehabilitation setting or wherever else.  There is a danger that, as the focus moves on to this shiny and extremely complex and difficult healthcare transformation, the most important thing, which is getting boys, girls, men and women access to doctors when needed, will slide.  Could the witnesses point us to what they believe are the most important implementation aspects they think will increase access or reduce waiting times quickly?  That is what the public needs.  That is what people are screaming for.  </p> <p>  The second question is on universalism.  Universal healthcare is defined as the ability to access healthcare without incurring undue financial hardship.  Sl&aacute;intecare is ambiguous on this.  It talks about universalism, which does not necessarily mean free, but it also talks about free.  It interchanges those a bit.  The witnesses have raised serious concerns about universal access.  Do their concerns relate both to free access and to universal access as the World Health Organization defines it?  In other words, they seem to be saying they are concerned about the future ability of people to access healthcare for free, based on what they have seen about people's ability to access healthcare without incurring undue financial healthcare would the witnesses be concerned regardless of which definition of universal is used?</p> <p>  My third question is not really covered in the witnesses' assessment but I imagine they will have a view on it.  I have worked on healthcare reform abroad and the single most important thing for healthcare reform to work, assuming one is travelling in broadly the right direction, is the buy-in of doctors.  It is the single most important thing.  If doctors, particularly senior clinicians, do not buy in, healthcare reform tends to fail.  The doctors and their unions are pretty scathing about Sl&aacute;intecare.  These are public statements they have made.  I am sure there are individual doctors who buy into it but at an organisational level they have been heavily resistant to Sl&aacute;intecare, which is something that has to be addressed.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts, reflections or advice for us as an Oireachtas with regard to trying to achieve buy-in for Sl&aacute;intecare and for this implementation at a senior clinical level?</p> <p>  The final question I have is on the costings.  I thank the witnesses for the ones they have done.  As I read the slides, they have done two - the costs of expanding entitlements and the costs of the transition.  Both get to about &euro;3 billion or thereabouts.  Have they done an analysis on the total cost, that is, the cost including the cost of entitlement, the cost of transition, the cost of scaling up and any other costs?  Do they have a total?  Getting to Sara's point, that there is either buy-in for this or there is not, if there was buy-in people would be thinking at a very serious level about deploying very serious resources against this.  I am not seeing that from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, or the Department of Health.  A total figure would be very helpful.  How much do we really need to pour into this, either against the original Sl&aacute;intecare profile or the witnesses' revised one, which is slightly less front-loaded?</p></speech>

Let us start with the last one first.  Shortly after we helped with the production of the Sl&aacute;intecare report we did an overall costing of what it all adds up to together.  It comes to the heady total of approximately &euro;19 billion, but that figure is over ten years.  That has to be taken in the context of likely public expenditure of approximately &euro;200 billion in that context.  If the figure of &euro;19 billion is thrown around it starts to get scary but the fact is, within the context of &euro;200 billion, it is not that big a price ticket, given that we are then engaging with wholesale reform of the system, universalisation and an expansion of entitlements.  The reason we do not present them together in the costings is that they are slightly different things.  The first relates to the annual increment in entitlement expansion while the transition fund refers to the actual amount of money spent.  It is somewhat of a case of apples and oranges, but it is probably around &euro;19 billion.  Again, that has to be put in the context of the overall spend.  That would be my comment on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke specifically about doctors.  In fact, that is very much changing now internationally.  The literature is around healthcare professionals and clinical leaders who are not necessarily doctors.  A really good physiotherapist or occupational therapist can be just as important a clinical leader as a doctor.  There is a strong literature around that and they are needed, but there is also very strong literature around how doctors in particular are often the ones to oppose any type of reform.  Once one begins to do it, most of them come on board but there is significant work to be done by the implementation office around engaging clinical leadership - not just doctors but all healthcare professionals and clinicians across the system - to get behind this plan.  I do not believe that has been done yet and that is why we specified in our opening statement that the aspects in the strategic implementation strategy around public engagement, workforce engagement and, particularly, clinical engagement and around integrating clinical and corporate governance are really key parts that have been missing from the Oireachtas process so far.  That really needs to happen.</p> <p>  Most people go into clinical work of some type or other with the intention of looking after and caring for people.  Most people in the system find their jobs extremely difficult at the moment.  It is really hard.  It is like a case of survival of the fittest.  Providing the best quality of care is an obstacle course.  If it can be demonstrated to the workers providing that care that this is going to be better for the people who use the services, most of them will come on board.  That brings me to the Deputy's first question, which was about the most important aspects of implementation for increasing access and reducing waiting times.  There are two questions in that.  I will deal with increasing access.</p><p> One has to begin showing people the difference that it will make in their lives.  A significant part of Sl&aacute;intecare is shifting care outside of hospitals into the communities and much better primary and social care.  Everybody, not just people with medical cards, needs to be able to access the services without a long wait time and, critically, without a charge.  Whether that is free or low-cost can be determined.  Most of the literature supports the no-cost rather than a low-cost element, particularly if one is trying to get people to use it.  It can be used as an incentive for people to use primary care services.  Suggestions in the original report like universal child care services, early intervention and child health prevention work and universal palliative care are good.  If one uses those aspects, one gets buy-in from the population.  The Deputy is wrong.  I do not think the public knows about Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, if one talks to people about what they want from their health system, then one can get them on board.</p></speech>

They need to know Sl&aacute;intecare by experiencing it, whether that is by cutting some of the charges or whether it is free or low-cost.  It needs to become a reality for people.  The majority of people care about accessing timely and quality health and social care services.  One can get them on board for Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

The public does not need to be on board for Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is a reconfiguration plan.  One needs clinicians, GPs and the HSE.  What the public wants is timely and affordable access to high-quality care.  I take Dr. Burke's point that it is important to make Sl&aacute;intecare real to the public by reducing costs.  I am asking a slightly different question.  The waiting lists have now got so bad that people are dying while on waiting lists waiting to see doctors.  That is happening.  I am meeting the parents of children who are dying because they cannot get access to surgeons.  That is the reality today.  In Cork, a child will wait three and a half years to get access to special needs intervention.  In St. James's Hospital there is now a six-year wait to see a specialist in urology.  It is getting worse.</p> <p>  I take Dr. Burke's point but I do not fully agree with it that one makes Sl&aacute;intecare real for the public by reducing financial barriers.  I believe we have to make it real for people by cutting down these completely unacceptable waiting lists.  Does Dr. Burke see specifics in Sl&aacute;intecare that would quickly begin to address the waiting times?</p></speech>

There is a strong commitment in Sl&aacute;intecare on the wait time guarantees.  The evidence is from other countries which brought down their waiting times quite significantly.  One needs some kind of mechanism or guarantee whereby people then get an entitlement to care, be it through a strong accountability, as in the NHS, or through vouchers like in Portugal.  Unless one has that accountability that there is a guarantee of care, then the system does not shift, no matter how much money one puts into it.  System reconfiguration is necessary but not sufficient.  One needs that culture of accountability and a culture of much more information availability on waiting times rather than just waiting lists which we do not currently have.  One needs accountability to the public on how long waiting times are and much more accountability on the performance of different providers.  That needs rebuilding.  That is a strong component alongside the system expansion.</p></speech>

We saw the bar chart with the double insurance holders.  Essentially, they are covered by the public system by having a medical card but also continue to pay out of pocket for private health insurance.  For those who do not, we see a large proportion of that spend, which is not affordable, is to access private care.  People cannot wait on the lists.  It is not just an issue of making it more affordable and reducing those charges but also ensuring that people feel well looked after in the public system and they are not paying in a way they cannot afford.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is clear that the care is either free at the point delivery or at the lowest possible cost.  A number of charges have been introduced over the past several years which bring medical cardholders into the fee-paying fold.  We have already designated that these households are not able to afford them.  When we look at the comparison over the years, we see that charges for prescription drugs are driving much of the unaffordable spending for the poorest and most vulnerable households.  It is important to ensure the most vulnerable households are not paying for care they cannot afford.  That is a significant part of their experience of accessing healthcare.  It prevents them from fulfilling their prescriptions and adhering to their medication.  It is a serious problem that we need to address.</p> <p>  On the lowest possible cost, Sl&aacute;intecare does not talk about removing the drug payment threshold but lowering it to a more affordable threshold.  There is not this sense of free care everywhere.  We are an outlier in the European context in that we do not offer free primary care.  People either have basically free GP care or they pay the full cost of it.  Even within the GMS, we know patients are paying for signing off on their disability forms and other small charges to primary care providers at the same time.  We need to ensure that the safety net is doing what it is meant to do.</p></speech>

I am not the only person who saw it.</p> <p>   My view is that the legislation comes first.  The legislation to entitlements is the driver.  Earlier, the Minister appeared to be putting it the other way around.  When everything is put in place, then and only then are we going to be in a position to legislate for maximum waiting times and entitlements.  That goes against some of what we discussed in the course of our deliberations.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  My view is that if we keep waiting and we cannot get the legislation until everything is perfect, then everything will never be perfect and we will never get the legislation.</p> <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the umbrella body for 90% of the workers in the health services, has a view that Sl&aacute;intecare will be a key factor in recruitment and retention.  It backs Sl&aacute;intecare as a basis for dealing with the recruitment and retention crisis.  Earlier, the Minister and Ms Laura Magahy attended the committee.  They did not seem to have anything new to offer in terms of recruitment and retention and how we can attract new staff.</p><p>To refer to the point made earlier, if we do not get buy-in from healthcare professionals, we will not be able to deliver it.  There are steps that can, and should, be taken by the powers-that-be, specifically the Government and Cabinet, that will show us that there is commitment.  The public may not understand the intricacies of Sl&aacute;intecare but they know what a waiting list is.  They know when they cannot afford to pay for prescriptions.  They know when they are standing in the chemists and have to make a choice between two medications they need but can afford only one.  They understand these situations.  I am curious as to whether the witnesses have any ideas on what can be done at a high level to instil the confidence that might drive some recruitment and retention.  It will not drive all of it but it might drive some level of recruitment and retention.  It might also improve the buy-in from those groups where there is not necessarily buy-in.  Nurses, healthcare professionals and doctors via the IMO have substantially bought in.  There are issues in Sl&aacute;intecare that they do not love but they have some buy-in.  There is clear hostility from other groups and some of this comes from reform fatigue.  Do the witnesses have a view on how this can be driven at a high level to ensure we get buy-in from healthcare professionals?</p></speech>

These have been deliberately built into Sl&aacute;intecare, which is one of the nice aspects of it.  There are wins we can have without a system change that will just make a difference to people's lives, such as lowering prescription charges, removing hospital inpatient charges and lowering the drug reimbursement threshold per single headed households.  These are all overnight wins we can achieve for which we do not need a system response and, therefore, do not need to wait for the system to change.</p> <p>  We do not need to wait for the system to get better before we legislate because there are components we can do now and get into play now.  There are components that have a slower build.  We need to develop a universal primary and community care setting, which is a key issue.  Having quick wins builds trust with the public and investing in the right areas in primary and community care will, hopefully, build trust among providers in the system because they can see where it needs to go, and that we are far too acute focused and we need to have much better non-acute settings.  As we talked about earlier, if we put human resources into this setting and make sure we can make good on some of our commitments, people will start to see a system that is changing and that they can buy into, and this is when it will start to build motivation and morale.</p></speech>

From my read of the strategy, action 6 on "universal eligibility", which is not at term anyone has ever used previously because it is about entitlements, is about reviewing charges and the current eligibility framework, developing a policy proposal and then introducing legislation with no timeline beside it.  In fact, Sl&aacute;intecare outlines clear timelines on legislation, phasing and introduction.  It is a step back in commitment rather than a step forward but it was good to hear the Minister speak about entitlements this morning.</p> <p>  With regard to action 9 on the workforce, there are certain "Sir Humphrey" sections in the implementation strategy, in that they go on and on but do not give up too many specifics on how to move them forward.  Perhaps this is where politicians can come into it to firm up some of these actions to have better commitment in them.</p></speech>

Reference has been made to training an increased number of professionals.  We all agree on this.  The degree to which this can be achieved in the short term, particularly with regard to retention, is something on which we are not so readily agreed because we do not know how to do it.  It has not been shown to us yet.  We are competing on the world market for health professionals and the question that arises immediately is an economic one, which is whether we can afford to compete at the level required to attract the appropriate number of professionals into the system.</p> <p>  I remind people that during the Sl&aacute;intecare committee sittings, I was at pains to point out the battle that goes on in each Department for resources at budget time.  There will always be suspicion among other Departments if one Department is given priority.  The good part of this is the Department of the Taoiseach is involved, which will give an overview to everybody involved and recognition that there are pressing issues in this particular area that need to be dealt with.  There are equally pressing issues in other areas, such as education and housing.  These three areas are fighting for the same resources.  To what extent is it feasible to marry together these three Departments in such a way as they can coexist in a complementary way?  In particular, elements of housing are complementary to health services in numerous ways.  There is the cost and affordability of housing for health professionals and the cost and affordability of housing for patients.</p> <p>  Cost versus vision and entitlement has rightly been referred to.  To what extent do the witnesses see progress being made towards achieving the vision and, at the same time, balancing this with the availability of resources that become available?  We must also keep in mind that, despite the fact considerable strides have been made in turning the economy around, with the public, Government and politicians in general making a major contribution to this at great cost to the public, we still have considerable national debt, and the servicing of this is also considerable at approximately &euro;6 billion per annum.  This must also be brought into the equation.  Is it feasible to weave a path between all these competing issues in a way that will achieve the results we desire under Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

I take on his comments on training.  It takes time.  Human resources are always the slowest to build and they are the most essential ingredient of any health system to work well.  We know we are deficient, particularly in primary and community care where we did not do so well during the austerity years.  We lost more professionals from that area than any other.  We have recovered less well also, whereby there has been more recovery in human resources in acute settings.  Human resources are important and the measures on this in Sl&aacute;intecare are deliberately phased, particularly if we look at some of the elongated phases.  They give us a little more time.  I agree we have to think about what motivates people and what will help to recruit and retain people.  The international literature shows strongly this is down to quite a broad package of various elements.  Salary is one but it is rarely enough by itself.  We need to look at training possibilities, hospital environments and good management.  A broad package of various elements help people to become satisfied.  We need to pay attention to this.</p><p>While we have managed to import our way out of some human resource challenges, we have lost people who moved on because when it came down to it, the terms and conditions did not work out or there were not enough training opportunities.  People felt they were in dead-end positions.  It is clear that is an issue that needs to be examined carefully because that is our key investment.</p><p> I welcome the creation of additional capacity in the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive to examine all the issues around workforce planning.  We need to consider very carefully how we motivate and retain people, which is not just a matter of salary.  Does anyone want to take the second question?  It is a poisoned chalice.</p></speech>

We are only at the starting line, even though the Deputy began that discussion on the committee in June 2016.  In a way, the appointment of Laura Magahy and the setting up of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office is the starting line.  We have been slow to get here, but we have got here.  In terms of costs versus vision, Professor Thomas's slide presentation shows that it is doable but it will require more money.  However, there has to be political will to fund and make it happen.</p></speech>

What we are saying is that we can still keep hold of the vision, and the integrity of that, but perhaps phase it in a slightly different way that makes it more realistic within budgetary constraints.</p></speech>

Everything becomes a waiting list in this country and everywhere else as far as I can see.  The point about waiting lists is that if it is possible to deal with an issue on the first, second or even the 20th day, it avoids a waiting list building up, be it for housing, health services or something else.  There is a already a long waiting list for services and we have to deal with that somehow.  If we are waiting to deal with an existing long waiting list and, at the same time, trying to put in place the structures we all recognise are envisaged, how will that work out?  Have we paid sufficient attention to those long waiting lists?  I am aware the National Treatment Purchase Fund has dealt with some of the cases.  When will we get to a stage where the waiting lists are manageable, that is, where people wait for perhaps two months?  Will it take four, ten, 12 or 20 years?  We need to deal with the amorphous mass and the disappointment and severe pain experienced by patients.  I have tabled D&aacute;il questions over the years seeking information on behalf of constituents, for example, elderly people who are waiting in severe pain for a hip replacement or other procedure.  The replies state it will take X number of years for the person to be seen.  Members often get such replies when trying to deal with the provision of vital services.  This seems to affect this country more than any other.  We must start somewhere by intervening and saying this will be the position from now on and we will hold the line, while at the same time dealing with the long queue at the other side of that line and ensuring it does not build up again.</p></speech>

Ireland is well out of line with international practice, certainly with international best practice.  We have some of the longest waiting times in Europe.</p></speech>

I am not sure we spend the money well in some cases.  We also push back some expenditures onto the private sector.  There are incentive structures.  We often have a significant amount of dual practice, which can create problems through the different incentives.</p> <p>  I want to come back to the issue of how we manage this problem because we do not have very good information on waiting times.  While we have data on waiting lists, we do not have very good waiting time data.  If we get much more detailed information on waiting times for various procedures in different parts of the country and make that publicly available, politicians can be empowered to start doing something about it.  It is much more difficult to do something to identify the problem when it is hidden behind bad data.  What Sl&aacute;intecare does is provide important investment in ehealth and some of these data systems.  Once the truth starts to come out, it will be much easier to manage it better.</p></speech>

Dr. Sarah Barry, our colleague, spoke about the spinning wheels.  We have address both issues.  We have to bring down waiting times, which are unacceptable and inhumane, but we also have to reform the system to ensure we are addressing the people waiting a long time.  We must start having diagnostics in the community, including providing same day access to general practitioners for tests, quicker elective care and many more services outside hospital.  Once we get that process moving, it can stop the build-up that is happening now.  It is not an either-or situation.  We have to do both.</p></speech>

There has to be a shift away from lists of people waiting to see somebody in a hospital outpatient clinic to being able to meet needs in the community more often.  We are seeing significant demand that we are not able to measure appropriately because we do not have the full numbers on individuals.  Some of those who are waiting are on several lists.  This demand is often channelled into the wrong streams or pots and belong in other places.  We need both the resources to get people into the right places in order that we can meet capacity, while also thinking about how we can make the current system better to ensure it will operate much more efficiently than at present. </p></speech>

I apologise for being late but I had an earlier commitment.  On efficiencies in the HSE and health service, the witnesses referred to medication and access to GPs.  To take the simple example of the cost of drugs and pharmaceuticals, people have access to drugs and pharmaceuticals but do not necessarily use them.  On generic drugs, the changes we have brought about in this area have not delivered significant savings.</p> <p>  We talk about pouring money into the health service without examining areas where we can create efficiencies.  The witnesses spoke about free access to GPs.  Since free GP care was introduced for children aged under six, which is a very welcome scheme, GPs have complained about the number of unnecessary visits they must accommodate.  Likewise, if we increase free access to services, whether for pharmaceuticals or general practice, the question arises as to how we make those services efficient and ensure they are not used unnecessarily.  I am not clear on whether we have examined that issue.</p> <p>  The other issue is efficiencies in our hospital structure.  I deal with many people who work in the medical care sector and I have found there is a serious problem with morale among nursing staff, doctors, junior doctors and consultants.  Many more people are retiring earlier than planned.</p><p>Such are the pressures now being put on people right across the board that they want to get out, and they are getting out three, four and five years earlier than they had planned.  This creates its own problems within the healthcare sector.</p><p> On the issue of consultants, if we want to deal with waiting lists we have to have a lot more people who have the ability to deal with the lists in a timely manner, and at the same time have the backup support.  Over the last three or four years the HSE has taken on more than 12,000 extra people.  I am not sure whether there was an overall plan to see exactly where people were needed and what needed to be prioritised.  It appears to have been a bit hit and miss and a case of whoever could shout the loudest for extra staff got the staff.  I am concerned that we are talking of putting more money into the health service without looking at prioritising from one to ten and asking where it needs to start with staffing and with the inefficiencies.</p><p> I have an issue with the lack of accountability in the health service.  We discussed the patient safety Bill last week and I raised this issue.  When we speak about the patient safety Bill and accountability it is aimed in particular at medical practitioners and nursing staff but I am not satisfied that we have any mechanism within the current structure of the HSE for accountability of managerial staff to the extent that we need.  It is not referred to within the Sl&aacute;intecare report but I may be wrong on this.  I am concerned.</p><p> Another issue that causes huge inefficiencies in the health service is the moving of the deck chairs within HSE management.  I have raised this previously.  I am aware of one hospital that had ten hospital managers in 18 years.  There is a lack of continuity in that process but nobody has asked why people are moving.  Is there a problem with the job or with the pay?  Nobody has looked at the movement of the deck chairs within the management and administration, where people are in a job for 12 months and then they have to move on to another job 12 months later.  If a nurse starts in a position he or she is more likely to be in a particular area for a period of time, and likewise with other medical staff.  There is continuity.  We do not have that continuity in administration.  I do not see where this whole management structure has been examined with regard to rolling out the long-term plan and accountability.  How would the witnesses deal with that?</p><p> Reference was made in the graph to duplication, where some people have medical cards and health insurance, and other people who have neither a medical card nor health insurance.  What are the exact percentages for these groups? I may have missed that and it would be helpful for me to have those percentages.</p></speech>

In the Sl&aacute;intecare report there is quite a large focus on changing the current inefficient system to one that is much more efficient.  My worry is that if we allow the system to just persist as is then the inefficiencies will also persist.  If one looks at what Sl&aacute;intecare is trying to do, it is moving care from where it is currently provided into lower care settings, which is moving it out of acute care settings into community and primary care settings where it is being done much more efficiently, quickly and responsively.  It is changing the skill mix around the delivery of some care where we are not so reliant on doctors to provide care.  We are looking more at alternative provision of different kinds of care.  The free GP and practice nurse access for children aged under six is an interesting case in point.  We need to think creatively about how we provide that care so the system is not unnecessarily burdened, and see if we can we use more practice nurses in that kind of setting.  We need to look at how we do that and think about it creatively.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is about doing things in a low-cost public care setting rather than in a high-cost private care setting.  We presented interesting data last week from EUROSTAT around European healthcare expenditure.  It shows that Ireland is the third most expensive country for voluntary health insurance spending per person.  Ireland is actually the 12th most expensive in terms of Government funding per inhabitant.  We must be careful not to believe the myths some people put out that we are spending far too much money.  It is more about how and where we spend it.  Sl&aacute;intecare is critical to changing the way that is done.  It requires transition and that is quite a difficult process, and sometimes slightly expensive in the short run.  What it then delivers, however, is a system that operates far more efficiently.</p></speech>

People do not necessarily know when they need care so it is better for them to access it and be sure of what is going on.  It is about weighing the choice between unnecessary utilisation, making sure people do not go to the GP, do not take a drug they do not need or fill a prescription they do not use and crowding out those people who actually need to access care.  We might look to improve efficiency on the one hand but we could end up with a very inefficient outcome in terms of people not accessing care until their problems are quite complex, or accessing the care in a scenario that could have been dealt with much earlier.  We need to be careful.  There is no evidence of a sweet spot for charges that somehow eliminates all the unnecessary utilisation but does not keep people from accessing care they way they need to and in its most appropriate setting.  There is evidence in Ireland that charges prevent people adhering to their medication and keep the poorest and sickest from visiting their GP.  The charges are a direct deterrent.  It is not necessarily true that introducing charges or maintaining charges at all costs will keep utilisation to only the necessary components.  With free GP access there has been an increase in demand because of the access for children under six, and due to the expansion of care, but there is also a call in the Sl&aacute;intecare report for increased primary care capacity and increased GP capacity to meet these needs, along with increased palliative care, home care services and other services to complement those needs.  It is not just up to the GP.  The GP can work with other healthcare professionals in tandem to provide this.</p> <p> On the drugs issue, it is important to note that these medications will not be free under Sl&aacute;intecare, but they are going to be affordable.  People who are on medical cards or GP visit cards, or with other types of safety nets, should not pay a charge that we have already deemed they are unable to afford.  They received a medical card because they are low income, or they have a chronic illness and cannot afford these.  For households that have a certain amount of affordability for these drugs it is proposed that they are not charged more than that.  We have pushed the thresholds up over the last number of years to a level that is not sustainable for many households.</p></speech>

The percentages actually drop when we look at the figures of those with no coverage.  There was 15% of households within that breakdown that could not afford their healthcare.  In 2009-2010 it was nearly 13% of households that could not afford their healthcare expenditure, which was their out of pocket charges and their private health insurance premiums.  The figure was 12.2%, which is illustrated in the yellow section of the document I provided.  This means they had no coverage, neither a medical card nor private health insurance.  This figure dipped to 9.8% in 2015-2016.  This dip comes with a huge health warning, however, because we what we are really capturing is the huge amount of unmet need.  Most households cannot even afford to put themselves into financial hardship because they do not have the money to spend on private care or insurance premiums.  We have good evidence to support the fact that unmet need is growing in Ireland.  A recent survey found that Ireland now has the second highest rate of unmet need for healthcare in the EU with 40.6% of adults over the age of 15 saying they had an unmet need for healthcare in at least the last 12 months due to cost, distance or waiting lists.  Only Latvia is higher than us now.</p></speech>

There is much to be learned from the case study.  We need to think carefully about what the capacity of the system will look like.  Where people do not necessarily need to go directly to their GP, could care be provided by other healthcare professionals?  There has to be capacity in the system to do that, which is why Sl&aacute;intecare is to invest in it.  It is a case in point to ensure the appropriate learning from the policy.</p></speech>

I agree fully with what has been said, but I spoke to a GP in a community care centre where a physiotherapist is now employed by the HSE.  It was taking anything up to six weeks for the GP to get an appointment for a patient with the physiotherapist.  He could telephone a physiotherapist and get a private appointment within 24 hours.  I agree fully that we need to introduce community care services at a far higher level.  How do we make sure we are delivering services in a timely manner and that it is not just about employing people?  That is also a challenge.</p></speech>

Nobody is arguing about the expansion of free care services or services at low cost.  In the past few years, however, we have seen the expansion of free GP care to those aged under six years - about an extra 240,000 children - persons in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance.  At the same time, there was a reduction of 38% in resources for general practice.  In the case of those aged under six years, what has happened is that the visitation rate has increased and general practice does not have the capacity to deal with the increase.  As a result those aged under six years end up being brought to out-of-hours services which also do not have the capacity to deliver free care services.  The children then end up in emergency departments.  The presentation of children aged under six years in emergency departments has, therefore, increased since they were provided with free GP care.  Children have not got any sicker in that time, but they have an entitlement to free GP care and if they do not receive it in general practice or out of hours, they will present at emergency departments.  Entitlement can be expanded, but it will have that consequence if it is not matched by an expansion of capacity.  Why would an emergency department see more children aged under six years when they have an entitlement to free GP care?  It is because general practice does not have the capacity to take them on.  That is where the policy does not match the practicalities.</p> <p>  We have touched on some aspects of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  Lost in translation, as I put it, has been the funding element and the issue of entitlement versus eligibility and the blurring of the lines in that regard.  There has also been a loss of urgency.  I do not get the impression from the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy that there is urgency.  We are now two and a half years into the process and we still have not seen any policy change.  Are there other elements the delegates can identify that have also been lost in translation?  It is a broad question.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare looks to expand by about 5,000 - 6,000 in its entirety - the number of occupational therapists and public health nurses, but I do not see any indication that that element has been taken on board.  The staffing of primary and community care settings is the critical component that will unlocks so much else if we want to move from providing care in acute care settings.  That has to be a priority, but I do not see it being picked up on.</p></speech>

I will talk mostly about the idea of community policing, although I am happy to answer questions on rural crime also.  During my involvement with the Commission on the Future of Policing, it received many submissions on rural crime.  In that context, it must be recognised that rural communities have a role to play in policing their areas in conjunction with the Garda and other participants.</p> <p>  Community policing is a philosophy of policing that promotes community-based problem-solving strategies to address the underlying causes of crime and disorder and fear of crime, and which provides reassurance.  Many community policing approaches involve the police performing a role in addressing community problems which may not be directly related to crime.  Problem-solving policing reorients the police role away from an exclusive focus on the crime.  Problems, not crime, become the organising core of police activity.  The concern is with preventing future harm.  Similarly, solutions can be broader than simple law enforcement and can involve the participation of other agencies, such as housing or health agencies.  Furthermore, the criminal law becomes only one means of addressing problems.  Civil laws can also be utilised.  Planning regulations, and, increasingly, mediation and restorative justice schemes can have a part to play.</p> <p>  Problem-solving policing requires analysis of the causes of the problem, identification of the options open to addressing it and the development of a means of evaluation of the impact of the problem so as to assess performance.  Such an approach requires partnership between the police, the community and other relevant agencies.  Through partnership structures, communities seek involvement in decision-making and problem solving.  Community policing in this way involves community empowerment.  It also has implications for the police requiring structural change.  To be effective such an approach requires devolution of power within the police organisation and the decentralisation of police authority to patrol officers and a far greater emphasis on collaboration between police and community.  The community policing approach emphasises ideas of consumer service, flexibility, consumer feedback and negotiation.</p> <p>  This change in the police role necessitates training to enhance police understanding of the nature of community problems and for the development of problem-solving techniques.  This was described in the Report of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, the Patten report, as the need for "more focus on developing personal communication and negotiation skills, scenario-based problem-solving exercises, self-assessment and peer assessment".  Community policing approaches also require a change in the way police effectiveness is measured.  The numbers of arrests or prosecutions are crude measurements and fully assessing community policing approaches requires more qualitative measurements such as problem resolutions but also community-oriented expectations and defined objectives.</p> <p>  Throughout the world, there is great variety in community policing models and approaches.  Despite this variety, a number of common characteristics define the community policing approach.  These are: flexibility of police structure, devolution of authority within the police and the development of localised command structures; creation of systems of local accountability; community crime prevention schemes; an increase in the number of foot patrols; cultivation of police-community relations through continuity of service by officers in a specific area over a prolonged period; problem solving of non-crime issues; partnership between police and public; and power-sharing between community and police in respect of decision-making.</p> <p>  There is no single model of community policing but the philosophy is strongly linked to the concepts of localised democracy and policing by consent, based on respect for fundamental human rights.  It also requires the entire police force to adopt a broader concept of policing and a transformation of the mindset of all police officers.</p> <p>  Many submissions received by the Commission on the Future of Policing highlighted broad public support from both outside and inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for better community policing.  At present, community policing is very informal and dependent on the personal commitment of local management to this form of policing and the level of support provided.</p> <p>  Other criticisms made of community policing include the following.  The diversion of resources to other duties would appear to vary significantly within the force.  The lack of available records to quantify this is in itself an issue of concern.  There is a considerable lack of supporting infrastructure for community policing units.  The work and outcome of the work undertaken by community garda&iacute; is inappropriately measured, if at all.  There is no clear command structure.  The activities of community police or the community policing structures are not sufficiently formalised within the organisation.  Community policing is under-resourced.  It does not have a proper career path or equality of status with respect to working conditions and allowances.  Community policing personnel are moved to other policing units when the need arises, such as for sporting events or temporary transfer deals in response to pressure on policing resources and this breaks down continuity in community police service.  The programme for recruiting suitable members to community policing is ill conceived.  Community police do not receive adequate training in conflict resolution problem-solving or communication skills.  There is often no specific office space to do such basic things as conducting meetings or receiving telephone calls.</p> <p>  In summary, in Ireland, as in many countries, community policing within our police organisation is marginalised and undervalued.  We have extensive evidence of this and yet, the one constant theme running throughout most submissions to the Commission on the Future of Policing, particularly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is the need for community policing to be central.</p> <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing has articulated a vision of policing into the future that puts community policing at its core.</p><p>It has made radical proposals that will transform the way in which policing is delivered to local communities.  The term &quot;community policing&quot; is used in many different ways but in the report of the commission we use the term &quot;district policing&quot;, which we consider to be the best fit for Irish circumstances and for the new model that is proposed.<br/><br/>Under the current approach, community policing is a kind of specialist activity, with perhaps 10% of garda&iacute; in a district designated as community officers.  We regard district policing as the backbone of police work and the police mission.  In our new district policing model, all police personnel at district level, sworn and non-sworn, should be considered to be community police.  In future, all Garda personnel at district level, sworn or non-sworn and whether assigned to emergency response or community engagement, should work as a single district policing team to solve problems affecting community safety, reduce crime and prevent harm.  They should develop their own district policing plans in consultation with local community fora.<b></b>They should be equipped to deliver all routine policing services with support from the divisional level for administration and certain specialist functions.<br/><br/>The structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the focus on the front line by becoming flatter and less siloed.  Headquarters should set policies, broad strategy, standards and objectives.  Front-line police units should decide how they can best deliver those objectives and be accountable to their supervisors for the outcomes.  There must be a high degree of delegated authority, complemented by stronger local supervision, notably at sergeant and inspector level.  Innovation, initiative and new approaches should be encouraged and evidence-based success applauded and disseminated.  Excellence on the front line should be valued and recognised.  The building of genuine community partnerships should be a requirement for all Garda districts.  To be effective in preventing crime and protecting people from harm, police must work in partnership with other entities, including schools, community and volunteer organisations, businesses, human rights NGOs, youth groups, faith-based groups, sporting bodies and others.  We have seen evidence of good examples of this throughout the country but the practice should be universal and police leaders should be assessed on their success in building such partnerships.  Garda&iacute; should be assessed for their performance in this respect, and it should be a factor in determining assignments and promotions.<br/><br/>Supporting the districts will be the division level units.  These should be large enough to be self sufficient for all routine administrative and operational purposes.  They should also have detective teams and other specialists to support the districts.  Crisis intervention teams, including staff from mental health and child services agencies, should be based at division level.  Each division should have an information centre, supporting the districts in data collection and analysis.  In effect, we envisage that a division should be, for most policing purposes, a mini police service in its own right.  The current 28 divisions seem to be too many and too small.  We are not more prescriptive about the structure because we believe firmly that the Garda Commissioner must be allowed to manage the organisation, and that includes deciding on the right structure.  We believe that it should be flatter than it is now, with a lower senior management ratio.<br/><br/>It is also important there be effective fora for police to engage with communities at district level.  In the new model for district policing, we envisaged that district police leaders would develop local policing plans based on local objectives and priorities agreed with joint policing committees, JPCs, or local community policing fora, LCPFs, involving full community participation.  Currently, the Policing Authority has a responsibility to co-ordinate and support the JPCs.  It does not have the same role in respect of LCPFs.  We propose that the new oversight body, the policing and community safety oversight commission, PCSOC, which will supersede the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, should develop these local structures to function effectively, building capacity for participation by community stakeholders, setting standards for their operation and evaluating their performance.<b></b>The key objective would be to build community trust and address problems through authentic engagement.  The PCSOC should also work with local fora to promote multi-agency approaches to community safety at local level.  It should have a fund available to support local innovation and initiatives.<br/><br/>The public, police and politicians all told the commission that they want to see more police on the front line.  We agree.  More police working in and with the community will help prevent and detect crime, reduce fear of crime and protect people at risk.  Many police are now doing jobs that do not require police powers and should be done by non-sworn employees or outsourced.  Police also have unnecessary administration duties such as keeping paper records, duplicating electronic ones.  These should be stopped.  These steps will allow significant numbers of garda&iacute; to be redeployed to front-line district duties.<br/><br/>The commission heard repeatedly throughout its consultations that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is constantly called upon to engage in non-crime roles, many of which perhaps could be conducted by other agencies.  However, it must be acknowledged as well that professional police everywhere are often both the first port of call, in that people go to them because they do not know where else to go and are then directed elsewhere, or they are the last port of call, as there are no other sources locally available or accessible due to it being the evening.  The police are also unique in the extent of their legal powers which can be called upon at any time in the conduct of their general or specific roles or when a non-crime issue becomes a crime issue.  It is also very important to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, like all professional police, has significant symbolic power in society.  The professional police remain qualitatively different from other forms of policing, in their symbolic power, generalist mission and regulatory position.  The key task for the commission was to identify how this unique position can best be utilised for the benefit of those most dependent on it, who primarily are the most vulnerable in society.<br/><br/>A January 2015 report by the UK College of Policing, &quot;Estimating demand on the police service&quot;, found that 84% of calls to the police were related to non-crime incidents, notably concerns over an individual&rsquo;s welfare.  Mrs. Theresa May told the Police Federation of England and Wales conference in May 2015, when she was then Home Secretary, that police officers were &quot;not social workers ... mental health nurses, or paramedics&quot;.  In reality, however, they often are all of these things, or at least on an amateur basis and unless other professional bodies who perform these roles engage or are available and accessible.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to perform such functions until that happens.  We have made recommendations on how this should occur.<br/><br/>District police should have real-time access to crime data and to information about public concerns.  They should keep their residents well informed about community safety issues and engage with them proactively to solve problems affecting crime and the perception of crime, thereby leading to both the reduction of crime and stronger confidence in community safety.  Front-line police are a vital source of information about crime, fear of crime and vulnerabilities in the communities they serve.<br/><br/>Finally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society in terms of socioeconomic status, gender and ethnicity.  This will take a determined effort, including innovative marketing of the police career and youth engagement initiatives along the lines of the &quot;police explorer&quot; programmes elsewhere.  It is also recommended in the report that the organisation should work with higher education institutions to develop a Garda access programme, aligned with the programmes of those institutions.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there is a historic challenge and opportunity facing us in terms of the future of policing.  As we approach the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is about how to transform our policing model from the highly centralised and hierarchical colonial model we inherited to a community policing model and all that it entails.  The commission has set down a transformative vision whereby the philosophy, principles and processes that define policing with the community can be effectively delivered in an Irish context.</p></speech>

I will focus on our experience of community policing.  To outline the context, For&oacute;ige is a national youth development organisation whose purpose is to involve young people, consciously and actively, in their own development and the development of society.  This is carried out through a range of supports, from universal volunteer led clubs to targeted interventions engaging with some of the most vulnerable and at-risk young people and families in the community.  Our primary experience with community policing is through the provision of Garda youth diversion projects, GYDPs.  There are 105 such projects nationally, managed by a range of community based organisations.  Funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS, Garda youth diversion projects are community based, multi-agency, youth crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour away from the criminal justice system by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  For&oacute;ige manages 42 GYDPs nationally and is also funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service to provide a range of supports to GYDPs through the GYDP best practice development team.</p> <p>  The community policing service provides vital support to many of the young people, families and communities with whom we work.</p><p>Community garda&iacute; actively contribute to the diversion of young people from offending or further offending.  This is done through building positive, trusting relationships in the community, engaging in partnerships with local agencies, both voluntary and statutory, and being visible and accessible.  The role of community garda&iacute; in early intervention and prevention of youth crime should not be underestimated.  Children and young people tend to follow a pathway towards offending behaviour.  There are also characteristics which make it possible to predict the likelihood of a young person offending.  These developmental pathways and characteristics give families, communities and systems the opportunity to intervene and prevent the onset of criminal and anti-social behaviour while also building skills, strengths and resilience in young people.  Focusing on the development of assets and strengths in young people while reducing the risks not only delivers positive outcomes for young people and families, but also contributes to the overall quality of life in a community and reduces the likelihood of the escalation of a young person's offending behaviour, thus reducing the burden of crime on society and the significant financial costs associated with that.<br/><br/>The research has clearly evidenced that the more contact a young person has with the justice system, the poorer his or her outcomes.  It is important to intervene as soon as possible and as little as possible with a young person who is at risk of offending to bring about a change in his or her behaviour.  Through their presence on the ground, the community garda can monitor behaviour and identify young people who may be at risk of offending before their behaviour escalates to the point that they come to the attention of their Garda colleagues.  The community garda will often deal with incidents of anti-social behaviour in an informal manner with a young person, and this low level of intervention is enough to have a positive impact on his or her behaviour.  Where a young person or family may require a greater level of intervention, the interagency approach of the community policing service allows community garda&iacute; to make timely referrals to appropriate services which can meet the needs of the young people and their families.<br/><br/>Garda youth diversion projects have greatly benefitted from the relationship with community garda&iacute;, particularly in relation to early intervention with young people.  The partnership approach of the community garda&iacute; has also been effective in identifying young people under the age of criminal responsibility who may be engaging in risky or anti-social behaviour.  This has ensured that the appropriate supports are put in place for young people aged under 12 years and has allowed us to address their risks and needs at an earlier stage using their strengths and interests to build skills, increase protective factors and reduce the likelihood of future offending.  Engagement with community garda&iacute; has allowed for frank informed conversations, allowing us to monitor behaviour, respond quickly and appropriately and ensure better outcomes for young people.<br/><br/>Community garda&iacute; contribute to youth projects and services and other community agencies in a wide variety of ways.  By sitting on local committees they can contribute to a co-ordinated response to meeting community needs.  Community garda&iacute; in many areas support GYDPs to develop a comprehensive analysis of youth crime in their catchment area using both PULSE data and local knowledge, which ensures that plans are designed which meet the specific needs of the community and take into account the nuances of their particular context.  Across the country, community garda&iacute; are involved in delivering a range of educational programmes in both the school and community settings.  These ensure that young people and communities are aware of their rights and responsibilities, but also build trust and relationships between community members and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has been our experience that community garda&iacute; have accompanied Irish Youth Justice Service workers on visits to families experiencing chaos and trauma, engaged with both mainstream and high-risk young people in a positive, meaningful and non-judgmental manner, and responded quickly and sensitively to young people and families in crisis.<br/><br/>In a police force in which there is a level of mistrust in many communities, community garda&iacute; are the exception.  As the visible, approachable and friendly face of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many young people and community members will reach out for help and advice from the person they have met at a local meeting, in the school corridor or community centre or walking through their estate before they would ever consider going to the local Garda station.  The ability to access the support of community garda&iacute; has benefitted many communities enormously from both a crime prevention and quality of life perspective.  Those in the community policing service have managed to build positive and effective working relationships with the community, voluntary and statutory agencies working in partnership with them, but equally, if not more importantly, they have built positive personal relationships with community members, young and old.<br/><br/>Given the many benefits I have outlined, it has been disappointing to see the gradual erosion of community policing nationwide in recent years.  Many Garda districts and divisions do not have a dedicated community policing service, which results in a system that is constantly firefighting and responding to issues as they arise, rather than proactively engaging in crime prevention and reduction measures.<br/><br/>Where community garda&iacute; are present in communities, the benefits are tangible.  However, with a reduction in resources and an increased demand, we have seen many community garda&iacute; pulled out of community duties in response to front-line operational needs.  This prioritisation of regular policing duties has resulted in a loss of the preventative work of relationship building within communities.  Many community garda&iacute; who have retired or moved position have not been replaced.  We have seen at first hand the challenges for community garda&iacute; who wish to have a greater level of engagement with communities, but because of the demands placed upon them can only now engage in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner.  Many communities are suffering as a result of the reduction in resources put into community policing.<br/><br/>Where community policing plays a significant role in crime prevention, in our experience with Garda youth development projects the benefits in terms of targeting, early intervention, assessment of risk and need and achieving positive outcomes for young people are clear.  Community garda&iacute; identify young people at risk before they have been detected offending, often under the age of criminal responsibility.  They support Irish Youth Justice Service workers to carry out assessments, engage with young people and families through the projects and deal with issues informally at a local level before they escalate.  They support interventions in very practical ways as well as providing advice, support, information and educational programmes.  Their partnership approach with community groups and other voluntary and statutory agencies ensures that community needs can be responded to in a co-ordinated and consistent manner leading to better outcomes for young people, families and communities.  The main challenges that we see are the lack of resources put into community policing in recent years, the absence of a service in many areas and the tendency, where there is a service, to direct community garda&iacute; to prioritise front-line operational duties to the detriment of their community duties.<br/><br/>Owing to the vital role community garda&iacute; play in early intervention and crime prevention, For&oacute;ige strongly advocates that appropriate and adequate community policing resources be allocated in every Garda division and district in order that all communities can benefit from the service.  For&oacute;ige welcomes the new community policing framework and the establishment of the new community policing offices in the 28 Garda divisions.  This is a positive development and we are hopeful it will support the allocation of appropriate resources to this essential community service.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.220" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Garvey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#H00300"><p>As members have copies of our statement, they will be glad to hear that I do not intend to read all of it.  I will begin with an overview.  Muintir na T&iacute;re has operated community alert for more than 30 years in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community alert is the largest crime prevention initiative in Ireland with more than 1,400 groups.  While relying on the age old principle of neighbours watching out for each other, community alert has also been quick to utilise modern tools such as text alert.</p> <p>  Statistics show that levels of rural crime are not increasing in general.  However, all levels of crime can be reduced.  A very real issue in rural areas is the fear of crime.  This does not always relate directly to actual crime levels.  For instance, whenever there is a high profile crime or reporting of a court case relating to a particularly heinous crime from several years earlier, we notice an increase in activity in community alert groups.</p> <p>  While crime obviously has rural and urban dimensions, isolation means fear is a much greater factor in rural areas.  When people do not have immediate neighbours, they are obviously more afraid of what might happen to them, whether someone will come to their aid and even about when they might be discovered.  Cases of elderly people being tortured, robbed and left tied up are thankfully rare, but they do occur and further fuel these fears.  Crime prevention and detection are important but of equal importance is creating an environment in which people feel safe.  Muintir na T&iacute;re and community alert play a vital role in providing this safe environment, through means such as text alert, the new mobile app, Cairde, and supporting other schemes such as the seniors alert scheme.  While communities can do a great deal for themselves, they still need improved support from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the judicial and legislative authorities.</p><p>Muintir na T&iacute;re has a memorandum of understanding with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the operation of community alert.  The partnership which also includes our funders, the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE, works well.  It has allowed for efficient and effective solutions to problems such as the recently introduced text alert rebate scheme.  It should continue to be a platform for providing solutions to rural crime and community safety problems.  Community policing is vital in providing this support.  In the years of financial restraint from 2008 community policing has been hit particularly hard, locally and centrally.  When resources were limited, the role of the community garda was often the first to be hit, as resources were directed towards what were thought to be more urgent areas.  This has had the effect of damaging the relationship between communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That relationship needs to be rebuilt urgently.</p><p> I will leave members to read in their own good time about the history, structure and mode of operation of Community Alert set out in our submission and move to page 8 which deals with community text alert.  Community text alert was formally launched as a community alert programme in 2013 in partnership with the IFA, Neigbourhood Watch and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has certainly caught the public's imagination.  Over 700 groups have registered for the initiative which receives regular positive media attention.  Well over 1,000,000 texts per annum are being issued.  Community text alert is often quoted as having provided the vital cog in crime detection and local Garda management often points to reduced crime levels in areas where the scheme is properly implemented.  Community text alert areas are highly visible through the erection of highly visible and identifiable signage which includes the telephone number of the nearest 24-hour Garda station, to which suspicious activity can be reported.  On receipt of such a call, garda&iacute; will verify the information and can then issue an SMS text message to all registered recipients in the area.  There is also the option of including surrounding areas where this might be useful, for example, in the case of a moving vehicle.</p><p> The success of community text alert is due to the fast and efficient dispersal of information between communities and the Garda.  There is also a deterrent effect through the visible signage erected.  However, equally effective benefits, although less obvious, arise through the organisation of community text alert groups as volunteers to visit houses to explain and gather contact numbers and watch out for older or more vulnerable neighbours.  The last 12 months have seen much change in community text alert, with Muintir na T&iacute;re having had to take over the role as the main issuer of text messages and also with new technology being introduced.  The new Cairde mobile app is an example.</p><p> Policing in Ireland is famous for its reliance on the support of communities and the public at large.  In previous decades most rural communities had a resident garda.  This has changed because of the financial constraints since 2008.  Many rural Garda stations have closed.  Initially, it was explained that resources could be better used by having more garda&iacute; on patrol, rather than sitting in a station.  There was a promise that community engagement would continue through deploying resources to have garda&iacute; available at certain times in public buildings such as community centres, but that has never happened to any great extent.  As resources tightened in Garda districts during the same period, one of the first casualties in many areas was the community garda, as personnel were reassigned to roles that were seen as more pressing.  While this might have been necessary in the short term, it has had a long-term impact.  Most people do not now know a local garda and this has serious implications in the passing of information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and increased fear of crime.  While community text alert has alleviated it somewhat, it is a one-way communication tool.  Members should note that this change primarily affected rural communities, as greater numbers in urban communities meant community engagement could continue to a great extent.</p><p> During the same period resources for community policing at central level were also severely cut.  The Garda community relations office has reduced in numbers and there is now only one sergeant responsible for the entire country.  While we appreciate his help and work very well with him, it severely curtails what can be achieved in our partnership.  Historically, the community relations bureau had one inspector, two sergeants, two garda&iacute; and two administrative staff, but, as I say, it has been reduced to one person.  These inadequate resources, coupled with the Garda management structure, hinder the central dissemination of best practice.  That leads to practical difficulties in areas such as community text alert.  None of this is a criticism of individual garda&iacute;, with whom we have an excellent working relationship, it is simply the end result of the provision of  inadequate resources.  We would like to see increased resources at central level and a return to each community having an allocated garda who would be known to it.  While we appreciate that these are operational matters outside the direct control of the committee or the Department, the issues must be highlighted.  In that regard, we welcome the recent report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, in particular as it relates to district policing.</p></speech>

Before I open up the meeting, I note as a courtesy that this is to be the substantive work of the committee in this session of the D&aacute;il.  For information, I note that the committee will next week meet representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, which will be a first, when the discussion will be about this dual focus of community policing and rural crime.  We will finish up the following week by meeting representatives of the Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association.  We appreciate all of the delegates making themselves available and engaging with us.  Deputies Colm Brophy, Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire and Clare Daly have indicated.  Anyone else who wishes to indicate will be added to the list.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#J00300"><p>I thank the delegates for attending.  I do not have that many questions in that I agree strongly with the gist of the presentations.  Certainly, I support the emphasis on community policing and hope the new Garda authorities will advocate it as being at the heart of policing.  My experience as a public representative, a councillor for ten years and then as a Deputy is that the community garda is at the heart of the interaction between the community and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Luckily, my area did not suffer as great a loss in the provision of community garda&iacute;.  The role was maintained throughout the cutbacks.  It is the most effective tool the Garda has to deal with crime in a way that prevents its escalation to more serious levels.  One thing that was mentioned by Mr. Connolly and which is a very valid point is that if a structure is not in place which focuses on a career path in community policing, it is at the heart of why it encounters problems.  What I have seen over ten or 15 years is that a lot of young garda&iacute; come into the role, perform it for a period of time, seem to really like it but, inevitably, move on.  They move up or out of the role, which leaves the existing structure of community garda&iacute;, as distinct from what was advocated in the report, as an ineffective form of community policing, notwithstanding its positive aspects.  That is because it is really only an engagement with the community at one level.  A part of it I have experienced through the joint policing committee in my local authority area shows, however, that there is a much better path that involves interaction with Garda management at all levels, including at the higher levels way up the line.  I welcome the proposals the delegates have made.  They are exactly where we should be going.  In my experience in Tallaght, Rathfarnham and elsewhere Garda management has worked on the community policing model in South Dublin County Council, which is where it can be really effective.  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on my point about promotions and whether it is at the heart of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#J00400"><p>It is central to it.  Something that was very striking emerged throughout the work of the commission.  We travelled all around the country to meet garda&iacute; in their stations.  They all saw themselves as community garda&iacute; and valuing the role as a priority.  They put it as a matter of "serving the community".  The problem was that the structures and processes to facilitate placing it at the core of the policing organisation were not in place.  Garda&iacute; felt that the role was undervalued and took the view individually that colleagues felt it was undervalued.  As such, the objective would to get into a specialist unit.  That is the way one would want to go.  However, many were happy working in community policing.</p><p>If they had a career path, and if they were promoted on the basis of how they engaged with communities, local structures and so on, it would be seen as much more important to the organisation.</p></speech>

I call Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#K00300"><p>I thank the Dr. Connolly for attending.  I was anxious that this issue would be addressed.  I am a big fan of the community policing model where it operates properly.  In my experience it has made a big difference in some of the communities I represent, which have had some excellent community garda&iacute;.  It is an issue that has been neglected, however.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on community policing earlier this year.  The number of dedicated community garda&iacute; around the country is down by 40%, but in some areas it is down by 94%, such as in Donegal.  Some of that might be due to a number of chief superintendents being in a better position to defend their resources and retain personnel.  I expect that there was a significant fall in every district and a catastrophic fall in some.</p><p>My first questions are for Dr. Connolly but I would like to hear others' views also.  The questions reflect what is in the Commission on the Future of Policing document.  Part of me wonders if it is an issue of language.  Community policing sounds vague unless one has met a designated community garda and had a sense of what a community garda does.  In a sense, one expects that every garda is a community garda, which is true up to a point.  My concern, however, is with the attitude taken from a policy point of view that every garda should be considered a community garda.  While every garda should be community-orientated and the attitude of those who are parts of core units should be in co-operation with the garda&iacute;, there is a difficulty if there is not a dedicated community garda for a subdistrict or several community garda&iacute; across a district.  The certainty of the role is not there.  There is a general principle that community policing is important, but when there is a spike in crime or when public order issues must be addressed in a district, people are redirected away from this work.</p><p>As our guests have all indicated, a huge function of community policing is in crime prevention and building relationships as opposed to crime-solving.  I am open-minded but my initial view is that there needs to be a core of people who are specifically and primarily responsible for community policing in a dedicated way.  While they are assisted in a general sense by other core unit garda&iacute;, it is their primary responsibility and the people in the locality know whom to ring if they want access to the community bus or if they want to organise some sort of a public meeting about a public order issue.  There should be a specific contact person who is known to people.</p><p>There are two districts in my constituency and, in the one closer to where I am from, we have had a series of excellent community garda&iacute;.  This allowed relationships and trust to be built up, particularly with younger people.  While other garda&iacute; might have been known, the community garda was known first and foremost.  I would like to hear Dr. Connolly's observations on that but I invite anyone else to comment also.  We could allow for every garda to be a community garda, covering a multitude, yet it might never really cut to the core of focused, dedicated development of relationships and dedicated community policing.  More broadly, does Dr. Connolly believe that community policing has been adequately resourced by Garda management in recent years?</p><p>There has not been a great deal of use of the restorative justice model in this jurisdiction.  The model has been used more in Britain, the North and other jurisdictions.  Do we need to see more of that and who is responsible for handling it?</p><p>On local accountability mechanisms, my experience is that the LCPFs, which are quite <i>ad hoc</i>in nature, are far more effective, and I expressed that in my submission to the commission.  I accept that JPCs vary hugely, but I attend meetings of Cork county JPCs as well as Cork city JPCs.  There is a population of 400,000 but the JPCs are trying to deal with things on a thematic basis and, therefore, all that happens is that crime statistics are read out to people and questions are answered.  There is no setting of priorities.  Policing plans are formally presented but they are so general and so broad-based that, ultimately, public representatives and community representatives do not have enough of a feel of the county as a whole to properly get their teeth into what is involved.  It needs to be much more localised, which is why the LCPFs generally work well, although they are very localised.  My understanding of what will be put forward by the commission is that both would be retained, although I am not sure I understand the division of labour that is envisioned in the proposal.  What would be the job of the JPCs, if they are to be retained, in the event that more emphasis is put on LCPFs?  In the North policing and community safety partnerships, PCSPs, are a fair bit more robust.  Was that model explored at all?</p></speech>

My view is that doing that tends to marginalise community policing.  At present, it is approximately 10% dedicated to community policing units.  The real problem here is we do not have any real idea of the demand on the policing service at a local level.  There needs to be a good analysis of the data coming in and the demand on the local districts before a decision can be made about exactly how many should be dedicated.</p> <p>  The key part of this is that everyone should look toward the community and see himself or herself as community police, whether he or she is in a specialist unit or otherwise.  It is not as if the community police in the organisation are being looked down on, which is where matters seem to stand currently.  The key is continuity of service, as Patten report acknowledged.  Over a number of years there must be dedication to an area or a location.  If a specialist unit comes in briefly because of some serious crime occurring, who are just there to investigate that particular crime, they still must liaise with the garda who is there permanently or on a more continuous basis and who is engaged in problem-solving.  That requires continuity and engagement over time.   We know that in other countries most issues - approximately 80% in the US and the UK - that come to the attention of the police are non-crime issues which are mostly related to vulnerable people and which need interagency work and sustained engagement over time.</p> <p>  On restorative justice, it is an area in which I have much interest.  There is huge potential and there are many good things happening with it.  Restorative justice is being rolled out and used more, and it fits into the model we are proposing because it looks at the problem and not necessarily the crime.  It aims to be preventive and it engages over time in bringing people together.  If it is, a young person and people who are important in his or her life are involved and he or she is helped get through the particular stage.</p><p>Restorative justice has much potential.  I have done work recently relating to drug debt.  In other areas such as sexual violence or hate crime, many are not engaging at all with the criminal justice system.  They are not going to the police because they do not necessarily want to end up in a prosecution.  They do not want to end up in a court case and even prison does not solve the problem if the offender ends up there as a problem may still continue from within a prison.  We must look at alternative and imaginative approaches, and restorative practice has much to offer in that respect.</p><p> I do not want to dominate and, therefore, I will finish on JPCs.  We received a number of submissions from JPCs and we were struck by them and by our visits by the inconsistencies.  Some were doing very good and novel things in different areas but the term "talking shop" was also used quite a bit in a number of submissions and the presentation of data.  This does not need to happen at a JPC and data relating to local crime should all be available using modern data techniques on the Garda website.  We were more impressed with the local community policing structures.  One cannot be overly prescriptive as that might not be what is needed in a rural area.  I have worked with a number of them in Dublin city and they have been extremely effective in dealing with serious crime problems.  There is much dedication.  There is also much resourcing, including the Irish farmers' organisation, Muintir na T&iacute;re, For&oacute;ige, the GAA and a huge number of organisations throughout the country that have a desire to perform a role in community safety that we should be able to tap into.</p></speech>

A number of counties operate successful district and divisional meetings, engaging with the community in a real way.  Cork does that very well but others I will not name do not do this at all.  It shows where this is on the priority list.  Looking at the metrics commonly reported in terms of numbers of checkpoints, arrests and everything else, there is never anything about the number of community engagement meetings and so on.  It needs to be made more consistent at a higher level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bernie Meally" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#L00300"><p>I agree with a number of the points made, particularly regarding the need for a dedicated community policing service and roles.  In areas where there are dedicated community garda&iacute;, they engage well with the young people and the families they work with.  In some areas there are difficulties or challenges and they need the support of local Garda management to protect the time and space in order that they can attend a committee meeting or go to a local youth club or project, sit with a group of young people, drink coffee and talk about what the number on their shoulder means, for example.  We have seen some  wonderful work done with a group of young people who engaged with a project and, through this, we did a relationship and sexuality education, RSE, programme.  As the conversations happened, the staff started to feel there may have been some inappropriate behaviour happening.  Immediately after the session, in consultation with their line manager of course, the staff spoke with community garda&iacute;.  They came in a very informal role to participate in the RSE programme, speaking about the legalities and illegalities of some of the behaviour.  There were positive discussions around consent and it was an important learning opportunity for those young people.  Had one of those community garda&iacute; received a call and been told a prisoner needed a lift to court, we may not have had that learning experience for those young people.  It is important that local Garda management supports those community garda&iacute;.  That echoes some of what has been said here already.</p> <p>  A particular skill set is required for a community garda.  I am speaking from the youth perspective.  Not every person can walk into a youth group or a group of young people and feel comfortable to engage in a meaningful way with them.  Where it is successful, community garda&iacute; come in with their prevention hat on, willing to build relationships with young people.  It is not about looking for crimes but rather some of the solutions and how to support young people and vulnerable families.  There is also a need for greater and more comprehensive training packages for those in that community garda role, as the skills are very different from somebody who might be in a regular unit or a traffic corps, for example.</p> <p>  We have seen an inconsistency - that word was used earlier - in how and where restorative justice operates throughout the country.  We have had some good feedback from young people and families who have engaged in restorative processes with the garda&iacute; and we would encourage more of that.  In some areas, it does not happen at all.  We see the restorative process, when it is engaged in very genuinely on both sides, as a fair and equal process.  It has some positive outcomes for young people and their families in terms of understanding the impact of behaviour on other people.  Young people can be impulsive and may not think about the impact on people they affect with their behaviour.  Through various restorative processes, there is increased awareness and many more positive outcomes for young people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#L00500"><p>I agree with that.  It speaks to what is in the Commission on the Future of Policing report and treating policing as a profession.  This is a skill.  I take on board the point made by Dr. Connolly.  I have said that every garda should view himself or herself as a community garda and be community-oriented.  My concern is at the other end of the equation.  Where there is a good community garda and functioning structure, there is a focal point for contact and concern.  However, it is just not the same if the approach is to get people to contact the station and any of the lads or ladies will help.  It is not quite the same.  I am sure any of them would do their best but one does not build up the same relationship as somebody whose primary purpose is to liaise and work with the community in developing initiatives.  It is my view but I maintain an open mind on it.</p> <p>  I have a view on fora.  Notification can be an issue and the community as a whole often does not know these are ongoing.  Garda&iacute; and local authorities, etc., must improve at getting the word out.  Public participation networks, PPNs, are great but these involve the people most switched on to what is happening in community structures and organisations anyway, so simply contacting them does not mean it will get to the wider community.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for For&oacute;ige, with one or two for Muintir na T&iacute;re.  There is an issue with the tendering of youth diversion projects and some people have expressed concerns about it.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  Is For&oacute;ige happy enough with how juvenile liaison officers and community policing are tied together?  We are not specifically addressing the juvenile liaison process here but should there be more focus on it?  Much policing time, especially in urban areas, is taken up by garda&iacute; being contacted to address anti-social behaviour, although much of the time the behaviour is not anti-social but just involves large groups of young people congregating.</p><p>Garda&iacute; then move them on to another place.  Someone else then rings the Garda station and they are moved again.  Sometimes those young people are involved in anti-social or criminal behaviour, but quite often they are not.  I believe a huge amount of time is wasted because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has to address constantly the fact that there are not enough places for young people between the ages of 14 and 17 to go, particularly those who are not interested in sport.  They do not have a place to go to, so they stay in.  That is an issue we have to address.  Where do we expect these young people to be if not at home if they are not into sport?  The lack of infrastructure means that garda&iacute; are constantly shifting people on to the next place.  It is true that sometimes there are real issues, such as anti-social behaviour and crime.  Quite often, however, no such issues arise.</p><p> In terms of Muintir na T&iacute;re, the issue of community CCTV has been discussed at this committee regularly.  Data protection concerns arise.  I can see both sides of the matter.  It is valuable for tackling crime.  How might data protection issues be addressed?  Do the witnesses have any concerns?  How do they envisage the scheme working?</p><p> I am mostly focusing on Muintir na T&iacute;re, but anecdotally the targeted theft of tradesmen's equipment is a significant issue at the moment.  People are being snooped on.  Those responsible are researching their victims online.  Expensive equipment is being targeted in a dedicated way, and people's livelihoods are threatened.  Have the witnesses come across that issue?  Do they have any views as to the solution?  It is only recorded as a theft, but it can devastate a household.</p></speech>

Deputy Clare Daly has to leave in a few minutes because a delegation is visiting her at 11 a.m., but she wants to ask questions.

I assure them that we analyse what they say and weigh up all the points made.  The report will be the main body of work for this committee going forward.</p> <p>  I found it striking that there was a real difference in the vision outlined by Dr. Connolly and the reality of the interactions.  The vision he spoke of is a good way to start.  I see merit in what he is saying.  The idea of having a dedicated 10% does not work.  We should understand that policing is there to protect and serve the community in all of its aspects.  We need to re-emphasise that.  I was struck by what Dr. Connolly said when he suggested that it should not be about arrest and prosecution but rather about considering how a community is best served.  There is a body of work in that.  What do the witnesses think about that?  They dealt briefly with restorative justice, but mediation and other areas could be looked at.  How can those options be explored further?</p> <p>  Inadequate multi-agency interaction is key.  It came up when we discussed the section 29 issue.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is called at night to take kids into care.  Generally speaking, the experience is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very good to deal with, but it does not have the support it needs from other agencies, especially Tusla.  Tusla has been particularly poor in terms of a lack of liaison with schools and in identifying problematic behaviour.  Will the witnesses discuss that further?  When a child gets into trouble, the parents are involved, but the school should be involved much more than it is.  Probation officers and Tusla can also get involved, meaning that the situation becomes very messy.  Do the witnesses have any views as to how that might be better co-ordinated?</p> <p>  In terms of specific communities, especially minority communities and people who were not born in Ireland in particular, will the witnesses tell us how the issues of language, hate crime and racism are dealt with?</p> <p>  If each group present here could change one thing to improve the area of community policing, what would it be?  That question is addressed especially to Muintir na T&iacute;re.</p> <p>  I am sorry for rushing.  The contributions made by the witnesses have been very thought provoking.  It is good to think about where we are and what the vision is.  The transition is part of a bigger project we are involved in.  We must reinvent what we mean by policing.  I will be paying attention to the replies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bernie Meally" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#M00400"><p>The first point Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire made was about the tendering process for Garda youth diversion projects.  When the call for proposal process - I believe that is the official title - was first announced in January, all of the community-based organisations that manage Garda youth diversion projects were very concerned.  Our major concerns related to the suggested timeframe.  There was a lot of consultation with garda&iacute;, community-based organisations and front-line youth justice worker.  Thankfully, the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS, has decided to delay that process.  That was a very welcome development for all youth organisations, not just For&oacute;ige.  It caused a lot of concern for a few months.  We identified that rash decisions had the potential to have a wide-ranging and long-term impact.  The delay is very welcome.  The process now proposed involves research, and will take place from the end of 2018 and throughout 2019 and beyond.  That research will identify the key benefits of a programme such as the garda youth diversion programme and the factors that make such a programme effective.  If there is then a call for proposals, the IYJS will be very clear on what it is looking for and what has the best outcomes for young people.  We welcome the decision to delay that process.</p> <p>  There was a general question about our experience with juvenile liaison officers and whether we are happy with them.  For&oacute;ige and other community-based organisations delivering garda youth diversion projects work very closely with juvenile liaison officers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are an essential part of the system.  The majority of young people who engage in a Garda youth diversion project are referred by their local juvenile liaison officer.  In most cases it works very well.  They have close and effective working relationships in many areas.  There have been various challenges with working with juvenile liaison officers over the years.  Work was done in 2017 to look at how Garda youth diversion projects and juvenile liaison officers could work together in a more effective manner.  Resulting from a process of consultation and research, a number of guidelines were put together that outlined what the relationship should look like and how to get the most from it.  We were finding that where people had a strong and positive personal relationship, the projects were operating very well.  The correct young people were being referred in a timely manner and the information flow between the youth justice workers and garda&iacute; was very good.  People were happy to pick up the phone and have a chat about an incident, gather information on it and assess it well.</p><p> There were some areas where the flow of information and perhaps the relationship were not as good.  Our research found that the issue between the projects and the juvenile liaison officer, JLO, simply concerned communication and understanding of roles and responsibilities.  Consequently, the guidelines break down what a youth justice worker's or juvenile liaison officer's role is.  We have found that this has helped to improve interaction and co-operation within the communities at a very practical level.  There have been varying responses from young people and families we have worked with on how they feel about the Garda or the juvenile liaison officer.  In many cases we find a young person is much more positively disposed to a juvenile liaison officer or a community garda, where they are present, than to any other garda in the community or in the Garda station.</p><p> Things are not perfect.  There are several other issues.  We would like to see a more comprehensive programme of training for JLOs.  In the last few years the Garda youth diversion projects, GYDP, best practice initiative has done some work with the Garda bureau of community engagement on developing training specifically for juvenile liaison officers.  Every JLO that comes into post receives that training, which helps them understand the issues and needs of a young person who is likely to offend.  It helps support them in deciding on the most appropriate response to those young people.  Sometimes that is a very informal response, and other times it is about going through a much more formal process.  Training is an issue.  We would love to see more training because there is a very particular skill set for a juvenile liaison officer, as there is for a community Garda.  Not everybody is born with that skill set and it is really important that they are supported.  It can absolutely be learned.  It is important that good quality training is put in place to support JLOs in learning some of those skills. </p><p> Finally, I will address youth facilities, and a previous speaker's comment that there is not necessarily somewhere for young people to go so they hang around the streets.  That is absolutely correct.  There are deficits in facilities for young people in some communities.  In other communities there are facilities but the young people or other community agencies may not be aware of them.  As organisations, we have a responsibility to get out there and make sure that people know we are there.</p><p> However, the youth sector is really struggling, and has been for the last few years, because of very significant cuts to funding.  The initial cut to the youth services grant scheme was 35%.  There was a restoration of 7%.  As such, funding for the youth services grant scheme is down 28% in the last several years.  I am tempted to say that has been the case since 2008, but I could be mistaken in that.  That has had a catastrophic impact on some of our services.  That 28% amounts to more than &euro;700,000.  That sort of money is massive to a charity like ours and it has had serious impacts.  We have lost jobs and we have not been able to replace people who have moved on.  That means that we cannot provide front-line services to young people and families who need and deserve them.  That is just the situation for For&oacute;ige.  There are many other organisations and agencies which have been very drastically hit by those cuts as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Sweeney" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#N00300"><p>I wish to pick up on a couple of issues.  Reference was made to equipment theft.  This is a very real issue in rural areas, not just for people in industry but for farms as well.  There has been a substantive amount of it.  It is especially targeted.  Some of these individuals are able to case farms.  There are quite detailed casings, sometimes with the use of high-technology equipment such as drones, etc.  In areas where substantive work has been done on CCTV operations, on which I will elaborate later, there is a structure with which to trace the offences.  However, that is in very rare situations.  We are finding on the ground that where technology enhances security and observation, crime drops and moves to the next area and then to the next.  This is a very real issue on the ground.  It feeds into the fear referenced in our introduction and a sense of isolation.  People live in fear, knowing that this is likely to affect them, if not now then at some time in the future.  That fear often extends to not even reporting the crime when it occurs.  We have to be very mindful of that.  Much of the time the full impact and level of what happens on the ground is not reported.  That affects the quality of the data we are reading.</p> <p>  I will give a brief example.  I spoke to a man recently who had been sitting in his kitchen with his family, eating their evening meal, when individuals with dogs walked through their private yard and past their kitchen window, going for a walk through their farm.  The family discussed whether or not to engage and decided not to.  Not only that, they decided not to report it to the Garda.  That is life in rural Ireland.  We must be very conscious of what reality is like on the ground.  There is fear of what may happen next if people report.  From our perspective, the frightening part, into which we all have an input, is this: why is that individual not confident enough to report that to his local community or the Garda?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Garvey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#N00500"><p>I would like to address Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question about community CCTV.  The establishment of community CCTV schemes around the country started to take off about five years ago, particularly around motorway junctions.  County Laois was a prime example.  The Department then introduced the grant scheme for community CCTV and allocated &euro;3 million to it.  Perversely, that has brought community CCTV to a halt.  As has been mentioned, there is an administrative issue over who the data controller for these schemes should be.  The legislation specifies that the local authority should be the data controller, but many local authorities are not prepared to take on that role and we are at a stalemate.  As to how we get out of it, I note there are three different types of CCTV scheme in the country.  There are community schemes, whereby the community takes responsibility for the scheme and the data; there are Garda schemes typically seen in towns, where cameras around the town are monitored in the Garda station; and there are hybrid schemes, which are a combination of both.  Although the Minister said they are not to be changed, the demands of the legislation need to be considered to see if a hybrid solution can be arrived at.  Several groups are now deciding not to apply for the grant and are doing their own thing.  In doing that, they are also walking away from getting the authority of the Garda Commissioner for the scheme.  That has implications for the admissibility of evidence gathered under the scheme.  That is the position of community CCTV.</p> <p>  I will briefly address equipment theft.  Mr. Sweeney outlined its results.  One practical suggestion is property marking, that is, marking equipment with an identifier.  One could be flippant and say that if nobody bought these things then nobody would steal them, but it is an issue if one cannot identify stolen goods.  There are several property marking schemes through which people can mark their property.</p><p> Deputy Clare Daly asked if there was one thing that might make community policing better.  That one thing would be a change in priority given to community policing at the top level of management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would then filter down.  That would have to be measurable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#O00200"><p>I will return to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point as I have given much consideration to the numbers and units and to the dedicated unit.  I appreciate that he said that he would keep an open mind on that.  We require clear information as to the demand for local services and that a clear workforce planning programme be put in place, neither of which exists.  Using that data, we could discuss a percentage that would look to the community and engage with it in a problem-oriented way.  It is crucial that we have a vision for policing with the community.  It cannot be something that is just put aside and not prioritised.</p> <p>  The commission's report had a great focus on training.  While I appreciate that there are some people who are very good at community policing, speaking to kids and so on, it is something for which people can be trained.  If someone is entering into this public service, they should know from the start that they are going into a community-based service where they must be able to engage with young people, people with mental health or addiction issues and so on.  That people are trained and prepared to engage at that level is central to the idea of community policing.  That is how one articulates a vision on the ground through a professional organisation, where people are properly trained and treat people with dignity no matter what section of society they come from.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear Deputy Clare Daly speak of the vision of community policing that we articulated.  The problem is that it has fallen through the cracks, which is why one can have a good community garda being pulled away.  It is great that we have articulated a vision of what it would look like in the future.</p> <p>  The issue of mediation is very important, just like restorative practice.  I bring members' attention to a forthcoming report by the Council of Europe on international experiences of restorative practice that should be worth examining.  We must look at alternative ways of dealing with frequent problems in terms of dealing with prevention.</p> <p>  The multi-agency point is central to much of what we have discussed in the commission's report.  We proposed setting up crisis intervention teams, which were first proposed in 2009, so that it is not just garda&iacute; who are available to deal with vulnerable people at 5 o'clock on a Friday.  We have also recommended that the Cabinet subcommittee on criminal justice should organise an annual event bringing together the various Departments which broadly have a role in the area of community safety to show that it is a multi-agency function.</p> <p>  If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to implement the report of the commission.</p></speech>

I will call Deputy Wallace next.  He has the jitters because he must go into the House to ask the Minister some awkward questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#O00400"><p>I do not have the jitters but I am hoping to give them to the Minister.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentations which were very good.  It is to be hoped that if we can get them a place in our report, there will be more thought around many of these issues.  Things get said and are just left there with not enough done.  Most of the good points that the witnesses are making will remain aspirational until someone is prepared to make changes to how things are done.  I think everyone made the point that for aspirations to become reality, it will cost money and more resources will be required in certain areas, whether they are taken from other areas or extra money is required for us to have real community policing.  I get the impression that the witnesses feel that more will have to go towards the overall budget in the first place.</p> <p>  I am running away, as it were, and so will ask only two questions.  Mr. Garvey said Muintir na T&iacute;re "would like to see increased resources at a central level" and "would also like to see a return to each community having an allocated garda".  Does he think that some Garda stations should also be reopened?</p> <p>  Some of the witnesses touched on this but do they agree that schools offer a great potential in developing a healthier approach to kids coming from a troubled background?  They referred to cuts to centres and so on.  I see ten to 15 kids in villages in Italy gather around a lamp post or bench there and they do not cause trouble.  There is a different mentality.  I am not saying that they do not have youth centres or anything.  Do schools not offer potential?  From my own experience going to school, it has a huge influence.  Teachers and individuals in the school can have a great impact on how one sees things.  Some teachers had a huge influence on me.  It is different from home.  The philosophy that comes from home is crucial but school is different.  Is it too aspirational in terms of the work to be done?</p> <p>  When I was young, we knew the local garda and we also knew where he was.  He moved around the parish a bit but he was in the barracks at certain hours and we knew where to get him.  He was completely a part of the community whereas now, with the so-called mobile garda, I do not have a clue who the garda is at home now.  I would not be in a position to go and look for him or her if I needed to.  That is a great loss to the community.</p></speech>

The Minister has indicated that he hopes to bring the force to 20,000 in the next two years, which is a huge increase in resources.  The resources are coming.  It is a question of ensuring that they are correctly allocated.  The same principle applies to Garda stations.  When resources were tight, they were closed.  We have an open mind on whether a dilapidated Garda station should be reopened or another facility provided in another community building, if that is available.  However, the Deputy is correct that there must be a physical place where one can visit one's liaison garda.</p> <p>  The idea at the time was that the garda&iacute; were better off out on patrol rather than filling out paper, and while true to an extent, it is also flippant.  People need a safe place to communicate with a garda, to pass information, get information and, as my colleague observed, to be able to have a conversation about what is happening in the community.  That is missing at the moment.  One cannot have that conversation through the window of a garda car as it is passing down the street.  There need to be more physical locations and we have an open mind as to whether they are Garda stations or other community facilities.</p> <p>  The representatives of For&oacute;ige will probably expand on this much more, but I believe that the Deputy is correct about schools.  Good community garda&iacute; are visiting schools.  They are organising events for the elderly but they are also visiting schools at the other end of the spectrum.  Our information, however, is that they are few and far between.</p></speech>

To address Deputy Wallace's comment on schools, my view is that it takes a village to raise a child.  It is not just about schools and the family of origin.  All members of the community should be involved in raising young people.  The Deputy is right that there are major opportunities within the education system to build skills in young people and to inspire and motivate those young people to be very active, positive citizens and to promote civic responsibility.  Where communities work well, all community agencies are involved.  Youth work and the education system work hand in hand.</p> <p>  In our experience with Garda youth diversion projects, schools are very much part of the work we do with young people.  They help us to assess the risks and needs of young people.  In many cases, education is a major risk.  A risk factor related to offending for young people is non-engagement in school, negative engagement in school or leaving school entirely.  Youth services, statutory services and other services work very hard with schools.  Most schools engage really well but there are other major opportunities.  The reality is that a school is constrained by a curriculum which it has to abide by.  The opportunities for youth work and community work complement the work that takes place in school at a pace that is reflective of the stage the young person has reached.  We can respond directly to his or her needs and tailor the programmes or interventions that we carry out with him or her entirely based on that young person's circumstances.  We all have a role in building skills for these young people.  That includes the Garda and every other agency present.</p> <p>  I did not address a comment made by Deputy Daly earlier but would like to do so now.  She posed a question about asking what we do and who we go to when a young person is in difficulty.  She also asked about multi-agency or interagency working.  Our experience has been that those working directly with young people are interested and willing to try to work together when a crisis occurs.  The issue that we have found is that there is sometimes a lack of communication at departmental level, and that has an impact on how we can and do work together.  It has caused many frustrations for front-line workers who see massive needs and possible opportunities to work together and support each other, but there is not necessarily joined-up thinking at departmental level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#P00700"><p>On Deputy Wallace's point about Garda stations, we have to be imaginative about this and look at co-location across agencies or in community centres.  There are sometimes challenges for people talking to garda&iacute; or going into a Garda station in a small village.  It is important that the State has visibility in villages and towns.  The withdrawal of post offices is problematic for many communities because, in effect, the State is withdrawing from these communities or becoming less visible in them.  Community policing builds on the informal controls that already exist.  We have a large number of national organisations that have a place in every single locality and village, whether the GAA, Muintir na T&iacute;re or the Irish Farmers Association.  They have an important role to play here in working with the Garda to provide facilities and so forth.  That is definitely possible.  It also means that agencies should co-locate.</p> <p>  The issue of schools is important and brings two issues to mind.  I was involved with a project initiated by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in the north inner city where she brought schools together in a sort of convention.  I wrote the report on it entitled, Just Saying, which addressed drug issues.  We have to get into the space that young people are in.  They were talking their own language about the drug and alcohol issues they were confronting.  I did work on drug debt, a problem that came up constantly in schools.  Kids were not going to school because they were in debt for drugs.  Their parents may not have known.  Many things happen in schools and schools have a role to play in assisting young people in getting discussing, negotiating and overcoming these problems.</p> <p>  I reiterate the point about interagency working.  In the commission report, we have called, at a ministerial level, for a regular meeting between agencies which have a place in the community safety area, whether justice, health or youth justice.  If there are such barriers to communication or data-sharing, they should be resolved at that level.  A strong message coming out of our report is that we look at policing.  We did not do a report on the police but on policing, which is not just about the Garda but cuts across all sectors of society.  I hope that emphasis is reflected in the committee's work too.</p></speech>

I love the vision for community policing.  My gut tells me that policing services have a long way to go.  The area that I am interested and work in and on which Dr. Connolly touched is addiction.  I have often worked with families with loved ones who had broken into houses to feed their addiction, whether to alcohol, drugs or gambling.  I would like to hear from the witnesses about that.  I will not use the word "addiction" because we often treat that as another issue.  We are talking about society in general.  What is the role of alcohol harm and drugs, including for people who are dependent on drugs and those who have binge weekends?  What is the impact of that on fights?  I refer to fighting, accidents that happen, sexual abuse and domestic violence.  When we look at crime, including the serious issue of rural crime, what drives people to commit crime in general and what role do alcohol, drugs and gambling play in that?</p> <p>  Dr. Connolly spoke about respect and the policing service.  The policing service deal with huge trauma every day.  It works on the front line all the time.  A report was done recently on trauma and the mental health of garda&iacute;.  There are no supports provided for garda&iacute; in that respect.  All of that trauma comes back to addiction and the role it plays.  I work with families who have somebody they love with an addiction problem.  They live with trauma too because they are watching their loved one go down the route of self-destruction.  They are living with the chaos and crisis this causes.  I am bringing this to the policing service and community policing.  From my experience of working with these families, if one gives them the tools to cope with this in a way that does not traumatise them or cause them to burn out and enables them to treat their family member with respect while establishing strong boundaries and measures that prevent him or her from creating chaos, the results are unbelievable.</p><p> Coming back to community service, I have worked with many different families.  I worked with a grandfather, for example, who was not an old grandfather.  He was relatively young, in his late 50s.  He was rearing his grandson and they were both living in a house together.  This young lad started to get into drugs of some kind.  He was not taking them every day but he started to get violent.  It was pretty scary and the grandfather did not know what to do.  He did not want to go to the police because this was his lovely grandson.  He did, however, connect with the local community garda with our help.  He brought the community garda into his home and sat the young lad down.  The community garda talked to the young lad at length about the impact his behaviour was having and said that the next time it happened, he would be arrested if there was violence.  Immediately there was a shift with the young lad and, thankfully, through a lot of interagency work, and this was only this one young lad, with the help of the community garda, and with the addiction services really supporting the grandfather, that young lad is now in recovery.  This is just a small example of how such interagency work can work well.</p><p> I have another example of a sister who was very concerned about her niece.  She was only ten and was living in an environment of addiction.  Again, the sister went to the community garda, who was fantastic.  The community garda gave her support.  Unfortunately, they could not do anything for the ten year old child, which was devastating, but at least there were some supports there.</p><p> I listen to "Today with Sean O'Rourke", on which Paddy O'Gorman has a segment in which he meets people outside the courts.  Almost 95% of the people he talks to are before the courts for alcohol, drugs or gambling related cases.  I am trying to ask the witnesses, in their experience in the work they all do, how high a percentage of cases are alcohol, drugs or gambling related.  I hear what Mr. Garvey is saying, that this must come from the top when it comes to the Garda.  District policing only accounts for 10% of policing overall.  That is pretty shocking when one thinks of what community garda&iacute; could do, bearing in mind that we must be conscious of the fact that many of the garda&iacute; are burned out from dealing with crises all the time.  I loved what Ms Meally said about the community and understanding roles and responsibilities.  Again, this goes back not only to the training of garda&iacute; but also to supports for them and having that support there for them when there is a crisis.  The overall approach could be life-changing for the police force in such a positive way if it came from the top, instead of this kind of zero tolerance and lack of compassion and lack of empathy.</p><p> I will stop soon.  This is just an area I am particularly passionate about.  I have worked in the prison services and seen women in particular who have entered prison because of crime related to drugs or alcohol - probably more alcohol than drugs.  They act out in ways they would never act out if it were not for substance misuse.  When one works in that field and deals with people in a compassionate, respectful way, the results are phenomenal and off the Richter scale.  All of a sudden they start to feel good about themselves, even though they have acted out in ways that have resulted in their ending up in prison.  They start to feel good about themselves and shame starts to disappear.  They start to realise that there may be hope.  In the witnesses' experience, what role do alcohol, drugs and gambling play in crime?  How high is the percentage?  Has there been any research done on this?</p></speech>

By this I do not mean that one sees drunkenness as 50% of youth crime in the statistics for the country or for particular catchment areas.  What one sees are the likes of minor assault as a result of a young person getting drunk and ending up in an argument and a physical altercation with someone.  One might see the likes of criminal damage, whereby someone is drunk and smashes all the wing mirrors on the street as he or she walks home, or one could see the likes of theft from a shop, whereby a person either steals alcohol to drink or steals other items to make the money to get alcohol.</p> <p>  If one were to look at the statistics on drugs, one would believe there is not a drug problem among the youth population in this country at all.  We know anecdotally, however, that there are pockets where there are huge issues of drug use and substance misuse.  For us, one of the major challenges in this regard is the real lack of under 18s substance misuse services and supports.  In some areas and counties there is nothing.  We have youth workers and youth justice workers who will access any training they can to be able to work with a young person.  Our area of expertise in respect of substance misuse in the youth work arena is around education, awareness and prevention.  When it comes to the field of intervention, there are other professionals who are much better placed to meet a young person's needs.  If a young person is actively engaging in substance use to the point at which it goes beyond experimentation and there is the start of a dependence on a substance, professionals should be working with those young people.  What we have in many communities are youth workers and other community organisations doing their very best to support these young people because no service is available or there are huge waiting lists to access those services.</p> <p>  The other issue we find is that many young people with substance misuse issues have underlying mental health issues.  A young person who is drinking or using substances could be doing so to help deal with anxiety, depression or chaos at home or for other reasons.  We find, however, that the community adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, will not work with that young person in dealing with his or her mental health issues because he or she has a dual diagnosis of a substance misuse issue.  Then there are people - again, I am talking especially about youth workers - in a community trying to hold and support young people and getting them to a point at which they can engage with a mental health service.  It is just very challenging for those working on the ground.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Garvey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#Q00500"><p>Yes.  The misuse of alcohol and drugs is an unusual one when it comes to rural crime in that it is more of an undercurrent in rural communities.  It is not a matter of out-there, in-your-face street brawls and wing mirrors being broken off cars because that just would not be accepted in a rural community.  The social mores still have that effect.  It may be a factor behind visiting gangs carrying out burglaries and so on.  That is a separate issue.  That is not to say that that misuse is not there; it is, of course.  It is there in domestic situations such as those the Senator described.  She is correct that the community garda can provide support in such cases - as I said earlier, the good ones do - but then it is about priority and focus.</p><p>Specialist drugs units have been set up everywhere that have a very clear focus on tackling one end of the spectrum.  We do not have that focus in the community garda's job.  It is a by the way.  If somebody knows a helpful garda, he or she will do the job.  It should be part of the job and have equal priority to the enforcement on the other end of the scale.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#R00200"><p>In terms of the links between drugs, alcohol and crime, there is a great deal of literature and research available.  The Health Research Board has produced quite a bit of research on this area.  Generally the link is understood using three models, one of which is psychopharmacological model.  This relates to the product or the quality of the drug that contributes to violence.  We have significant evidence that supports the link between alcohol and violent crime but not so much in respect of illicit drug use.</p> <p>  Recently, I was invited to talk at an event on benzodiazepine use among young people and the impact this was having on them in terms of forgetting their actions, for example, engaging in violence and forgetting about it the next day.  The event was organised by youth workers.  It is a very serious issue that is largely hidden but the consequences are not hidden, which is of concern in this area.</p> <p>  I was struck by Senator Black's point on the impact of trauma on work of garda&iacute; because it was a major issue that the commission confronted in our work.  We wrote a chapter calling for the introduction of a properly resourced wellness programme within the Garda and obligatory counselling to be provided following traumatic events.  A programme is being rolled out in the organisation but we were very strongly of the view that it needs to be well resourced.  We were struck in particular by the very high suicide rate in the Garda organisation on which data were published just before we reported.  The Garda survey also highlighted the types of issues that were being confronted by garda&iacute;.</p> <p>  One of the most positive features of the commission's report is that we discuss not only the prevention of crime but also the prevention of harm and responding to harm.  Harm is often the result of a dual diagnosis, serious addiction issues or family trauma.  As I mentioned, a recent report in the UK showed that 80% of police interactions involved non-crime events and usually involved vulnerable people with mental health issues, addiction issues, etc.  That is what police organisations are doing on a day-to-day basis.  Often they are doing it because other agencies may not be available after 5 p.m.  That is the reality of police work and we have made it a central part of our work that people need to be trained in this.  Garda&iacute; are often the ones left to try and deal with these issues.  They should be trained or, if not trained, they should be close enough to other agencies to be able to divert people to them.  They understand the signs, for example, in cases of sexual violence issues, particularly associated with alcohol, which often arise.  They need to have sufficiently close links with other organisations, be it in the addiction or sexual violence field, to ensure they do not do more harm in their initial reaction to the victim and can subsequently divert people to other organisations.  That is central to what we are talking about in terms of a multi-agency approach.</p></speech>

I have read the opening statements and I know that the committee will them very helpful in producing our final report.</p> <p>  I will share some of my own experiences with everyone.  In my role as justice spokesperson for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, many of my colleagues ask me to attend meetings in their constituencies.  I have found these meetings a very insightful experience and a couple of issues have stood out at them.  First, there is still huge confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  People want to see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na succeed notwithstanding the problems in the force in recent years.  Second, a large number of people attend meetings when they are about community policing or rural crime, much more so than any other political issue.  That reflects a genuine concern and interest among the public.  The Garda has a good base upon which to build. </p> <p>  People say the same thing at every meeting I attend.  They want to see more garda&iacute; on the beat and they want more community policing, which is what we are discussing here.  The committee's objective is to see what we can do to give effect to that, how can we make the force more efficient and, primarily, how can we get more garda&iacute; out into the community doing work that is valued by the community.  Every politician in this room goes knocking on doors and meets people.  Most people are not particularly interested in a politician calling to their door but there is a much greater level of appreciation and trust in garda&iacute;.  I would like to see circumstances in which communities would know who their local community garda&iacute; are, in the same way as they know Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in or whoever else is their Deputy in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  Are there ways whereby that can be done?  Maybe there is too much staff turnover in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and people move on too quickly.  I do not know whether the issue has been covered but what are the witnesses' views on having a separate grade of community garda and a separate line of progression for community garda&iacute;?    </p> <p>  Criminality has been greatly enhanced by technology.  Criminals use the Internet to defraud people and to identify whether people are at home.  Similarly, peace minded people and those who want to obey the law can also use technology to fight criminality.  I have seen the Garda work with people on community watch schemes to try to get a whole area covered by a Garda division.  People in these areas may form a WhatsApp group or community alert scheme.  The witnesses may have covered this matter before and I apologise if they have.  Could the committee make any recommendation in our report to improve the situation in this regard?  </p></speech>

We touched on the matter in the sense that the commission is talking about a district policing model where everyone is involved in community policing and outward looking.  We have gone into great detail on that.  We had a chat about whether there should be a community policing unit.  On the basis that we do not know the demand being place on garda&iacute; locally and because there is no clear workforce plan, we did not present figures for community policing.  We were reluctant to do so because, whereas community garda&iacute; account for approximately 10% of the force, we do not want the issue to be put to the side as if it is irrelevant.</p> <p>  We also have a chapter on digital innovation and social media.  One of the things that we have called for is for mobile Apps to be made available to front-line garda&iacute; and for the Garda to ratchet up its social media profile because, in this day and age, there is no reason people should not know their local garda.  There should be regular contact and there are mobile Apps that can facilitate that.  We went into that in some detail in the report.</p></speech>

I noted in my opening statement that in many of the communities in which we are present people can be fearful or mistrusting of the Garda.  The one person that they tend to trust is the community garda because that is the person who visits their youth club and attends community meetings or they have met him or her on some pleasant trip.  People have learned to recognise their community garda as a person, not just someone in a uniform which can be a major barrier for people.</p> <p>  It is important that there is some continuity for communities.  It takes a long time to build up trust with somebody and if there is quick turnover in Garda personnel, the community must start from scratch every time a new community garda is appointed.  For us, building trust takes time.  Whatever supports that can be put in place to ensure community garda&iacute; can be present or visible in the same community over a longer period would be a positive development.</p></speech>

Muintir na T&iacute;re fully agrees with the recommendation that all garda&iacute; should be community focused.  It is important that the community has a face, or two or three, to cover a roster and that they have a contact point with which, as For&oacute;ige has said, they can build up trust.  They attend community alert meetings and youth club meetings and so on, and that is important.</p> <p>  The crime prevention officer is becoming the de facto contact point for the Garda in many areas because he or she is going out to meetings and giving crime prevention advice.  In many cases there is one crime prevention officer for a division which can cover two counties.  Such officers are not contactable.  It is not feasible.  There needs to be a contact point.</p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is woefully behind in technology and that is something everyone accepts.  Muintir na T&iacute;re operates a text alert scheme and it sends out texts on behalf of the Garda.  In many cases, Muintir takes a phone call from a garda on a mobile phone asking it to send out a text because garda&iacute; do not have smartphones or even Internet access in many stations.  Where are we going if we do not even have that as a starting point?</p></speech>

I thank the Chair.  Would there be any value in a voluntary system of central registration, where the Garda or another organisation would maintain a register?  Marking equipment is a sensible precaution but people might sell stuff.  If garda&iacute; go to a market or find someone who is selling ill-gotten goods, it is not necessarily easy to disprove a claim that they were sold to the man or woman selling them.  Would there be a value in a central register where tradespeople or farmers could register expensive equipment?  If they sell it on, they can contact the register or, if it is stolen, they can report that.  When that equipment is found, garda&iacute; can refer to the register and see that the item was registered and then stolen.  Is there sense to a system like that?</p></speech>

There are a number of registers already but the problem is they are disparate and there is no agreed national database.  Muintir na T&iacute;re has looked at this and done a pilot programme on property marking, and we might see if it can be further developed with a database.  There is one in the UK which operates successfully.  The police force is behind it and it is sponsored by an insurance company, which makes sense.  That operates as the de facto national database.  I think it should be looked at.</p></speech>

Everyone has a distinctive postal code that is not being used for much.  Property could be marked with an individual's postal code.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Johnny Connolly from the school of law at the University of Limerick.  He is not the first witness from the university to be here as, in recent weeks, one of his colleagues was also before the committee.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Meally and Ms Canning from For&oacute;ige.  I hope the plug for more funding for For&oacute;ige was picked up on.  The committee has no spending powers so it can do little other than support the witnesses' appeal.</p> <p>  Thanks also to the witnesses from Muintir na T&iacute;re, Mr. Garvey and Mr. Sweeney, for their input to this session.</p> <p>  The committee hopes to launch its report before the end of November.  The committee will let the witnesses know about the launch and, if they are in a position to join, they would all be most welcome back.</p> <p>  I also thank the members for their participation.</p></speech>
