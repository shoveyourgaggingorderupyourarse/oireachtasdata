Apologies have been received from Deputies Mattie McGrath and David Cullinane and Senator Gerard Craughwell.  I remind members to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as it causes interference with the broadcasting service.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>The purpose of the meeting is to consider the final report of the European Union task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and &quot;doing less more efficiently&quot;.  I am delighted we have two of the best scholars on European affairs working in Ireland before the committee.  I welcome Dr. Emmanuelle Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan from University College Cork, UCC, and Professor Gavin Barrett from University College Dublin, UCD, and thank them for taking time out of their busy schedules to attend.</p><p>The committee has considered the issue of how and where decisions are made a number of times.  We also follow with interest the ongoing work of the task force led by the First Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr. Frans Timmermans.  The final report of the task force was published during the summer.  It is helpful that our two guests are present to share their thoughts on the report and to consider issues related to the future of Europe.  I will ask Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan and Professor Barrett to make their initial opening statements, after which members will make comments and ask questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emmanuelle Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018100300002#A00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to share my analysis and views on the European Commission's report by the task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and "doing less more efficiently".  It is a great honour to be asked to do so and I hope I can contribute insightfully to the discussion.</p> <p>  I will first explain how I will structure my talk today.  I will start by briefly recalling the history of the principle of subsidiarity and its mutations since its official enshrining in the Maastricht treaty of 1992.  Such contextualisation is useful in understanding the task force's approach in 2018.  I will then analyse the key points and recommendations made by the task force as well as its shortcomings.</p><p>Finally, I would like to set this report in the broader context of the future of Europe, specifically the future of European democracy.  <br/><br/>Despite having its roots in European political philosophy, the principle of subsidiarity was not used in the context of the European Community until 1986.  It was first mentioned in the Single European Act and only with regard to environmental policy.  It coincided with the increase in the use of majority voting, as opposed to unanimity, and the concern of member states that the European Community was encroaching on their sovereign power.  Therefore, support for the idea of subsidiarity as a tool to assign limits to the growth of the Community's powers grew substantially until it was enshrined in Article 3(b) of the Maastricht treaty.  This article provides that &quot;in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community.&quot;  The Treaty of Lisbon set up the early warning mechanism elevating national parliaments to the position of subsidiarity watchdogs.  However, in nine years, only three of what are known as yellow card procedures were started and no orange procedure has commenced.  This shows the limitations of the process.<br/><br/>Looking back helps us to understand the context for this task force report.  The Maastricht treaty marked the shift from a &quot;permissive consensus to a constraining dissensus&quot;, a description coined by Hooghe and Marks, when it comes to European Union affairs and policies.  The subsidiarity principle was introduced at a time of public contestation over the legitimacy of the European integration project.  Twenty-five years on, the landscape has not changed much except for the fact that this contestation has taken shape in populist political parties whose support is increasing across a significant number of member states.<br/><br/>What are the key points of the report?  It is worth mentioning that the task force was set up in a context of reflection about the future of Europe and the questions of democratic and legitimacy deficits that the European Commission and the European Union as a whole have not yet resolved.  The President of the European Commission set three objectives for the task force, namely, how to better apply the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality with regard to preparation and implementation of legislation; how to better involve the regional and local levels in policymaking; and to identify policies that could be re-delegated to the national level.  Overall, the recommendations are not radical but offer welcome clarification.  In particular, the report acknowledges the shortcomings of the early warning mechanism, EWM, put in place by the Lisbon treaty, which cannot be remedied without a treaty change.  Therefore, it recommends that the Commission interpret flexibly the eight-week deadline for national parliaments to submit their reasoned opinions.  The same flexibility should also apply if a significant number of reasoned opinions that are below the threshold for a yellow card are submitted.  It also recommends a lowering of the yellow card threshold, which would force the Commission to justify more thoroughly its legislative proposals.  The overall tone is for the Commission and the European co-legislators to be more attuned to the national, regional and local levels; to give more visibility to how they use the inputs from regional and national parliaments; and to promote increased co-ordination and information sharing between national and regional parliaments.<br/><br/>As is often the case with the European Commission, it considers that the problem lies in communicating better regarding the effective operation of the principle of subsidiarity.  Beyond a flexible implementation of the principle, the European Commission also recommends a more consistent approach.  The task force's main contribution involves a model assessment grid to be used on subsidiarity and proportionality issues by all European institutions, not only at the start of the legislative process but also during it as well as <i>ex post</i>.  This is what the task force brands &quot;active subsidiarity&quot;, which is grounded in the concept of European added value.  On this aspect, it is interesting to note that the expert the task force called upon, Professor Dougan from the University of Liverpool, specifically cautioned against this idea of &quot;added value&quot;.  He highlighted that the added value to having EU action in cross-border situations would always be positive and render the test pointless, while frustrating national and subnational levels of governance.  However, the idea of translating the subsidiarity principle into European added value is pervasive throughout the entire report as a concept better understood by citizens.<br/><br/>This brings us back to the idea of using subsidiarity as a communication tool to boost the legitimacy of the European Union's actions in the eyes of the citizens.  Dehousse analysed in 1993 that &quot;subsidiarity's direct utility as a legal instrument [was] limited.&quot;  He argued that &quot;its introduction into the treaty should be understood as a strong political message: the Member States are not prepared to accept an unlimited extension of Community competences.&quot;  He nonetheless concluded that regardless of whether subsidiarity was workable legally or an effective tool of allocation of competence, this political message trumped all.  He concluded his article by stating &quot;we are therefore likely to hear more of subsidiarity.&quot;  Here we are, 25 years later, and the search for the European Union's legitimacy and effectiveness in action in the eyes of the citizens remains elusive.<br/><br/>The major shortcoming with the task force report is that it confuses subsidiarity with policy substance.  When the task force claims on page 12 that &quot;national Parliaments have a pivotal role in ensuring conformity with the subsidiarity principle, and they also have a positive contribution to make on the substance of new legislation&quot; it seems to equate both.  However, the entire report is about subsidiarity as a tool of competence allocation, that is, who should act and not in what way they should act.  The report acknowledges that national and regional parliaments' contributions &quot;frequently go beyond subsidiarity issues in their reasoned opinions&quot;, which creates frustration on both sides.  Reasoned opinions on the basis of subsidiarity are the only ones that can create legal consequences.  If the reasoned opinion is not made on that basis, the Commission is legally entitled to ignore the sub-European parliaments.<br/><br/>In 2005, the Commission introduced the Barroso initiative, which can be defined as &quot;a broad political dialogue between the Commission and the national parliaments of the Member States on all aspects of the former's political agenda&quot;.  The major difference with the EWM is that the Barroso initiative opinions can assess any political aspect of a Commission proposal, well beyond subsidiarity issues.  This allows the national or regional parliament to engage in policy preferences and substance, which politicises EU policies and develops their level of ownership at sub-European levels.  This initiative exists at the discretion of the Commission though and could be withdrawn at any time.  It is a shame to see that the Barroso initiative is not investigated in more depth by the task force with a view of enshrining it into the treaties.<br/><br/>Similarly, the idea of a &quot;green card&quot;, which gives parliaments a right to suggest to the Commission that it take action, is pushed aside.  The only small light of hope for significant policy shaping by national and regional parliaments came on page 14 with a suggestion that they and the Commission should exchange more intensely on shaping the Commission's work programme.  If the concept of subsidiarity is to demonstrate European added value in its action while closing the gap with the citizens by decentralising decision-making to the level the closest to the citizen, moving away from a technocratic conception of policy proposal to a more political one would make sense.  However, since it would further challenge the Commission's right of initiative, the task force fell back on a classic, namely, reinforced co-operation and co-ordination among national parliaments.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this report was commissioned in the context of a reflection on the future of Europe.  The task force clearly rejects scenario four on &quot;doing less more efficiently&quot; regarding re-delegating certain policies to the national level.  However, it recommends that existing legislation be reviewed with regard to subsidiarity, proportionality and regulatory density in order to improve effectiveness of implementation of the existing body of law.  As Jani points out, &quot;the report missed an opportunity to highlight the political nature of parliamentary contributions to EU integration.&quot;</p><p>Davor Jani suggests &quot;a periodic balance of competences review... organised across the Union with national and regional parliaments&quot; every four to five years.  I do not consider this a meaningful democratic reform that would engage the public.  However, it is time to change the message and broaden the scope of contribution of regional and national parliaments to European policymaking. <br/><br/>We need to politicise EU policies so that citizens and sub-European parliaments can develop ownership of those policies.  This involves infringing further on the right of initiative of the European Commission.  However, the time has come to realise that European democracy is not working and it goes beyond simply increasing the powers of the European Parliament.  This has been systematic with every treaty change and inversely proportional to the EU average level of turnout in European elections.  It is time for supranational institutions to engage with and carve out space for sub-European parliaments&rsquo; political views on EU policies and EU policy-shaping.  Many significant democratic reforms should be envisaged beyond the very fragile <i>spitzenkandidat </i>implemented in 2014, which I believe was a step in the right direction. <br/><br/>The lack of a visionary approach to the future of Europe is disappointing given the increasing rise of populist parties across the European Union and the risks it poses to the European project.  In his latest State of the Union address, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker mentioned subsidiarity only once, referring to &quot;being big on the big things and small on the small things&quot;, a cheap turn of phrase.  His big example of the use of subsidiarity was clock-changing.  At a time, whether winter or summer, European citizens and their regional and national parliaments are contesting the legitimacy and effectiveness of European action, it seems odd and even condescending to send them back to do some clock work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gavin Barrett" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018100300002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to contribute on this interesting topic.  There will be some overlap with what Professor Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan had to say but a slightly different focus.  I would like to do a little contextualisation, perhaps in a shorter framework as the professor has done so much to outline the overall context of subsidiarity and what it means.</p> <p>  The task force report is an important step along the road to completing the process begun with the March 2017 Commission White Paper on the Future of Europe.  Other steps have been a series of Commission reflection papers on the social dimension of Europe, harnessing globalisation, deepening economic and monetary union, EMU, the future of European defence and the future of EU finances.  The process of reaction to the Commission White Paper is still ongoing.  It did not end with these reflection papers.  It includes the future of Europe debates going on across Europe and this task force report.  The process is intended to end with the European Council in Sibiu, Romania in May 2019 and the European Parliament elections one month later.  It is a time-limited and rapid process.</p> <p>  If the task force report is a response, what is it a response to?  This has been answered to some extent.  In asking what the questions which triggered it are, let us remind ourselves that the Commission put forward five five courses for the future of the Union, namely, carrying on; retreating to doing nothing but the Single Market; letting those who want to do more to do more; doing less more efficiently; and doing more together.  President Juncker put forward a purported sixth option in his State of the Union speech in 2007 but that was just a variant of carrying on, with a lot of emphasis on freedom, equality and the rule of law.</p> <p>  The task force report relates to the fourth option, doing less more efficiently.  I have a habit of reading the end of books before I read the text so I will read a couple of conclusions on the report and then touch on the various recommendations.  First, the group that produced this report was limited.  It was entirely male, and comprised quite senior males.  I am one of those myself so perhaps I should not object too strongly.  The regions were perhaps overrepresented.  There were three members of the committee of the regions on this group and one former member, which gave the committee a majority in producing this report.  That is very much reflected in the report and its emphasis on regional concerns.  Only Troika states were represented.  There was no French or German representative, much less any Irish representative.  It was compiled in a short period.  The task force met only seven times between January and July.  I realise there are other aspects to it, such as a COSAC working group which met Professor Dougan and so on.  There was a certain degree of consultation although that process was largely limited to regional authorities.  It has to be read in that light and it has limitations on that basis.</p> <p>  Interestingly, the task force rejects the idea of doing less more efficiently in the report's conclusion.  Its first conclusion is to recognise the need for more EU action to address emerging challenges where the EU has added value in areas such as security, defence and migration, and intensified EU action on other areas like climate change and innovation.  It is rather like the parish priest standing up and declaring himself an atheist, or an atheist standing up and declaring he has found God.  It is an unusual start for a report on doing less.  There is a great deal of focus on the interests of regions and local authorities.  I do not want to detract from its recommendations in that regard.  They are useful recommendations, but they are a little overdone.  </p> <p>  There is also food for thought for national parliaments.  The idea is "active subsidiarity".  I will come back to what that means.  The idea of using a common assessment grid for assessing subsidiarity is positive and useful.  The third task force recommendation is especially interesting.  There is a good discussion of national parliaments and subsidiarity, but a slightly facile analysis of the number of yellow cards.  Some members of the task force wanted to increase this number by cutting the threshold needed to issue a yellow card, that is, the number of national parliamentary votes.  The number of yellow cards is not necessarily a representation of the success or otherwise of the early warning mechanism.</p> <p>  The task force also calls on the Commission to ensure to always give timely, comprehensive and public responses to reasoned opinions.  We cannot dispute that.  It has not always been done.  Some task force members wanted to hand parliaments a red card veto.  Others feared the consequences of doing this, particularly in the absence of a uniform understanding of what subsidiarity is.  Some members wanted a green card facility that provided for members to propose legislation at European level.  The task force as a whole pulled back from that and just wants national parliaments to co-ordinate themselves a little more.</p> <p>  Some members wanted an extension of the time period for early warnings from eight to 12 weeks.  The committee recommends that change when the opportunity arises, giving it a slightly lukewarm endorsement.  There is a call for more flexibility regarding the eight weeks and the use of a so-called "common grid".  It is true that there has been a variety of approaches to what subsidiarity means, with different parliaments taking different approaches.  The idea of a common grid approach, modelled on a grid used by the committee of the regions and included in the annex to the report, is probably not a bad idea.  The Commission has shown a little discretion on the eight-week period.  For instance, it does not count August as part of the eight weeks, but it does count Christmas holidays and periods when parliaments are in recess for election purposes.  There is room for flexibility.  Perhaps that could also be endorsed.  Some wanted proportionality and issues of competence to be covered by reasoned opinions as well, because parliaments raise these issues and it can be frustrating for them when they do not get any feedback.  However, that did not meet with the overall endorsement of the group.  There is a call for better co-ordination and information-sharing between national parliaments and regional parliaments; a lot of stuff that people can agree on and proposals for reform.</p> <p>  The fourth task force recommendation is also interesting.  It advocates greater involvement in the Commission's annual work programme and the European semester.  There are ideas that could be used to allow national parliaments and committees such as this to play a bigger role in such procedures.</p><p>In September every year, the Commission President delivers his State of the Union address, complements it with a letter of intent which is sent to the presidents of the various institutions and the national parliaments and the Commission work programme follows in October.  The task force wanted more active engagement between the Commission, national parliaments and local and regional authorities between the publication of the letter of intent and the adoption of the Commission work programme.  National parliamentary committees could invite in bodies like those and ask them to voice their concerns or views about the programme.<br/><br/>The economic policies of member states are now co-ordinated at European level in the European semester process.  Some people from the budget office were handing out literature about that in the lobby upstairs as I was coming in.  The Commission has encouraged greater participation in, and ownership of, the so-called country specific recommendations and the task force strongly backed that up.  It wanted the inclusion not only of national administrations but also regional authorities, social partners and civil society generally.  That might be a facility or an opportunity for committees like this, or perhaps other committees within the Oireachtas, to get involved in that process and play a useful role.<br/><br/>Before it made its recommendations, the task force offered five broad conclusions and, in both its recommendations and conclusions, there were a reasonable number that would be of interest to national parliaments.<br/><br/>Looking at the conclusions first, it recognised the need for more EU action, not less - an unusual way to begin a report about doing less, more efficiently.  It recognised the need for more action in some areas and intensified EU action in others.  Second, the task force pronounced it essential to remedy weaknesses in current policy making processes, meaning more involvement of national, regional and local authorities, a better shared understanding of subsidiarity and proportionality and improved participation of national parliaments and regional authorities.  I will come back to what is meant by more active subsidiarity, but there is not a lot to disagree with there.  There were some good ideas.  It proclaimed the need for a better shared understanding of subsidiarity and it noted, with some puzzlement, which I share, that the Amsterdam treaty definition of &quot;subsidiarity&quot; was wiped out of the Lisbon treaty.  I do not know why that happened and it should go straight back in there.  The task force recommendations were based, to a certain extent, on the Amsterdam understanding of subsidiarity.<br/><br/>A fourth conclusion was that EU legislation in some areas is too dense and complex but the conclusions here were nuanced.  The report realised trade-offs are necessary and recommended a Commission process building on the refit simplification process that would take into account subsidiarity and proportionality and other issues.  That would involve going back through all the legislation that has ever been adopted by the Union and checking it for all these issues.  That is a big exercise.  I do not know how useful it would be, but that is what was recommended.  Its fifth and final conclusion was that its findings should not be the end of a process but the beginning of a more active engagement with subsidiarity and proportionality.  There is not much to disagree with there.<br/><br/>It had eight recommendations about active subsidiarity.  I will not go into all of them.  I will mention four of them which concern national parliaments.  It recommended promoting opportunities for national parliaments and local authorities to participate at an early stage to shape new initiatives and signal concerns.  It recommended more effective control by national parliaments, meaning more time for national parliaments in the change from eight weeks to 12 weeks.  Better co-ordination and more information sharing between national parliaments was also recommended.  There are Monday morning meetings in Brussels but the task force wants more than that.  It also wants co-legislators to better reflect national parliament and local authority concerns about subsidiarity and proportionality and more active engagement between national parliaments and other parties to shape the Commission's work programme.  This would mean an enhanced role for national parliaments in shaping the agenda.<br/><br/>The task force had nine recommendations in all and I will touch on them briefly.  The first was that there be a common assessment grid used by EU institutions, national parliaments and everyone involved to assess subsidiarity, proportionality and legal basis issues.  There is not a lot to disagree with there.  One of the problems with subsidiarity has been that different parliaments have taken different views of what subsidiarity actually involves.  The absence of a clear approach to subsidiarity is something we can live without and, if a common grid approach would help, it would be a happy development.<br/><br/>Task force recommendations Nos. 2 and 3 were concerned with more effective subsidiarity control.  The task force recommended certain non-treaty changes that the Commission should apply flexibility regarding the eight-week deadline.  I checked this in Philipp Kiiver's book about subsidiarity because, as far as I could recall, the Commission had shown flexibility but it is true that it does not take Christmas breaks and recesses for elections into account so there is room for more flexibility there.  That must be balanced with efficiency at European level.  I am not sure if there can be as much flexibility shown as they want, but perhaps, for example, taking into account Christmas breaks would be welcome.<br/><br/>The report also recommended a change to the treaty by extending the eight-week period for reasoned opinions to 12 weeks.  One must think about the efficiency of the legislative system at European level, but the feeling among the task force was that eight weeks is too short.  I do not know if the committee has a view in relation to that but it is something worth thinking about.<br/><br/>Recommendation No. 4 addressed better involvement of national, regional and local authorities in policy making, so this is included the annual work programme and European semester recommendations, which I have mentioned.<br/><br/>Recommendation No. 5 was about the Commission's impact assessments.  Impact assessments generally accompany legislative proposals by the Commission and the task force recommended that it ensure they systematically consider their impact on local and regional authorities.  There is significant emphasis on local and regional authorities in the report.<br/><br/>Recommendations Nos. 6 and 7 referenced the legislative procedure at EU level and wanted the European Parliament and the Council to use this subsidiarity and grid proposal.  The report suggested hearings of local and regional authorities.  That made me wonder why there would not be hearings of national parliaments as well.  That is biased in favour of regional authorities.  The idea of taking more seriously and upgrading the level of involvement of national parliaments, particularly in view of the kinds of democratic concerns that we have heard from Professor Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan, is certainly worth thinking about.<br/><br/>I looked at the penultimate task force recommendation, No. 8, which is that the Commission should develop a mechanism to identify and re-evaluate existing legalisation in light of subsidiarity, proportionality and simplification concerns, and the role of local authorities.  All the existing body of legislation, the entire European Union <i>acquis communautaire</i>, should be reviewed.  It sounds like a big exercise.  I doubt if it is worth it, but the existing refit programme has been useful, so perhaps this might also be useful.<br/><br/>The final task force recommendation, No. 9, is limited.  The next Commission should reflect on rebalancing its work in some policy areas towards delivering more effective implementation, rather than initiating new legislation, and it might do this in areas where the existing body of legislation is mature or has recently been substantially revised.  That is certainly not going to set the place on fire with controversy.<br/><br/>The task force noted concerns of national parliaments that delegated Acts and implementing Acts fall outside the early warning mechanism.  At national level, legislation is adopted via the Oireachtas but statutory instruments also do a huge amount.  At European level, there is not just normal European legislation, there are delegated Acts and implementing Acts.  They fall entirely outside the early warning mechanism.  The task force noted the concerns expressed to them by national parliaments.  I presume this happened at COSAC.  The task force did not respond to those concerns but noted that there is a four-week feedback period via the Commission website on the use of such legislation and it encouraged the Commission to be more sparing in its use of delegated legislation.</p><p>We have had similar issues at domestic level, as regards how does one control the use of "sub-legislation", if I can call it that, and how does one reconcile the practical need for such legislation with democratic controls.  We have issues like that here in Ireland.  We have issues like that at European level as well.</p><p> I do not really have any conclusions because I already gave the committee the conclusions at the beginning.  That is it from me.</p></speech>

There is obviously an emphasis on regional structures, which do not exist here to the same extent, and for a long time I have thought that maybe there was an intention on somebody's part somewhere to reduce the national structures to regional level and thereby enhance the central structure.  That remains a danger.  Some countries across Europe have a long history of regional institutions, that were powerful and conflicted, and to some extent still are, and we need to keep that in mind.</p> <p>  When we look at what is required, I believe for my sins that the European unelected institutions have a difficult job to do.  They should be able to interpret the concerns and the wishes, some of which are in conflict as well, of the national institutions and be able to bring them together in a way that is acceptable to all.  It does not always happen that way.  For example, if one does not have a national attitude in a particular country that in some way encompasses the European general attitude to a particular issue at any one time, everybody will go off on their own particular trail doing their own thing to the detriment of the European institution and, eventually, there will be fragmentation.  There are some signs across Europe of individuality, re-nationalisation and, potentially, destructive fragmentation beginning to show.  I note the importance of the national parliaments.  The further one goes down the food chain, the more likely one will get conflicting issues and conflicting opinions, and more controversial opinions, and I would strongly urge that we be careful about doing something like that.</p> <p>  The report does not address the issue of re-nationalisation.  It does not really say anything about it at all.  There is merely a passing reference made to the 1930s.  The point at issue now is the future of Europe, how we run it and how national parliaments recognise that we can either be together or be apart.  There are indications in some quarters, particularly in one area, as one country is leaving.  That is not a good sign.  Sadly, there may be fault on both sides.  That being the case, the institutions must examine that and its importance and they need to respond to it in some way, shape or form.  Otherwise, we will end up in a very difficult situation.  The exit of Britain might not be the last.  If that happens, then the whole European Union concept of being together, of supporting each other and of shared sovereignty, will go down the river and be gone and then we will have the emergence of a different Europe.</p> <p>  I do not want to go on because other speakers want to participate as well but right across the globe at present, there is the emergence of nationalism.  It is not a good development.  We should have learned the lessons of history.  It is a dangerous development.  Neither is it good to overreact to it.  The European and national institutions right across Europe need to be aware of its existence, to be able to plan in such a way as to show a clear advantage in following the cohesive approach favoured by the founding fathers of modern Europe and to stay on that path because moving away from it involves nothing but serious problems for the people of Europe, the individual member states and the European project in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018100300002#E00400"><p>I enjoyed both presentations.  I never thought I would say that when it comes to an issue such as subsidiarity.  Subsidiarity is a term that has plagued my fascination with the European institutions for the past 13 years.  I have been to so many events where someone would get up and start talking about it and one would see the room collectively go to sleep.  I accept it is a key tenet of what the European Union is about but it is something that is so poorly explained and means different things to so many different people.  I would be quite happily to put both our guests on the road to go around and talk about it, if people are still willing to listen to the term.</p> <p>  There are a couple of issues they both brought up and I will merge them together rather than ask individual questions or make points.  First, as a former member of the Committee of the Regions, I will defend it heartily.  However, I fully take the point.  Indeed, when I saw the picture of who was there, at least two of them lead my group in the Committee of the Regions and therefore I cannot be too mean, as I might need their votes in the congress in Helsinki soon.  What I wanted to point out is it kind of sums up - I suppose it goes to the first presentation - the difficulty in defining European democracy.  I mentioned outside to Professor Barrett that when I sat on the Committee of the Regions, I was there as a part-time county councillor from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown who flew over on Ryanair, to my right was the president of the Lombardy region with approximately 15 staff and to my left was the mayor of Salzburg.  It shows the difference in what democracy means in each member state.  We talk about the federal system in Germany and the importance of local and regional government.  It is so much more important.  Much of that plays into the history of the member states in question but also their electoral system.  We are starting on the adventure of directly elected mayors - regrettably, not in Dublin just yet.  How will that feed in?</p> <p>  It comes back, I suppose, to the electoral systems and how to explain the single transferable vote, PR-STV, system to every other member state bar Malta.  It is different.  Then we get into the political system as a whole.  There is the presidential system in France as compared with the parliamentary system here.  There is the question of how the Chancellor of Germany is actually elected and, of course, and crucially, as brought up by Dr. Emmanuelle Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan, the fragility of the Spitzenkandidat system as a whole.  I remember distinctly in the 2014 local elections Mr. Martin Schulz coming over here.  There are no members from the Labour Party here at present but I give them credit for trying to drum up a bit of interest in it.  Mr. Schulz managed to get two column inches.  However, there is a certain special adviser to one of the Ministers who was on team Juncker, which was the campaign team, and he said going around Europe there was an absolute buy-in.  As I mentioned Helsinki, we go to the EPP congress to choose the EPP Spitzenkandidat and yet there is already this background noise that it does not matter who is chosen and depending on where we are at, the European Council might just throw this away.  Something that was raised in the second Lisbon referendum here was the importance of a directly elected European Commission president.  Many on the Continent would argue that a Spitzenkandidat is a directly elected European Commission president.  Try to say that to Irish people, who are currently going through the joys of a presidential election, and it is difficult to get that common idea of European democracy.</p> <p>  When one looks at the specifics of the recommendation, "Doing Less, More Efficiently" - indeed, there was mention of the President of the European Commission, Mr. Juncker's comment on it in the previous state of the Union address and one looks at the visionary versus practical - one must ask over the past 15 years how much of the work of the European Commission, and, indeed, the European project as a whole, has been visionary and how much of it has been reactionary.  We go from the financial crisis into the migrant refugee crisis and the delights of Brexit.  We are constantly reacting.</p> <p>  I must give credit to the French President, Mr. Emmanuel Macron.  I did not necessarily agree with the vast majority of his speech, but it was heartening to see him speak about a vision for Europe for nearly two hours last year.  That is something that has not happened, arguably since Delors.  How do we take that argument over?  It is important that my colleague mentioned the rise of populism and nascent nationalism across the continent.  It is a question of how one counters that.  Certain politicians are better at doing that than others.  Then one has the guise of other politicians who ten years ago were the most enthusiastic of pro-Europeans and were talking about how European integration would solve all the ills of their country in the post-communist era, and now they are blatantly and flagrantly in breach of European law, in my opinion.</p><p>How do we start the development of the European project?  In Rome last year there was a number of very interesting speeches and proposals about the next 60 years.  We all remember what started it all, namely, the European Coal and Steel Community, but the vast majority of my friends and colleagues do not remember.  Did the European Coal and Steel Community really envisage subsidiarity becoming the key issue?  Did it think of a future Europe in which there were five options?  I suppose it is always going to be reactionary and needs to be as the world changes, but there is a case for putting out a core development, and that must be pulled back from the specific policies that so many of the local and regional representatives fed into it.  One could ask how far we can reach.  The migrant crisis will end at some stage, or at least the refugee crisis in Syria will end at some stage, but it might not be today or tomorrow or even for a decade.</p><p> Professor Barrett focused on having more time and information for domestic European affairs committees.  Again harking back to the Committee of the Regions, the scope for interparliamentary engagement on a European level is not what it should be.  I do not think domestic parliamentarians take the level of interest in European affairs they merit, based on the significant opportunities the Commission has for initiating legislation, looking at the COREPER process and how elected representatives can feed into it and not just the permanent government.  Something is lacking in the sense that we go to the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for European Affairs, COSAC, once every six months if we are lucky.  Only three to five people go on a delegation.  I have not been at the last two because they did not suit.  There need to be opportunities not just to attend interesting seminars on key topics but one must also get used to meeting people.  Meeting members of the European affairs committee in Poland or Estonia once every six months is not enough.  In the austerity era people would baulk at the idea of anyone travelling.  I challenge anyone to say how spending three nights in Brussels in the Radisson RED hotel is somehow a jolly.  It is not.  There is hard work to be done there and long hours are required.  We need to be prepared to defend that.</p><p> One of the very interesting things about the ongoing malaise that is Brexit is that we are seeing the positive result of taking the show on the road.  One cannot conduct inter-European relations from one's home capital.  The fact that the Government has had more than 2,000 meetings with its peers in other member states and the European institutions is quite obvious.  It is shown in the level of solidarity that we have got.  If we are truly going to buy into 60 more years of the European project, we need to be prepared and not just to go to Brussels or Strasbourg.  One of the most interesting things I found out was not at a plenary in Brussels but at a civics meeting in Brindisi.  It was about Calais.  We are talking about migration, which was the dominant issue because it was local authorities that were literally picking people up off the beaches or who were managing "The Jungle" camp in Calais.  The situation is completely alien to us sitting on this very windy, wet rock.  I wish the best of luck to anyone to tries to swim to Ireland or a take a boat from Libya.  It is just not possible.  This level of discourse needs to happen.</p><p> Possibly for us as politicians the difficulty is taking all the excellent contributions the witnesses have made and the report of the task force, which is a good one, and making it more relevant to the people.  That is our job.  We are the conduit between the population at large and the institutions of Government.  It is not a very easy thing to do.  One of the things mentioned by Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan is that the Commission always talks about communication being key.  I do not necessarily think the Commission needs to communicate more, I think it needs to be less balanced.  I think it needs to sell Europe a bit more.  The Commission spent 20 years paying Nigel Farage to tell everyone how bad it is, to blatantly lie about the role of the European Commission when it comes to straight or bendy bananas or air pillows in cereals when he was talking about something else.  It was good to hear the comments by Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, following the collapse of the bridge in Italy.  The collapse of the bridge was horrible and I am very sympathetic to those affected but it is about time Europe stood up for itself, and it is about time domestic politicians and Heads of Government stood up for Europe as well.  It is very easy to blame Brussels or other state actors and that is what gifts the rise of far-right populism on the Continent and far-left populism in this country because it gives them an opportunity.</p><p> On a completely separate note, I pay credit to Tony Dodd, who moved on from this committee.  He is enjoying his first meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He was an excellent help to me and all other members and I would just like to put it on the record.  I again thank the witnesses for their contributions. </p></speech>

It was a very interesting and constructive contribution.  I thank both witnesses for their presentations.  This committee is examining the future of Europe generally.  We have had various witnesses before us in recent months.  I thank the witnesses for the work they have done on the task force and for their constructive criticism.  As a committee we must consider the report of the task force and make our views known in due course to the Commission.  It is a debate well worth having.</p> <p>  Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan referred to populist political parties being on the rise in the European Union.  She also referred to the democratic and legitimacy deficits.  They are the two big issues.  She hit the nail on the head in that regard and we must consider those issues.</p> <p>  Previous speakers, perhaps predictably given that we are in the national Parliament and we are national parliamentarians, spoke about the role of national parliaments, but I wish to extend the discussion a little.  I recall that after the defeat of some of the referendums here in Ireland on the various treaties, there was a big discussion about what the national Parliament could do to bring Europe closer to the citizens.  One reform was that prior to a European Council meeting the Taoiseach must come into the D&aacute;il and outline what he intends to do at the meeting and then he must report back to the D&aacute;il in the following week on what took place.  That has been a very good initiative and there have been other initiatives in terms of scrutinising legislation.  I wish to ask a broad question and the witnesses should feel free to answer honestly.  How are we doing as a national Parliament in terms of scrutinising European legislation and communicating Europe to citizens?  Are there one or two more things they think we as a national Parliament could be doing to improve the democratic and legitimacy deficits?  Do they have any suggestions to make to us and could we be doing more?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018100300002#F00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for their very interesting contributions.  I will follow up on some of the comments made by Senator Richmond.  Subsidiarity is at the heart of it.  The problem the European Union faces is that in its original form, namely, the European Coal and Steel Community, one had effectively a group of nations with a very similar background and socioeconomic situation that wanted to come together and that had structures in place in terms of their own parliamentary democracies to enable that to happen.  They fashioned a Europe that really fitted with where they stood.  We then got to the point where the European Union expanded following the end of the Cold War, where there was a very sustained expansion of the Union to try to consolidate the view of what would become Europe.  The problem then was the combination of an economic recession and the way in which politics works.  Everybody sat back and took their foot off the accelerator and a situation was allowed to develop where we now have within the European Union a wide, disparate group of countries, some of which have almost no interconnectivity at all, apart from the fact that they have membership of the European Union.  Some of them view subsidiarity as a way to address that.</p><p>It is quite interesting.  This report highlights that subsidiarity is most popular among regional and local administrations which, ironically, want to disentangle themselves from the federal state they are in so they can be more closely aligned to a super-federal state.  That says a lot about the way in which they view subsidiarity or the way in which, in a longer-term situation, subsidiarity will become an issue for them.</p><p> In terms of the reform process, Europe needs to do two things.  First, it needs to more clearly try to define and lock in what it is as an institution.  Connectivity with the people is important but I think we sometimes get a big hung up on this.  I lived for a period in the United States and most people in Albany, New York, cared most what happened in Albany and did not give a monkey's about what was happening in Washington D.C. because that is what directly impacts on their life.  We have to be realistic.  As long as the EU is a confederation of member states, most citizens are going to be more interested in what their national governments are doing in terms of what directly impacts on their lives.  What Europe has missed a trick on is that because it has a problem defining what it is, it then has a problem selling what it is to the people of Europe.  One of the greatest ironies of the whole Brexit situation is that it is only when a country's citizenry was facing down the barrel of the gun of losing what it means to be European that we saw a discussion on European issues and values taking place, and more discussion probably took place in the UK than in any of the other 27 member states.</p><p> I am very much in agreement with much of what Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan stated.  The heart of it, I believe, is that subsidiarity goes more towards the member state than the region.  However, it has to be hinged off with regard to the definition of what is the future of Europe.  The latter is the key question.  This must be in terms not just of a Europe with benefits but a Europe that looks at this and says, "If you do go off the rails and you do decide to disavow the common value, there is a consequence."  So far, we have been too scared to go down that route.  The process that was launched in recent days will take so many years to complete that half of us sitting in this room will not even be alive to see the end of it.  That is not a process for dealing with a problem within the European Union.</p></speech>

It is a matter of grave concern to ourselves, looking back and looking forward, especially in light of recent political events and the way things work between the European, national and local levels.  There is the question of how decisions are to be made and how we are to be the policy makers of the future, whether that is at the European, national or local level.  There are so many things to be taken into consideration and such work, including what the witnesses are doing, is very much to be appreciated.</p> <p>  I particularly appreciate the school visits programme with its question-and-answer sessions, which is very important.  I have been going to schools since 1999, not just colleges and secondary schools but national schools also, and I place great significance on this.  Young people take a great interest.  If we give time to young people, they will give time to listening and asking questions.  Sometimes the questions asked in a national school can be very thought provoking and are a reflection of what parents are saying at home.  It is a very important function and I would encourage everybody to engage in this.  The problem all of us have is time but, whether one is an elected representative or an official in a Department, it is my view that if one gives to young people, it will pay dividends in the future.  The young are the really important during these schools visits because they are the policymakers, officials and politicians of the future.  It is also they who will be creating jobs.  Great significance should be attached to giving them information to consider.</p> <p>  Does Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan agree with the task force that there are no policy areas which should be re-delegated, or are there are policy areas that she thinks should, could or would be re-delegated?  I invite Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan to respond.  While I do not want to rush her, we would appreciate it if she could condense her responses a little.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emmanuel Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018100300002#G00300"><p>I will go in reverse and try to cover as many of the questions as possible.  On the Chairman's question on policy areas that could be re-delegated to the national level, this links up with a few of the points made regarding the purpose of the European Union or the question of what is the European Union.  I will share my opinion.  The EU proves its added value, which the task force report mentions quite a bit.  I agree with the task force report that there is no area that should be re-delegated.  I agree with what Emmanuel Macron mentioned last September, namely, national sovereignty is not effective any more and we should think of European sovereignty and this idea of shared sovereignty that was at the heart of the European Coal and Steel Community.  I very much agree with those positions.  This does not mean that the national parliaments and the sub-national levels do not have a role in policy shaping and policy-making, but it means we can be effective at the European level much more than at the national level.</p> <p>  This is also because of how the EU has developed.  We discovered, as the economic recession hit us, that we needed to act together and that acting individually was not going to work.  On this idea of re-delegating, I know Dr. Barrett thought it odd that the Commission would automatically put forward, almost at the start, this idea to the effect that it was not going to re-delegate, even though it was looking at doing less more efficiently.  I do not think it is odd.  It fits perfectly with the decade of reports put out by the Commission.  It protects its turf and I would have been extremely surprised if it was the opposite way.  Therefore, I was not surprised.  They did not even pretend they were going to envisage re-delegation.</p></speech>

They just said, "Potentially, on the implementation front, we might look at implementing a bit more subsidiarity, but that is it."</p> <p>  I will discuss the school programme at the end because it is something I am involved in.  Deputy Brophy mentioned that the EU needs to lock in what it is within the context of the debate on the future of Europe and what the EU is aspiring to be.  Again, I think this fits back to what Senator Richmond was pointing towards with reference to the speech given by Emmanuel Macron at the Sorbonne last September, which was extremely rich in terms of ideas and of visions for the future of the EU.  However, he pronounced it three days before Angela Merkel discovered that she would not have a majority and, therefore, he did not get the backing of a strong German Government to try to implement the reforms he laid out.  His idea focuses on European sovereignty and asks that we would build a Europe which breaks away from what we have at the moment through a series of concentric circles.  In terms of the five scenarios laid out by Jean-Claude Juncker, Macron is looking at doing more, but only certain of us will do more at the start.  In other words, the centre circle of the concentric circles will move towards further integration, and then the second circle and the third circle.</p><p>This is why he mentioned the UK, though not in the context of Brexit.  He did not actually utter the word "Brexit".  He mentioned the UK and I think his intention was to have the UK sitting in the third circle.</p></speech>

Fundamentally, that is one of the biggest worries for Europe.  As someone who is pro-European and who believes in the concept of a developed European sovereignty in conjunction with the idea of member states, mine is not a Franco-German vision.  Chancellor Merkel is now in a position whereby she is restrained in terms of what she can say.  When we heard President Macron or Chancellor Merkel in the past, however, a large selection of colleagues did not hear a European vision being described.  They heard a Franco-German position that was almost harking back to the old days and saying we must do it their way or take the high road.  That is one of the huge risks facing Europe.  They do not see the newer, broader EU, or maybe they just do not want to see it.</p></speech>

Macron is very much pitching the European campaign now along the lines of him together with Merkel pushing for a more integrated Europe on certain issues like defence and fiscal integration to develop the economic and monetary union, versus Orb&aacute;n, Kasinsky, Babi&scaron;, Salvini and Conte in Italy and so on.  I understand what the Deputy is saying.  When I did my interviews at the European Commission in 2015, all I heard was that there was a strong feeling in member states that the European Commission is German, that it is a German Commission offering German solutions to the economic recession and no other country has a voice.  We need them to have those visions offered by politicians.</p> <p>  Senator Richmond is not here.  Will I still answer the question he posed?</p></speech>

I would agree but at the same time, at national level, domestic politicians do not do that.  I have heard it in Ireland and France many times.  During the economic crisis, I heard plenty of extreme criticism of the European Commission which I think, quite honestly, went overboard.  In France, it was exactly the same.  The European semester involved France offering further structural reforms.  They were required but the French finance Minister absolutely rejected them and stated that France is a sovereign country, when actually it is signed up to the European semester.  We are meant to implement those rules yet we have one of the biggest countries, and a founding member state, contradicting them publicly through its finance Minister.  That is not the right way.</p> <p>  In terms of the Commission being less balanced, I totally agree but I do think domestic politicians have a big role to play, not only in fighting for Europe but in educating the citizens as well.  This brings me to the schools programme that the Chairman mentioned.  I was financed by the European Commission to develop a schools programme at primary level.  The blue star programme currently in place is not child friendly or teacher friendly, in my opinion.  Teachers are interested in Brexit and can hear what is happening, but have no knowledge and do not know how to go about devising their lesson plans and so on.  I have devised the programme with a primary school teacher and, as the Chairman mentioned, I have piloted it in three schools.  My role is not to defend the European Union.  My role, as an academic and a teacher, is to educate.  I put out to them and we discussed the positives, the negatives, Brexit, Northern Ireland, and these kids are six, seven, 11 and 12 years old.  It is amazing what questioning comes from them.  I would say it is not from the parents because the parents know very little about the European Union in general.  It is interesting to see their reasoning.  Domestic politicians have a duty to educate citizens when it comes to understanding the role of the European Commission.  In the Brexit debate, we heard claims that the European Commission imposes decisions on us.  The European Commission does not do that; it makes proposals that are decided by the MEPs and the Council.  That is a task which falls to domestic politicians.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Haughey's point on how we are doing in terms of communicating Europe, and what this national Parliament can do, I was saying over lunch that I came to Dublin three or four years ago on Europe Day and I was shocked not to see the EU flag flying above the D&aacute;il.  Those are symbols that can trigger the European citizens' interest and make them wonder what is happening.  Nobody knows about Europe Day or, by extension, about the different aspects of Ireland's engagement with the Union and so on.  On that point, this national Parliament could do a lot better through symbolic actions but also through communication with the citizens.</p> <p>  There was a question about the 2004 enlargement.  The Deputy was saying that up until the 2004 enlargement, there were quite similar members in the European Union and that the enlargement brought in a different group of countries.  However, the economic crisis only hit older member states.  Let us imagine the 2004 enlargement had not happened.  The economic crisis would have hit Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, Italy, exactly the same way, and the migration crisis would have just hit the borders closer to Italy, etc.  I am not exactly sure why-----</p></speech>

We had a headlong rush to bring in member states, to lock them into a European way of thinking and get them operating through institutions.  Unfortunately, because that integration process was not really developed, when governments in those have states changed, they have shown a fairly healthy disregard for how member states should behave in terms of judicial independence, monetary policy and the separation between central banks, parliaments and the executives.  I was really referring to that aspect of it.  There is a risk that some of the older member states could also drift off with the election of populist parties.  When the French finance Minister states that his country is not going to observe a rule, there is very little consequence.  If a smaller member state says that, there is a feeling that there seem to be much greater consequences.</p><p>However, there are far greater consequences for a smaller member state which makes such a statement.  The European Union did not work hard enough to bed in some of the democratic institutions in the newer member states such that they would be sufficiently strong to withstand what we are now seeing and trying to deal with.</p></speech>

The rhetoric at the time was that we had a duty to bring them in.  There was also a race towards NATO membership.  The countries joined NATO before they joined the European Union, but the events were in close proximity and there was some rivalry between the two international organisations.  The countries were brought in too quickly, having regard to the need for compliance with the Copenhagen criteria set out in 1993.  It is clear that they were brought in as a political message.  Thereafter, we tried to play catch-up and now find ourselves in the current position.  I am not sure that is the reason for populism developing to such an extent in those countries, but they have not yet developed a strong attachment to European Union values.  The Deputy mentioned that there should be consequences, but the consequences have not been sufficiently strong or timely.</p></speech>

Durkan expressed concerns about the evenness of the consultation process.  I agree that a certain amount was due to the speed with which the task force had to report.  Of course, the European Parliament refused to participate in the exercise because it was led by the Commission, which detracted from the membership.  I have mentioned the deficiencies in gender balance, regional representation and so on which affected the report and led to an over-emphasis on regional questions.  It reminds me a little of the Amsterdam treaty which was supposed to provide for the enlargement of the European Union but which ended up dealing with justice and home affairs questions which needed to be addressed.  It did a great job in reforming these areas, but it did not do what it was supposed to do, namely, to prepare the institutions for enlargement, which is why the Nice treaty was needed.  This report does a great job in telling us how we should involve regional and local authorities, but subsidiarity and other issues remain to be addressed.</p> <p>  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan's point about fragmentation is well taken.  The danger of fragmentation has never been greater.  Curiously, Brexit is doing wonders for the avoidance of fragmentation as it has scared the living daylights out of all members of the European Union, apart from the United Kingdom.  It is probably part of the reason the approval rate in Ireland for the European Union is 92%.</p> <p>  Solving the insoluble problem of democratic participation will be key.  Obviously, as Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan indicated, increasing the powers of the European Parliament only will not be enough.  A range of reforms are needed.  The Lisbon treaty was a good start in beginning to empower national parliaments, but many other things need to be done.  Rather like curing cancer, there is not one answer but a series of answers.</p> <p>  Senator Neale Richmond referred to the European Committee of the Regions.  Differences between its members have crippled the committee and explain why it has not been more empowered.  With all due respect to county councils in Ireland, Irish councillors sit on the committee alongside the President of the Bavarian Government who thinks his role and area are more important than Ireland because Bavaria has a bigger population.  It is very difficult to make such an institution or body work.  It is almost impossible to cure the problem of democratic representation at a European level, but we must do so because there is no alternative.</p> <p>  I take the Senator's point about parliamentarians having to travel abroad in order to get their job done.  One thing I hate about media coverage of parliamentarians is the league tables of how much money each spends on travel, as if those who spend the most money are the worst parliamentarians.  Frequent travel is often necessary to enable them to do their jobs and those who travel the most are sometimes the best parliamentarians.  We need a more mature attitude to the issue on the part of some in the media. </p> <p>  Senator Neale Richmond also raised the issue of how to make the report more relevant.  It could be used as a fund of ideas.  For instance, the proposal regarding national parliaments doing something about the Commission's work programme or the European semester could be taken up by the Houses of the Oireachtas or Oireachtas committees which could call witnesses and hold hearings on the European semester each year.  The same could be done on the work programme, on which the views of groups worth hearing on the issue such as social groups, trade unions and so on could be canvassed.  All such groups have a view on the Commission's work programme and, in particular, the European semester and budget.  The proposal might be worth pursuing.</p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey asked for a review of how we were doing.  Am I allowed to advertise?  The Deputy should purchase my book which has just been published by Manchester University Press.</p></speech>

I will synopsise it.  </p> <p>  On how we are doing, Ireland used to be categorised fairly as a slow adapter, but that has changed and we have improved during the years.  That improvement has been aided by various measures such as the reforms introduced and legislation passed after the rejection of the Nice treaty.  That treaty and its subsidiarity reforms led to much reform in Ireland and elsewhere through which parliaments received more powers.  However, some restrictions apply to the Irish Parliament.  Under the electoral system, members will not be rewarded electorally for the excellent work being done by this committee.  Under the system of proportional representation with a single transferable vote, constituency work is always better rewarded than committee work.  However, the work done by this committee and others is of vital importance.</p> <p>  On what could be done, there could be greater involvement on matters such as the Commission's work programme and the European semester.  A greater effort could be put into trying to influence things at European level.  Getting in early enough to do so is vital.  Brexit is of great importance.  There should be more discussion of how well prepared people are for a no-deal Brexit which we might be facing.  Are we prepared for such an eventuality in terms of customs?  How well prepared are the farming industry and employers?  It would be very useful for representatives of such groups to be brought before an Oireachtas committee to communicate their concerns and views in that regard.  I acknowledge that a certain amount of work has been done in that regard, but perhaps more could be done.</p> <p>  Like every other parliament, the Oireachtas must decide on what it wishes to concentrate.  Dr. Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan mentioned the political dialogue with the Commission.  Does the Parliament wish to participate in it?  It may think it is not worth its while.  Some of the most active parliaments such as that in Denmark and the Eduskunta in Finland do not participate because they have decided to concentrate their energies elsewhere.  Every parliament must decide for itself.  Each has limited resources and must decide what it most wants to do.  Some thought should be given to the areas on which the Oireachtas should concentrate.</p> <p>  I am somewhat concerned by the relative lack of control over Ministers in deciding things in the European Union.  As members are aware, we do not have a scrutiny reserve system such as that in place in the United Kingdom or a mandate system such as that in place in Denmark and Finland.  The general result is that Irish Ministers operate on a very long leash, with very little parliamentary scrutiny.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee, reports to the Oireachtas on some Council meetings, as has been the practice for a succession of Parliaments, but the Oireachtas has no control over decisions made at many other Council meetings.  I do not know what the solution is to that problem because there is little pressure exerted by the Legislature or the Executive to introduce a scrutiny reserve system.  Certain committees have recommended its introduction, but it has never been done.  I understand the motivation behind it, but it results in one of the primary tasks of national parliaments - controlling the Executive, in particular on what happens at Council meetings - not being carried out.  There is further detail on that issue in my book.</p> <p>  Deputy Colm Brophy raised concerns about central and eastern European countries.  Unfortunately, there has been less leverage over them since they joined the European Union.</p><p>I am not sure it was possible to hold them out for longer than they were.  They needed to be brought into NATO and the European Union quickly; therefore, there was a political imperative in that regard.  It came with certain disadvantages and risks which we are seeing coming to fulfilment in the way described by the Deputy.  We need to work out ways, of which perhaps funding is one, whereby we can get around the fact that the rule of law mechanisms in Article 7 of the treaty are manifestly inadequate, principally owing to the voting systems in place.  There is no doubt that something must be done desperately.  Perhaps funding is one of the ways whereby it might be done.</p><p> The Chairman asked about areas that could be redelegated.  I was glad when Professor Sch&ouml;n-Quinlivan spoke first because it gave me a few minutes to think about it, but I have not succeeded in coming up with any area that should be redelegated.  However, there are certain areas where the density of regulation must be reconsidered, for example, banking regulation.  There was too little regulation of banking matters at European level before the crisis, but we probably have too much now.  There is overlapping regulation, with a series of requirements that at this stage would frighten someone, if he or she was the legal adviser to a bank.  There are certain areas where less density is badly needed.  We must also examine how legislation is implemented.  A relative of mine who is a farmer received a letter on one occasion telling him how much nitrogen his cattle were allowed to produce.  It was set out in detail.  It implemented a directive at European level, but that is not how one implements such a directive; therefore, that issue must be examined.  Another matter that must be examined is implementation by statutory instruments.  Vast quantities of European regulations are implemented here via statutory instrument and we are still not controlling it properly.  We have to think of a mechanism for doing so.  I do not have much advice to offer on redelegation, but there are certainly many other things we could consider.</p></speech>

In retrospect, we say the European Union enlarged too soon.  Let us consider, however, the situation 20 years ago or so and the reunification of Germany.  What were the options?  Should it have been left hanging loose, floating alone in that region?  Should the other countries adjacent to the western Balkans have been left to swing around by themselves, floating in what were very volatile circumstances?  Where would they have gone?  I am strongly of the view that there were no other options.  However, the vision has changed and it is no longer what it was.  The emphasis was on togetherness.  We were all in this together, sharing with each other and a positive contribution to make, but that is gone.  Each member state now seems to be more introverted.  The European Union is becoming introverted.  That should not be the case.  Unless each member state reflects the vision of the European Union, there is no sense in having it because it will not work.  We should list this item for debate on another day and invite our guests to attend.  I foresee a massive disaster if things go wrong.  There is no other option.</p></speech>

I said I supported the view that the European Union should have enlarged quickly, but the issue is what happened next.  The foot was taken off the accelerator in embedding the process after the countries in question were brought into the European Union.  Much of the work that was done in bringing them in was not followed through and we allowed them to hang there.  Twenty years later we saw the implications.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise them that any opening statements given to the committee may be published on the committee's website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call the Minister to make his opening contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to discuss the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am pleased to be joined by Ms Laura Magahy,  who was recently appointed as executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.  She was appointed following a comprehensive recruitment process and brings a wealth of experience to the role.  I formally welcome her to the position and assure her of my full support in this challenging but exciting role.  She took up the post officially on 1 September and has hit the ground running since then.  I will ask her to outline her immediate plans for implementation and progress to date shortly.</p> <p>  Just as the Government and I value the cross-party support that produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report, we recognise that the same support and cross-party co-operation will be required to successfully deliver the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  Every party and grouping in the Oireachtas, bar perhaps one, has said that it is in favour of Sl&aacute;intecare and the implementation thereof.  We need to all work together now to make that a reality.  As I have said to this committee previously, we will only  succeed in bringing about change if everyone, including politicians, clinicians, patients, service users and others, is united on the overall goal and we are all pulling in the same direction.</p> <p>  The publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy in August marked another important step in this process.  The strategy provides an implementation framework for the transformation process and it outlines 106 specific actions that will be taken over the next three years, which are the first three years of the strategy.  I firmly believe that this process is different from others that came before it because this is not my plan and it is not just the Government&rsquo;s plan; this is the long-term plan, everyone's plan and the only plan.  Change of this magnitude cannot be delivered overnight and it is important that we acknowledge this is a strategy that will take time to implement.  The publication of the strategy was an important step, but this is a process that will have many steps over its lifetime.  We have also paid particular attention to getting the implementation governance and structures right, which was rightly important to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  In the past, this has been lacking.  We have had many strategies previously and the lack of an implementation structure has often caused challenges.  I will return to this later.</p> <p>  We are committing to the development of detailed action plans each year and we will measure our progress transparently with twice-yearly progress reports.  This is a new departure in health reform and we are trying to use a model that has been used in the Action Plan for Jobs, for example, where we will not just say that we will do something but we say that we will do it and then report against it.  Every six months, we will publish a progress report to show what we said we would do, who we said would do it, to check if it is done and if so that is great but if it is not why is it not done.  That transparency in reform is something that has been lacking in our health service over many years and it is a focus that I hope we can bring to it.  </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report will be delivered over a 10-year period and, at its core, it will do a number of things.  It will move our system to a population-based approach of healthcare planning and delivery.  This will involve the development of a citizen care master plan for the health service, which will inform service planning, resource allocation, workforce planning and policy prioritisation.  This is important because, in the past, we have tried to develop the health service to suit the health service.  It was the system for the system but what we are trying to do now is find out what services our citizens need, what is the citizens care master plan and  then put the structures in around that rather than the other way around.  Informed by this framework, new models of care will be designed that are structured, coherent and tailored to population need.  It will continue the focus on promoting the health and well-being of our population through the implementation of Healthy Ireland, the framework for improved health and well-being.  A priority action is the publication of the Healthy Ireland outcome framework this year.</p> <p>  A significant part of Sl&aacute;intecare will be the focus on bringing the majority of care into the community.  This will require a much stronger system of community care, with increased resources and an expansion in the range of services that are available.  The initial focus will be on developing capacity to manage chronic disease in the community, development of community intervention teams, which we have made some progress on by increasing investment in, and access to, community-based diagnostic facilities and the development of community nursing services.  We will also move towards a health service where care is provided on the basis of need and not on the ability to pay.  This ambition must be planned carefully and introduced over a period that is appropriate in terms of making sure we have the workforce and the investment in place.  If we get the sequencing of this wrong, all we will do is end up rationing care in the community rather than ensuring that people can access it.  Progress is being made in extending entitlement, including providing medical cards to those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, and GP visit cards to those in receipt of carer's allowance.  The Government has also committed to the introduction of a statutory scheme for home care to support people to live in their own homes.  It is my intention that this scheme will be operational within this first three-year period of the strategy under discussion today.</p> <p>  Under Sl&aacute;intecare, we will move our system from long hospital waiting times to a timely service, especially for those who need it. There is no single solution to this but additional bed capacity both in hospitals and the community is a big part of it, along with investing further in home care services, multi-annual plans for reducing waiting times and considering how best to introduce a waiting time guarantee.  One development that I believe will be significant, which is mentioned in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, is the development of elective hospitals.  We have funding to deliver three elective hospitals with one each in Galway, Cork and Dublin.</p> <p>  I had the opportunity to visit Golden Jubilee Hospital in Scotland just last week with Ms Magahy to see exactly how an elective-only hospital was developed.  The good news is that the hospital administrators have managed to significantly reduce their waiting lists.  When the hospital first opened, people were waiting three years for a hip or a knee replacement but that is down to 12 weeks while people were waiting two or two and a half years for cataract surgery but that is down to an average of four weeks.  We must move on with the development of our elective facilities.  We have seen that it has worked in Scotland and we now need to reproduce that model here.  We will pick the sites for these three hospitals next year.  Our focus is always on driving down waiting lists and ensuring patients can have access to services as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare will also bring about improved governance, performance and accountability, which is something that this committee spends a lot of time talking about and scrutinising for very good reason.  This will be achieved through the establishment of a HSE board, defining new organisational and operational structures for the future reconfiguration of the health services.  The HSE board legislation will be introduced in the Seanad on 10 October and I hope to pass it through both Houses of the Oireachtas this year with everyone's co-operation so that it can take effect at the beginning of next year.  I was pleased to announce Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane as chair-designate of the new board.  He brings a wealth of experience to what will be a challenging role and I look forward to him having an opportunity to come before the committee to be scrutinised on his views and plans for that role.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the importance of implementation governance and structures and I would like to briefly outline a number of key elements.  There is widespread agreement that significant change and reform requires a well resourced programme office to champion, lead and manage the process.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended the establishment of such an office and a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office has now been established.  It will be led by Ms Magahy and it is being resourced with the skills and expertise necessary to lead the reform programme.  The programme office is, as I said in August, working on a detailed action plan which will be published before the end of the year.  This will include a review of all the actions and associated timeframes, the development of detailed milestones and, crucially, the assignment of responsibility for each action.  In the Sl&aacute;intecare report produced by the committee, it asked that when we published the plan, it would then be reviewed by the executive director.  That is the process we are undertaking and it will be published by the end of the year.</p><p>There are two other structures which I wish to draw to the committee's attention.  The first is the Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council.  It is important that we get the stakeholders and ask experts here to help us out in the delivery of this plan because it cannot be something merely owned in the Oireachtas or in the HSE.  I am eager that an advisory council would be in place.  I am delighted that it will be chaired by Professor Tom Keane, an eminent clinician and clinical leader, who came to our country and worked with my predecessors and previous Governments to reform our cancer services, and we are seeing the benefit of those outcomes today.  I am delighted that he has agreed to lend his services to Ireland again.<br/><br/>Professor Keane will chair the advisory council.  It will comprise 23 members.  I am pleased to be in a position to announce the membership of the council.  For the record of the committee, the membership is: Professor Tom Keane, the former director of the national cancer control programme; Ms Laura Magahy, executive director; Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly, consultant geriatrician; Dr. Anthony O'Connor, consultant gastroenterologist; Professor Patrick Broe, general surgeon in Beaumont Hospital and clinical director in the RCSI group; Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer of the HSE; Ms Annette Kennedy, president of the International Council of Nurses; Dr. Ronan Fawsitt, a GP in Kilkenny who has done excellent work in the development of primary care; Ms Gillian O&rsquo;Brien, director of clinical governance at Jigsaw; Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy, an incredible patient advocate with a wealth of experience in this area; Mr. Brendan Courtney, a patient advocate who shone a spotlight on the importance of getting home care and looking after our older citizens' rights in this country; Ms Sarah O'Connor, CEO of the Asthma Society; Mr. Brian Fitzgerald, former CEO of St. James's Hospital and deputy CEO of the Beacon Hospital; Mr. Liam Doran, former general secretary of the INMO; Mr. Leo Kearns, CEO of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI; Dr. Josep Figueras, who, I believe, appeared before the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and is a director of the European observatory; Ms Joanne Shear, former national primary care clinical programme manager at the US Veterans Health Administration; Dr. Heather Shearer, clinical governance expert; Dr. Eddie Molloy, management consultant; Mr. Paul Reid, CEO of Fingal County Council, who brings a wealth of experience in change management; Professor Mary Higgins, obstetrician, National Maternity Hospital; Dr. Anna McHugh, GP registrar, Donegal; and Dr. Emily O'Conor, president of the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine and a consultant in emergency medicine at Connolly hospital.  The committee is almost gender balanced, with a split of 12 to 13.  There are a wide range of skill sets, from a patient advocacy point of view, from a change management point of view and, importantly, from a medical point of view.  I thank those people for stepping up and serving, and offering us their wealth of experience.  The first meeting of the advisory council will take place, and be chaired by Professor Keane, on 24 October.  I hope this committee will at some point have an opportunity to engage with him on his role and how he envisages the advisory council helping us deliver it.<br/><br/>The second structure is the high-level delivery board.  This will comprise the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform and Health, the director general of the HSE and the Sl&aacute;intecare executive director.  This is important.  The Committee on the Future of Healthcare stated that it wanted a whole-of-government approach to this and having a high-level delivery board that the executive director can feed in to and that can then feed in to the Cabinet Committee on Health, chaired by the Taoiseach, is crucial.  Having in the room the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Health and Public Expenditure and Reform is important and very much in line with the committee's strong recommendation on the need for cross-government support.<br/><br/>We have begun progressing a number of recommendations.  We moved ahead with the establishment of the HSE board.  That legislation will commence in the Seanad next week and I would appreciate co-operation on that.<br/><br/>Crucially, we have carried out a public consultation on the geo-alignment of hospital groups and community healthcare organisations.  This has been completed and I will publish the results shortly.  I want to move ahead with outlining what geo-alignment will look like this year and I will need the committee's support on this.  Drawing lines on maps is never the easiest exercise for any politician to do.  The Sl&aacute;intecare committee helpfully left it to my Department to work out how best to divide up the country, but what the committee was keen on, and what I am keen on, is that we move away from this siloed approach that there are duplicate management structures for community care and hospital care.  If we are to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, we need geo-alignment.  We need a singular budget for a certain part of the country to deliver the whole spectrum of care.  That is what we need to get to.<br/><br/>I have taken the decision, in consultation with Ms Magahy, to move forward on that at a quicker pace than originally envisaged and I intend to announce my proposed geo-alignment this year.  This is the potential game-changer that the committee wants to see in terms of Sl&aacute;intecare because one can no longer have siloed budgets with somebody saying that patient X needs to remain in the hospital because it will cost him or her to care for that patient in the community or <i>vice versa</i>.  One budget with a board for each regional entity holding people to account at a regional level is an important way.  It will help deliver integrated care.  However, if we are to legislate for this, I will need cross-party support to deliver this.  I would be happy to discuss with the committee the public consultation document in advance of that or to send that to the committee so that it could consider it.  I would very much welcome, in the spirit of bipartisanship, the committee's consultation.<br/><br/>The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was also clear on the role of private practice in public hospitals.  Let me be clear, because sometimes I hear myself described by my opponents wrongly in this regard, I am in favour of the removal of private practice from public hospitals but, like the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, I am in favour of doing so in an intelligent, phased way.  I have made my views on this quite clear.  Our current mixed model system is an outlier.  We cannot convince ourselves it is the norm.  It is not the norm.  It is an outlier that one can have a public hospital full to capacity and a patient who is in greater need of care not getting that care because somebody is carrying out private practice in that hospital.  We cannot stand over that, but we also have to do it right and we cannot do it overnight.  The committee asked me to set up an independent review group to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system.  I have done that and it is being chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir.  The work is ongoing and I expect to receive that report by the end of this year or shortly thereafter.  This will provide valuable guidance and I would welcome an opportunity to discuss with this committee.  However, my policy objective is clear.  I believe we need to remove private practice from public hospitals but we need to do it in a way that makes sense.<br/><br/>I will briefly refer to the role general practice needs to play in this.  We cannot deliver a decisive shift to primary care or community care and more services if we do not resource general practice.  The committee will be pleased to hear that I have reached agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on significant multi-annual funding for general practice and I expect intensive engagement to commence on this matter in the next few weeks.<br/><br/>Finally, I have mentioned capacity.  The health service, even when one implements reforms, does not have adequate bed capacity.  We do not compare favourably internationally in this regard.  The Government's national development plan, NDP, commits &euro;10.9 billion, much of which is directed at Sl&aacute;intecare.  This will include 2,600 additional beds, the elective hospitals I mentioned and 4,500 community care beds that have been identified.  It will also include the roll-out of eHealth, which is so important and which was a key recommendation of Sl&aacute;intecare, and putting diagnostics into our primary care centres.  There are 124 primary care centres in operation throughout the country.  The key now is what more can they do.  Can we put more X-ray facilities, more ultrasound facilities and more staff into these facilities?  I am pleased that the development plan will deliver that.<br/><br/>I am confident that the plan that many members in this room worked so hard on and engaged on for such a long period of time is the right plan and that if we implement it, we will very much be on the right track.  We agreed on a vision and we now have an implementation strategy.  We have dedicated staff, led by Ms Magahy, to deliver and implement this strategy.  We will report twice a year.  We will publish detailed annual action plans and resource this through the budgetary process as well.  This will require a broad coalition of support and I look forward to working with all stakeholders on the important agenda.<br/><br/>With the Chairman's permission, I will ask Ms Magahy to say a few words.</p></speech>

I very much look forward to working with all of them over the next number of years to deliver on the Sl&aacute;intecare objectives and on the principles outlined in the original Oireachtas report.</p> <p>  The robustness of the Sl&aacute;intecare structure gives a sound underpinning and I suppose I am the little circle in the middle.  The implementation office is in the middle and will be supported by the advice from the advisory council, which I very much welcome, reporting through to the other structures that the Minister has outlined.  I believe it gives a strong link back through to the system, and down and out to the people who are delivering the services.</p> <p>  The remit of the programme office is to establish the programme of reform to develop a strategic and programmatic approach to implementation working with all parts of the system to ensure that everybody is following the strategy and to work collaboratively with all the stakeholders, support the work of colleagues in their reform efforts and report progress.  I am keen not to duplicate any effort that is under way and, therefore, I proposing to have a small tight office, which then connects to the people who are doing the work, and to have a strong focus on implementation.</p><p>I am mindful that everyone here has a part to play in the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Key to its delivery is continuing political buy-in and the leadership that was shown by the cross-party Oireachtas committee.  That support is very important to me while the implementation process is going on, and I look forward to working with the members of this committee.  I hope to continue to have their support.  I am very happy to meet the members individually if they would like more details on what I am proposing.  I encourage them to get involved in the process.</p><p> Citizen engagement and empowerment is key, and I am beginning a programme to that end before the end of this year.  It is essential that there is buy-in to this process.  Enabling those on the front line who are delivering services is also key, and also the wider determinants.  We tend to focus on the HSE and those structures, but we need to involve the wider determinants for prevention purposes, in particular, for the health and well-being of people.  It is something that I am going to be focusing on.  We will take a partnership approach. </p><p> I have been in office for 23 days, so I am very new to the role-----</p></speech>

The office was established, and I am now engaged in beginning discussions with people about what is important to them and identifying their priorities.  Key to my job is to come back before the end of December with an action plan for 2019 setting out who is doing what, where, when and how.  That is what I am focused on.  There are 106 actions in this strategy, and I am intent on delivering within the set time limits.  The advisory council has been established and it is meeting for the first time in October.  I have finalised my approach to the citizen care master plan, and the citizen engagement and empowerment process will roll out before the end of the year.  The budget is under discussion at the moment.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet it.  I look forward to working with it.</p></speech>

Every member will have seven minutes to interact across the floor.  We would appreciate it if members could be concise with their questions, and perhaps the Minister would be concise with his answers so that we can move along speedily.</p> <p>  Why was the Sl&aacute;intecare office not set up in the Department of the Taoiseach rather than in the Department of Health, as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report?  Given the nature of building in Ireland, particularly the building of hospital beds, when does the Minister expect the first new hospital bed to be built and available?  I understand that most of the capital resources are going into the completion of the children's hospital at the moment, which will not be completed until 2021 or 2022.</p> <p>  Why is there no reference whatsoever in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy to the setting up of a national health fund, which was a central component of the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations on how this would be funded going into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#G00500"><p>The question as to whether the office should reside in the Department of Health or the Department of the Taoiseach was discussed at this committee, and I made my views very clear on that at the time.  The Minister for Health is accountable to the Oireachtas for the delivery of the health service under Sl&aacute;intecare, subject to the health Acts and the powers and functions of the HSE.  The Minister for Health is also accountable democratically in terms of answering parliamentary questions, Topical Issue debates, Private Member's motions and legislation.  To hive off responsibility for reform of the health service from the Minister for Health of the day would have been a very peculiar construct, in my view, and the view of the Government, taking into account the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  We made sure there was a structure in place to try to achieve the same objective.  I flagged that with the Sl&aacute;intecare committee in advance of publication and at this committee post publication.  People can agree or disagree that we have achieved that, but it is what we endeavoured to do.  Ensuring that there is a high-level delivery board involving the three secretaries general of the crucial Departments - the Department of the Taoiseach, representing the Taoiseach of the day, the Department of Health, representing me, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of resourcing - is the way to go.  The Taoiseach will chair the Cabinet committee on health, and the Sl&aacute;intecare office, including Ms Magahy and me, will account to the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  The question about beds is very valid.  I can assure the Chair that I ask that question several times a week.  I asked the HSE to produce a document detailing the number of beds it could deliver over the next three years using a combination of modular build, existing space in hospitals and a degree of internal reconfiguration to make more space or to use space more efficiently within hospitals, and it has responded, stating that it could deliver around 600 hospital beds.  I can send the Chair a detailed note, because I do not have the exact details to hand, but the answer to the question asked is that over the next three years approximately 600 of the 2,600 beds can be delivered.  A big chunk of those beds will be delivered towards the latter half of 2019.  The Chair is familiar with Limerick, geographically and medically.  Delivery of modular builds would create 60 beds for University Hospital Limerick.  I am very committed to doing that, and I have discussed it with the CEO of the hospital group.  That is an example of the delivery of the first tranche of 600 beds.</p> <p>  It was decided, when we published the implementation plan, not to make any decisions that are matters for the budget outside of the normal budgetary cycle.  However, we will require an integration fund for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  There is a lot of funding in the Department of Health already, and any extra funding through the budget will be Sl&aacute;intecare-proofed.  Almost &euro;11 billion has been allocated in the capital plan.  My analysis of the plan suggests that &euro;6.6 billion of that is for Sl&aacute;intecare, whether through elective-only, diagnostics in the community, bed capacity in the community hospitals or eHealth.  Above and beyond that, I have to empower Ms Magahy and her team to deal with the large-scale roll-out of projects to take services from the acute hospitals into the community.  The Sl&aacute;intecare advisory council will assist in that.  The Sligo eye care model is one that people often talk about.  It has been piloted for so long that everyone accepts that it works.  At what point can we roll it out?  In Deputy Kelly's constituency there is the Nenagh cataract theatre.  If it works in Nenagh, we should be able to roll it out nationally.  We know that community intervention teams, CIT, work, and they should also be rolled out nationally.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare recommended that funding would be allocated to the plan annually, providing between &euro;306.85 million to &euro;450 million to cover the expansion of entitlements and a &euro;3 million transition fund to make up for the lack of infrastructure over recent years.  However, in the implementation strategy there is no reference to funding whatsoever.  A reference is made to an integration fund, but no value is put on that fund.</p></speech>

When the implementation plan was launched in August, I made the point that the Government has decided that the resourcing of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is something in which all political parties have a role to play in a minority Government, is a matter for the Estimates process.  The budget is next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#G01000"><p>I welcome the Minister, and I wish Ms Magahy the best of luck.  She has taken on a Herculean task.  Fianna F&aacute;il has signed up to Sl&aacute;intecare.  It helped to write it and would like to see it implemented.</p> <p>  Healthcare reform is difficult and complex and regularly fails in different jurisdictions around the world.  One of the things it requires is credibility of leadership, and I am worried by parts of the statement the Minister has made.  Understandably, he is looking to the future, but there is no reflection on the problems we have at the minute.  Since 2011, healthcare spending has gone up every year, per person and when adjusted for inflation, and yet waiting times across the board for men, women and children all over Ireland are worse than ever.</p><p>For the third year in a row there has been a massive budgetary overrun and it is fair to say that clinicians all over the country are at their wits' end.  </p><p> I will focus on waiting times because the issue affects patients the most.  Children with special needs are waiting three and half years for treatment.  Young children with scoliosis are waiting three years for treatment.  In the rest of Europe spinal curvature is not allowed to exceed an angle of 45 degrees but in Ireland the limit is 100 degrees.  For the first time ever, the number of people on waiting lists has exceeded 1 million.  When one adds the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, figure to all the other figures, the number totals 1 million people, which has never happened before.  In spite of annual increases in funding, the position is worsening.  Let us take the number of people waiting for surgery for more than a year.  In 2010, that figure was slightly more than 700 people but now stands at 14,000.  For every one person in Ireland who was waiting over a year for surgery in 2010, there are now 20.  This goes to the heart of credibility.</p><p> My real fear is that the responsibility for fixing these failures is now being put on Sl&aacute;intecare.  The presentation lists seven Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.  I will not read them all but I put it to the Minister that four of them should have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare as they are the job of government.  Promoting the health of our population is normal healthcare.  Moving our system from long waiting times to a timely service has nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare and is the job of the Government.  Waiting times were falling drastically and were 20 times lower in 2010 than they are now in certain areas.  Accountability and performance is also the normal job of healthcare management.  I am concerned that there is a lack of acknowledgement of just how bad things have become in healthcare for patients and clinicians.  Sl&aacute;intecare is being given the role of system reconfiguration and moving to a more modern model of care.  That is its responsibility but I am concerned that Sl&aacute;intecare is being tasked with fixing the problems that are the normal job of Government to fix, for example, waiting times and avoiding significant budgetary overruns every year.</p><p> In the spirit of trying to get this right, does the Minister accept the failures in the healthcare system today, particularly in terms of waiting lists which are longer than they have been since records began?  Does he agree that in order to implement a very serious and ambitious programme of change, we will need much more competence in delivery by Government based on what patients are facing every day?  How does he plan to provide that competence given that what we are facing and what we have all signed up to is a complex, difficult and important programme of change?  </p></speech>

I do not know if the Minister can respond in three minutes. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#H00300"><p>I will do my very best.  I thank Deputy Donnelly.  Certainly, when I look to reform I will definitely look to the future and I will not the past.  The way that people have endeavoured to reform the health service has created many of the current problems.  The establishment of a national entity, an idea most political parties agreed with, was botched.  As a result, we have layers of bureaucracy that often make it impossible for citizens to find answers.  I welcome the cross-party approach to how we should reform the health service in a way that is very much better than the reforms that have gone before.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly listed a number of objectives which he claimed have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.  They are very much in the programme, as the Deputy knows.  Sl&aacute;intecare deals extensively with the issues I raised in connection with waiting lists and calls on me to address them.  What I am doing is accounting to this committee today for my intention to do that.  </p> <p>  I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that everything in healthcare has worsened.  It depends on what one measures.  For starters, let us talk about waiting lists.  Some of the figures now published on waiting lists were not published before the Government took office.  Outpatient figures were not published before 2014.  When speaking about current figures the Deputy is not comparing like with like.  There are challenges in terms of waiting lists.  In line with a commitment agreed by Deputy Donnelly's party and my party in the confidence and supply agreement, the number of people waiting for inpatient day-case treatment has fallen by 13,000.</p> <p>  Outpatient services are a major challenge.  One of the main ways to address the issue is through the Sl&aacute;intecare model by identifying who can be seen locally in the primary care centre by a general practitioner or an advanced nurse practitioner.  Many of the metrics are much better than previously.  I do not suggest the Deputy did this but blaming Government policy for all of the failures in the health service and crediting everything but Government policy and investment for everything that is good in it does not stand up to scrutiny.  Children with cystic fibrosis will, thank God, live an awful lot longer than they would have done heretofore.  That is as a result of great clinicians but also the significant investment we have made in drugs such as Orkambi.  The same applies to outcomes for cancer, stroke, heart conditions and life expectancy.  While having one person on a trolley is one too many, the HSE TrolleyGAR number fell by 5% in September.</p> <p>  I accept that there is a substantial body of work to do and very many challenges in healthcare.  However, I do not accept that everything in healthcare is in crisis because every single day many people have a positive experience.  We surveyed patients who stayed at least one night in an acute adult hospital last year.  When we asked how they found their experience from the moment they walked into the emergency department to the moment they were discharged, 86% of respondents indicated their experience was good or very good.  However, I need to be worried every moment of every day about the 14% who did not have a good experience.  If we are to address that issue, we need to implement Sl&aacute;intecare. </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare plan has credibility because it has something we have never had before in healthcare.  First, all of us support it but, more important than the political support for the plan, it has a decent chance of being given the time it will need to function.  In case Deputy Donnelly is ever appointed Minister for Health, I should point out that what people in the health service despair about is another new Minister arriving with a bright shiny plan.  We now have one plan and we are all pulling in the same direction.  It will require resources.  To answer the Deputy's question on delivering Sl&aacute;intecare and accountability for its delivery, as the Minister for Health, I am accountable for delivering it.  Ms Magahy is charged with running the Sl&aacute;intecare office but I am accountable to the Oireachtas for the delivery of this plan.  If we publish an action plan at the end of this year and say we will do this, that and the other and report against that every six months, I will be accountable to the Deputy and he people of Ireland for achieving those commitments. </p></speech>

My concern is that Sl&aacute;intecare will be tasked with solving problems such as waiting lists.  We do not need Sl&aacute;intecare to reduce waiting lists, promote the health of the population, drive accountability and performance or deliver a healthcare system that has the ability to plan and execute.  We need Sl&aacute;intecare for reconfiguration.  Reducing waiting lists and helping the men, women and children on those lists have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Most of these problems have worsened in recent years.</p> <p>  How much money will the Minister seek explicitly for Sl&aacute;intecare activities over the next one to five years, as opposed to the normal expected increases in healthcare expenditure that we would expect to see?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#H00500"><p>I urge the Minister to reply in one minute, if possible.</p></speech>

While I take the Deputy's point, I do not agree that Sl&aacute;intecare is not the key to addressing many of these challenges, including waiting lists.  Delivering what Sl&aacute;intecare calls on me to deliver is key.</p> <p>  With one week to go before the budget, I cannot answer the Deputy's question on how much I am seeking, or perhaps his party is seeking, in the budget for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I can give one example of multi-annual expenditure.  Of almost &euro;11 billion provided for capital expenditure, &euro;6.6 billion is what I would describe as Sl&aacute;intecare funding for the delivery of its capital elements.  The current expenditure elements will be a matter for budget day next week and the HSE service plan thereafter.  I will be happy to continue our interaction on the Deputy's questions later.</p></speech>

There is an awful lot riding on the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.</p> <p>  I listened to the previous exchange on which Government made the biggest mistakes in the health service.  We could play that game all day but it probably will not advance the discussion.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has measured trolley waits for a long time and its figures do not always concur with the figures produced by the HSE's TrolleyGAR.  The INMO figures show the position is getting worse.</p><p>Will the Minister confirm that the overspend and the carrying over of recurring expenses will be addressed in the budget?  We talk about investment but months after the previous budget the Minister received a letter from the head of the HSE saying that it was in trouble as a result of underfunding.  Deputy Pearse Doherty pointed that out to the Minister but he did not listen.  Maybe he listened this year, and I hope that he did.  Will he confirm that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#J00300"><p>On the transition of services to primary care, much of our primary care is centred around GPs.  I have seen no evidence that any progress has been made on the renegotiation of the GP contract.  Will the Minster update us on where that process has reached?  I have repeatedly asked questions about staffing for primary care centres, and each time I receive the same answer.  It is a real cut and paste job which says services will be provided from within existing resources.  I can even quote it from memory.  There are no new staff.  If the Minister has a vision for how this will work without staff, I would love to hear it.  I doubt he does, however, so we must hear about where the staff are going to come from and, specifically, what the Minister will do in regard to GPs.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare provides that there will be legislation for entitlement for all residents to access health and social care and a guarantee on waiting lists underpinned by legislation.  The implementation plan has changed that slightly and uses the words "expand eligibility on a phased basis to move towards universal healthcare".  If it is universal, then we do not have to discuss eligibility.  There seems to be some contradiction.  There has also been some slippage with the universality but also the legislation to underpin guaranteed waiting times.  I echo the previous comments.  It is very much bound up with the waiting lists, because it is a mechanism, but the waiting lists must also be addressed separately.</p> <p>  Will the costings that the Department of Health will use in the implementation strategy be published along with the implementation report?  It is important that we see that and that we see real progress.  No one wants this to be merely a tick-box exercise.</p></speech>

On the overspend, as my colleague, the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure said, possibly at a Committee on Budgetary Oversight meeting last week, he and I are actively engaging in addressing what will be a requirement for supplementary funding for the health service this year.  I am very confident that we can reach agreement on that.  That issue will crystalise and I expect that it would be resolved in the next few days.</p> <p>  I would need to come back for a separate session on overspend versus value for money because I could use almost my seven minutes on that.  There is a need for accountability on the resources that are given and a need to ensure that we have an adequate budget each and every year within the resources available.</p> <p>  On GPs, as I said in my opening statement, in recent days I reached an agreement with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform which gives me a mandate to engage with GPs on a multi-annual investment programme.  It is a very substantial programme, both as the subject of negotiations and the budget, so I cannot be more specific.  That said, I genuinely expect very intensive engagement in coming weeks with GPs and I expect to be in a position to be able to increase significantly the investment in general practice starting next year, subject to agreement.</p> <p>  The Deputy, to be fair to her, regularly raises the issue of the staffing of primary care centres.  I will see if we can get the Deputy some specific information on this.  When I open primary care centres, I am regularly told about the additional staff working there and the additional specialties being undertaken.  I will try to get Deputy O'Reilly a note and will be happy to come back and debate that with her.</p></speech>

There may be new staff moving in from other areas, say in Balbriggan, where they closed the health centre and moved them into the new health centre, but that does not represent additional staff for a town with the fastest growing population in the State.  That is only shifting staff around.  No new services can be developed just because someone is taken out of a building that is derelict and put them into one that is shiny.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#J00600"><p>I take that point.  I would point out, however, that there were extra occupational therapy posts this year, extra speech and language therapy posts recently, and more than 140 assistant psychology posts.  I will ask Ms Magahy to do some work on that.  I also ask her to speak about how we will plan for the workforce for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

It is around the needs of the population, and that is what the geoalignment will facilitate.  It will need a combination of approaches based on whatever the needs are.  We will talk to the different training bodies about training extra GPs and practice nurses, for example, training advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, and community nurses, and cross-training for multidisciplinary team approaches, and about trying to get that in the colleges at an early stage rather than everyone being trained in their own specific area and then being expected to work in a multidisciplinary way later, by miracle.  There is also clinical managerial training.  We are starting to engage younger professionals and enlisting their views, because of the disaffection that many have expressed about working in the system, to hear what they have to say.  It will have to follow the model of care and what that will look like when we start to move types of work which are taking place in the hospitals into the community.</p></speech>

It is in the Sl&aacute;intecare report but it is not in the implementation plan.  I am conscious of time and do not want to eat into others&rsquo; time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#J00900"><p>This is something I and Ms Magahy have discussed in recent days.  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly on the word "entitlement" rather than eligibility and we will revert to using entitlement.  The idea is that every citizen in this country should be entitled to access care in their community.  We want universal entitlement and universal access to primary care.</p> <p>  The second thing is important, and is outlined in actions in section 6.2 of the 106 actions that we published.  Sl&aacute;intecare does say that it should be low cost or no cost.  That is a direct phrase in the report, and Sl&aacute;intecare refers specifically to that.  Actions 6.2.1 to 6.2.3, inclusive, outline three very specific actions that we will undertake in establishing the framework and developing the roadmap for achieving universal access, both of which will start next year.  That is still the position.</p> <p>  We are committed to guaranteed waiting times.  The implementation plan is committed to doing that.</p></speech>

I will come back with the specific number in one moment.  However, I do want to legislate for waiting times.  I spoke to the Scottish health minister about this last Friday.  I want to do it and make sure that we can deliver them.  The elective-only model was how they did it in Scotland.  We have given a commitment to picking three sites next year for the delivery of elective-only hospitals.  I want to see if we can move ahead more quickly with one of these so that we have a demonstrated project, and then we can legislate for the waiting times.  However, I need to ensure that the capacity is there before legislating for the waiting times.  I will return to the Deputy in a moment about where this is written.</p> <p>  Did the Deputy ask me another question?</p></speech>

The first is directly for Ms Magahy and relates to her.  I do not know how many people in this room were involved in writing the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  To be fair to the Minister, the specific structures put in place - the advisory council, where it fits within Government, structures and everything like that - are those for which we asked.</p><p>What is the programme office going to have as its own resources?  Ms Magahy referred to a small team earlier on; what is it?  Within those structures there is no doubt that there will be frustrations from time to time, dare I say some of them with the man sitting beside Ms Magahy or whoever is in his role.  How is she going to deal with them?  How is she going to ensure she can get traction within the structures that have been put in place when she is missing deadlines, timelines are not being put in place, and resources are not available?  There will be absolutely an element of that.  How is she going to use those structures and what is she going to do to ensure that she is getting what she wants when she wants it?  </p><p> On the 106 actions, there is the whole area of the first number of years and prioritisation.  For instance, one of the biggest priorities, which I insisted on, was bringing forward community care, all the issues in respect of home help and the whole range of stuff there, which is common sense, as well as bringing forward diagnostics because it is creating blockages all over the place.  I know she is only in her role 25 days, but could Ms Magahy use that as an example in her answer as to how the programme office is going to interact within the structures to make it achievable within the three-year timeframe?</p><p> My next question is for the Minister and concerns the hospital capacity review and its implementation.  I think I must thank him for his news, as he more or less said the 60-bed unit in Limerick is to be part of the plan he is going to announce.  I appreciate that he has confirmed that.  With Clonmel and Limerick on either side of me, I get the benefit of having the two worst situations as regards accident and emergency departments and people on trolleys in the whole country.  On the actual capacity, I presume there will be some process whereby the alignment of this work with the alignment of Sl&aacute;intecare is going to be engineered because that is critical.</p><p> The Minister might outline a little bit more - best of luck with this one, I mean that in jest - the whole issue of geo-alignment.  He said he had timelines for that, what are they?  Again I agree with him that it has to be brought forward.  I do not think Ms Magahy's work can progress until that alignment happens.</p><p> When will the report from the committee of Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir be available in respect of public-private?  The Minister made a statement about GP contracts, I presume in respect of multiple annual funding.  Senator Swanick will probably have questions on this.  We all know the level of progress is not what it should be.  Is the Minister saying that since he has got this agreement now, he is going to see progress moving at a different pace imminently?</p></speech>

This is just work in progress.  The first is around the citizen care master plan, so I will need population health planning expertise as part of my team but will also be working out in the system with people who have that expertise.  In terms of co-ordination, governance and value for money, which is my second work stream, I will need finance and governance advice coming into my team.  My third work stream is about teams of the future and I have talked a little bit about that; obviously, I will need workforce planning expertise.  Finally, I have the sharing progress work stream which is about communications and engagement.  Through those, we have some service design people, some project managers, critically.  I will also need input from different people at different points in time, for example with an economics background or whichever pieces are needed at the time.  Between now and the end of the year, I am working out how the action plan is going to be structured and what my team is going to be in-house.  I am going to keep it tight because there is expertise out in the system and I am proposing that the office is a kind of bridge out to the system just to make sure everything is co-ordinated and happening in the right sequence.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

What is she going to do?</p></speech>

Being serious, one cannot do something unless one knows one has the right resources behind it.  I will not be promising that I can deliver something unless I have the right resources.  I will not know I have the right resources for the next number of months.  To be fair, until the end of the year, when I have worked out what the priorities are, which I have committed to doing and which I will do, it is hard to predict exactly what they will require.  The things the Deputy outlined in terms of bringing the community care closer and making sure it works properly is definitely and the other things he outlined, the home help, diagnostics and so on, are absolutely priorities.  If the whole system is going to work, that has to be a first focus.</p></speech>

The Deputy has highlighted it here many times.  They are working very hard at hospital level to develop and deliver on a modular proposal.  My understanding is that they sought planning permission and that there may be a further appeal there.  That information is subject to correction; I just read it somewhere.  Subject to that being rectified, I want to see this progress urgently.</p></speech>

I want to thank the hospital group CEO.  She put a lot of work into it and ploughed on with it as well, which was very important for being ready.  In Clonmel, the 40-bed modular is progressing.  My understanding is that it is due to open very early in the new year.  I will confirm that with the Deputy.  I hope to be in a position to visit it shortly.</p> <p>  On geo-alignment, what the Deputy said is 100% correct.  If the idea of Sl&aacute;intecare is to reduce bureaucracy, increase accountability and move more services locally where appropriate to do so, we need to have regional entities with joined-up thinking and a continuum of care for the patient.  Until we grasp that nettle, we cannot move forward much further.  That is why we have taken a decision and there are a number of actions.  The first strategic action is to consult and finalise decisions on the geographic alignment of hospital groups and community healthcare organisations by the end of this year.  I will announce by the end of this year what I would like to be the regional entities; ultimately, it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to legislate.  In 2019, in another specific action, we will introduce modifications to the hospital groups and community health organisations to ensure geographic alignment and will begin to develop processes for integrated performance management on an interim administrative basis.  We will let them bed in and test.  We will start in 2019 to devolve decision making.  We have done this already with the hospital groups.  We will devolve decision making and autonomy in line with their functionality.  The action plan states that in 2021 we will legislate for these revised structures but, if I am to be very honest, if there was a willingness in the Oireachtas to legislate a little bit earlier I would be very open to doing that as well.  I would like to do it quickly.</p> <p>  The other action on the alignment piece is for next year and is a really important one.  As well as doing this, it is also envisaged to define the new organisational operation structure in terms of what the new slimmed-down HSE will do over time and what the Department of Health will do over time, the Department in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare and the HSE in the context of new regional entities.  There are five specific actions there on geo-alignment all taking place by the end of next year.</p> <p>  On Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir's group, publicly he has stated that he will have his work completed by the end of this year.  I would hope to receive that report by the end of this year or very early next year.  It is going to be a very important piece of work.  As the Deputy knows, there are many vested interests arguing as to why we should not do this.  There are many people whom the Deputy and I represent who need us to get it right.  We need to get it right on a phased basis and in an appropriate way.  I will be very much influenced by the work of that expert group which includes a lot of really good expertise.</p> <p>  On the GP contract, put bluntly, yes, I expect to be in a position to see progress if there is willingness on both sides, which I really think there is but it takes two sides to negotiate.  I have a mandate now from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and from my own Department in terms of policy objectives being aligned with the funding stream.</p></speech>

I especially welcome Ms Magahy and wish her well with what will not be an easy task.  If there is anything I can do personally, my door will always be open to her.  Well done to everybody involved in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Much hard work went into the plan.  It is fantastic that health is now above politics and, through Sl&aacute;intecare, it will remain that way and we will all be on the same hymn sheet.  Other Departments should take note and act accordingly.</p> <p>  I apologise if I repeat any of the questions asked by other members.  I had to step out to meet some farmers who travelled from west Cork.  The Minister said the Sl&aacute;intecare programme will move the health system to a population-based approach.  Will he elaborate on that statement?  He stated "new models of care will be designed that are structured, coherent and tailored to population need."  When does he expect this to occur?  Could it not have been started already?</p> <p>  The Minister also stated the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare will require a stronger system of community care.  Has a decision been taken on what that system will be?</p> <p>  The Minister emphasises that Sl&aacute;intecare will be "for those who need it most".   I find that description abstract and I wonder what the criteria will be.  Who will decide who needs it most?</p> <p>  This may not be the correct forum but, on a personal level, I ask for the Minister's permission to contact him about a matter.  I was contacted this morning by a constituent who has been waiting for 17 weeks for the result of a smear test.  An initial test came back unclear so the patient was advised to retest.  She has now been told she will have to wait another 17 weeks for the second result.  May I contact the Minister on that matter?</p></speech>

We will look at a map of Ireland not just in a geographical sense but in terms of where our citizens live and what needs they have.  Ms Magahy spoke passionately about citizen engagement and empowerment.  What do the citizens of Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's region or my region want their health service to look like?  We need to develop the structures around that, rather than continuing, as we have often done in healthcare, to put up the structures and then tell patients to come and access them.</p> <p>  On why new structures are not yet in place, that is a valid question and one that many people at home are also asking.  The Deputy made the point that Sl&aacute;intecare is above party politics, which is exactly the answer.  The risk is that if I, as the current Minister, or another Minister before or after me, tinkers with and starts changing the structures, they then become the structures of this or that Minister and often do not last the test of time.  There has been far too much chopping and changing in health, and all of us in the political system are collectively guilty of not allowing the health service to properly bed in to a programme of reform.  The beauty of and difference with this programme is that while I, as the incumbent, will implement it, in all likelihood those who come after me will also have signed up to it.  This means there is a good chance it will be done and will stand the test of time.</p> <p>  On community care, we have made progress on some of the issues.  We have given a commitment, for example, to a statutory home care scheme.  I know the Deputy has a strong view that, as politicians, we say we want everyone to be able to grow old at home in his or her own community with dignity but the only statutory scheme we currently have is the fair deal for nursing home care.  Home care around the country is variable in its delivery.  The idea that there would be a statutory home care scheme is one example of the community care.  The model we need to roll out for our nurse practitioners and the general practitioner contract is still ongoing.</p> <p>  What do we mean by "those who need it most"?  The authors of Sl&aacute;intecare, many of whom are here today, are trying to move away from a position where the ability to pay trumps medical need.  This is a move with which I agree.  We want to ultimately have a system where nobody lies awake in bed at night wondering if he or she has the money to access healthcare the next day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#L00800"><p>I welcome the Minister, Ms Magahy and the officials and wish them well in the task they are undertaking.  They need all the luck and assistance in the world.  The structures that are now emerging are not exactly my first choice because the question that comes up all the time is whether the HSE is the appropriate structure to evenly deliver throughout the country the services that are required.  I still hold that view although I note the implementation group has a minor version of what I had in mind, and hopefully it will work.</p> <p>  The population of the country has increased significantly in the past ten or 12 years, and it will increase more.  It is double what it was in the early 1960s and that should be taken into account.  If we rely on community care and primary care systems, we need to know whether we have the capacity and capability to do the job that is required at that level.  However, we have not yet found out if that is the case because it has not been identified if we have that capacity.  We do not know whether we are making the best use of the available resources, such as theatres, consultants and so on.  This will not happen unless services are delivered around the clock.  People do not get ill from Monday to Friday only.  The problem is serious and unless we do something about this issue, it will worsen.</p> <p>  I am glad to see the bed shortage issue is being addressed.  Various people have stated repeatedly before different committees of which I have been a member, including this one, that we have too many beds.  We still hear this argument from time to time.  I am glad it has finally been recognised that we need to have sufficient beds and accommodation and we need to ensure patients are not parked on trolleys around corridors, which creates a health and safety issue for patients, staff and everyone else.  We also need to compare our costs and expenditure with those of other OECD countries.  There is no use spending more on average than everyone else while delivering less.  We must deliver on a par with our competitors.  Otherwise, we have a problem.</p> <p>  There are specific areas where treatment has been lacking in recent times.  Scoliosis is one case in point.  I cannot understand how it took a survey by RT&Eacute; to identify the extent of the problem and its most acute aspects.  That should not happen.  If the system had been vigilant, internally capable and doing the job it is supposed to do, we should have seen the problem long before we reached that stage.  We need to be able to deliver services in a much sharper fashion for children and other patients on waiting lists who have acute problems.  There are countries that do that with fewer facilities than we have.  Will the Chair please tell me when I my time is up?</p></speech>

I have raised the issue of primary care centres before.  I am not certain they are capable of delivering the quality, level and extent of community care that are required.  I do not know as I have not yet seen them do so.  In some of the primary care centres there is not equal participation from the public sector nor equal access.  That is not much good to us if we are trying to deliver a service to the general public.</p><p>That is enough for the moment.  I said I would pull the handbrake a bit earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#M00200"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan for affording me the time to reply within the seven minutes.  I do not disagree with the Deputy at all that the current construct of the HSE is not fit for purpose.  That is not just my view but it is the view of the HSE.  The former director general of the HSE said that at this committee, calling it an "amorphous blob", as reported in the national media.  The HSE, as constructed, is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  There is a need for a national entity, and this is echoed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  There are many good things in our health service that would not be achieved without a national entity, including the national maternity strategy, the national cancer strategy and potentially procurement and human resource elements.  These are issues where it makes sense for them to remain in the national core, although that core is far too big and bloated.  The idea is to devolve as much as possible to the regional entities, with those entities having a board and being accountable.  Although it is not a criticism of people and I can find myself in the same position, all too often people in the Oireachtas raise questions because they cannot get answers at a local or regional level.  Affording people the chance to access information about their own healthcare in a local or regional setting makes sense.</p> <p>  The Deputy is entirely correct to raise the idea of population increases as everyone speaks about the health service as though it is static.  I am thankful we have a growing and ageing population.  People are living much longer in Ireland and we want them to be able to live good, healthy lives, with a good quality of life.  I should be clear that the mantra that there are too many beds in the Irish health service is gone, over and dead.  We have far too few acute hospital beds and it is highly regrettable that we went through an era of people deciding we had too many beds.  It was not an economic argument but rather an ideological argument.  They believed everything could be done in primary care.  Much more can be done in primary care but we have the evidence with the bed capacity review that many more acute hospital beds are required.  The person who needs an intensive care unit bed will never be seen in primary care so increased acute capacity is required with the primary care element.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to ask the question about primary care centres.  They have the capacity to do much more.  I will give the example of the one I visited and opened in Castlebar, where there is now an X-ray facility.  Under the governance of the hospital in Mayo, as Senator Swanick knows well, there was a position where many people had to go to the general hospital and there was a waiting list for X-rays.  The operation of the X-ray facility I mentioned has effectively eliminated the waiting list for X-rays.  We have all these fine buildings and there is much good work going on in them.  I do not mean to in any way downplay that.  There is an ability to do much more.  Deputy Donnelly and I represent a constituency with a primary care centre in Carnew and before it was in place, people from Carnew and south Wicklow were travelling to the Mater hospital for wound management.  That can now be done locally.  There is a definite ability to do much more in primary care, and that is what Sl&aacute;intecare is about.  It is also what our capital plan is about in the form of putting diagnostic infrastructure in place.</p></speech>

I will speak initially about primary care.   I welcome the Minister's comments on the funding of primary care, particularly multi-annual funding.  Does the Minister see any possible rowing back on the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts applied to general practice?  I agree with Deputy Durkan and I welcomed the primary care infrastructure plan, which produced more primary care centres around the country.  However, I have said on multiple occasions that it is not necessarily about bricks and mortar but rather the activity that happens within the primary care setting.</p></speech>

That is basically what it is all about.  As we know, general practitioners on a daily basis often carry out nursing duties.  Many of my GP colleagues around the country would agree with me in saying that even a small 10% refund of the FEMPI cuts could facilitate the sending of staff on training for nurse prescribing, for example.  Too much emphasis has been placed on the provision of primary care centres around the country when it is the provision of care that is important.  Does the Minister agree that any possible unwinding of the FEMPI cuts in the general practice sector should be kept separate from contract negotiations?  Will that process occur in an aligned fashion?</p> <p>  We speak of marrying primary and community care, as well as providing more new beds in the hospital sector, which I agree with.  The Minister mentioned the HSE's indication that there is capacity to provide 600 new beds between modular units and reconfiguration of existing wards, etc.  There is a major under-utilised resource, which I have spoken about on numerous occasions, which is the community hospital sector across the country.  Is there a specific fund within the implementation strategy for the community hospital sector, in particular?  The Minister mentioned the X-ray department installed in the new primary care centre in Castlebar but there are four district and community hospitals in the Mayo region.  There is an X-ray department in Belmullet hospital used once or twice per week, and there is an X-ray department in Ballina hospital.  Community hospitals should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era.  There is a major resource of beds not being used and they should not be seen as glorified nursing homes.  They help facilitate discharges from hospital and they prevent admissions to acute hospitals.  There is no reason somebody who has a hip replacement done at Mayo general hospital could not be rehabilitated in Belmullet, Castlebar or Swinford a couple of days later, for example.</p> <p>  We need to specifically consider the redevelopment of our community hospital sector as a way of taking pressure off the acute sector and opening access to GPs to admit to the community hospital sectors directly.  For example, people could be admitted and have a medication review, a chest X-ray or some blood work done.  An elderly person might have a brief admission for one week, and that would prevent an admission to the acute hospital sector.  It would save much money.  It is something that should be examined as it may have been overlooked in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?</p></speech>

The buildings can be enablers for change, integrated care and multidisciplinary working.  I opened one in Grangegorman only a few weeks ago and, as the Senator knows, it brought together many healthcare professionals who for the first time were working together under one roof, providing integrated care for a patient.  That is the benefit I see in the bricks and mortar aspect but it is not the end of the conversation.  It is what happens within those buildings that is really important.</p> <p>  I do not want to negotiate with GPs through this committee and they never like that.  Nevertheless I make the point that there are three elements to any discussion we must have.  There is an element about sustainability.  The Senator referred to FEMPI.  I am talking about sustainability but we are both speaking about recognising the fact that GPs in many cases today feel they are in need of supports to keep their current practice and services sustainable.  We need to talk about that.  I hope the Senator notices I am separating this and making it a distinct point from new services.  We need to talk about sustainability of our existing general practice service.</p> <p>  The second point we need to discuss is crucial and I referenced it in my opening statement.  It is throughout both the committee's Sl&aacute;intecare document and my implementation plan.  This is chronic disease management.  If sustainability is one leg of discussion, chronic disease management is another.  What can general practice do in chronic disease management if those GPs are resourced to do it?  I know from my conversations with GPs that there is a willingness and desire to do more but they must be resourced to do it.  The third leg of the stool is a conversation around access to primary care and how to advance the Sl&aacute;intecare ambition as it relates to access.</p> <p>  The three elements are sustainability, Sl&aacute;intecare chronic disease management and Sl&aacute;intecare access.  They are the three legs of a stool about which we, as a State, need to have a very serious conversation with general practice.</p><p>The State must be able to come to that conversation with significant resources.  I am now in a position to do that.  We need GPs to come to the table with a willingness to engage, which I believe is there.  I hope that re-engagement will shortly commence.</p><p> I agree with the Senator on smaller hospitals.  We are underutilising our smaller hospital network.  It is important that we provide the right care in the right place, which Senator Swanick, as a doctor, knows better than I do.  Smaller hospitals have the capacity to do more, whether in terms of diagnostics, elective procedures or otherwise.  I refer to the reopening of the cataract theatre in Nenagh hospital, a so-called small hospital, which will serve the people of the mid-west and reduce cataract waiting lists.  I visited Kilcreene hospital in Kilkenny, which has sufficient staff to do more hip operations and sought funding to carry out such operations.  I am pleased that we were able to facilitate that.  Some smaller hospitals have the staff, capacity and eagerness to do more.  Part of Sl&aacute;intecare is to consider how best to utilises all assets and capacity within the public health service.  Senator Swanick made a fine point regarding the role of smaller hospitals in that regard.</p></speech>

Services such as pulmonary and cardiac rehabilitation could be carried out at such hospitals, which would mean that patients would not have to travel for an hour or an hour and a half to a main acute hospital.  The provision of such services would facilitate the preservation of our district hospital network.  With a little lateral, solution-driven thinking, it is very simple to put in place good services that benefit patients at very little cost.  I am be happy to work with the Minister to further such measures.</p></speech>

Much of the cost relating to many such facilities is in the capital space.  I am pleased that our capital budget has increased significantly which will enable us to have those conversations.</p></speech>

When the Government came into being, it indicated that reform could not be discussed until after the Sl&aacute;intecare report was delivered.  It took six months longer than anticipated to deliver the report, for which the Committee on the Future of Healthcare must take responsibility.  The report was published 17 months ago but we are still talking about devising a plan.  I am concerned that there is a lack of urgency.  We are locked into that system which perpetuates the waiting lists and trolley queues raised by Deputy Donnelly for the next three years.  The Minister stated that trolley numbers reduced in September but the trend is upwards year on year.  That is a symptom of what is happening in the wider health services.  Trolley queues should not be the focus but they are a symptom of what is happening.  I am concerned that there is a lack of urgency because demographic change is continuing as our population is aging and requires more healthcare.  The older population require the most healthcare.  Demographic change will not wait.</p> <p>  On the point made by Senator Swanick regarding the GP negotiations, almost no GP negotiations took place this year.  There were two or three meetings, which is nothing.  As we approach the budget, there is a sudden surge of activity, similar to that before last year&rsquo;s budget after which nothing happened.  I am concerned that the budget cycle stimulates movement which then peters out for another year.  I ask the Minister to address the urgency with which he will approach the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p></speech>

I hear his frustration and know that it is genuine.  As I stated, some of the timelines in the Sl&aacute;intecare report were unworkable.  It would be incorrect to contend otherwise.  Although I do not wish to end on a sour note, I must point out that the report was produced in May and suggested that an executive director would be appointed by July.  That is not how the world works in terms of recruiting highly skilled professionals such as Laura Magahy.  One cannot hire such a person within two months.  The report suggests that we should extend access to free GP care to 500,000 persons per year.  While I do not speak for either of the GPs in the room, I have yet to meet a GP in my constituency or in my role as Minister for Health who believes that that would be sustainable, rather than resulting in very lengthy general practice waiting lists.  Although I fully subscribe to the agenda and endpoint of Sl&aacute;intecare, a relatively substantial amount of work remained to ensure its correct sequencing such that waiting lists in primary care settings are not created.  If we accept that general practice is one of the best functioning parts of the health service-----</p></speech>

I am not here to be negative and I want to get on with this.  However, the timelines were somewhat contradictory in this regard because while the Chairman is correct that the report recommends increasing capacity, it also states that we must ensure that eligibility is extended in a very short period of time.  That would not have worked.  I want the committee to know that I, my Department, the Sl&aacute;intecare office and the HSE believe that Sl&aacute;intecare is the only plan on health reform.  We are moving beyond conversations regarding my view of Sl&aacute;intecare to a point where we have an implementation plan and, better still, by the end of the year will have the action plan which will detail what we are going to do and who is going to do it, which will be of assistance to the committee in its scrutiny and accountability role.  We will then publish reports measuring that every six months.  There will be nowhere to hide in terms of progressing the reform agenda.</p> <p>  I am particularly keen to pursue geographical alignment.  It may not be politically advantageous but it is crucial in terms of providing regional integrated care and singular budgets.  I will invest political capital in trying to bring that forward more quickly than was originally envisaged.</p> <p>  The Chairman and I regularly discuss the GP contract.  It has taken much too long for it to be put in place.  I now have an agreed mandate on multi-annual funding, and we will go at this hammer and tongs and try to have it agreed.</p></speech>

Fundamentally, the current waiting lists have nothing to do with Sl&aacute;intecare.  They have grown beyond recognition to levels never seen before in the history of the Republic of Ireland.  Does the Minister accept that solving the waiting lists is possible without Sl&aacute;intecare and doing so is simply a responsibility of the Government?  Regardless of whether the Oireachtas published a Sl&aacute;intecare report and what is progressing in that regard, does the Minister accept that it is his role to bring down those waiting lists, which have reached hellish levels?</p> <p>  On funding, the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the team from Trinity College Dublin from whom the committee will hear this afternoon state that Sl&aacute;intecare is predicated on approximate funding growth of 7.5% per year.  That amounts to approximately &euro;1.1 billion per year for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare assuming a base of approximately &euro;15 billion.  I acknowledge that the budget will be delivered next week and I am not asking the Minister what he is pitching to the Minister for Finance for next year.  However, is he seeking to meet a broad funding goal in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the view of the team from Trinity College Dublin that the approximate cost will be an additional &euro;1.1 billion each year for approximately ten years?</p> <p>  Obviously, the funding overrun for this year which may amount to more than &euro;600 million is very serious.  Is it likely to impact on the ability to invest in Sl&aacute;intecare for next year?</p> <p>  On assets, both in terms of people such as clinicians, doctors, nurses, speech and language therapists and so on and physical assets such as beds, hospitals, primary care centres, diagnostics, etc., when does Minister believe he will be able to present the committee with a year-by-year forecast indicating how many doctors, nurses, paediatric consultants and primary care centres there will be in various parts of the country?</p><p>When will the Minister be in a position to present a forecast in this regard?</p><p> The Minister said earlier that the HSE is not fit for purpose.  There is danger in a Minister for Health making that statement and not setting out a definitive plan for a replacement.  In the UK, Mr. Andrew Lansley, on his appointment by former Prime Minister Cameron said that one of the first things he was going to do was disband NHS trusts, with no proposals regarding what would replace them.  This caused chaos.  One of the greatest mistakes of the former Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, was his statement on taking up that Ministry that he was going to get rid of the HSE, with no proposals on what would replace it, and that caused chaos.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said that the HSE is not fit for purpose, which I believe many people would agree with in spite of there being some phenomenal people working therein every day to help people.  When does he expect to have a new organisation in place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#O00200"><p>I accept that we can make progress on waiting lists in advance of Sl&aacute;intecare, and aside from it.  I believe - I am not being pedantic - the policy shift that Sl&aacute;intecare represents will help improve waiting lists.  If we did not have Sl&aacute;intecare, it would lessen the pace of progress.  I think that is a fair comment.  For the benefit of those watching the proceedings, I want to be clear that we are not waiting for the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare to work every day to try to improve the waiting lists.  I do not want to be pedantic because the waiting lists are too long, but many of these waiting lists were never before published.  That is a point worth making.  For example, in light of the RTE "Prime Time Investigates" programme, we now publish pre-planned and what are known as TCI waiting lists.  As far as I am aware, prior to me becoming Minister, these were never before published.  Prior to 2014, outpatient lists were never published.  There are still too many people on waiting lists but this needs to be factored in.</p> <p>  As I said at the launch of the implementation plan in Government Buildings, largely speaking, the costs outlined by the TCD team and the committee are correct.  However, as I said earlier during my engagement with the Chairman, a significant proportion of the costs is dependent on contractual negotiations, and not only with GPs.  We will also need a new consultant contract at some point, and there will be negotiations on the decisions taken by the Government and the Oireachtas on public and private services.  As the Deputy will be aware, private health insurance contributes significantly to our public hospitals and this is factored into the figures provided.  Some of the costs are capital and others are current.  Largely speaking, I am not engaged in a row with the TCD team or with the Sl&aacute;intecare committee about the figures, but I am making the point that some of the policy decisions that we have yet to make as an Oireachtas will have a bearing on the costs.  For example, Sl&aacute;intecare recommends the removal of private practice from public hospitals but it also recommends that before doing so, we should do a particular piece of work on it and revert to the committee with a roadmap.  This represents a big chunk of money in terms of the overall impact on a yearly basis in regard to the health service.</p></speech>

The Minister's response is that he is broadly in agreement with the Sl&aacute;intecare/TCD figures of approximately &euro;1.1 billion.  The question was slightly different in that I asked if, notwithstanding any negotiations with the Minister for Finance this year - I appreciate where we are at in the budget cycle - taking a five to ten-year view, that is the approximate funding for which the Minister is making the case in respect of implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

What a Government or the Oireachtas will be able to deliver in 2019 and 2020 is a variable.  It will be dependent on the choices the Deputy's party makes and on the choices and decisions of the Government.  I expect that we will have funding allocated to Sl&aacute;intecare this year that will enable progress.  I want Sl&aacute;intecare implemented in full over the lifetime of the ten-year strategy.</p></speech>

He has made clear that he believes the funding overrun in health, which sadly is not a new phenomenon and is a reflection of the need for Sl&aacute;intecare and a more efficient accountable transparent model of funding and delivery, will not affect his spending or taxation plans for 2019.  I take him at his word in this regard.</p></speech>

On the assets, I will ask Ms Magahy to respond later to that question because she has a body of work to do in mapping out people need and the capital and infrastructural need over the next number of years.</p> <p>  On the comment that the HSE is not fit for purpose, it is reassuring that it is not just me, as Minister for Health, who is saying that.  The director general of the HSE also said that.  I am happy to echo the Deputy's point that there are many brilliant people working in the health service, such that saying the HSE is not fit for purpose is not a jibe by me or any political at the staff of the HSE and the work they do or endeavour to do but a recognition that the HSE, as currently set up, is not fit for purpose.  I want it to be clear that under Sl&aacute;intecare the HSE will continue in existence but it will be slimmed down in that many of its functions will be devolved to regional entities in line with the strategy.  Unlike the UK Minister referenced by Deputy Donnelly, I make my comments in the context of the plan we are discussing.  On when I expect to make the changes, by the end of the year I will be in a position to return to this committee or the D&aacute;il to set out what I think, based on the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the geo-alignment should look like. </p> <p>  In 2019, we will begin to devolve some of those functions on an administrative basis.  The implementation plan states that to allow the system to bed down, we should legislate for those changes in 2021, but, as I said in my earlier engagement with Deputy Kelly, I have an open mind and instinctively would like to legislate earlier if there was a majority view in the Oireachtas that we should do that.  By the end of this year, what the map of Ireland from a structural point of view will look like will be published.  From 2019, we will commence administrative changes and from 2020 to 2021 we will begin legislating in this regard.  That is my proposal, which is very much in keeping with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

The question that people in the HSE will ask, as they did when the Minister's predecessor, Senator Reilly, said he was going to get rid of the HSE, and as happened when Mr. Andrew Lansley said he would get rid of the primary care trusts, is, "Will I have a job?"  Slimming down means fewer staff, which means some people will be on voluntary or compulsory redundancy unless there is natural attrition.  We have a lot of very good people within the HSE.  We all agree there are layers of bureaucracy that should not be there in the organisation and, the same applies in some of the acute settings as well.  Many good people will watch this process carefully and think their job or post may not exist in the new slimmed down agency.  When will people know if they will have a job in the new HSE?</p></speech>

I am sure the Deputy will agree that I could not make announcements in that regard in such a public forum.  These are conversations to be had with representative bodies at an appropriate time.  This is about where people work.  Many of the people working in the HSE today may work in a devolved regional entity into the future.  The HSE has employees throughout the country.  An analysis will be conducted on the needs of the health service, such that we will not know for two years or more how many staff are needed.  The HSE is involved in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is the policy direction for the HSE and it is embracing it.  We will get this right.  When we did big programmes of reform in the past, for example, the abolition of the health boards and the creation of the HSE, this is an area where we did not get it right.  That is an objective comment.  We have to get it right this time.</p><p>We have to look at these issues sensitively and carefully.  We must not do so in a knee-jerk fashion.  We are talking about something that will happen over a number of years.  To answer the Deputy's question, it will probably take around two years.</p></speech>

I suppose that is what I will look at between now and the end of the year.  I have been tasked with a series of 106 actions and looking at the dependencies between those actions.  I am thinking of rolling it out over a number of years using the concept of a citizen care master plan.  This will involve looking at population needs on a geolined basis and looking at service design care pathways, before then looking at the infrastructural needs and e-health needs that will be required to support the newly developed service design care pathways and, critically, looking at the resources needed by the teams of the future - what the teams will look like and what the numbers will be.  That will take some time to sort out.  It will need to be done in an orderly fashion.</p></speech>

We are not starting from scratch, but we almost have to start from scratch as we determine the ideal way to plan for the projected increase in population from 4.6 million to 5.2 million over the next eight to ten years.  We will start by looking at where the various sectors of the population are located, what they look like, what their needs are, what their age profiles are, where they stand on the deprivation index and what their requirements are.  Then we will build up a service in respect of that population.  It was mentioned earlier that it is better to do it that way rather than setting out where the buildings are and asking the service to respond to that.</p></speech>

I was dealing with the Minister for Justice and Equality on a Commencement matter in the Seanad.  I would like to ask the Minister about Project Ireland 2040 and the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It has been identified that additional hospitals are needed in certain locations, including Cork.  I understand that a group of people from various agencies in Cork, including Cork City Council, Cork County Council, UCC, the voluntary hospitals and the HSE, has been put together with a view to identifying a site for a new hospital in Cork.  The identification of a site is a crucial issue.  There have been 25 years of delays in developing a new children's hospital in Dublin.  Even though all of the people who should be on this group were identified six or eight months ago, I understand the HSE has made no effort to call the group together.  I am a little concerned about that.  The first issue is identifying a site.  The next issue is going through the planning process.  These issues have to be dealt with before budgetary commitments are made.  It should be simple to identify the pros, cons and disadvantages of a number of sites.  I will explain why I am concerned to ensure this is treated as a priority.  The population of Cork city and county has increased from 410,000 to 542,000 or by 130,000 over the past 30 years.  It is growing at a phenomenal rate.  Within the next eight years, there could well be a population in excess of 700,000 in the area in question.  For that reason, I this serious issue is a priority.  I would like to know whether the Department of Health can communicate with the HSE on this issue.  We are talking about building additional units.  At what stage do we start looking at sites?  I am a little concerned about that.</p> <p>  I would like to raise a second matter.  Over the past three years, the HSE has taken on more than 12,000 additional people.  The number of staff in the HSE has increased from over 99,000 to over 110,000.  I have concerns about the number of people being taken on in administration and management.  I accept fully that they need support.  If one looks at the entire staff of the HSE, more than 17,600 people work in administration and management and a further 7,500 are in nurse manager roles.  Technically, there are more than 24,500 people in these positions.  In fairness, nurse managers also provide nursing services.  We seem to have a management structure everywhere.  One of the problems I find with the HSE is that I cannot get anyone to make a decision.  I recently dealt with a case in which 12 people from the HSE and Acquired Brain Injury Ireland were summoned to a meeting to make a decision on one person.  Just 24 hours before the meeting was due to happen, one person announced that he or she had moved to a new job in the HSE and would not attend the meeting but did not set out who would attend in his or her place.  As a result, the meeting was cancelled.  I find that astonishing.  I have come across many cases in which a medical practitioner who is trying to make a decision about a particular patient reports to management the issues he or she is dealing with, only for three different groups of people in administration to tell him or her how he or she should manage the patient in question.  This is causing significant morale problems for nursing and other staff in hospitals.  It seems that no one can make a decision on a particular issue.  I raised this last week when Dr. Holohan came before the committee to speak about the proposed patient safety Bill.  Doctors and nurses are being held accountable for every step they take, but we do not have any accountability on the managerial side.  I refer not only to the decision-making process on the managerial side, but also to the delays in making decisions.  When was the last time a HSE manager was disciplined?  It is right that doctors and nurses are held accountable when errors are made.  I wonder what process we can set up to deal with this issue if we want to have reform.  There is resistance to reform.  How do we propose to deal with this issue in that context?</p> <p>  I would like to mention a final issue.  We met Professor John Higgins from Cork last week to discuss gynaecological services.  A second theatre needs to be opened in Cork to deal with such services.  The HSE ended up renting space from the Mater Private Hospital in Cork and the consultants moved to that hospital.  Public patients were dealt with there in an organised way.  More than 1,500 people were taken off the waiting list as a result of an initiative led by management and consultants.  It seems that problems have been encountered in opening the second theatre in Cork University Hospital so that this service can be provided.  We have the space and the theatre, but we seem to have a problem getting it opened.  If we want to implement Sl&aacute;intecare, how do we deal with all of the issues that will arise?  We are trying to get people to accept that change must come about, that they must take responsibility for the decisions they are making and that they must take the people around them into account.</p></speech>

I fully agree with him that the hospital in Cork needs increased capacity,  There is a particular need for acute hospital space.  As the Deputy has rightly said, the population has grown significantly, but the bed base has not.  That is why we announced an acute hospital development for Cork in the capital plan.  We also said that Cork would receive one of three elective-only hospitals, to which I referred earlier in the context of the Scottish model following my trip to Scotland last week.</p><p>I take the point the Senator makes about the next steps in these capital projects and ensuring that, when capital funding becomes available, we will be ready to go in having the sites available and planning permission obtained in order that we will be able to go to tender.  In the next few weeks I will convene the relevant stakeholders in Cork to seek an action plan on the next steps to be taken.  I will keep the Senator, as well as other Oireachtas Members from Cork, informed and updated, as necessary.</p><p> Making sure we have clear management structures in place at regional level is at the core of Sl&aacute;intecare.  They have been lacking to date, but we will have geoalignment and one integrated structure for the community and hospitals in order that people will not get stuck in one part of the health service.  There will also be a regional board in order that we will be able to look at decision makers in the eye and demand that they account for their actions.</p><p> I am pleased that we have increased investment in Cork University Hospital.  We have also supported clinical autonomy in the budgetary process.  The hospital has made great progress in dealing with gynaecology waiting lists.  I thank Professor John Higgins and the clinical team for the work they have done in that regard.  I am keen to see if we can do more to support their good work in the context of the budget.  I will be happy to discuss the matter further with the Senator.</p></speech>

If Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Bernard J. Durkan combine their questions, we can allow the Minister to leave.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#Q00300"><p>There is a notion that the issue of waiting lists has only arisen in recent times.  That is not true.  I remember dealing with cases in my constituency in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, when people had been waiting for up to seven years for a hip replacement operation.  I remember one case in which somebody had been waiting for nine years.  They were in extreme pain and had repeatedly tried to gain access to the service.  Whatever blocked it at the time did so seriously for persons who were in acute pain.  Some people were unable to access the service before they died and they died in pain, which was a terrible reflection on the system at the time.  This, therefore, did not start in the last couple of months.</p> <p>  I disagree with Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly on the abolition of the HSE.  The Minister's predecessor was right, but he did not press ahead with the next phase to replace it with the structures required.  I pointed this out at the time.  The HSE was the wrong structure and the decision to replace the health board system was the wrong one.  However, it was based on expert opinion from the United Kingdom, based specifically on the situation in the greater Manchester area which had the same population as Ireland.  Some of us pointed out that it could not be done in the same fashion because the two were chalk and cheese.  One was a vast geographical area, while the other was a compact urban area that was ideal for the delivery of concentrated services in the shortest possible time.  The sooner we recognise that we are dealing with a very different system from the one in the greater Manchester area, the sooner we will move forward.</p> <p>  In the control centres of big transport operations worldwide operatives have big screens in front of them on which they can see the movement of traffic.  Whenever there is a stoppage they know instantly what to do.  The same should apply to the health service, although obviously in a different format.  We need to identify the snags which slow the system, thus denying a patient access to it.  The HSE should not be regarded as an employment agency but as a vehicle with which to deliver services to patient, the needs of whom are paramount.  If we do not realise this, all the talk, re-evaluation and restructuring will come to naught.  When there are snags, as with traffic, they cause problems to back up and they get worse and worse.  What action can be takem to deal with this issue?  Can we focus on it?  We could carry out an audit of the weaknesses in the system, but if it does not work for even some of the time, we will not deliver anything.  The sooner we recognise this the better.  We can play around with it all we want and blame one another for it, but we need to develop a smooth, free-flowing system that will keep patients moving in a circular movement to have them dealt with quickly.  What provisions does the Minister have in mind to identify the snags for individual patients and take action to deal with them?</p> <p>  My last point is about overruns.  There have been overruns in the health service for the past 20 years.  Which disciplines are the most seriously affected and which are guilty of having overruns every year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#Q00400"><p>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan is right that overruns are not new in the health service.  Denying that there are overruns is new, as is pretending that they are not recurring.  I can play the game of which previous Government made the biggest mess of the health service, but it will not profit us much.  I asked the Minister how the overruns were related to recurring costs.  There is a difference between recurring and once-off costs.  A once-off cost can be incurred to deal with an event that places unprecedented pressure on the health service.  I am not referring to the flu but other unforeseen events.  Mr. Tony O'Brien wrote to the Minister earlier this year about the issue of recurring overruns.  Does the Minister accept that there are overruns and is it his intention to deal with them?  I am not asking him to divulge the fourth secret of Fatima, about which we read a lot in the newspapers.</p></speech>

Were his figures correct?  Were they exactly right or roughly correct?  Are the actual figures worse?  Is it the Minister's position that there are recurring overspends and that there is not a single incident which places unprecedented pressure on the health service?</p> <p>  Deputy Bernard J. Durkan was also right to say patients had to be at the centre of health services, but there will be no health service without staff to work in it.  There will just be big empty buildings with a lot of sick patients in them.  We need some strategy to deal with the issue of recruitment.  We might disagree on whether the Minister's strategy is failing, entirely or in part, but staff will be required to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  Nurses are engaged in consultations and have signalled that this issue may lead to industrial action.  I understand doctors and consultants are more or less in the same space.  The health service is haemorrhaging staff and potential industrial relations difficulties are mounting up.  This makes the service a very unattractive place in which to work.  In some respects, the purpose of Sl&aacute;intecare is to ensure those who are graduating and bright health professionals working within the system, as well as all other staff who keep it going, will see that there is a plan and that in time the HSE and the health service will be an attractive place in which to work.</p><p>There was a very unfortunate incident where the number of student nurses increased overnight from 435 to 870.  They had been counted as 0.5 equivalents and then they were counted as a whole-time equivalents.  That does not add a single extra person but it makes the figures look good.  It does not add a single extra body to a ward.  We do not need any more of that but we do need honesty regarding where the recruitment challenges lie and about a detailed plan to be put in place.</p><p> The D&aacute;il supported a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on nursing recruitment and retention and it was very clear in saying that pay has to be at the heart of it.  We spoke to Kevin Duffy, the chair of the Public Service Pay Commission last week at another committee, and he said he was explicitly told not to focus on pay and that it was not a pay review.  We can all pretend that pay is not an issue but we are ignoring the nurses, doctors and allied health professionals who tell us that pay is definitely an issue, not simply in the health service but also in the section 39 agencies and other sectors.  I understand there was some progress in that regard.  I do not wish to put Ms Magahy on the spot, particularly as she has only been in the job for 22 days, but I would be keen to hear if she has any thoughts on how she is going to be able to crack this nut because no plan will work without the staff to implement it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#R00200"><p>I agree with much of what Deputy Durkan stated.  One of the things we are lacking in the health service is data.  I think that is the reason the Sl&aacute;intecare committee put such a focus on ehealth.  I am pleased that we are going to be able to deliver the ehealth agenda in full because of the ability it provides in tracking that to which Deputy Durkan referred in terms of where the blockage lies.  If one has a clinical director in a hospital who realises there is congestion in the emergency department, he or she should be able to check on the needs of the patients and say, whether, for example, there are 20 people in beds who need MRI or CAT scans and that if they get those scans, 20 beds will be freed up.  The inability to have all the data collated is a blockage in the system and the ehealth agenda is very important in that regard.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the agreement that has been reached at the Workplace Relations Commission in respect of section 39 organisations.  I hope it will bring stability and certainty to the staff working in the sector and to those for whom they care and provide services.  That is something we welcome.  I thank SIPTU, led by Paul Bell and others, for their further engagement.</p> <p>  On the overrun or overspend, I will provide some figures.  The Estimates for 2018 provided for gross expenditure of &euro;15.332 billion for health services.  Of that, &euro;14.839 billion is for current expenditure and &euro;493 million is for capital expenditure.  The last available position at the end of June shows that the HSE's income and expenditure position is &euro;341.7 million above profile.  While there are offsetting surpluses and deficits, to respond to Deputy Durkan's question, a large proportion of the overall deficit is in the acute hospitals division.  As regards the exact figures in Tony O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s letter or anybody else&rsquo;s commentary, we do know yet because the year is not yet over.  I have said on a number of occasions that there will be an overspend or an overrun, whichever way one wishes to classify it, and that will need to be addressed.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I are seeking to address it and I hope the matter can be resolved in the coming days.</p> <p>  When the HSE publishes a service plan, there is a legal requirement under the legislation for it to say that it is going to deliver said plan within budget.  It knows the funding available at that stage.  While I accept the point made, it is easily conflated with a failure to deliver everything within a service plan.  In fairness, Deputy Durkan is not doing that.  People have legally signed up to deliver the service plan with the knowledge of the funding they have available.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Magahy to comment on Sl&aacute;intecare, staffing and how she intends to proceed.  She replied to Deputy Donnelly on the issue.  I respect the processes being undertaken by the INMO and the PNA and I do not want to say anything to interfere with their consultation with their members.  It is important that the process runs its course before I make further comment, other than to make one point.  In terms of recruitment and retention, there is a retention challenge in particular for nurses and that is what the Public Service Pay Commission found.  We are putting forward proposals in line with what the Public Service Pay Commission said to try to address the challenges.  The new entrant pay agreement will ensure the pay of new, often younger nurses restored to an equivalent level to that of their colleagues.  That should be welcomed by nurses, teachers and other sectors.  I am pleased agreement has been reached in that regard.  We also want to see somebody be able to become a senior nurse quicker than is currently the case.  There is a financial benefit to that, and also to the specialist qualification allowance.  I will not interfere in the process but nurses will have to make an adjudication on those proposals.  The executive made comments on that in the aftermath of the EGM but that needs to go through a process and then we need to engage.</p> <p>  Mr. Duffy, of the Public Service Pay Commission, does also say in his document that there may also be at some point in time, which he does not specify, where there should be further engagement.  He specifically references Sl&aacute;intecare because, as the Deputy correctly indicated, the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare will require healthcare professionals, including nurses, and may also require people to take on different roles and tasks and to work in different structures.  I am conscious that the line is there in the report of the Public Service Pay Commission and I am eager to explore it further but I am respectful of the process.</p></speech>

That is grand, but does the Minister not accept that the time might be now?  The recruitment and retention crisis is happening now.  We are discussing things that we say are new but that are not such as, for example, waiting lists.  Perhaps the position is worse now, perhaps it is not - I do not know.  I represented nurses for years and we did not have challenges with recruitment and retention.</p></speech>

I stated that in the D&aacute;il and at the IMO conference and I say it here because it is the truth.  We have an issue with the retention of healthcare professionals.  One could argue the toss about recruitment because the stats show that people sign up to be nurses and doctors but the length of time people stay in the health service is a cause of concern.</p> <p>  Mr. Duffy and the Public Service Pay Commission have made some more general comments, including the one I referenced on Sl&aacute;intecare, but it also made specific commitments we want to extend to nurses such as the qualification allowance and the senior nurse&rsquo;s scale, and coupled with that is the position regarding new entrants.  I would like nurses to consider that in the context of their discussions and following the outcome of the discussions I look forward to engaging with them.</p></speech>

We are delighted to be here.  I am accompanied by Pathways team members Dr. Sara Burke and Dr. Bridget Johnston, whose assistance has been invaluable.</p> <p>  The committee asked us to evaluate the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and present our work on re-phasing the original Sl&aacute;intecare costings.  This research was presented at the final seminar of the pathways to universal healthcare project, funded by the Health Research Board, HRB, which took place a week ago in Trinity College.  It also draws on our experience of working with the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare at the end of 2016 and early in 2017, when we had the privilege of working closely with some members of this committee.  </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy was published on 8 August 2018 and Ms Laura Magahy began as the executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office in September 2018.  The implementation strategy has four goals and ten interlocking high-level strategic actions, each of which have further specific actions.  A brief critique of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy follows, using the framework which structured the work of the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We compare the treatment of vision, principles, entitlements, integrated care, funding and implementation in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy with the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy refers regularly to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and restates the principles contained in the original report.  The Sl&aacute;intecare vision as specified in the Oireachtas report was for a universal health system accessible to all on the basis of need which is free at the point of delivery or at the lowest possible cost.  The Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report defines what it means by universal healthcare and outlines the services that were to be included in the universal system.  It specified that all residents would be entitled to these services and that this entitlement would be backed by legislation alongside a wait time guarantee.  Everyone in Ireland would be entitled to a full package of services, free or at low cost, within a set period of time.  It detailed the phasing and costings required to deliver such care.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy is much more conservative, referring to eligibility rather than entitlement.  Action six refers to expanding eligibility on a phased basis to move towards universal healthcare.  It uses the term "universal eligibility" which is, at worst, an oxymoron and at best, only a conditional commitment.  It goes on to state that the vision is that all citizens "will have universal access to healthcare, in both the acute and community settings.".  These statements appear contradictory implying either a lack of understanding of the terms or a watering down of the commitment to universalism as laid out in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report. </p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy upholds the vision of integrated care as specified in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  In particular, an imminent decision on the alignment of community services with hospitals groups as well as the allocation of resources through regional integrated care structures on the basis of population health need are both positive aspects of the implementation strategy. </p> <p>  Goal No. 3 of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy is to ensure the health service is financially sustainable.  It has a strong emphasis on productivity and achieving value for money.  However, there is no recognition of household financial sustainability, little about eliminating or reducing charges and no national health fund as specified in the original report.  There is a specific action to "design, establish and resource a multi-annual transition fund with appropriate governance to support the change process".  While the capital aspects of the Oireachtas report transition fund are included in the national development plan in terms of community diagnostics, eHealth, primary care centres, new hospital capacity and elective-only hospitals, there is no mention of the funding required to train increased numbers of healthcare professionals for strong primary and community care service as detailed in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Neither is there any specification of the additional money required to fund the expansion of entitlements and to support the reform process as specified in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report. </p> <p>  The Pathways team has reworked the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare cost projections to provide another option for funding.  This extends the implementation period to 12 years and elongates some of the phasing of specific components within that.  We would be delighted to show members some slides of these after this opening statement. </p> <p>  Goal No. 1 of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy is to "deliver improved governance and sustain reform through a focus on implementation".  This puts implementation up front and centre, with a map of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation structure.  However, the implementation strategy critically lacks the specifics of the original Sl&aacute;intecare Oireachtas report in terms of targets, phasing, timelines, milestones and the budget needed to deliver it.  It is important not to reinvent the wheel. </p> <p>  In conclusion, the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, the appointment of Laura Magahy and the establishment of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office are all necessary and important developments.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy begins to do the important task of weaving together reforms that were happening anyway with the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  However, there is a need to keep an eye on the Sl&aacute;intecare Oireachtas vision and ambition and the essential components of entitlement and funding which are lacking in the implementation strategy.  Nevertheless, the strategy progresses the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report by integrating clinical and corporate governance.  The emphasis on public engagement on health and well-being, a workforce engagement plan and the development of a citizen care master plan are welcome additions and may well be critical to triggering the political commitment and leadership that is needed to fund and deliver the vision as laid out in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p> <p>  We look forward to further discussions with the committee on this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Steve Thomas" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#T00400"><p>Myself and my colleagues will present a few of the slides that we drew from last week's final workshop on the pathways to universal healthcare project.  We have selected slides that we believe will provide a useful focus for the committee.</p> <p>  In terms of the first slide, one of the issues that has come up with Sl&aacute;intecare is whether it is too expensive to implement.  Obviously, a further question is whether it is too expensive not to implement, given the current overruns in the health budget.  The original Sl&aacute;intecare report was focused on a ten year implementation plan.  A lot of the activity, particularly around entitlement, expansion and the transition fund was front loaded into the first six years, with a maximum amount of &euro;460 million expansion related to entitlements per year, from year three.  In our work we consider what might be the effect of changing some of the assumptions behind that.  We keep the basic costings and basic items but shift some of the underlying assumptions and look at a 12 year implementation plan.  We do not frontload it into the first six years but spread it out more evenly across the timeframe.</p><p>We push back the start dates of a couple of items, for instance, the inpatient hospital fee removal to year two and the emergency department fee removal to year 11 from year eight.  We stretched some of the phasing, particular around universal primary care, which is now elongated to six years for implementation rather than five years.  </p><p> With the freeing up of GP care and replacing private income in public hospitals, we looked at both phases and took them back a bit and stretched the phasing to get our house in order for preparing and implementing those policies.  We try to change some of the underlying assumptions.  It is interesting to then look at what impact that has.  </p><p> On the bar chart, I show the entitlement expansion cost required for each year on the left hand axis.  We are running at approximately &euro;250 million for the first five years.  By the end of the 12 years, we still arrive at the figure of 2.8, which is shown by the line chart.  On the right axis, members can see the total amount coming to &euro;2.8 billion, so that is consistent with the current entitlement expansion detailed in Sl&aacute;intecare.  That will give members a slight idea of the rephasing.  </p><p> If one goes to the next slide, one can do a comparison with the original Sl&aacute;intecare costings, which are in orange, and the revised and rephased Sl&aacute;intecare costings in blue.  Substantially less is required upfront but, at the tail end, there is more investment, so it is more evenly focused.</p><p> On the next slide, we can do it for the transition cost because if we have a 12-year period rather than ten years and we are elongating the phasing, or delaying the phasing of some of the components slightly, we can redistribute some of the transitional costs as well.  The impact of this is to reduce some of the initial burden on the budget.  Interesting work was done by the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, particularly for year one.  There may be budget constraints but subsequently there will be enough fiscal space to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  This way of rephasing may get around some of the initial problems with affordability.</p><p> I will ask my colleague Dr. Bridget Johnston to follow on.</p></speech>

Currently about 68% to 70% comes from general taxation and the remainder of funding comes from private health expenditure.  That is what households either spend out of pocket at the time they access health care or the reimbursement that comes from private health insurance companies back into the system.  They contribute about an equal pot each, about 15% each.</p> <p>  Some of the work I have done for the pathways project is to look specifically at the affordability of this spending by households.  Using the household budget survey provided by the CSO, I have been able to estimate that 14% of households were not able to afford what they were spending on either out of pocket charges or private health insurance premiums in 2009 and 2010.  By the year 2015 to 2016, this had grown to 17.3% and that probably should be seen in the context of rising charges throughout multiple budgets, but also the increase in private health insurance premia.</p> <p>  What is interesting to look at on this slide is who is mostly affected by this, what these households look like, and what kinds of protection are they supposed to have from the system so that they do not experience this financial hardship.  The top bar for the years 2009 and 2010 shows that the majority are medical card-GP card holders.  Those represented by the blue bar are considered double, so they not only have a medical card but also private health insurance.  They are meant to be protected by the medical card system as well.  We can see they are the overwhelming majority of people who are not financially protected, experience financial hardship, and are pushed further into poverty or into poverty because of their spending on either of these items.  We can see this grew substantially by 2015-2016, not only for the proportion of households but the breakdown within.  We can see that the safety net that is meant to be provided by the medical card scheme is failing those households.  This is the overwhelming majority of those who are experiencing financial hardship.  In its current form, this system is not protecting people as well as it should.</p></speech>

I will ask the same two questions that I put to the Minister when he appeared before us this morning.  First, we had a long discussion in the Sl&aacute;intecare committee about where the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office should sit and it has been placed in the Department of Health.  We were strongly of the view that it should be placed in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  Where does that leave us regarding the political buy-in?</p> <p>  There is no reference to a national health fund in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  A major component of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan was that there would be a national health fund which would be comprised of earmarked taxes and specific funds.  In his reply, the Minister said that the funding for Sl&aacute;intecare would come through the normal budgetary process.  We were quite strong that this would not be sufficient funding to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sara Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#U00400"><p>There are two separate issues.  One relates to where the implementation offices sits and the second to the political buy-in.  I was present for lots of heated discussions privately at the Committee on the Future of Healthcare as to where that implementation office should be.</p> <p>  I was in a minority and favoured it being in the Department of Health, because I believe very strongly that the Department is there to drive the strategic direction of health policy in Ireland.  If the Department is not driving Sl&aacute;intecare, what is it doing?  It is positive that the implementation office is under the Department.  It is critical that there are structures in place to support that work and political buy-in.  The implementation strategy has done a pretty good job on the map of the governance structures for Sl&aacute;intecare and the high level committee with input from the Secretaries General of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach, which reports to the Cabinet sub-committee, and an independent advisory group are all positive developments.  That is a strength of what has happened since the work of the committee.</p> <p>  The question of political buy-in is a separate issue.  It was evident from the Minister's presentation this morning that he is wholeheartedly behind Sl&aacute;intecare.  There is an issue as to how far that political buy-in goes.  There are political hearts and minds to be won across the Oireachtas, and not just in government, to support for Sl&aacute;intecare.  The international evidence is clear on this.  Unless we have political buy-in from the Taoiseach down, and particularly from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe having a key role, then it will be difficult for Sl&aacute;intecare to happen.</p></speech>

It is difficult and probably without precedent to get the current tax base to deliver sufficient resources for the scale of change required to transition the system and reconfigure it.</p> <p>  There is a strong case for making a one-off investment in reconfiguration.  As we have seen, even though elements are included in the capital plan, important elements of the new system relating to primary and social care professionals are still lacking.  The danger is that with tax, one will always get squeezed out.  We have even seen the overrun issue having an effect so there will be a squeezing out.  Yet there is no protection and there is no earmarking.  It is difficult to protect the necessary space to do that.  There probably needs to be a conversation with the public about the earmarking of particular tax into the fund and allocating from that for reconfiguration and  entitlement expansion purposes, otherwise the danger will always be that it gets crowded out.  However laudable the ambitions, the danger is that they will get crowded out by the immediate need.</p></speech>

We hear a great deal about how Sl&aacute;intecare needs to be funded within the usual annual budgetary frameworks.</p><p>That says a lot about the absence of political buy-in because if there was political buy-in at the most senior level people would get that this cannot be done within the annual budgetary process and that it needs not just multi-annual funding, but this additional transition fund to shift the provision of healthcare in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is worrying.  The witnesses have been forthright and have called out the areas about which they have worries.  I am going to make one nakedly political point to which I do not expect them to respond, although it is relevant to implementation, and then I have four questions.  The political point is that healthcare has been extremely badly managed at a political level over the last few years.  A lot of that is down to poor implementation and an inability to get things done on the ground - to open up an intensive care unit bed here and there, as required, to make sure that a surgeon gets hired where needed and so forth.  I see that incompetence - and this is my view, I am not transposing it onto the witnesses - rolling into the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and it worries me.</p> <p>  My four questions are as follows.  The public does not really care about Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is a reconfiguration strategy and it is very important for the future of healthcare and Fianna F&aacute;il is fully signed up to it, but the public does not care.  The public cares about getting access to medical care, be it in their home, their local GP clinic, a primary care centre, an acute setting, a rehabilitation setting or wherever else.  There is a danger that, as the focus moves on to this shiny and extremely complex and difficult healthcare transformation, the most important thing, which is getting boys, girls, men and women access to doctors when needed, will slide.  Could the witnesses point us to what they believe are the most important implementation aspects they think will increase access or reduce waiting times quickly?  That is what the public needs.  That is what people are screaming for.  </p> <p>  The second question is on universalism.  Universal healthcare is defined as the ability to access healthcare without incurring undue financial hardship.  Sl&aacute;intecare is ambiguous on this.  It talks about universalism, which does not necessarily mean free, but it also talks about free.  It interchanges those a bit.  The witnesses have raised serious concerns about universal access.  Do their concerns relate both to free access and to universal access as the World Health Organization defines it?  In other words, they seem to be saying they are concerned about the future ability of people to access healthcare for free, based on what they have seen about people's ability to access healthcare without incurring undue financial healthcare would the witnesses be concerned regardless of which definition of universal is used?</p> <p>  My third question is not really covered in the witnesses' assessment but I imagine they will have a view on it.  I have worked on healthcare reform abroad and the single most important thing for healthcare reform to work, assuming one is travelling in broadly the right direction, is the buy-in of doctors.  It is the single most important thing.  If doctors, particularly senior clinicians, do not buy in, healthcare reform tends to fail.  The doctors and their unions are pretty scathing about Sl&aacute;intecare.  These are public statements they have made.  I am sure there are individual doctors who buy into it but at an organisational level they have been heavily resistant to Sl&aacute;intecare, which is something that has to be addressed.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts, reflections or advice for us as an Oireachtas with regard to trying to achieve buy-in for Sl&aacute;intecare and for this implementation at a senior clinical level?</p> <p>  The final question I have is on the costings.  I thank the witnesses for the ones they have done.  As I read the slides, they have done two - the costs of expanding entitlements and the costs of the transition.  Both get to about &euro;3 billion or thereabouts.  Have they done an analysis on the total cost, that is, the cost including the cost of entitlement, the cost of transition, the cost of scaling up and any other costs?  Do they have a total?  Getting to Sara's point, that there is either buy-in for this or there is not, if there was buy-in people would be thinking at a very serious level about deploying very serious resources against this.  I am not seeing that from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, or the Department of Health.  A total figure would be very helpful.  How much do we really need to pour into this, either against the original Sl&aacute;intecare profile or the witnesses' revised one, which is slightly less front-loaded?</p></speech>

Let us start with the last one first.  Shortly after we helped with the production of the Sl&aacute;intecare report we did an overall costing of what it all adds up to together.  It comes to the heady total of approximately &euro;19 billion, but that figure is over ten years.  That has to be taken in the context of likely public expenditure of approximately &euro;200 billion in that context.  If the figure of &euro;19 billion is thrown around it starts to get scary but the fact is, within the context of &euro;200 billion, it is not that big a price ticket, given that we are then engaging with wholesale reform of the system, universalisation and an expansion of entitlements.  The reason we do not present them together in the costings is that they are slightly different things.  The first relates to the annual increment in entitlement expansion while the transition fund refers to the actual amount of money spent.  It is somewhat of a case of apples and oranges, but it is probably around &euro;19 billion.  Again, that has to be put in the context of the overall spend.  That would be my comment on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy spoke specifically about doctors.  In fact, that is very much changing now internationally.  The literature is around healthcare professionals and clinical leaders who are not necessarily doctors.  A really good physiotherapist or occupational therapist can be just as important a clinical leader as a doctor.  There is a strong literature around that and they are needed, but there is also very strong literature around how doctors in particular are often the ones to oppose any type of reform.  Once one begins to do it, most of them come on board but there is significant work to be done by the implementation office around engaging clinical leadership - not just doctors but all healthcare professionals and clinicians across the system - to get behind this plan.  I do not believe that has been done yet and that is why we specified in our opening statement that the aspects in the strategic implementation strategy around public engagement, workforce engagement and, particularly, clinical engagement and around integrating clinical and corporate governance are really key parts that have been missing from the Oireachtas process so far.  That really needs to happen.</p> <p>  Most people go into clinical work of some type or other with the intention of looking after and caring for people.  Most people in the system find their jobs extremely difficult at the moment.  It is really hard.  It is like a case of survival of the fittest.  Providing the best quality of care is an obstacle course.  If it can be demonstrated to the workers providing that care that this is going to be better for the people who use the services, most of them will come on board.  That brings me to the Deputy's first question, which was about the most important aspects of implementation for increasing access and reducing waiting times.  There are two questions in that.  I will deal with increasing access.</p><p> One has to begin showing people the difference that it will make in their lives.  A significant part of Sl&aacute;intecare is shifting care outside of hospitals into the communities and much better primary and social care.  Everybody, not just people with medical cards, needs to be able to access the services without a long wait time and, critically, without a charge.  Whether that is free or low-cost can be determined.  Most of the literature supports the no-cost rather than a low-cost element, particularly if one is trying to get people to use it.  It can be used as an incentive for people to use primary care services.  Suggestions in the original report like universal child care services, early intervention and child health prevention work and universal palliative care are good.  If one uses those aspects, one gets buy-in from the population.  The Deputy is wrong.  I do not think the public knows about Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, if one talks to people about what they want from their health system, then one can get them on board.</p></speech>

They need to know Sl&aacute;intecare by experiencing it, whether that is by cutting some of the charges or whether it is free or low-cost.  It needs to become a reality for people.  The majority of people care about accessing timely and quality health and social care services.  One can get them on board for Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#W00600"><p>That is exactly the point I was making.  The public does not need to be on board for Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is a reconfiguration plan.  One needs clinicians, GPs and the HSE.  What the public wants is timely and affordable access to high-quality care.  I take Dr. Burke's point that it is important to make Sl&aacute;intecare real to the public by reducing costs.  I am asking a slightly different question.  The waiting lists have now got so bad that people are dying while on waiting lists waiting to see doctors.  That is happening.  I am meeting the parents of children who are dying because they cannot get access to surgeons.  That is the reality today.  In Cork, a child will wait three and a half years to get access to special needs intervention.  In St. James's Hospital there is now a six-year wait to see a specialist in urology.  It is getting worse.</p> <p>  I take Dr. Burke's point but I do not fully agree with it that one makes Sl&aacute;intecare real for the public by reducing financial barriers.  I believe we have to make it real for people by cutting down these completely unacceptable waiting lists.  Does Dr. Burke see specifics in Sl&aacute;intecare that would quickly begin to address the waiting times?</p></speech>

There is a strong commitment in Sl&aacute;intecare on the wait time guarantees.  The evidence is from other countries which brought down their waiting times quite significantly.  One needs some kind of mechanism or guarantee whereby people then get an entitlement to care, be it through a strong accountability, as in the NHS, or through vouchers like in Portugal.  Unless one has that accountability that there is a guarantee of care, then the system does not shift, no matter how much money one puts into it.  System reconfiguration is necessary but not sufficient.  One needs that culture of accountability and a culture of much more information availability on waiting times rather than just waiting lists which we do not currently have.  One needs accountability to the public on how long waiting times are and much more accountability on the performance of different providers.  That needs rebuilding.  That is a strong component alongside the system expansion.</p></speech>

We saw the bar chart with the double insurance holders.  Essentially, they are covered by the public system by having a medical card but also continue to pay out of pocket for private health insurance.  For those who do not, we see a large proportion of that spend, which is not affordable, is to access private care.  People cannot wait on the lists.  It is not just an issue of making it more affordable and reducing those charges but also ensuring that people feel well looked after in the public system and they are not paying in a way they cannot afford.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is clear that the care is either free at the point delivery or at the lowest possible cost.  A number of charges have been introduced over the past several years which bring medical cardholders into the fee-paying fold.  We have already designated that these households are not able to afford them.  When we look at the comparison over the years, we see that charges for prescription drugs are driving much of the unaffordable spending for the poorest and most vulnerable households.  It is important to ensure the most vulnerable households are not paying for care they cannot afford.  That is a significant part of their experience of accessing healthcare.  It prevents them from fulfilling their prescriptions and adhering to their medication.  It is a serious problem that we need to address.</p> <p>  On the lowest possible cost, Sl&aacute;intecare does not talk about removing the drug payment threshold but lowering it to a more affordable threshold.  There is not this sense of free care everywhere.  We are an outlier in the European context in that we do not offer free primary care.  People either have basically free GP care or they pay the full cost of it.  Even within the GMS, we know patients are paying for signing off on their disability forms and other small charges to primary care providers at the same time.  We need to ensure that the safety net is doing what it is meant to do.</p></speech>

The real test of it is what will come out of the confidence and supply negotiations on the budget.</p></speech>

I am not the only person who saw it.</p> <p>   My view is that the legislation comes first.  The legislation to entitlements is the driver.  Earlier, the Minister appeared to be putting it the other way around.  When everything is put in place, then and only then are we going to be in a position to legislate for maximum waiting times and entitlements.  That goes against some of what we discussed in the course of our deliberations.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  My view is that if we keep waiting and we cannot get the legislation until everything is perfect, then everything will never be perfect and we will never get the legislation.</p> <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the umbrella body for 90% of the workers in the health services, has a view that Sl&aacute;intecare will be a key factor in recruitment and retention.  It backs Sl&aacute;intecare as a basis for dealing with the recruitment and retention crisis.  Earlier, the Minister and Ms Laura Magahy attended the committee.  They did not seem to have anything new to offer in terms of recruitment and retention and how we can attract new staff.</p><p>To refer to the point made earlier, if we do not get buy-in from healthcare professionals, we will not be able to deliver it.  There are steps that can, and should, be taken by the powers-that-be, specifically the Government and Cabinet, that will show us that there is commitment.  The public may not understand the intricacies of Sl&aacute;intecare but they know what a waiting list is.  They know when they cannot afford to pay for prescriptions.  They know when they are standing in the chemists and have to make a choice between two medications they need but can afford only one.  They understand these situations.  I am curious as to whether the witnesses have any ideas on what can be done at a high level to instil the confidence that might drive some recruitment and retention.  It will not drive all of it but it might drive some level of recruitment and retention.  It might also improve the buy-in from those groups where there is not necessarily buy-in.  Nurses, healthcare professionals and doctors via the IMO have substantially bought in.  There are issues in Sl&aacute;intecare that they do not love but they have some buy-in.  There is clear hostility from other groups and some of this comes from reform fatigue.  Do the witnesses have a view on how this can be driven at a high level to ensure we get buy-in from healthcare professionals?</p></speech>

These have been deliberately built into Sl&aacute;intecare, which is one of the nice aspects of it.  There are wins we can have without a system change that will just make a difference to people's lives, such as lowering prescription charges, removing hospital inpatient charges and lowering the drug reimbursement threshold per single headed households.  These are all overnight wins we can achieve for which we do not need a system response and, therefore, do not need to wait for the system to change.</p> <p>  We do not need to wait for the system to get better before we legislate because there are components we can do now and get into play now.  There are components that have a slower build.  We need to develop a universal primary and community care setting, which is a key issue.  Having quick wins builds trust with the public and investing in the right areas in primary and community care will, hopefully, build trust among providers in the system because they can see where it needs to go, and that we are far too acute focused and we need to have much better non-acute settings.  As we talked about earlier, if we put human resources into this setting and make sure we can make good on some of our commitments, people will start to see a system that is changing and that they can buy into, and this is when it will start to build motivation and morale.</p></speech>

From my read of the strategy, action 6 on "universal eligibility", which is not at term anyone has ever used previously because it is about entitlements, is about reviewing charges and the current eligibility framework, developing a policy proposal and then introducing legislation with no timeline beside it.  In fact, Sl&aacute;intecare outlines clear timelines on legislation, phasing and introduction.  It is a step back in commitment rather than a step forward but it was good to hear the Minister speak about entitlements this morning.</p> <p>  With regard to action 9 on the workforce, there are certain "Sir Humphrey" sections in the implementation strategy, in that they go on and on but do not give up too many specifics on how to move them forward.  Perhaps this is where politicians can come into it to firm up some of these actions to have better commitment in them.</p></speech>

Reference has been made to training an increased number of professionals.  We all agree on this.  The degree to which this can be achieved in the short term, particularly with regard to retention, is something on which we are not so readily agreed because we do not know how to do it.  It has not been shown to us yet.  We are competing on the world market for health professionals and the question that arises immediately is an economic one, which is whether we can afford to compete at the level required to attract the appropriate number of professionals into the system.</p> <p>  I remind people that during the Sl&aacute;intecare committee sittings, I was at pains to point out the battle that goes on in each Department for resources at budget time.  There will always be suspicion among other Departments if one Department is given priority.  The good part of this is the Department of the Taoiseach is involved, which will give an overview to everybody involved and recognition that there are pressing issues in this particular area that need to be dealt with.  There are equally pressing issues in other areas, such as education and housing.  These three areas are fighting for the same resources.  To what extent is it feasible to marry together these three Departments in such a way as they can coexist in a complementary way?  In particular, elements of housing are complementary to health services in numerous ways.  There is the cost and affordability of housing for health professionals and the cost and affordability of housing for patients.</p> <p>  Cost versus vision and entitlement has rightly been referred to.  To what extent do the witnesses see progress being made towards achieving the vision and, at the same time, balancing this with the availability of resources that become available?  We must also keep in mind that, despite the fact considerable strides have been made in turning the economy around, with the public, Government and politicians in general making a major contribution to this at great cost to the public, we still have considerable national debt, and the servicing of this is also considerable at approximately &euro;6 billion per annum.  This must also be brought into the equation.  Is it feasible to weave a path between all these competing issues in a way that will achieve the results we desire under Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

I take on his comments on training.  It takes time.  Human resources are always the slowest to build and they are the most essential ingredient of any health system to work well.  We know we are deficient, particularly in primary and community care where we did not do so well during the austerity years.  We lost more professionals from that area than any other.  We have recovered less well also, whereby there has been more recovery in human resources in acute settings.  Human resources are important and the measures on this in Sl&aacute;intecare are deliberately phased, particularly if we look at some of the elongated phases.  They give us a little more time.  I agree we have to think about what motivates people and what will help to recruit and retain people.  The international literature shows strongly this is down to quite a broad package of various elements.  Salary is one but it is rarely enough by itself.  We need to look at training possibilities, hospital environments and good management.  A broad package of various elements help people to become satisfied.  We need to pay attention to this.</p><p>While we have managed to import our way out of some human resource challenges, we have lost people who moved on because when it came down to it, the terms and conditions did not work out or there were not enough training opportunities.  People felt they were in dead-end positions.  It is clear that is an issue that needs to be examined carefully because that is our key investment.</p><p> I welcome the creation of additional capacity in the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive to examine all the issues around workforce planning.  We need to consider very carefully how we motivate and retain people, which is not just a matter of salary.  Does anyone want to take the second question?  It is a poisoned chalice.</p></speech>

We are only at the starting line, even though the Deputy began that discussion on the committee in June 2016.  In a way, the appointment of Laura Magahy and the setting up of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office is the starting line.  We have been slow to get here, but we have got here.  In terms of costs versus vision, Professor Thomas's slide presentation shows that it is doable but it will require more money.  However, there has to be political will to fund and make it happen.</p></speech>

Everything becomes a waiting list in this country and everywhere else as far as I can see.  The point about waiting lists is that if it is possible to deal with an issue on the first, second or even the 20th day, it avoids a waiting list building up, be it for housing, health services or something else.  There is a already a long waiting list for services and we have to deal with that somehow.  If we are waiting to deal with an existing long waiting list and, at the same time, trying to put in place the structures we all recognise are envisaged, how will that work out?  Have we paid sufficient attention to those long waiting lists?  I am aware the National Treatment Purchase Fund has dealt with some of the cases.  When will we get to a stage where the waiting lists are manageable, that is, where people wait for perhaps two months?  Will it take four, ten, 12 or 20 years?  We need to deal with the amorphous mass and the disappointment and severe pain experienced by patients.  I have tabled D&aacute;il questions over the years seeking information on behalf of constituents, for example, elderly people who are waiting in severe pain for a hip replacement or other procedure.  The replies state it will take X number of years for the person to be seen.  Members often get such replies when trying to deal with the provision of vital services.  This seems to affect this country more than any other.  We must start somewhere by intervening and saying this will be the position from now on and we will hold the line, while at the same time dealing with the long queue at the other side of that line and ensuring it does not build up again.</p></speech>

I am not sure we spend the money well in some cases.  We also push back some expenditures onto the private sector.  There are incentive structures.  We often have a significant amount of dual practice, which can create problems through the different incentives.</p> <p>  I want to come back to the issue of how we manage this problem because we do not have very good information on waiting times.  While we have data on waiting lists, we do not have very good waiting time data.  If we get much more detailed information on waiting times for various procedures in different parts of the country and make that publicly available, politicians can be empowered to start doing something about it.  It is much more difficult to do something to identify the problem when it is hidden behind bad data.  What Sl&aacute;intecare does is provide important investment in ehealth and some of these data systems.  Once the truth starts to come out, it will be much easier to manage it better.</p></speech>

Dr. Sarah Barry, our colleague, spoke about the spinning wheels.  We have address both issues.  We have to bring down waiting times, which are unacceptable and inhumane, but we also have to reform the system to ensure we are addressing the people waiting a long time.  We must start having diagnostics in the community, including providing same day access to general practitioners for tests, quicker elective care and many more services outside hospital.  Once we get that process moving, it can stop the build-up that is happening now.  It is not an either-or situation.  We have to do both.</p></speech>

There has to be a shift away from lists of people waiting to see somebody in a hospital outpatient clinic to being able to meet needs in the community more often.  We are seeing significant demand that we are not able to measure appropriately because we do not have the full numbers on individuals.  Some of those who are waiting are on several lists.  This demand is often channelled into the wrong streams or pots and belong in other places.  We need both the resources to get people into the right places in order that we can meet capacity, while also thinking about how we can make the current system better to ensure it will operate much more efficiently than at present. </p></speech>

I apologise for being late but I had an earlier commitment.  On efficiencies in the HSE and health service, the witnesses referred to medication and access to GPs.  To take the simple example of the cost of drugs and pharmaceuticals, people have access to drugs and pharmaceuticals but do not necessarily use them.  On generic drugs, the changes we have brought about in this area have not delivered significant savings.</p> <p>  We talk about pouring money into the health service without examining areas where we can create efficiencies.  The witnesses spoke about free access to GPs.  Since free GP care was introduced for children aged under six, which is a very welcome scheme, GPs have complained about the number of unnecessary visits they must accommodate.  Likewise, if we increase free access to services, whether for pharmaceuticals or general practice, the question arises as to how we make those services efficient and ensure they are not used unnecessarily.  I am not clear on whether we have examined that issue.</p> <p>  The other issue is efficiencies in our hospital structure.  I deal with many people who work in the medical care sector and I have found there is a serious problem with morale among nursing staff, doctors, junior doctors and consultants.  Many more people are retiring earlier than planned.</p><p>Such are the pressures now being put on people right across the board that they want to get out, and they are getting out three, four and five years earlier than they had planned.  This creates its own problems within the healthcare sector.</p><p> On the issue of consultants, if we want to deal with waiting lists we have to have a lot more people who have the ability to deal with the lists in a timely manner, and at the same time have the backup support.  Over the last three or four years the HSE has taken on more than 12,000 extra people.  I am not sure whether there was an overall plan to see exactly where people were needed and what needed to be prioritised.  It appears to have been a bit hit and miss and a case of whoever could shout the loudest for extra staff got the staff.  I am concerned that we are talking of putting more money into the health service without looking at prioritising from one to ten and asking where it needs to start with staffing and with the inefficiencies.</p><p> I have an issue with the lack of accountability in the health service.  We discussed the patient safety Bill last week and I raised this issue.  When we speak about the patient safety Bill and accountability it is aimed in particular at medical practitioners and nursing staff but I am not satisfied that we have any mechanism within the current structure of the HSE for accountability of managerial staff to the extent that we need.  It is not referred to within the Sl&aacute;intecare report but I may be wrong on this.  I am concerned.</p><p> Another issue that causes huge inefficiencies in the health service is the moving of the deck chairs within HSE management.  I have raised this previously.  I am aware of one hospital that had ten hospital managers in 18 years.  There is a lack of continuity in that process but nobody has asked why people are moving.  Is there a problem with the job or with the pay?  Nobody has looked at the movement of the deck chairs within the management and administration, where people are in a job for 12 months and then they have to move on to another job 12 months later.  If a nurse starts in a position he or she is more likely to be in a particular area for a period of time, and likewise with other medical staff.  There is continuity.  We do not have that continuity in administration.  I do not see where this whole management structure has been examined with regard to rolling out the long-term plan and accountability.  How would the witnesses deal with that?</p><p> Reference was made in the graph to duplication, where some people have medical cards and health insurance, and other people who have neither a medical card nor health insurance.  What are the exact percentages for these groups? I may have missed that and it would be helpful for me to have those percentages.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Steve Thomas" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#Z00200"><p>I do not share all the Senator's concerns about inefficiency, but I hear them.  In the Sl&aacute;intecare report there is quite a large focus on changing the current inefficient system to one that is much more efficient.  My worry is that if we allow the system to just persist as is then the inefficiencies will also persist.  If one looks at what Sl&aacute;intecare is trying to do, it is moving care from where it is currently provided into lower care settings, which is moving it out of acute care settings into community and primary care settings where it is being done much more efficiently, quickly and responsively.  It is changing the skill mix around the delivery of some care where we are not so reliant on doctors to provide care.  We are looking more at alternative provision of different kinds of care.  The free GP and practice nurse access for children aged under six is an interesting case in point.  We need to think creatively about how we provide that care so the system is not unnecessarily burdened, and see if we can we use more practice nurses in that kind of setting.  We need to look at how we do that and think about it creatively.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is about doing things in a low-cost public care setting rather than in a high-cost private care setting.  We presented interesting data last week from EUROSTAT around European healthcare expenditure.  It shows that Ireland is the third most expensive country for voluntary health insurance spending per person.  Ireland is actually the 12th most expensive in terms of Government funding per inhabitant.  We must be careful not to believe the myths some people put out that we are spending far too much money.  It is more about how and where we spend it.  Sl&aacute;intecare is critical to changing the way that is done.  It requires transition and that is quite a difficult process, and sometimes slightly expensive in the short run.  What it then delivers, however, is a system that operates far more efficiently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bridget Johnston" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018100300002#Z00300"><p>Following on from Professor Thomas's comments on efficiency, quite often people will say that we have to charge because if we do not - as the Senator said - then people may not use medication the way they should or they may visit the doctor when they do not need to.  People do not necessarily know when they need care so it is better for them to access it and be sure of what is going on.  It is about weighing the choice between unnecessary utilisation, making sure people do not go to the GP, do not take a drug they do not need or fill a prescription they do not use and crowding out those people who actually need to access care.  We might look to improve efficiency on the one hand but we could end up with a very inefficient outcome in terms of people not accessing care until their problems are quite complex, or accessing the care in a scenario that could have been dealt with much earlier.  We need to be careful.  There is no evidence of a sweet spot for charges that somehow eliminates all the unnecessary utilisation but does not keep people from accessing care they way they need to and in its most appropriate setting.  There is evidence in Ireland that charges prevent people adhering to their medication and keep the poorest and sickest from visiting their GP.  The charges are a direct deterrent.  It is not necessarily true that introducing charges or maintaining charges at all costs will keep utilisation to only the necessary components.  With free GP access there has been an increase in demand because of the access for children under six, and due to the expansion of care, but there is also a call in the Sl&aacute;intecare report for increased primary care capacity and increased GP capacity to meet these needs, along with increased palliative care, home care services and other services to complement those needs.  It is not just up to the GP.  The GP can work with other healthcare professionals in tandem to provide this.</p> <p> On the drugs issue, it is important to note that these medications will not be free under Sl&aacute;intecare, but they are going to be affordable.  People who are on medical cards or GP visit cards, or with other types of safety nets, should not pay a charge that we have already deemed they are unable to afford.  They received a medical card because they are low income, or they have a chronic illness and cannot afford these.  For households that have a certain amount of affordability for these drugs it is proposed that they are not charged more than that.  We have pushed the thresholds up over the last number of years to a level that is not sustainable for many households.</p></speech>

The percentages actually drop when we look at the figures of those with no coverage.  There was 15% of households within that breakdown that could not afford their healthcare.  In 2009-2010 it was nearly 13% of households that could not afford their healthcare expenditure, which was their out of pocket charges and their private health insurance premiums.  The figure was 12.2%, which is illustrated in the yellow section of the document I provided.  This means they had no coverage, neither a medical card nor private health insurance.  This figure dipped to 9.8% in 2015-2016.  This dip comes with a huge health warning, however, because we what we are really capturing is the huge amount of unmet need.  Most households cannot even afford to put themselves into financial hardship because they do not have the money to spend on private care or insurance premiums.  We have good evidence to support the fact that unmet need is growing in Ireland.  A recent survey found that Ireland now has the second highest rate of unmet need for healthcare in the EU with 40.6% of adults over the age of 15 saying they had an unmet need for healthcare in at least the last 12 months due to cost, distance or waiting lists.  Only Latvia is higher than us now.</p></speech>

That is the question.  I am not asking about increased costs or anything else.

There is much to be learned from the case study.  We need to think carefully about what the capacity of the system will look like.  Where people do not necessarily need to go directly to their GP, could care be provided by other healthcare professionals?  There has to be capacity in the system to do that, which is why Sl&aacute;intecare is to invest in it.  It is a case in point to ensure the appropriate learning from the policy.</p></speech>

I agree fully with what has been said, but I spoke to a GP in a community care centre where a physiotherapist is now employed by the HSE.  It was taking anything up to six weeks for the GP to get an appointment for a patient with the physiotherapist.  He could telephone a physiotherapist and get a private appointment within 24 hours.  I agree fully that we need to introduce community care services at a far higher level.  How do we make sure we are delivering services in a timely manner and that it is not just about employing people?  That is also a challenge.</p></speech>

Nobody is arguing about the expansion of free care services or services at low cost.  In the past few years, however, we have seen the expansion of free GP care to those aged under six years - about an extra 240,000 children - persons in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance.  At the same time, there was a reduction of 38% in resources for general practice.  In the case of those aged under six years, what has happened is that the visitation rate has increased and general practice does not have the capacity to deal with the increase.  As a result those aged under six years end up being brought to out-of-hours services which also do not have the capacity to deliver free care services.  The children then end up in emergency departments.  The presentation of children aged under six years in emergency departments has, therefore, increased since they were provided with free GP care.  Children have not got any sicker in that time, but they have an entitlement to free GP care and if they do not receive it in general practice or out of hours, they will present at emergency departments.  Entitlement can be expanded, but it will have that consequence if it is not matched by an expansion of capacity.  Why would an emergency department see more children aged under six years when they have an entitlement to free GP care?  It is because general practice does not have the capacity to take them on.  That is where the policy does not match the practicalities.</p> <p>  We have touched on some aspects of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  Lost in translation, as I put it, has been the funding element and the issue of entitlement versus eligibility and the blurring of the lines in that regard.  There has also been a loss of urgency.  I do not get the impression from the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy that there is urgency.  We are now two and a half years into the process and we still have not seen any policy change.  Are there other elements the delegates can identify that have also been lost in translation?  It is a broad question.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare looks to expand by about 5,000 - 6,000 in its entirety - the number of occupational therapists and public health nurses, but I do not see any indication that that element has been taken on board.  The staffing of primary and community care settings is the critical component that will unlocks so much else if we want to move from providing care in acute care settings.  That has to be a priority, but I do not see it being picked up on.</p></speech>

It is a Bill entitled an Act to make provision in relation to requests for accommodation by homeless families and for that purpose to amend the Housing Act 1988 and to provide for related matters.  I introduced it on First Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 2017.  It was supported and unopposed on Second Stage on 15 November 2017 and referred to the committee.  I have submitted a statement to the committee.  I do not propose to read it in full, but I will go through some elements of it.</p> <p>  We all know that there are wider issues surrounding the provision of housing and homelessness, of which members of the committee are very well aware.  There is a specific need to address the issue of children and families affected by homelessness, particularly in the context of the referendum on the rights of children.  In the context of the wording of the amendment inserted into the Constitution, there is a need to ensure laws are drafted in order that those rights can actually be vindicated in a practical way.  In particular, they would require local authorities and the State generally to recognise the rights of a child in a family unit when applying for accommodation or other forms of assistance.  </p> <p>  We started to draft the Bill following an incident people will remember in which 12 families with 30 children between them could not be accommodated by homeless services in Dublin on 23 May 2017 and were sent to Garda stations because there was nowhere else for them to go.  It has been reported that at least one of the families slept in a public park.  The 30 children had no right to protection, safety or a roof over their heads, except as the dependants of their parents.  Since the Bill was passed on Second Stage, Ms Margaret Cash and her children slept in Tallaght Garda station because they had no alternative.  Whatever disputes we may have about the actual homeless figures, we know that close to 4,000 children are living in homeless accommodation.  We are also aware of the effect this has on children and the fear and anxiety they face, including about losing contact with friends and communities, etc.  </p> <p>  The focus of the Bill is on the perspective of children.  Statistics published by Trinity College Dublin show that 42% of homeless adults are women, many of whom have dependent children in lone-parent households.  It is clear from the research that there are not enough services available to cater for the needs of these families.  This underlines all the more the need to specifically provide protection for the children, as well as their mothers.</p> <p>  Homeless charities have stressed the importance of strengthening the law on families in crisis, but I want to mention Focus Ireland, in particular, because it worked very closely with us in drafting the legislation.  Mr. Wayne Stanley is in the Visitors Gallery.  I also refer to the Mercy Law Resource Centre.  Some members were present at the launch of its most recent report entitled, Children &amp;amp; Homelessness &ndash; A Gap in Legal Protection, when the Ombudsman for Children pointed to the need for legislation to protect children and families affected by homelessness.  I do not know if the committee plans to hold further hearings, but if it does, I suggest Focus Ireland, the Mercy Law Resource Centre and the Ombudsman for Children be invited to appear before it.  It may decide not to do so, but if it does, I recommend that course of action.   </p> <p>  A family who are homeless present to a local authority and a housing assessment is undertaken by a staff member.  If the parents are assessed as homeless under the Act, they may be offered emergency accommodation.  In recent years it has become common practice, particularly in Dublin, to require a family to identify their own emergency accommodation in a hotel or a bed and breakfast, with the local authority's being responsibility reduced to paying for the room.  It is commonly known as self-accommodation.  No assessment is carried out to identify whether the family are capable of securing such a room or the impact of the uncertainty caused on the children.  Over 500 families in Dublin are in self-accommodation without any support from a case worker.  Most such families do secure accommodation, but where this is not possible, some local authorities, particularly in Dublin, provide a number of "contingency beds" which are made available as a last resort.  Where no such rooms are available or they are unsuitable, there are no official guidelines on the advice that should be given to the family or how the incident should be recorded or reported.  </p> <p>  I have provided some detail in the written statement on Focus Ireland and the statistics it has given us.  Most startlingly, it told us that between January and the end of August it had no alternative on 180 occasions but to recommend that families go to a Garda station.  In 21 cases it was confirmed that a family had, in fact, slept in a Garda station.  There was some improvement when contingency beds were provided, but we understand the problem is again becoming acute.  Focus Ireland has told us that a legislative provision to provide direction for local authorities in these difficult circumstances is necessary.  The Bill will also ensure there will be an holistic response in the support of families in hotels and hubs, not only in providing a roof over their heads but also wider supports for the effective functioning of families and the development, welfare and protection of children within the family home.  </p> <p>  I will provide more detail on the technical aspects of the Bill.  In mechanical terms, it is a short Bill, with just one operative section which will insert a new section, to be numbered section 10A, immediately after section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 which relates to the provision of accommodation or other assistance by housing authorities for homeless persons.  Under section 2 of the Act, a person is homeless if he - the Act uses the term "he" rather than "she" - is unable to provide accommodation from his own resources and there is no available accommodation which he, together with any other person who normally resides or might reasonably be expected to reside with him, can reasonably be expected to occupy or remain in.</p><p>This includes cases where persons may be living in a night shelter or similar institution for want of any alternative accommodation.  Under section 10 of the Act, a request for accommodation may be made to the housing authority by or on behalf of a homeless person.  The housing authority may then, subject to ministerial regulations, make arrangements with an approved body to provide accommodation for the homeless person or directly provide the person with appropriate assistance, including financial assistance, or rent accommodation, arrange lodgings or contribute to the cost of accommodation or lodgings for the person.  </p><p> As I said, the Act refers to a person as homeless if there is no accommodation available which he, together with any other person who normally resides with him, or who might reasonably be expected to reside with him, can reasonably be expected to occupy.  There is no explicit recognition in the current scheme of those other persons, as persons in their own right, with entitlement under law.  In 1988, there was no statutory recognition of the needs of a homeless family as a family unit, nor is there any statutory recognition of the constitutional rights of homeless children.  Under the constitutional amendment, the State recognises and affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of all children and it must, as far as practicable, by its laws, protect and vindicate those rights.  That is the crucial outcome we are seeking to achieve today.  The sole purpose of our new section 10A is to oblige housing authorities to recognise persons in accommodation crises as a family unit and to have specific regard to the best interests of the children of homeless families.  </p><p> I do not know how much more time I have.  I can give the committee some more technical information.  </p><p> The new section 10A is headed "Homeless persons and children" and applies where a request for accommodation or other assistance is made to a housing authority by or on behalf of a homeless person when another person who normally resides or who might reasonably be expected to reside with the homeless person is a child.  In such a case the housing authority must, when making a decision on the request, including a decision about whether to provide interim or urgent assistance, recognise the persons concerned as a family unit and must regard the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration.  The housing authority must have particular regard to the need, by practical means, to protect and assist families, including by providing them with safe accommodation in order to support and encourage the effective functioning of families and the development, welfare and protection of children within the family home.</p><p> The language used in section 10A is not original.  The requirement that in certain cases the best interest of the child be regarded as a paramount consideration is to be found both in the constitutional amendment and the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  It is enshrined in Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which provides that in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration.</p><p> Under section 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, the two principal general functions of Tusla are to support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children and to support and encourage the effective functioning of families.  We have borrowed and adapted that language to spell out the approach a housing authority should adopt when dealing with a homeless family in need of assistance.</p><p> I hope that gives the committee some detail on the language used in the Bill.  I am happy to answer any questions. </p></speech>

I fully support the Bill.  It is both eminently sensible and reasonable and I hope we will be able to progress it as speedily as possible given its logic.  I will use the time I have to reinforce the reasons we need this legislation.  I will talk a little about what I am experiencing on the ground in terms of homeless families and children.</p> <p>  Last Tuesday, we had a screening of a film here, "Through the Cracks", which was produced by Ingrid Casey and directed by Luke Daly and Nathan Fagan.  It focused on the experience of two families.  What was most powerful about the movie was we heard not only the voices of the mothers but also those of the children.  It is one of the first times I have directly heard, albeit narrated by actors, children who are living in or who have lived in emergency accommodation, including family hubs, describe what it is like and talk about the impact on them.  It was a very moving session.</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge the reality of referrals of homeless families to Garda stations because there seems to be some level of public denial about this practice.  The figures Deputy O'Sullivan quoted are factually correct and have been widely reported in the media.  There seems to be a lack of clarity about who is responsible for this and what can be done to stop it.</p> <p>  My main concerns are the length of time families with children are spending in emergency accommodation.  I deal with families who have been in emergency accommodation for more than two years.  They started with arrangements lasting from one night to the next, before moving on to hotel placements and then family hubs.  This is particularly the case for larger families because of the difficulties for local authorities in finding suitable accommodation under the housing assistance payment scheme or council allocations for families with four or more children.  We are experiencing families being offered emergency accommodation for only part of their families.  For example, a mother with three or four children will be told she can go to a hotel with two children because it will not accommodate her other two children who will be sent elsewhere, with all the negative impacts that has.  </p> <p>  I do not understand why Tusla will not provide family supports outside of term time.  Tusla will provide Leap cards and other such supports during term time.  When the school term stops and a family is in emergency accommodation, for example, in Swords, Meath or Kildare and they are from the west or south of Dublin, those supports should be provided throughout the year because the family still has to travel to see relatives and access other supports.</p> <p>  I am glad Deputy O'Sullivan raised the issue of self-accommodation.  I do not understand the reason for self-accommodation, other than to reduce the administrative burden on the local authority.  The idea that a person experiencing the trauma of being homeless must ring a long list of hotels every day to secure emergency accommodation makes no sense.  We had a particular difficulty in July and August and early September because of the holiday season.  These are families who have to ring every day.  There is no guarantee of a place.  Some of these families are very vulnerable or have other issues in their lives.  The idea that this is an appropriate mechanism for the allocation of emergency accommodation is wrong.  It leads to relationship breakdown.  I am sure other Deputies have experienced individual cases where a relationship breaks down and then there is the complication of who gets the emergency accommodation and access to the children.  If this was just for a short period, it would be a reasonable proposition but given it could be for a year or two years, it has all sorts of implications for family relationships, particularly at early developmental stages for children.</p> <p>  I have some concerns about data.  For example, we get figures on homeless children in Dublin but we do not get figures for the four local authorities in Dublin.  For this reason, I do not know how many children from the South Dublin County Council area are currently in emergency accommodation because we do not get a breakdown of the overall figure.  That causes all sorts of difficulties.</p> <p>  The value of the Bill is that it would make many of the practices I have highlighted less likely to occur.  It would certainly give those of us who are advocating for families a stronger set of tools to try to ensure those types of practices are weaned out.  </p> <p>  I am not criticising the Bill but there are limitations which are a result of not being able to introduce Opposition Bills that place a charge on the State.  Other jurisdictions have statutory limits on the length of time adults and particularly families with children can spend in emergency accommodation.  Scotland has a 24-week limit and it meets and exceeds it.  </p> <p>  Officials from the Department are present and listening.  We need the Department to seriously consider whether the Government could introduce legislation at some point providing for such legal limits in recognition of the serious developmental damage lengthy stays in emergency accommodation can do.  Focus Ireland launched two significant studies last December which addressed the impact of emergency accommodation on families with children.</p> <p>  We need a much more proactive approach by local authorities in terms of prevention plans before families become homeless.  The largest cause of family homelessness is the use of vacant possession notices to quit.  In many cases we know six months before a family presents as homeless that it will be homeless.  Despite what I hear from some Government Deputies on the floor of the D&aacute;il, when a family presents with a notice to quit, it is told to go away and come back a month before it is given access to homeless housing assistance payments.  It is then told to come back again on the day the notice to quit expires.  That is clearly not an appropriate solution.  </p> <p>  I fully support the Bill.  I would like the committee to consider waiving further scrutiny after we hear what is said today in order that we can progress this as quickly as possible because it would be an important addition to the legislative protections for families with children.</p></speech>

I would like to speak about cases I have dealt with over the past three months and how the Bill might affect them or raise questions in terms of how they might be affected.  The case of Ms Keely Jones in Cork is well known.  Ms Jones chose to go public to highlight her situation.  She has nine children.  She was living in private rented accommodation but she received notice to quit, leaving her and her children homeless.  She spent much of the time over the summer camped in tents on the beach in Youghal with six of her children.  They slept in travel cots and on air mattresses.  Ms Jones then chose to go public to highlight her case.  As I understand it, this Bill would not guarantee Ms Jones accommodation but it would mean that the authorities would have to take into account her nine children when assessing what happens next.  If this is an additional point of pressure on the authorities, however small, I welcome it.  It is also the main reason for supporting the Bill.</p> <p>  My questions are about people who are already in emergency accommodation and the local authorities' approach to these people.  I will give two examples.  First, on a Monday afternoon a couple of months ago, a man walked into my clinic.  He had been staying with his wife and children in emergency accommodation - I think it was bed and breakfast accommodation - funded by the State and during that time he had been offered accommodation under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  The HAP accommodation was unsuitable from the point of view of location.  It is a long story but it was a totally unsuitable location for the family.  Nobody in authority told him that there was a penalty for refusing an offer of accommodation, so he refused in the hope of getting something better.  He was then told by homeless services that he would have to vacate the emergency accommodation because the State would no longer pay for it as he had refused HAP accommodation.  He appealed that decision and lost.  He then showed up at my clinic.  On the afternoon of the day he was due to vacate the bed and breakfast accommodation, the State financial support for the accommodation was to cease, affecting him, his wife and their two children.  The children are twins aged ten months old.  At this point, the choice for this family was to spend a night sleeping on the streets of Cork or in a Garda station.  Thankfully, following some engagement with homeless services the family got a stay of execution, so to speak.  Will this Bill deter homeless services making a decision to cut off financial support for accommodation?  I presume it does not bar them from making the type of decision made in this case, which was a bad decision in my opinion.  Does it apply to this scenario as opposed to a scenario in which emergency accommodation is sought but has not yet been acquired?</p> <p>  The second example is a case brought to my attention this week involving a woman who has been homeless since March 2017 and living in emergency accommodation for 11 months.  She has a husband and four children, including a baby girl aged one and a child with autism.  She has been told that she can only remain in emergency accommodation for 12 months.  She has one month before she faces eviction form emergency accommodation with her children if the council, or she, does not find other suitable accommodation in the interim, which will be difficult owing to the housing crisis and the size of the family.  What impact will this Bill have on this woman's rights and her children's rights? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018100300002#E00200"><p>I support the Bill.  Earlier this week we heard the story of a woman in emergency accommodation delivering stillborn twins, which is horrific.  It is frightening that this is happening in 2018.  We must ensure this does not happen again.  The point was made to me recently that a generation of children are growing up thinking that "no fixed abode" is an address.  Children in homelessness have no home address and they think this is normal.  It is not.  We have to ensure that in the future we do not have children or families in emergency accommodation such as family hubs and hotels.  Reports on families in the hubs and emergency accommodation such as hotels cite stress, arguments and feelings of hopelessness among families and children.  This is unacceptable.  Worryingly, the homeless crisis continues.  Every day we wake up to stories of another family being made homeless.  This is unacceptable.</p> <p>  There are 31 local authorities.  Every one of them has the means to deal with homelessness.  In Carlow, when a person or family presents as homeless the local authority secures accommodation for them.  However, like other local authorities Carlow County Council does not have emergency accommodation units and so there is nowhere to accommodate people other than in a hotel.  While I welcome the Bill, what we need is secure accommodation for homeless families and children.  We need houses and emergency units such that if a person or family presents at my clinic at night or over the weekend there is somewhere I can send them.  In some local authorities it is hard to access a service for homeless people.  We need to address this issue.</p> <p>  Reference was made to official guidelines.  It is crucial that every local authority has official guidelines on homelessness, particularly for children.  The main factors in regard to homelessness are high rents and a lack of housing.  Unless we address these issues, the crisis will worsen.  As I said, I support the Bill but I believe we need proper guidelines in every local authority in order that every local authority is accountable for every family that seeks assistance from it.  We have to ensure that people who find themselves in an accommodation crisis on a Friday evening or at the weekend have access to a 24-7 service.</p> <p>  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to the issue of cost in terms of what is proposed in the Bill.  Cost is a major factor in the homelessness crisis.  The Deputy is correct that we need to ensure this legislation is not held up on the basis of cost.  I firmly believe that when it comes to the delivery of housing, children with disabilities and access to disability grants and so on the main issue is funding.  We have to make sure this Bill proceeds to ensure there will be more accommodation available to families and children in homelessness.</p><p>It will be a good Bill and I will fully support it.</p></speech>

This is worthwhile, appropriate and timely legislation.  I find that the people who are coming to my clinic now get a home when their eldest child is, at minimum, almost nine years old.  They have been waiting for a home for nine years.  In many cases, they have had a very difficult life.  They are initially living at home with one parent or the other.  They move into accommodation and then in many cases they become homeless.  I saw a family this week with three children who were living in bed and breakfast accommodation.  They were walking the streets all day.  When they came in to me, the children were absolutely exhausted and fell asleep in my office.  I contacted the local authority and we helped them as best we could.  The trauma homelessness is visiting upon young children in particular is entirely unacceptable in a modern democracy.</p> <p>  I welcome the work the Minister is doing, the &euro;6 billion that has been ring-fenced for housing and the significant increase in house building in my area.  However, we need to do other things to prevent homelessness.  One of them is increasing tenants' rights in terms of occupancy.  I would support a freeze on all notices to quit, in other words, that tenants could not be put out of rented accommodation provided they are paying rent and are reasonably up to date and provided there is not evidence of anti-social behaviour through the local authority or another State agency.  In the crisis that we have, the rights of individuals who are in occupation and paying rent should be sacrosanct and should be placed above the rights of the landlord for at least two years, until the housing crisis is dealt with.  That will give security, provided the tenants are paying the rent and are not causing anti-social issues.</p> <p>  Years ago, the local authority was very helpful and had the time and capacity to meet housing applicants to talk about their issues.  That is all gone now.  People are told when they go in that they are to come back in five, six, seven or eight years.  The listening part of life is probably falling to the voluntary and homeless organisations, and we need to make sure that there is adequate and proper resources for them to help families in a very broad sense on this homeless path.  I know we have family hubs and I welcome them.  However, if people are in bed and breakfast accommodation, where do they go with their children during the day?  There is no appropriate place for them to go.  We need to look at that as well.  We should have warm, well-heated accommodation for them to go into during the day to have as normal a family life as they can in the very difficult position they are in.  </p> <p>  The proposed legislation is very timely.  Much is being done but we need to do an awful lot more.  Supporting this Bill will help people who need housing and will push the agenda forward.</p></speech>

On a general point, my party has published ten Bills, some of which have completed Second Stage, although most have not gone much further.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, talks about listening to the Opposition and asks it to come forward with its ideas.  I do not think we have had any element of an Opposition housing Bill even pass through the D&aacute;il, let alone the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  We supported Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's very worthwhile Bill on Second Stage.  My concern is that we are just going through the motions.  We produce legislation and speak on it on Second Stage and it then gets to pre-legislative scrutiny.  However, I do not know where it goes to after that.  We have to prioritise some of these Bills to try to ensure they pass the D&aacute;il.  The Seanad is then another matter.</p> <p>  Recognising a group of people as a family unit and prioritising children is crucially important.  I agree wholeheartedly on that.  The Deputy referred to Margaret Cash, and she was not the first mam - or dad, indeed - to have to sleep in a Garda station with her or his kids.  I wrote directly to the Minister at the time and asked him to establish a time-bound task force on child and family homelessness.  It would take six to eight weeks to bring the stakeholders together and see what is needed, including whether we need legislation like this.  I think we do need it because this is a priority that we have to drive.</p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill.  We have other legislation which would complement it and which we will publish next week.  It will be an addition to this Bill.  My only question is about the Deputy's interaction with the Department and the Minister.  Is she in any way confident that this can go to the next Stage and that we can clear Committee, Report and Final Stages?  I hope she is.  What sense does she get from the Department?</p> <p>  I could go through different testimonies, as others have done, which we are all receiving.  We are all meeting people every single day of the week.  The housing crisis is not getting better.  Certainly for families and children it is a massive issue and we have to work together in the Oireachtas to resolve it.  That is why I urge Government to look in real terms at Opposition Bills, take them on board and enact them.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for bringing the legislation to the committee.  If this Bill passes, what will change the following day?  What is the difference between it and the 1988 Act?  The committee has been invited to visit numerous supports that are provided for homeless families in emergency accommodation, such as family hubs, wet and dry hostels and the physical and mental support services that are provided to families in very difficult situations.  One or two of us have gone on those visits although for various reasons other members could not go.  I was made very aware of the support services that are provided within the family hubs.  Although they vary, they are generally similar, whether they are the physical supports of supporting a family and all that encompasses, a place finder who works with them to find accommodation, or somebody to look after their children while they visit accommodation to see if it is suitable.  There are 22 place finders within the various local authorities.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien is right that we all have people regularly attending our clinics.  Some of us choose to keep those visits confidential, deal with the families appropriately and help them in the way that we deem suitable in the circumstances.   I will not name people here as it would not be appropriate to do so.  I would prefer to give people their dignity and respect and keep it confidential when they visit me.  I have met people who tell me they have been advised not to take HAP or go into a family hub or other type of accommodation being offered to them and instead, for whatever reason, to stay in a hotel.  My fear is that they are not getting this advice from a person who is qualified or experienced to give it.  There is a lot of misleading information out there that preys on vulnerable people when they need support.  That is my fear.  I do not know if that issue will be covered in this Bill in any shape or form.  I know a great deal of work is being done to give people the right information about what services are available to them.</p> <p>  Within six weeks of the Mater Dei family hub opening, 13 families had left because we found accommodation for them.  This is a better way of finding accommodation that is suitable to an individual or family.  Nobody ever said family hubs were the answer.  They are for the interim.  Likewise, nobody ever says where we will house families and individuals while we get supply up and running.  That is the pinch point in the system.</p> <p>  We all have various stories that we could bring here, all tragic and involving people in vulnerable situations.  However, this committee is about finding solutions for people.  I welcome Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's Bill.</p><p>What would change tomorrow if the Bill passes and what would the differences be <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the 1988 Act?  Section 1 proposes to insert a new section 10A(b) with the words, &quot;another person who normally resides, or who might reasonably be expected to reside, with the homeless person is a child,&quot;.  Is something missing from that line?  It is a technicality and I do not need an answer now.</p></speech>

For that to be real there has to be legislation to give children and their families the opportunity to vindicate their rights.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Senator Murnane O'Connor asked how far we can go with an Opposition Bill.  We cannot cause a cost to the Exchequer so I would be delighted if the Department and the Minister strengthened the Bill because the Minister can bring forward legislation which has a cost to the Exchequer.  We all want to achieve stronger rights for families.  Whether that means the Government bringing forward legislation or amending my legislation to make it stronger, it is fine with me.  Deputy O'Brien asked about interactions with the Department and I hope it will give a positive response.  The indications are that it will but, as is often the case, it may have issues with the language we put into legislation.  I hope it will be strengthened rather than rejected.  I take Deputy O'Brien's point that there are a large number of Opposition Bills.  This Bill was published approximately a year ago.</p> <p>  I would love to have been able to put statutory limits into the legislation, as they have in Scotland, but I could not do so as an Opposition Member as it would not have got through.  The Chairman and Senator Murnane O'Connor asked what difference the Bill would make.  It would require guidelines and protocols for all local authorities to follow.  Focus Ireland and other charities have given guidelines to staff on how to deal with people who present as homeless but the Bill will immediately oblige the State and the Department to provide clear guidelines and protocols on how front-line staff should respond when people present as homeless.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry asked about people who were already in emergency accommodation and the Bill covers that, with the following proposal for a new section 10A(b)(iii) that the housing authority should have particular regard to the need by practical means to protect and assist families, including by providing them with safe accommodation, in order to support and encourage the effective functioning of families, and the development, welfare and protection of children within a family home.  In this way it deals with people who are already in emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  The case of one specific separated family was referred to, where the mother was sleeping in a tent, and the case of Margaret Cash was mentioned by Deputy O'Brien.  In both cases the reference to "family unit" in subsection (b)(i) of the new section deals with where the accommodation provided is not big enough.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd referred to tenants' rights.  We all agree that we need to strengthen tenants' rights in general and I believe every Opposition party has now published legislation to strengthen tenants' rights.  I agree with the Deputy but separate legislation is required for that.</p></speech>

I have recently had cases where I rang the local authority and was told it had to set up meetings with Focus Ireland.  One cannot just go to see the charity.  This is not working as it should and it cannot be right to have to go to one's local authority and request a meeting.  We might bring Focus Ireland before the committee for a meeting on this subject and I will speak to Mary Hurley about it too.  This does not address the needs of homeless people.

I am accompanied by my colleague Mr. David Kelly, principal officer with responsibility for the homelessness and housing inclusion supports division of the Department.  </p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to outline the existing provisions under the Housing Acts for the welfare of children and families who are experiencing homelessness.  I also welcome the opportunity to update the committee on the Department&rsquo;s work in supporting families who are experiencing homelessness.</p> <p>  The existing provisions of the Housing Act 1988 set out the requirement for a person or household to be regarded as homeless by a housing authority for the purposes of the Act.  Under its provisions, it is a matter for the housing authority concerned to determine whether a person is to be regarded as homeless.  In the case of any person determined to be homeless, the housing authority seeks to put in place the most appropriate immediate accommodation response which it may arrange or which may be operated by a State-funded service provider without the requirement for the person to undergo a social housing assessment and be approved for social housing supports.</p> <p>  The existing system generally has provided for the emergency accommodation needs of homeless families with children at a time when significant numbers of families have been presenting to services.  The current homeless assessment arrangements give housing authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of individuals and families who present to them and housing authorities make every reasonable effort to address their accommodation needs.  While every case that presents to homeless services is different, housing authorities always endeavour to ensure the response they provide is the most appropriate to the particular circumstances of each case.</p> <p>  As I have set out, statutory responsibility for the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual local authorities.  The Department&rsquo;s role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of local authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Funding is provided for local authorities on a regional basis.  Regional allocations are delegated to a lead local authority in each of the nine local authority regions.  Under these arrangements responsibility for assessment and decision-making on the funding of services rests with the relevant regional lead authority.  The allocations are made and overseen in accordance with protocols agreed between the Department and the lead local authorities.</p> <p>  With the increase in the incidence of homelessness in recent years, the Government has increased the funding available to the Department for the provision of homeless services.  In 2018 it provided Exchequer funding of &euro;116 million for the provision of homeless services, an 18% increase on the 2017 budget allocation.  This funding is allocated to local authorities to fund the operational cost of providing homeless services.  Under the statutory arrangements in place, the local authorities are required to fund a minimum of 10% of the operational costs from their own resources.  A significant proportion of this funding is for the provision of accommodation for families experiencing homelessness, including those in hotels and, increasingly, family hubs.</p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland - the action plan for housing and homelessness - includes a range of measures to support families experiencing homelessness.  The plan recognises that hotels are not a suitable or secure medium to long-term accommodation option for families.  In 2017 the Department began working with the local authorities in the development of family hubs in a number of areas.  Family hubs provide a more appropriate short-term solution in accommodating families who are experiencing homelessness by providing cooking and laundry facilities, with greater space for recreational activities, as well as other family-centred supports.  Families in hubs are supported by the local authorities to identify and secure independent tenancies.  There are 22 family hubs in operation across the country which provide approximately 550 units of family accommodation.  The Department is working with the local authorities to deliver further family hubs and making available the necessary capital funding.  In that regard, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, recently wrote to the local authorities to request that they bring forward and accelerate as a matter of urgency the provision of additional family hubs.</p> <p>  The Department is also working closely with the local authorities on the homeless HAP place-finder programme.  The programme was made available to all local authorities earlier this year and the Department has approved funding for 22 place-finder officers in local authorities nationally.  The place-finder officers work with families who are experiencing homelessness to identify a tenancy in the private rented sector and can provide financial support by way of rent deposit and advance rent payments.</p> <p>  Supporting families who are experiencing homelessness is a priority for the Department.  We work closely with our counterparts in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla.  This includes working together on the interagency group which was established by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in 2017 to ensure the State&rsquo;s response to homelessness was co-ordinated effectively.  Last week at this committee the Minister reaffirmed his commitment and priority to tackling homelessness.  While significant numbers of families and individuals continue to present as homeless, record levels of individuals and families are being supported out of homelessness, with 4,729 adults exiting homelessness into independent tenancies in 2017 and a further 2,332 in the first half of 2018.  The Department, with its local authority colleagues, will continue to work and support families and other households who are experiencing homelessness, with a view to ensuring they can secure long-term sustainable housing solutions as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  My colleague Mr. David Kelly and I will be happy to answer questions about any issue which arises.</p></speech>

It was more of a description of what the Department was doing, which I understand.  Obviously Ms Hurley is an official in the Department and not the Minister who makes policy.  I will quote one sentence from her contribution: "The Department&rsquo;s role involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of local authorities in addressing homelessness at local level."  My concern in the context of the Bill I am bringing forward is the issue of policy and legislation.  </p> <p>  Ms Hurley spoke about funding.  Many here would question why people are still slipping through the net, as we have seen when families are separated and people are sent to Garda stations.  Families are definitely still slipping through the net.  There is no legal underpinning of the rights of children following the constitutional referendum.  I am not sure if the officials can even answer the question.</p> <p>  My main question relates to the intention to provide legislation and a framework of policy to not just recognise that local authorities which are clustered for the purposes of spending money on homeless services have a responsibility but also to ensure the State will have both a legislative and policy framework and protocols in terms of practice, thereby avoiding, as described, different local authorities having different practices and not having clarity about what exactly happens when a family presents as homeless.  I gave the example of Scotland where there are statutory limits for being accommodated out of emergency accommodation.  I recognise that those present are officials rather than the political heads of Departments, but it is essential for us get that kind of direction.  I will certainly pursue the matter further either through my legislation or legislation initiated by the Government.  With others, I believe there is a gap.  The comprehensive document from the Mercy Law Resource Centre indicates that we need legislation to underpin the rights of children and families when they present as homeless.</p></speech>

I have some factual questions as Ms Hurley is not here to give her personal opinion but the information we require.</p><p> There appears to be some confusion in the public arena about the number of exits from homelessness in the last year, of people who were in emergency accommodation but who have been assisted out of it.  Will Mr. Hurley give us the most up-to-date figure for such exits, separate from preventions?  Perhaps she might have figures for preventions, for people accessing the homeless HAP before their notice to quit date is up or not.  That would be helpful because I heard some Government spokespeople - I presume mistakenly - adding the two figures together.  It would be good to know the numbers of exits and preventions.</p><p> One of the fears some of us have is that while it is right and proper to improve the quality of emergency accommodation for families and children, there is not enough of a focus on prevention, of the difficulties we are having with the rental accommodation scheme in Dublin, where hundreds of RAS leases are coming to an end because the landlords are having difficulty with the scheme, or the continuing problem presented by vacant possession notices to quit that are pushing families into homelessness.  Is the Minister or the Department considering other actions to ensure prevention?  While it is right and proper to have more and better quality emergency accommodation, it would be even better if we could try to prevent families from becoming homeless in the first place.</p><p> Is the Department tracking the length of time families with children are spending in emergency accommodation from the moment they present to when they exit?  If so, can we be given data?  Is Ms Hurley aware of the difficulties members of the committee have raised about the acute problem larger families face in accessing emergency accommodation and, when they get into such accommodation, exiting it owing to the lack of larger four-bedroom properties in the rental market or council stock?</p><p> On the issue of supports for families with children outside school hours, has the Department raised it with Tusla?  If not, is it something it could raise with it?  It appears to be punitive that one receives a support during school time but not outside it.  It would be valuable to raise the issue.  </p><p> Has the Department examined or considered the statutory time limits in place in other jurisdictions for the length of time families spend in emergency accommodation, Scotland being one?  In addition, important legislation was enacted in England and Wales earlier this year which places a statutory obligation on local authorities to put a prevention plan in place 48 days prior to a family becoming homeless.  Is this something the Department has considered and, if so, does Ms Hurley have a view on it?</p><p> With regard to seeking accommodation in Garda stations, it would be helpful to have clarity on the facts.  In her presentation Deputy Jan O'Sullivan outlined the information as we understood it.  What is confusing some among the public is whether there is a protocol in place for the referral of families to Garda stations if there is no emergency accommodation available by a certain time.  Is it a departmental protocol, a DRHE protocol or a protocol developed by the voluntary sector?  In its absence, what is the Department's view of such a protocol?  Is Ms Hurley satisfied that after the spike in the number of referrals to Garda stations, there are sufficient contingency beds available to prevent it from happening?  Have there been other referrals to Garda stations since the spike in August?  Any other information Ms Hurley could give us would be very helpful.</p></speech>

I have a question about the allocation of &euro;116 million for the provision of homelessness services which represent an 18% increase on the allocation for 2017.  May we have a breakdown for all of the local authorities?  It is important to know where the money was spent in each of the 31 local authorities.  </p> <p>  Does the Department have guidelines?  Ms Hurley has said several times that it all goes back to the local authorities.  When a homeless person presents to a local authority, it is up to it to deal with him or her.  Does every local authority have guidelines in place?  That is an important point.  My understanding is that a person one local authority will describe as homeless is not considered as such by another.  </p> <p>  Another very important issue raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan was that of advice.  Are there people who will give it?</p> <p>  Ms Hurley spoke about the 22 family hubs, which should not be necessary, but it is good that we have them.  They provide 550 family units.  In the case of other local authorities such as my local authority in Carlow, is there a protocol for them to provide emergency accommodation?  Will the officials tell me what the local authority in Carlow has by way of emergency accommodation?  We do not have hubs or other accommodation in which we can put people.  If it is accommodation in a refuge that is needed, we must go to Tusla or the health service on behalf of the mother and the children.  As I realise this is Mr. Kelly's area of responsibility, what is in place in each local authority area?  It is important to mention the 31 local authorities because they have a massive role to play in dealing with this issue which affects people's lives so much.  What plan is in place in every local authority to provide emergency accommodation when it does not have housing and other accommodation available?</p> <p>  I note that funding was provided to have 22 place-finder officers available in the local authorities.  As there are 31 local authorities, why is the number only 22?  I have a great interest in this area.  We talk about the HAP and other schemes, but every local authority deals with homelessness.  Some are dealing with higher numbers than others, but it is important that every local authority be treated the same.  </p> <p>  Ms Hurley spoke about the HAP scheme.  I have massive concerns which I have raised previously with the officials.  Having rent pressure zones in certain local authority areas and not in others is not going to work.  It is not possible for the scheme to work when in neighbouring counties there are rent pressure zones, as in the case of County Carlow.  The HAP scheme is fine and a change from the rent allowance scheme, but it must be examined.  HAP scheme tenants need more security because they are at the mercy of landlords.  That is the reality.  If a landlord decides to sell, the tenant is given three months' notice, depending on how long he or she has been in the property.  This issue must be addressed.</p> <p>  It also worries me that the Department has only built 500 local authority houses this year.  It is a worry in the sense that-----</p></speech>

From the Department's perspective, the principle of her Bill - the prioritisation of the protection of children and families - is a key objective.  What I have tried to set out are the protections and provisions in existing legislation.  The 1988 Act enables local authorities to deal with families with children who present and place them in accommodation.  We meet regularly with the local authorities and the regional heads to discuss the operation of the legislation, under which the local authorities are able to meet the needs of families and place them in emergency accommodation.  However, the thrust of the Bill - it will be a matter for the Oireachtas to debate it - in seeking to look after families and ensuring they are in appropriate accommodation has been taken on board.</p> <p>  On procedures, the 1988 Act is in place and the Department issues regular guidance on how things should operate at local level when somebody presents as homeless.  In Dublin, for example, the DRHE has documented procedures for what is to happen from when a person walks through the door and presents as homeless.  There are various steps to be taken along the way in dealing with families who present.  We work with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla and there are protocols in place, particularly on child protection.  We are very focused on that issue to ensure that when families are placed in emergency accommodation, it is both appropriate and safe.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin has raised the issue of the quality framework on several occasions and that forms part of it.  The quality of the accommodation is something we focus on.  The procedural operation of the Housing Act 1988 is something we focus on and the issues the Deputy raised in the Bill are ones we will work on as well in terms of the general principles.  We are probably on the same page.  When the Bill moves through the Oireachtas it will be up to the Oireachtas to consider it but in terms of families and children, through our work with the inter-agency group which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, established, through the various schemes and structures with which we have to deal with local authorities and through the funding we provide for emergency accommodation, we are certainly very focused on ensuring that children should be accommodated in an appropriate manner.</p><p> Some of the questions Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised sit well with the questions raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  He raised questions about prevention in particular.  With the increasing number we are seeing coming through the doors, prevention is something that we are very focused on at the moment.  We are always looking at new ways of trying to prevent families from going into emergency accommodation.  On the place finder service, which Senator Murnane O'Connor raised, we have offered it to all local authorities.  Some 22 of the 31 local authorities have taken it up but it is there for everybody and for each local authority.  We see that as being critical because with a proper place finder service in place, if people present when they get their notice to quit, they should be able to work with the place finder service to find accommodation.  One of the issues I will follow up on is the issue Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised whereby people are being told to come back a month later.  That is something I will follow up on but in terms of prevention, we see place finder, and dealing with families at an early stage, as important.  There are also a range of supports that have been put in place at local authority level, so that when families present there is engagement with them and with their family in situations where they are living in the family home.  There are community and social supports in place as well.  Prevention will certainly be something we will focus on more.  There are a number of prevention actions in place at the moment but it is something the Minister is very keen that we would focus on.</p><p> On tracking the length of time in emergency accommodation, we know that 48% of families are spending fewer than six months in emergency accommodation and we want-----</p></speech>

It presents challenges when large families present.  It is very rare that families would be split up.  If they present very late in the day, local authority workers will do their best to try to keep them together and if it is not possible that night, they will work to bring them together as quickly as possible but it can be very challenging when a very large family presents.  It is something we are looking at in the delivery in our social housing programme so that we have that stock of large homes.  We have asked the place finder service to go after it in terms of HAP properties for those large families.  We regularly meet the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, about this.  It is very rare for the family unit to be separated and largely happens where a family presents who do not have identification and the local authority is not certain about the family unit.</p> <p>  On the quality of emergency accommodation, hubs obviously provide a much more secure and better quality of accommodation.  We have been working to finalise the quality framework on all emergency accommodation but one of the issues that we are very focused on in the Department and at local authority level is to ensure the correct supports are in place in the accommodation we roll out.  I know Senator Murnane O'Connor, Deputy &Oacute; Broin and the Chair have been out to the Mater Dei hub and to other hubs and the physical quality of the premises along with the child and social supports there are immense.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised the Homeless Reduction Act 2017 in the United Kingdom.  We have met our opposite numbers in the UK about it and it is something we are looking at.  There are interesting issues in it and we are teasing some of them out.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Kelly to refer to the issues around numbers.  He has been working very closely with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, and he works with the regional heads on exits and the Garda stations.  Before I pass over to Mr. Kelly, I refer to a question from Senator Murnane O'Connor.  We can certainly set out how our funding is allocated and what the spend is.  On emergency accommodation in Carlow, the practice where there is not a hub or a State facility is to refer somebody to a hotel.  That is the current practice.  There is no hub in Carlow so a person who presents there would certainly have his or her needs taken care of but it would be in hotel accommodation or some other form of emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

It causes problems because they are back and we have to try to find HAP for them.  In the long term we might need to look at getting a hub or somewhere stable for a few months so that we can find a place for a family or whoever it may be because the short timescale of the bed and breakfast-type accommodation is causing problems.  Ms Hurley knows it is not nice to have children going into bed and breakfast accommodation or a hotel in their school uniforms, so I ask that the Department look at this for Carlow.  We need something short term so that people can stay longer than the few nights they can currently stay in a bed and breakfast or a hotel.</p></speech>

We provide that guidance to local authorities but local authorities are the statutory housing authorities so it is a matter for them to implement those recommendations or schemes based on the need that exists in their local area.</p></speech>

With this emergency, every local authority should have this in place to get children and families back into homes.  That is something we all need to look at.  Every local authority needs to focus on this because it is crucial that every one of them takes this up.</p></speech>

We also have a small number of local authorities where homelessness would not be an issue.  We probably do not need to fund place finder officers in each of the local authorities.</p></speech>

Two questions were not answered - one concerning the Garda stations and the other on whether there has been engagement with Tusla about the supports for families outside of term time.</p> <p>  I do not doubt for a second that Ms Hurley genuinely believes when she says local authorities are able to meet the needs of families and place them in emergency accommodation.  All I would like her to take away from this - this is pertinent to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's Bill and is one of the reasons she proposed the Bill - is that the experience of many of us is that is not the case.  It is not because the local authorities are not trying.  It is either because emergency accommodation is not available and, therefore, the local authority is not placing anybody anywhere.  The local authority is giving a list of hotels and telling the families to self-accommodate.  The self-accommodation can take quite a long time, forcing families with children to overhold and get into very difficult legal situations with their landlords.  Even when they are in the emergency accommodation - August was a particularly acute point but it was not the only time - people fall in and out of the emergency accommodation placement they are in because of hotel beds not becoming available, etc.</p> <p>  I am aware Ms Hurley cannot comment on this from a political point of view but all I would ask her to consider is that the reason Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is looking to strengthen the child focus of the homeless legislation is because we all have large numbers of examples where the current framework is not strong enough.  If this Bill was to go through, we believe it would give that extra focus.</p> <p>  I would be interested in responses to the questions on the Garda stations and the Tusla supports.</p></speech>

We need to bring that right down.  We are all agreed on that.  That is why he has been driving a very ambitious hub programme, particularly with the Dublin local authorities over the past few months.  We are working with the Dublin local authorities to try to put in place a robust programme around hubs.  That means that when families present they are not going to try to self-accommodate themselves or directly into a hotel.  We are all agreed that self-accommodation is something we need to bring to reduce and bring to a close.</p> <p>  On capacity during August, the Minister put in place a working group around the Papal visit.  We knew we were going to come under significant pressure during August in respect of accommodation and visitors and tourists coming into the city.  We put in place and brought forward a number of contingency rooms and beds for people who would present.  They are still in place so there is capacity.  Only this week we discussed this with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, which has confirmed that there is capacity for families who present at the moment.  That additional accommodation we brought in during August is still in place.  It is saying it can accommodate people who present now.  If people present early, it makes it easier to place them.  It is the late presentations that create significant challenges to the system, when somebody comes in late in the evening, and people are trying to find accommodation for them.  There is spare capacity in the system at the moment, as confirmed by DRHE.  The working group the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, established around additional accommodation and beds has really paid off because we have retained the accommodation in the system so there is capacity.  I checked this morning and there is those spare rooms in the system.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Kelly now.  We are all on the same page as to self-accommodation which is why the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is driving the ambitious hub programme.  As to capacity, nobody should have to spend the night in a Garda station as we have the capacity in the Dublin region at the moment in terms of beds, and that is where the pressure is.</p></speech>

At that point, a decision is being made that there are no emergency beds.  I am confused because everybody is denying there is a protocol in place on this, but clearly something is going on.  What is Mr. Kelly's understanding of that situation where a family with children, late into the evening, has not been placed in emergency accommodation and is referred by the intake team to the Garda station?  Is Mr. Kelly aware of that protocol?  Is that a protocol that has been agreed with the Department and with the DRHE?</p><p>Has this been communicated to garda&iacute;?

Rather than establishing bespoke services for families in emergency accommodation, part of Tusla's objective is to link them with existing services such as family resource centres.  It is something we can discuss with Tusla, but it is not our understanding services stop outside school terms.</p></speech>

One of the services that does stop is provision of a Leap card.  For example, a family living in emergency accommodation in Swords whose children go to school in Clondalkin receive a Leap card but only during term time.  There was a real problem during the summer.  Naturally, during the summer the family in the example given would want to travel to Clondalkin to be with those in their support networks and the friends of their children, but they would have to bear the cost in doing so.  It would be a small consideration and I ask Mr. Kelly to raise the issue with Tusla.  It would not add an awful lot to the bill to add the extra three or four months and it would make a huge difference to the families in question.  I have written to Tusla about it and have to say the replies to parliamentary questions have not been very encouraging.  I cannot see why a valuable support such as this is provided during school time but not outside it.</p></speech>

I will talk mostly about the idea of community policing, although I am happy to answer questions on rural crime also.  During my involvement with the Commission on the Future of Policing, it received many submissions on rural crime.  In that context, it must be recognised that rural communities have a role to play in policing their areas in conjunction with the Garda and other participants.</p> <p>  Community policing is a philosophy of policing that promotes community-based problem-solving strategies to address the underlying causes of crime and disorder and fear of crime, and which provides reassurance.  Many community policing approaches involve the police performing a role in addressing community problems which may not be directly related to crime.  Problem-solving policing reorients the police role away from an exclusive focus on the crime.  Problems, not crime, become the organising core of police activity.  The concern is with preventing future harm.  Similarly, solutions can be broader than simple law enforcement and can involve the participation of other agencies, such as housing or health agencies.  Furthermore, the criminal law becomes only one means of addressing problems.  Civil laws can also be utilised.  Planning regulations, and, increasingly, mediation and restorative justice schemes can have a part to play.</p> <p>  Problem-solving policing requires analysis of the causes of the problem, identification of the options open to addressing it and the development of a means of evaluation of the impact of the problem so as to assess performance.  Such an approach requires partnership between the police, the community and other relevant agencies.  Through partnership structures, communities seek involvement in decision-making and problem solving.  Community policing in this way involves community empowerment.  It also has implications for the police requiring structural change.  To be effective such an approach requires devolution of power within the police organisation and the decentralisation of police authority to patrol officers and a far greater emphasis on collaboration between police and community.  The community policing approach emphasises ideas of consumer service, flexibility, consumer feedback and negotiation.</p> <p>  This change in the police role necessitates training to enhance police understanding of the nature of community problems and for the development of problem-solving techniques.  This was described in the Report of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, the Patten report, as the need for "more focus on developing personal communication and negotiation skills, scenario-based problem-solving exercises, self-assessment and peer assessment".  Community policing approaches also require a change in the way police effectiveness is measured.  The numbers of arrests or prosecutions are crude measurements and fully assessing community policing approaches requires more qualitative measurements such as problem resolutions but also community-oriented expectations and defined objectives.</p> <p>  Throughout the world, there is great variety in community policing models and approaches.  Despite this variety, a number of common characteristics define the community policing approach.  These are: flexibility of police structure, devolution of authority within the police and the development of localised command structures; creation of systems of local accountability; community crime prevention schemes; an increase in the number of foot patrols; cultivation of police-community relations through continuity of service by officers in a specific area over a prolonged period; problem solving of non-crime issues; partnership between police and public; and power-sharing between community and police in respect of decision-making.</p> <p>  There is no single model of community policing but the philosophy is strongly linked to the concepts of localised democracy and policing by consent, based on respect for fundamental human rights.  It also requires the entire police force to adopt a broader concept of policing and a transformation of the mindset of all police officers.</p> <p>  Many submissions received by the Commission on the Future of Policing highlighted broad public support from both outside and inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for better community policing.  At present, community policing is very informal and dependent on the personal commitment of local management to this form of policing and the level of support provided.</p> <p>  Other criticisms made of community policing include the following.  The diversion of resources to other duties would appear to vary significantly within the force.  The lack of available records to quantify this is in itself an issue of concern.  There is a considerable lack of supporting infrastructure for community policing units.  The work and outcome of the work undertaken by community garda&iacute; is inappropriately measured, if at all.  There is no clear command structure.  The activities of community police or the community policing structures are not sufficiently formalised within the organisation.  Community policing is under-resourced.  It does not have a proper career path or equality of status with respect to working conditions and allowances.  Community policing personnel are moved to other policing units when the need arises, such as for sporting events or temporary transfer deals in response to pressure on policing resources and this breaks down continuity in community police service.  The programme for recruiting suitable members to community policing is ill conceived.  Community police do not receive adequate training in conflict resolution problem-solving or communication skills.  There is often no specific office space to do such basic things as conducting meetings or receiving telephone calls.</p> <p>  In summary, in Ireland, as in many countries, community policing within our police organisation is marginalised and undervalued.  We have extensive evidence of this and yet, the one constant theme running throughout most submissions to the Commission on the Future of Policing, particularly from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is the need for community policing to be central.</p> <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing has articulated a vision of policing into the future that puts community policing at its core.</p><p>It has made radical proposals that will transform the way in which policing is delivered to local communities.  The term &quot;community policing&quot; is used in many different ways but in the report of the commission we use the term &quot;district policing&quot;, which we consider to be the best fit for Irish circumstances and for the new model that is proposed.<br/><br/>Under the current approach, community policing is a kind of specialist activity, with perhaps 10% of garda&iacute; in a district designated as community officers.  We regard district policing as the backbone of police work and the police mission.  In our new district policing model, all police personnel at district level, sworn and non-sworn, should be considered to be community police.  In future, all Garda personnel at district level, sworn or non-sworn and whether assigned to emergency response or community engagement, should work as a single district policing team to solve problems affecting community safety, reduce crime and prevent harm.  They should develop their own district policing plans in consultation with local community fora.<b></b>They should be equipped to deliver all routine policing services with support from the divisional level for administration and certain specialist functions.<br/><br/>The structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the focus on the front line by becoming flatter and less siloed.  Headquarters should set policies, broad strategy, standards and objectives.  Front-line police units should decide how they can best deliver those objectives and be accountable to their supervisors for the outcomes.  There must be a high degree of delegated authority, complemented by stronger local supervision, notably at sergeant and inspector level.  Innovation, initiative and new approaches should be encouraged and evidence-based success applauded and disseminated.  Excellence on the front line should be valued and recognised.  The building of genuine community partnerships should be a requirement for all Garda districts.  To be effective in preventing crime and protecting people from harm, police must work in partnership with other entities, including schools, community and volunteer organisations, businesses, human rights NGOs, youth groups, faith-based groups, sporting bodies and others.  We have seen evidence of good examples of this throughout the country but the practice should be universal and police leaders should be assessed on their success in building such partnerships.  Garda&iacute; should be assessed for their performance in this respect, and it should be a factor in determining assignments and promotions.<br/><br/>Supporting the districts will be the division level units.  These should be large enough to be self sufficient for all routine administrative and operational purposes.  They should also have detective teams and other specialists to support the districts.  Crisis intervention teams, including staff from mental health and child services agencies, should be based at division level.  Each division should have an information centre, supporting the districts in data collection and analysis.  In effect, we envisage that a division should be, for most policing purposes, a mini police service in its own right.  The current 28 divisions seem to be too many and too small.  We are not more prescriptive about the structure because we believe firmly that the Garda Commissioner must be allowed to manage the organisation, and that includes deciding on the right structure.  We believe that it should be flatter than it is now, with a lower senior management ratio.<br/><br/>It is also important there be effective fora for police to engage with communities at district level.  In the new model for district policing, we envisaged that district police leaders would develop local policing plans based on local objectives and priorities agreed with joint policing committees, JPCs, or local community policing fora, LCPFs, involving full community participation.  Currently, the Policing Authority has a responsibility to co-ordinate and support the JPCs.  It does not have the same role in respect of LCPFs.  We propose that the new oversight body, the policing and community safety oversight commission, PCSOC, which will supersede the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, should develop these local structures to function effectively, building capacity for participation by community stakeholders, setting standards for their operation and evaluating their performance.<b></b>The key objective would be to build community trust and address problems through authentic engagement.  The PCSOC should also work with local fora to promote multi-agency approaches to community safety at local level.  It should have a fund available to support local innovation and initiatives.<br/><br/>The public, police and politicians all told the commission that they want to see more police on the front line.  We agree.  More police working in and with the community will help prevent and detect crime, reduce fear of crime and protect people at risk.  Many police are now doing jobs that do not require police powers and should be done by non-sworn employees or outsourced.  Police also have unnecessary administration duties such as keeping paper records, duplicating electronic ones.  These should be stopped.  These steps will allow significant numbers of garda&iacute; to be redeployed to front-line district duties.<br/><br/>The commission heard repeatedly throughout its consultations that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is constantly called upon to engage in non-crime roles, many of which perhaps could be conducted by other agencies.  However, it must be acknowledged as well that professional police everywhere are often both the first port of call, in that people go to them because they do not know where else to go and are then directed elsewhere, or they are the last port of call, as there are no other sources locally available or accessible due to it being the evening.  The police are also unique in the extent of their legal powers which can be called upon at any time in the conduct of their general or specific roles or when a non-crime issue becomes a crime issue.  It is also very important to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, like all professional police, has significant symbolic power in society.  The professional police remain qualitatively different from other forms of policing, in their symbolic power, generalist mission and regulatory position.  The key task for the commission was to identify how this unique position can best be utilised for the benefit of those most dependent on it, who primarily are the most vulnerable in society.<br/><br/>A January 2015 report by the UK College of Policing, &quot;Estimating demand on the police service&quot;, found that 84% of calls to the police were related to non-crime incidents, notably concerns over an individual&rsquo;s welfare.  Mrs. Theresa May told the Police Federation of England and Wales conference in May 2015, when she was then Home Secretary, that police officers were &quot;not social workers ... mental health nurses, or paramedics&quot;.  In reality, however, they often are all of these things, or at least on an amateur basis and unless other professional bodies who perform these roles engage or are available and accessible.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to perform such functions until that happens.  We have made recommendations on how this should occur.<br/><br/>District police should have real-time access to crime data and to information about public concerns.  They should keep their residents well informed about community safety issues and engage with them proactively to solve problems affecting crime and the perception of crime, thereby leading to both the reduction of crime and stronger confidence in community safety.  Front-line police are a vital source of information about crime, fear of crime and vulnerabilities in the communities they serve.<br/><br/>Finally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society in terms of socioeconomic status, gender and ethnicity.  This will take a determined effort, including innovative marketing of the police career and youth engagement initiatives along the lines of the &quot;police explorer&quot; programmes elsewhere.  It is also recommended in the report that the organisation should work with higher education institutions to develop a Garda access programme, aligned with the programmes of those institutions.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there is a historic challenge and opportunity facing us in terms of the future of policing.  As we approach the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is about how to transform our policing model from the highly centralised and hierarchical colonial model we inherited to a community policing model and all that it entails.  The commission has set down a transformative vision whereby the philosophy, principles and processes that define policing with the community can be effectively delivered in an Irish context.</p></speech>

I will focus on our experience of community policing.  To outline the context, For&oacute;ige is a national youth development organisation whose purpose is to involve young people, consciously and actively, in their own development and the development of society.  This is carried out through a range of supports, from universal volunteer led clubs to targeted interventions engaging with some of the most vulnerable and at-risk young people and families in the community.  Our primary experience with community policing is through the provision of Garda youth diversion projects, GYDPs.  There are 105 such projects nationally, managed by a range of community based organisations.  Funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS, Garda youth diversion projects are community based, multi-agency, youth crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour away from the criminal justice system by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  For&oacute;ige manages 42 GYDPs nationally and is also funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service to provide a range of supports to GYDPs through the GYDP best practice development team.</p> <p>  The community policing service provides vital support to many of the young people, families and communities with whom we work.</p><p>Community garda&iacute; actively contribute to the diversion of young people from offending or further offending.  This is done through building positive, trusting relationships in the community, engaging in partnerships with local agencies, both voluntary and statutory, and being visible and accessible.  The role of community garda&iacute; in early intervention and prevention of youth crime should not be underestimated.  Children and young people tend to follow a pathway towards offending behaviour.  There are also characteristics which make it possible to predict the likelihood of a young person offending.  These developmental pathways and characteristics give families, communities and systems the opportunity to intervene and prevent the onset of criminal and anti-social behaviour while also building skills, strengths and resilience in young people.  Focusing on the development of assets and strengths in young people while reducing the risks not only delivers positive outcomes for young people and families, but also contributes to the overall quality of life in a community and reduces the likelihood of the escalation of a young person's offending behaviour, thus reducing the burden of crime on society and the significant financial costs associated with that.<br/><br/>The research has clearly evidenced that the more contact a young person has with the justice system, the poorer his or her outcomes.  It is important to intervene as soon as possible and as little as possible with a young person who is at risk of offending to bring about a change in his or her behaviour.  Through their presence on the ground, the community garda can monitor behaviour and identify young people who may be at risk of offending before their behaviour escalates to the point that they come to the attention of their Garda colleagues.  The community garda will often deal with incidents of anti-social behaviour in an informal manner with a young person, and this low level of intervention is enough to have a positive impact on his or her behaviour.  Where a young person or family may require a greater level of intervention, the interagency approach of the community policing service allows community garda&iacute; to make timely referrals to appropriate services which can meet the needs of the young people and their families.<br/><br/>Garda youth diversion projects have greatly benefitted from the relationship with community garda&iacute;, particularly in relation to early intervention with young people.  The partnership approach of the community garda&iacute; has also been effective in identifying young people under the age of criminal responsibility who may be engaging in risky or anti-social behaviour.  This has ensured that the appropriate supports are put in place for young people aged under 12 years and has allowed us to address their risks and needs at an earlier stage using their strengths and interests to build skills, increase protective factors and reduce the likelihood of future offending.  Engagement with community garda&iacute; has allowed for frank informed conversations, allowing us to monitor behaviour, respond quickly and appropriately and ensure better outcomes for young people.<br/><br/>Community garda&iacute; contribute to youth projects and services and other community agencies in a wide variety of ways.  By sitting on local committees they can contribute to a co-ordinated response to meeting community needs.  Community garda&iacute; in many areas support GYDPs to develop a comprehensive analysis of youth crime in their catchment area using both PULSE data and local knowledge, which ensures that plans are designed which meet the specific needs of the community and take into account the nuances of their particular context.  Across the country, community garda&iacute; are involved in delivering a range of educational programmes in both the school and community settings.  These ensure that young people and communities are aware of their rights and responsibilities, but also build trust and relationships between community members and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has been our experience that community garda&iacute; have accompanied Irish Youth Justice Service workers on visits to families experiencing chaos and trauma, engaged with both mainstream and high-risk young people in a positive, meaningful and non-judgmental manner, and responded quickly and sensitively to young people and families in crisis.<br/><br/>In a police force in which there is a level of mistrust in many communities, community garda&iacute; are the exception.  As the visible, approachable and friendly face of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many young people and community members will reach out for help and advice from the person they have met at a local meeting, in the school corridor or community centre or walking through their estate before they would ever consider going to the local Garda station.  The ability to access the support of community garda&iacute; has benefitted many communities enormously from both a crime prevention and quality of life perspective.  Those in the community policing service have managed to build positive and effective working relationships with the community, voluntary and statutory agencies working in partnership with them, but equally, if not more importantly, they have built positive personal relationships with community members, young and old.<br/><br/>Given the many benefits I have outlined, it has been disappointing to see the gradual erosion of community policing nationwide in recent years.  Many Garda districts and divisions do not have a dedicated community policing service, which results in a system that is constantly firefighting and responding to issues as they arise, rather than proactively engaging in crime prevention and reduction measures.<br/><br/>Where community garda&iacute; are present in communities, the benefits are tangible.  However, with a reduction in resources and an increased demand, we have seen many community garda&iacute; pulled out of community duties in response to front-line operational needs.  This prioritisation of regular policing duties has resulted in a loss of the preventative work of relationship building within communities.  Many community garda&iacute; who have retired or moved position have not been replaced.  We have seen at first hand the challenges for community garda&iacute; who wish to have a greater level of engagement with communities, but because of the demands placed upon them can only now engage in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner.  Many communities are suffering as a result of the reduction in resources put into community policing.<br/><br/>Where community policing plays a significant role in crime prevention, in our experience with Garda youth development projects the benefits in terms of targeting, early intervention, assessment of risk and need and achieving positive outcomes for young people are clear.  Community garda&iacute; identify young people at risk before they have been detected offending, often under the age of criminal responsibility.  They support Irish Youth Justice Service workers to carry out assessments, engage with young people and families through the projects and deal with issues informally at a local level before they escalate.  They support interventions in very practical ways as well as providing advice, support, information and educational programmes.  Their partnership approach with community groups and other voluntary and statutory agencies ensures that community needs can be responded to in a co-ordinated and consistent manner leading to better outcomes for young people, families and communities.  The main challenges that we see are the lack of resources put into community policing in recent years, the absence of a service in many areas and the tendency, where there is a service, to direct community garda&iacute; to prioritise front-line operational duties to the detriment of their community duties.<br/><br/>Owing to the vital role community garda&iacute; play in early intervention and crime prevention, For&oacute;ige strongly advocates that appropriate and adequate community policing resources be allocated in every Garda division and district in order that all communities can benefit from the service.  For&oacute;ige welcomes the new community policing framework and the establishment of the new community policing offices in the 28 Garda divisions.  This is a positive development and we are hopeful it will support the allocation of appropriate resources to this essential community service.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.357" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Garvey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#H00300"><p>As members have copies of our statement, they will be glad to hear that I do not intend to read all of it.  I will begin with an overview.  Muintir na T&iacute;re has operated community alert for more than 30 years in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community alert is the largest crime prevention initiative in Ireland with more than 1,400 groups.  While relying on the age old principle of neighbours watching out for each other, community alert has also been quick to utilise modern tools such as text alert.</p> <p>  Statistics show that levels of rural crime are not increasing in general.  However, all levels of crime can be reduced.  A very real issue in rural areas is the fear of crime.  This does not always relate directly to actual crime levels.  For instance, whenever there is a high profile crime or reporting of a court case relating to a particularly heinous crime from several years earlier, we notice an increase in activity in community alert groups.</p> <p>  While crime obviously has rural and urban dimensions, isolation means fear is a much greater factor in rural areas.  When people do not have immediate neighbours, they are obviously more afraid of what might happen to them, whether someone will come to their aid and even about when they might be discovered.  Cases of elderly people being tortured, robbed and left tied up are thankfully rare, but they do occur and further fuel these fears.  Crime prevention and detection are important but of equal importance is creating an environment in which people feel safe.  Muintir na T&iacute;re and community alert play a vital role in providing this safe environment, through means such as text alert, the new mobile app, Cairde, and supporting other schemes such as the seniors alert scheme.  While communities can do a great deal for themselves, they still need improved support from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the judicial and legislative authorities.</p><p>Muintir na T&iacute;re has a memorandum of understanding with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the operation of community alert.  The partnership which also includes our funders, the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE, works well.  It has allowed for efficient and effective solutions to problems such as the recently introduced text alert rebate scheme.  It should continue to be a platform for providing solutions to rural crime and community safety problems.  Community policing is vital in providing this support.  In the years of financial restraint from 2008 community policing has been hit particularly hard, locally and centrally.  When resources were limited, the role of the community garda was often the first to be hit, as resources were directed towards what were thought to be more urgent areas.  This has had the effect of damaging the relationship between communities and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That relationship needs to be rebuilt urgently.</p><p> I will leave members to read in their own good time about the history, structure and mode of operation of Community Alert set out in our submission and move to page 8 which deals with community text alert.  Community text alert was formally launched as a community alert programme in 2013 in partnership with the IFA, Neigbourhood Watch and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has certainly caught the public's imagination.  Over 700 groups have registered for the initiative which receives regular positive media attention.  Well over 1,000,000 texts per annum are being issued.  Community text alert is often quoted as having provided the vital cog in crime detection and local Garda management often points to reduced crime levels in areas where the scheme is properly implemented.  Community text alert areas are highly visible through the erection of highly visible and identifiable signage which includes the telephone number of the nearest 24-hour Garda station, to which suspicious activity can be reported.  On receipt of such a call, garda&iacute; will verify the information and can then issue an SMS text message to all registered recipients in the area.  There is also the option of including surrounding areas where this might be useful, for example, in the case of a moving vehicle.</p><p> The success of community text alert is due to the fast and efficient dispersal of information between communities and the Garda.  There is also a deterrent effect through the visible signage erected.  However, equally effective benefits, although less obvious, arise through the organisation of community text alert groups as volunteers to visit houses to explain and gather contact numbers and watch out for older or more vulnerable neighbours.  The last 12 months have seen much change in community text alert, with Muintir na T&iacute;re having had to take over the role as the main issuer of text messages and also with new technology being introduced.  The new Cairde mobile app is an example.</p><p> Policing in Ireland is famous for its reliance on the support of communities and the public at large.  In previous decades most rural communities had a resident garda.  This has changed because of the financial constraints since 2008.  Many rural Garda stations have closed.  Initially, it was explained that resources could be better used by having more garda&iacute; on patrol, rather than sitting in a station.  There was a promise that community engagement would continue through deploying resources to have garda&iacute; available at certain times in public buildings such as community centres, but that has never happened to any great extent.  As resources tightened in Garda districts during the same period, one of the first casualties in many areas was the community garda, as personnel were reassigned to roles that were seen as more pressing.  While this might have been necessary in the short term, it has had a long-term impact.  Most people do not now know a local garda and this has serious implications in the passing of information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and increased fear of crime.  While community text alert has alleviated it somewhat, it is a one-way communication tool.  Members should note that this change primarily affected rural communities, as greater numbers in urban communities meant community engagement could continue to a great extent.</p><p> During the same period resources for community policing at central level were also severely cut.  The Garda community relations office has reduced in numbers and there is now only one sergeant responsible for the entire country.  While we appreciate his help and work very well with him, it severely curtails what can be achieved in our partnership.  Historically, the community relations bureau had one inspector, two sergeants, two garda&iacute; and two administrative staff, but, as I say, it has been reduced to one person.  These inadequate resources, coupled with the Garda management structure, hinder the central dissemination of best practice.  That leads to practical difficulties in areas such as community text alert.  None of this is a criticism of individual garda&iacute;, with whom we have an excellent working relationship, it is simply the end result of the provision of  inadequate resources.  We would like to see increased resources at central level and a return to each community having an allocated garda who would be known to it.  While we appreciate that these are operational matters outside the direct control of the committee or the Department, the issues must be highlighted.  In that regard, we welcome the recent report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, in particular as it relates to district policing.</p></speech>

Before I open up the meeting, I note as a courtesy that this is to be the substantive work of the committee in this session of the D&aacute;il.  For information, I note that the committee will next week meet representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, which will be a first, when the discussion will be about this dual focus of community policing and rural crime.  We will finish up the following week by meeting representatives of the Irish Farmers Association and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association.  We appreciate all of the delegates making themselves available and engaging with us.  Deputies Colm Brophy, Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire and Clare Daly have indicated.  Anyone else who wishes to indicate will be added to the list.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#J00300"><p>I thank the delegates for attending.  I do not have that many questions in that I agree strongly with the gist of the presentations.  Certainly, I support the emphasis on community policing and hope the new Garda authorities will advocate it as being at the heart of policing.  My experience as a public representative, a councillor for ten years and then as a Deputy is that the community garda is at the heart of the interaction between the community and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Luckily, my area did not suffer as great a loss in the provision of community garda&iacute;.  The role was maintained throughout the cutbacks.  It is the most effective tool the Garda has to deal with crime in a way that prevents its escalation to more serious levels.  One thing that was mentioned by Mr. Connolly and which is a very valid point is that if a structure is not in place which focuses on a career path in community policing, it is at the heart of why it encounters problems.  What I have seen over ten or 15 years is that a lot of young garda&iacute; come into the role, perform it for a period of time, seem to really like it but, inevitably, move on.  They move up or out of the role, which leaves the existing structure of community garda&iacute;, as distinct from what was advocated in the report, as an ineffective form of community policing, notwithstanding its positive aspects.  That is because it is really only an engagement with the community at one level.  A part of it I have experienced through the joint policing committee in my local authority area shows, however, that there is a much better path that involves interaction with Garda management at all levels, including at the higher levels way up the line.  I welcome the proposals the delegates have made.  They are exactly where we should be going.  In my experience in Tallaght, Rathfarnham and elsewhere Garda management has worked on the community policing model in South Dublin County Council, which is where it can be really effective.  I am interested in hearing the delegates' views on my point about promotions and whether it is at the heart of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#J00400"><p>It is central to it.  Something that was very striking emerged throughout the work of the commission.  We travelled all around the country to meet garda&iacute; in their stations.  They all saw themselves as community garda&iacute; and valuing the role as a priority.  They put it as a matter of "serving the community".  The problem was that the structures and processes to facilitate placing it at the core of the policing organisation were not in place.  Garda&iacute; felt that the role was undervalued and took the view individually that colleagues felt it was undervalued.  As such, the objective would to get into a specialist unit.  That is the way one would want to go.  However, many were happy working in community policing.</p><p>If they had a career path, and if they were promoted on the basis of how they engaged with communities, local structures and so on, it would be seen as much more important to the organisation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#K00300"><p>I thank the Dr. Connolly for attending.  I was anxious that this issue would be addressed.  I am a big fan of the community policing model where it operates properly.  In my experience it has made a big difference in some of the communities I represent, which have had some excellent community garda&iacute;.  It is an issue that has been neglected, however.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on community policing earlier this year.  The number of dedicated community garda&iacute; around the country is down by 40%, but in some areas it is down by 94%, such as in Donegal.  Some of that might be due to a number of chief superintendents being in a better position to defend their resources and retain personnel.  I expect that there was a significant fall in every district and a catastrophic fall in some.</p><p>My first questions are for Dr. Connolly but I would like to hear others' views also.  The questions reflect what is in the Commission on the Future of Policing document.  Part of me wonders if it is an issue of language.  Community policing sounds vague unless one has met a designated community garda and had a sense of what a community garda does.  In a sense, one expects that every garda is a community garda, which is true up to a point.  My concern, however, is with the attitude taken from a policy point of view that every garda should be considered a community garda.  While every garda should be community-orientated and the attitude of those who are parts of core units should be in co-operation with the garda&iacute;, there is a difficulty if there is not a dedicated community garda for a subdistrict or several community garda&iacute; across a district.  The certainty of the role is not there.  There is a general principle that community policing is important, but when there is a spike in crime or when public order issues must be addressed in a district, people are redirected away from this work.</p><p>As our guests have all indicated, a huge function of community policing is in crime prevention and building relationships as opposed to crime-solving.  I am open-minded but my initial view is that there needs to be a core of people who are specifically and primarily responsible for community policing in a dedicated way.  While they are assisted in a general sense by other core unit garda&iacute;, it is their primary responsibility and the people in the locality know whom to ring if they want access to the community bus or if they want to organise some sort of a public meeting about a public order issue.  There should be a specific contact person who is known to people.</p><p>There are two districts in my constituency and, in the one closer to where I am from, we have had a series of excellent community garda&iacute;.  This allowed relationships and trust to be built up, particularly with younger people.  While other garda&iacute; might have been known, the community garda was known first and foremost.  I would like to hear Dr. Connolly's observations on that but I invite anyone else to comment also.  We could allow for every garda to be a community garda, covering a multitude, yet it might never really cut to the core of focused, dedicated development of relationships and dedicated community policing.  More broadly, does Dr. Connolly believe that community policing has been adequately resourced by Garda management in recent years?</p><p>There has not been a great deal of use of the restorative justice model in this jurisdiction.  The model has been used more in Britain, the North and other jurisdictions.  Do we need to see more of that and who is responsible for handling it?</p><p>On local accountability mechanisms, my experience is that the LCPFs, which are quite <i>ad hoc</i>in nature, are far more effective, and I expressed that in my submission to the commission.  I accept that JPCs vary hugely, but I attend meetings of Cork county JPCs as well as Cork city JPCs.  There is a population of 400,000 but the JPCs are trying to deal with things on a thematic basis and, therefore, all that happens is that crime statistics are read out to people and questions are answered.  There is no setting of priorities.  Policing plans are formally presented but they are so general and so broad-based that, ultimately, public representatives and community representatives do not have enough of a feel of the county as a whole to properly get their teeth into what is involved.  It needs to be much more localised, which is why the LCPFs generally work well, although they are very localised.  My understanding of what will be put forward by the commission is that both would be retained, although I am not sure I understand the division of labour that is envisioned in the proposal.  What would be the job of the JPCs, if they are to be retained, in the event that more emphasis is put on LCPFs?  In the North policing and community safety partnerships, PCSPs, are a fair bit more robust.  Was that model explored at all?</p></speech>

My view is that doing that tends to marginalise community policing.  At present, it is approximately 10% dedicated to community policing units.  The real problem here is we do not have any real idea of the demand on the policing service at a local level.  There needs to be a good analysis of the data coming in and the demand on the local districts before a decision can be made about exactly how many should be dedicated.</p> <p>  The key part of this is that everyone should look toward the community and see himself or herself as community police, whether he or she is in a specialist unit or otherwise.  It is not as if the community police in the organisation are being looked down on, which is where matters seem to stand currently.  The key is continuity of service, as Patten report acknowledged.  Over a number of years there must be dedication to an area or a location.  If a specialist unit comes in briefly because of some serious crime occurring, who are just there to investigate that particular crime, they still must liaise with the garda who is there permanently or on a more continuous basis and who is engaged in problem-solving.  That requires continuity and engagement over time.   We know that in other countries most issues - approximately 80% in the US and the UK - that come to the attention of the police are non-crime issues which are mostly related to vulnerable people and which need interagency work and sustained engagement over time.</p> <p>  On restorative justice, it is an area in which I have much interest.  There is huge potential and there are many good things happening with it.  Restorative justice is being rolled out and used more, and it fits into the model we are proposing because it looks at the problem and not necessarily the crime.  It aims to be preventive and it engages over time in bringing people together.  If it is, a young person and people who are important in his or her life are involved and he or she is helped get through the particular stage.</p><p>Restorative justice has much potential.  I have done work recently relating to drug debt.  In other areas such as sexual violence or hate crime, many are not engaging at all with the criminal justice system.  They are not going to the police because they do not necessarily want to end up in a prosecution.  They do not want to end up in a court case and even prison does not solve the problem if the offender ends up there as a problem may still continue from within a prison.  We must look at alternative and imaginative approaches, and restorative practice has much to offer in that respect.</p><p> I do not want to dominate and, therefore, I will finish on JPCs.  We received a number of submissions from JPCs and we were struck by them and by our visits by the inconsistencies.  Some were doing very good and novel things in different areas but the term "talking shop" was also used quite a bit in a number of submissions and the presentation of data.  This does not need to happen at a JPC and data relating to local crime should all be available using modern data techniques on the Garda website.  We were more impressed with the local community policing structures.  One cannot be overly prescriptive as that might not be what is needed in a rural area.  I have worked with a number of them in Dublin city and they have been extremely effective in dealing with serious crime problems.  There is much dedication.  There is also much resourcing, including the Irish farmers' organisation, Muintir na T&iacute;re, For&oacute;ige, the GAA and a huge number of organisations throughout the country that have a desire to perform a role in community safety that we should be able to tap into.</p></speech>

A number of counties operate successful district and divisional meetings, engaging with the community in a real way.  Cork does that very well but others I will not name do not do this at all.  It shows where this is on the priority list.  Looking at the metrics commonly reported in terms of numbers of checkpoints, arrests and everything else, there is never anything about the number of community engagement meetings and so on.  It needs to be made more consistent at a higher level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bernie Meally" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#L00300"><p>I agree with a number of the points made, particularly regarding the need for a dedicated community policing service and roles.  In areas where there are dedicated community garda&iacute;, they engage well with the young people and the families they work with.  In some areas there are difficulties or challenges and they need the support of local Garda management to protect the time and space in order that they can attend a committee meeting or go to a local youth club or project, sit with a group of young people, drink coffee and talk about what the number on their shoulder means, for example.  We have seen some  wonderful work done with a group of young people who engaged with a project and, through this, we did a relationship and sexuality education, RSE, programme.  As the conversations happened, the staff started to feel there may have been some inappropriate behaviour happening.  Immediately after the session, in consultation with their line manager of course, the staff spoke with community garda&iacute;.  They came in a very informal role to participate in the RSE programme, speaking about the legalities and illegalities of some of the behaviour.  There were positive discussions around consent and it was an important learning opportunity for those young people.  Had one of those community garda&iacute; received a call and been told a prisoner needed a lift to court, we may not have had that learning experience for those young people.  It is important that local Garda management supports those community garda&iacute;.  That echoes some of what has been said here already.</p> <p>  A particular skill set is required for a community garda.  I am speaking from the youth perspective.  Not every person can walk into a youth group or a group of young people and feel comfortable to engage in a meaningful way with them.  Where it is successful, community garda&iacute; come in with their prevention hat on, willing to build relationships with young people.  It is not about looking for crimes but rather some of the solutions and how to support young people and vulnerable families.  There is also a need for greater and more comprehensive training packages for those in that community garda role, as the skills are very different from somebody who might be in a regular unit or a traffic corps, for example.</p> <p>  We have seen an inconsistency - that word was used earlier - in how and where restorative justice operates throughout the country.  We have had some good feedback from young people and families who have engaged in restorative processes with the garda&iacute; and we would encourage more of that.  In some areas, it does not happen at all.  We see the restorative process, when it is engaged in very genuinely on both sides, as a fair and equal process.  It has some positive outcomes for young people and their families in terms of understanding the impact of behaviour on other people.  Young people can be impulsive and may not think about the impact on people they affect with their behaviour.  Through various restorative processes, there is increased awareness and many more positive outcomes for young people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#L00500"><p>I agree with that.  It speaks to what is in the Commission on the Future of Policing report and treating policing as a profession.  This is a skill.  I take on board the point made by Dr. Connolly.  I have said that every garda should view himself or herself as a community garda and be community-oriented.  My concern is at the other end of the equation.  Where there is a good community garda and functioning structure, there is a focal point for contact and concern.  However, it is just not the same if the approach is to get people to contact the station and any of the lads or ladies will help.  It is not quite the same.  I am sure any of them would do their best but one does not build up the same relationship as somebody whose primary purpose is to liaise and work with the community in developing initiatives.  It is my view but I maintain an open mind on it.</p> <p>  I have a view on fora.  Notification can be an issue and the community as a whole often does not know these are ongoing.  Garda&iacute; and local authorities, etc., must improve at getting the word out.  Public participation networks, PPNs, are great but these involve the people most switched on to what is happening in community structures and organisations anyway, so simply contacting them does not mean it will get to the wider community.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for For&oacute;ige, with one or two for Muintir na T&iacute;re.  There is an issue with the tendering of youth diversion projects and some people have expressed concerns about it.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  Is For&oacute;ige happy enough with how juvenile liaison officers and community policing are tied together?  We are not specifically addressing the juvenile liaison process here but should there be more focus on it?  Much policing time, especially in urban areas, is taken up by garda&iacute; being contacted to address anti-social behaviour, although much of the time the behaviour is not anti-social but just involves large groups of young people congregating.</p><p>Garda&iacute; then move them on to another place.  Someone else then rings the Garda station and they are moved again.  Sometimes those young people are involved in anti-social or criminal behaviour, but quite often they are not.  I believe a huge amount of time is wasted because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has to address constantly the fact that there are not enough places for young people between the ages of 14 and 17 to go, particularly those who are not interested in sport.  They do not have a place to go to, so they stay in.  That is an issue we have to address.  Where do we expect these young people to be if not at home if they are not into sport?  The lack of infrastructure means that garda&iacute; are constantly shifting people on to the next place.  It is true that sometimes there are real issues, such as anti-social behaviour and crime.  Quite often, however, no such issues arise.</p><p> In terms of Muintir na T&iacute;re, the issue of community CCTV has been discussed at this committee regularly.  Data protection concerns arise.  I can see both sides of the matter.  It is valuable for tackling crime.  How might data protection issues be addressed?  Do the witnesses have any concerns?  How do they envisage the scheme working?</p><p> I am mostly focusing on Muintir na T&iacute;re, but anecdotally the targeted theft of tradesmen's equipment is a significant issue at the moment.  People are being snooped on.  Those responsible are researching their victims online.  Expensive equipment is being targeted in a dedicated way, and people's livelihoods are threatened.  Have the witnesses come across that issue?  Do they have any views as to the solution?  It is only recorded as a theft, but it can devastate a household.</p></speech>

Deputy Clare Daly has to leave in a few minutes because a delegation is visiting her at 11 a.m., but she wants to ask questions.

I assure them that we analyse what they say and weigh up all the points made.  The report will be the main body of work for this committee going forward.</p> <p>  I found it striking that there was a real difference in the vision outlined by Dr. Connolly and the reality of the interactions.  The vision he spoke of is a good way to start.  I see merit in what he is saying.  The idea of having a dedicated 10% does not work.  We should understand that policing is there to protect and serve the community in all of its aspects.  We need to re-emphasise that.  I was struck by what Dr. Connolly said when he suggested that it should not be about arrest and prosecution but rather about considering how a community is best served.  There is a body of work in that.  What do the witnesses think about that?  They dealt briefly with restorative justice, but mediation and other areas could be looked at.  How can those options be explored further?</p> <p>  Inadequate multi-agency interaction is key.  It came up when we discussed the section 29 issue.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is called at night to take kids into care.  Generally speaking, the experience is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very good to deal with, but it does not have the support it needs from other agencies, especially Tusla.  Tusla has been particularly poor in terms of a lack of liaison with schools and in identifying problematic behaviour.  Will the witnesses discuss that further?  When a child gets into trouble, the parents are involved, but the school should be involved much more than it is.  Probation officers and Tusla can also get involved, meaning that the situation becomes very messy.  Do the witnesses have any views as to how that might be better co-ordinated?</p> <p>  In terms of specific communities, especially minority communities and people who were not born in Ireland in particular, will the witnesses tell us how the issues of language, hate crime and racism are dealt with?</p> <p>  If each group present here could change one thing to improve the area of community policing, what would it be?  That question is addressed especially to Muintir na T&iacute;re.</p> <p>  I am sorry for rushing.  The contributions made by the witnesses have been very thought provoking.  It is good to think about where we are and what the vision is.  The transition is part of a bigger project we are involved in.  We must reinvent what we mean by policing.  I will be paying attention to the replies.</p></speech>

When the call for proposal process - I believe that is the official title - was first announced in January, all of the community-based organisations that manage Garda youth diversion projects were very concerned.  Our major concerns related to the suggested timeframe.  There was a lot of consultation with garda&iacute;, community-based organisations and front-line youth justice worker.  Thankfully, the Irish Youth Justice Service, IYJS, has decided to delay that process.  That was a very welcome development for all youth organisations, not just For&oacute;ige.  It caused a lot of concern for a few months.  We identified that rash decisions had the potential to have a wide-ranging and long-term impact.  The delay is very welcome.  The process now proposed involves research, and will take place from the end of 2018 and throughout 2019 and beyond.  That research will identify the key benefits of a programme such as the garda youth diversion programme and the factors that make such a programme effective.  If there is then a call for proposals, the IYJS will be very clear on what it is looking for and what has the best outcomes for young people.  We welcome the decision to delay that process.</p> <p>  There was a general question about our experience with juvenile liaison officers and whether we are happy with them.  For&oacute;ige and other community-based organisations delivering garda youth diversion projects work very closely with juvenile liaison officers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They are an essential part of the system.  The majority of young people who engage in a Garda youth diversion project are referred by their local juvenile liaison officer.  In most cases it works very well.  They have close and effective working relationships in many areas.  There have been various challenges with working with juvenile liaison officers over the years.  Work was done in 2017 to look at how Garda youth diversion projects and juvenile liaison officers could work together in a more effective manner.  Resulting from a process of consultation and research, a number of guidelines were put together that outlined what the relationship should look like and how to get the most from it.  We were finding that where people had a strong and positive personal relationship, the projects were operating very well.  The correct young people were being referred in a timely manner and the information flow between the youth justice workers and garda&iacute; was very good.  People were happy to pick up the phone and have a chat about an incident, gather information on it and assess it well.</p><p> There were some areas where the flow of information and perhaps the relationship were not as good.  Our research found that the issue between the projects and the juvenile liaison officer, JLO, simply concerned communication and understanding of roles and responsibilities.  Consequently, the guidelines break down what a youth justice worker's or juvenile liaison officer's role is.  We have found that this has helped to improve interaction and co-operation within the communities at a very practical level.  There have been varying responses from young people and families we have worked with on how they feel about the Garda or the juvenile liaison officer.  In many cases we find a young person is much more positively disposed to a juvenile liaison officer or a community garda, where they are present, than to any other garda in the community or in the Garda station.</p><p> Things are not perfect.  There are several other issues.  We would like to see a more comprehensive programme of training for JLOs.  In the last few years the Garda youth diversion projects, GYDP, best practice initiative has done some work with the Garda bureau of community engagement on developing training specifically for juvenile liaison officers.  Every JLO that comes into post receives that training, which helps them understand the issues and needs of a young person who is likely to offend.  It helps support them in deciding on the most appropriate response to those young people.  Sometimes that is a very informal response, and other times it is about going through a much more formal process.  Training is an issue.  We would love to see more training because there is a very particular skill set for a juvenile liaison officer, as there is for a community Garda.  Not everybody is born with that skill set and it is really important that they are supported.  It can absolutely be learned.  It is important that good quality training is put in place to support JLOs in learning some of those skills. </p><p> Finally, I will address youth facilities, and a previous speaker's comment that there is not necessarily somewhere for young people to go so they hang around the streets.  That is absolutely correct.  There are deficits in facilities for young people in some communities.  In other communities there are facilities but the young people or other community agencies may not be aware of them.  As organisations, we have a responsibility to get out there and make sure that people know we are there.</p><p> However, the youth sector is really struggling, and has been for the last few years, because of very significant cuts to funding.  The initial cut to the youth services grant scheme was 35%.  There was a restoration of 7%.  As such, funding for the youth services grant scheme is down 28% in the last several years.  I am tempted to say that has been the case since 2008, but I could be mistaken in that.  That has had a catastrophic impact on some of our services.  That 28% amounts to more than &euro;700,000.  That sort of money is massive to a charity like ours and it has had serious impacts.  We have lost jobs and we have not been able to replace people who have moved on.  That means that we cannot provide front-line services to young people and families who need and deserve them.  That is just the situation for For&oacute;ige.  There are many other organisations and agencies which have been very drastically hit by those cuts as well.</p></speech>

Reference was made to equipment theft.  This is a very real issue in rural areas, not just for people in industry but for farms as well.  There has been a substantive amount of it.  It is especially targeted.  Some of these individuals are able to case farms.  There are quite detailed casings, sometimes with the use of high-technology equipment such as drones, etc.  In areas where substantive work has been done on CCTV operations, on which I will elaborate later, there is a structure with which to trace the offences.  However, that is in very rare situations.  We are finding on the ground that where technology enhances security and observation, crime drops and moves to the next area and then to the next.  This is a very real issue on the ground.  It feeds into the fear referenced in our introduction and a sense of isolation.  People live in fear, knowing that this is likely to affect them, if not now then at some time in the future.  That fear often extends to not even reporting the crime when it occurs.  We have to be very mindful of that.  Much of the time the full impact and level of what happens on the ground is not reported.  That affects the quality of the data we are reading.</p> <p>  I will give a brief example.  I spoke to a man recently who had been sitting in his kitchen with his family, eating their evening meal, when individuals with dogs walked through their private yard and past their kitchen window, going for a walk through their farm.  The family discussed whether or not to engage and decided not to.  Not only that, they decided not to report it to the Garda.  That is life in rural Ireland.  We must be very conscious of what reality is like on the ground.  There is fear of what may happen next if people report.  From our perspective, the frightening part, into which we all have an input, is this: why is that individual not confident enough to report that to his local community or the Garda?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Garvey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#N00500"><p>I would like to address Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's question about community CCTV.  The establishment of community CCTV schemes around the country started to take off about five years ago, particularly around motorway junctions.  County Laois was a prime example.  The Department then introduced the grant scheme for community CCTV and allocated &euro;3 million to it.  Perversely, that has brought community CCTV to a halt.  As has been mentioned, there is an administrative issue over who the data controller for these schemes should be.  The legislation specifies that the local authority should be the data controller, but many local authorities are not prepared to take on that role and we are at a stalemate.  As to how we get out of it, I note there are three different types of CCTV scheme in the country.  There are community schemes, whereby the community takes responsibility for the scheme and the data; there are Garda schemes typically seen in towns, where cameras around the town are monitored in the Garda station; and there are hybrid schemes, which are a combination of both.  Although the Minister said they are not to be changed, the demands of the legislation need to be considered to see if a hybrid solution can be arrived at.  Several groups are now deciding not to apply for the grant and are doing their own thing.  In doing that, they are also walking away from getting the authority of the Garda Commissioner for the scheme.  That has implications for the admissibility of evidence gathered under the scheme.  That is the position of community CCTV.</p> <p>  I will briefly address equipment theft.  Mr. Sweeney outlined its results.  One practical suggestion is property marking, that is, marking equipment with an identifier.  One could be flippant and say that if nobody bought these things then nobody would steal them, but it is an issue if one cannot identify stolen goods.  There are several property marking schemes through which people can mark their property.</p><p> Deputy Clare Daly asked if there was one thing that might make community policing better.  That one thing would be a change in priority given to community policing at the top level of management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would then filter down.  That would have to be measurable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#O00200"><p>I will return to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point as I have given much consideration to the numbers and units and to the dedicated unit.  I appreciate that he said that he would keep an open mind on that.  We require clear information as to the demand for local services and that a clear workforce planning programme be put in place, neither of which exists.  Using that data, we could discuss a percentage that would look to the community and engage with it in a problem-oriented way.  It is crucial that we have a vision for policing with the community.  It cannot be something that is just put aside and not prioritised.</p> <p>  The commission's report had a great focus on training.  While I appreciate that there are some people who are very good at community policing, speaking to kids and so on, it is something for which people can be trained.  If someone is entering into this public service, they should know from the start that they are going into a community-based service where they must be able to engage with young people, people with mental health or addiction issues and so on.  That people are trained and prepared to engage at that level is central to the idea of community policing.  That is how one articulates a vision on the ground through a professional organisation, where people are properly trained and treat people with dignity no matter what section of society they come from.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear Deputy Clare Daly speak of the vision of community policing that we articulated.  The problem is that it has fallen through the cracks, which is why one can have a good community garda being pulled away.  It is great that we have articulated a vision of what it would look like in the future.</p> <p>  The issue of mediation is very important, just like restorative practice.  I bring members' attention to a forthcoming report by the Council of Europe on international experiences of restorative practice that should be worth examining.  We must look at alternative ways of dealing with frequent problems in terms of dealing with prevention.</p> <p>  The multi-agency point is central to much of what we have discussed in the commission's report.  We proposed setting up crisis intervention teams, which were first proposed in 2009, so that it is not just garda&iacute; who are available to deal with vulnerable people at 5 o'clock on a Friday.  We have also recommended that the Cabinet subcommittee on criminal justice should organise an annual event bringing together the various Departments which broadly have a role in the area of community safety to show that it is a multi-agency function.</p> <p>  If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to implement the report of the commission.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that if we can get them a place in our report, there will be more thought around many of these issues.  Things get said and are just left there with not enough done.  Most of the good points that the witnesses are making will remain aspirational until someone is prepared to make changes to how things are done.  I think everyone made the point that for aspirations to become reality, it will cost money and more resources will be required in certain areas, whether they are taken from other areas or extra money is required for us to have real community policing.  I get the impression that the witnesses feel that more will have to go towards the overall budget in the first place.</p> <p>  I am running away, as it were, and so will ask only two questions.  Mr. Garvey said Muintir na T&iacute;re "would like to see increased resources at a central level" and "would also like to see a return to each community having an allocated garda".  Does he think that some Garda stations should also be reopened?</p> <p>  Some of the witnesses touched on this but do they agree that schools offer a great potential in developing a healthier approach to kids coming from a troubled background?  They referred to cuts to centres and so on.  I see ten to 15 kids in villages in Italy gather around a lamp post or bench there and they do not cause trouble.  There is a different mentality.  I am not saying that they do not have youth centres or anything.  Do schools not offer potential?  From my own experience going to school, it has a huge influence.  Teachers and individuals in the school can have a great impact on how one sees things.  Some teachers had a huge influence on me.  It is different from home.  The philosophy that comes from home is crucial but school is different.  Is it too aspirational in terms of the work to be done?</p> <p>  When I was young, we knew the local garda and we also knew where he was.  He moved around the parish a bit but he was in the barracks at certain hours and we knew where to get him.  He was completely a part of the community whereas now, with the so-called mobile garda, I do not have a clue who the garda is at home now.  I would not be in a position to go and look for him or her if I needed to.  That is a great loss to the community.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Garvey" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#O00600"><p>Deputy Wallace mentioned resources which are finite.  The Minister has indicated that he hopes to bring the force to 20,000 in the next two years, which is a huge increase in resources.  The resources are coming.  It is a question of ensuring that they are correctly allocated.  The same principle applies to Garda stations.  When resources were tight, they were closed.  We have an open mind on whether a dilapidated Garda station should be reopened or another facility provided in another community building, if that is available.  However, the Deputy is correct that there must be a physical place where one can visit one's liaison garda.</p> <p>  The idea at the time was that the garda&iacute; were better off out on patrol rather than filling out paper, and while true to an extent, it is also flippant.  People need a safe place to communicate with a garda, to pass information, get information and, as my colleague observed, to be able to have a conversation about what is happening in the community.  That is missing at the moment.  One cannot have that conversation through the window of a garda car as it is passing down the street.  There need to be more physical locations and we have an open mind as to whether they are Garda stations or other community facilities.</p> <p>  The representatives of For&oacute;ige will probably expand on this much more, but I believe that the Deputy is correct about schools.  Good community garda&iacute; are visiting schools.  They are organising events for the elderly but they are also visiting schools at the other end of the spectrum.  Our information, however, is that they are few and far between.</p></speech>

To address Deputy Wallace's comment on schools, my view is that it takes a village to raise a child.  It is not just about schools and the family of origin.  All members of the community should be involved in raising young people.  The Deputy is right that there are major opportunities within the education system to build skills in young people and to inspire and motivate those young people to be very active, positive citizens and to promote civic responsibility.  Where communities work well, all community agencies are involved.  Youth work and the education system work hand in hand.</p> <p>  In our experience with Garda youth diversion projects, schools are very much part of the work we do with young people.  They help us to assess the risks and needs of young people.  In many cases, education is a major risk.  A risk factor related to offending for young people is non-engagement in school, negative engagement in school or leaving school entirely.  Youth services, statutory services and other services work very hard with schools.  Most schools engage really well but there are other major opportunities.  The reality is that a school is constrained by a curriculum which it has to abide by.  The opportunities for youth work and community work complement the work that takes place in school at a pace that is reflective of the stage the young person has reached.  We can respond directly to his or her needs and tailor the programmes or interventions that we carry out with him or her entirely based on that young person's circumstances.  We all have a role in building skills for these young people.  That includes the Garda and every other agency present.</p> <p>  I did not address a comment made by Deputy Daly earlier but would like to do so now.  She posed a question about asking what we do and who we go to when a young person is in difficulty.  She also asked about multi-agency or interagency working.  Our experience has been that those working directly with young people are interested and willing to try to work together when a crisis occurs.  The issue that we have found is that there is sometimes a lack of communication at departmental level, and that has an impact on how we can and do work together.  It has caused many frustrations for front-line workers who see massive needs and possible opportunities to work together and support each other, but there is not necessarily joined-up thinking at departmental level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.395" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Johnny Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018100300002#P00700"><p>On Deputy Wallace's point about Garda stations, we have to be imaginative about this and look at co-location across agencies or in community centres.  There are sometimes challenges for people talking to garda&iacute; or going into a Garda station in a small village.  It is important that the State has visibility in villages and towns.  The withdrawal of post offices is problematic for many communities because, in effect, the State is withdrawing from these communities or becoming less visible in them.  Community policing builds on the informal controls that already exist.  We have a large number of national organisations that have a place in every single locality and village, whether the GAA, Muintir na T&iacute;re or the Irish Farmers Association.  They have an important role to play here in working with the Garda to provide facilities and so forth.  That is definitely possible.  It also means that agencies should co-locate.</p> <p>  The issue of schools is important and brings two issues to mind.  I was involved with a project initiated by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in the north inner city where she brought schools together in a sort of convention.  I wrote the report on it entitled, Just Saying, which addressed drug issues.  We have to get into the space that young people are in.  They were talking their own language about the drug and alcohol issues they were confronting.  I did work on drug debt, a problem that came up constantly in schools.  Kids were not going to school because they were in debt for drugs.  Their parents may not have known.  Many things happen in schools and schools have a role to play in assisting young people in getting discussing, negotiating and overcoming these problems.</p> <p>  I reiterate the point about interagency working.  In the commission report, we have called, at a ministerial level, for a regular meeting between agencies which have a place in the community safety area, whether justice, health or youth justice.  If there are such barriers to communication or data-sharing, they should be resolved at that level.  A strong message coming out of our report is that we look at policing.  We did not do a report on the police but on policing, which is not just about the Garda but cuts across all sectors of society.  I hope that emphasis is reflected in the committee's work too.</p></speech>

I love the vision for community policing.  My gut tells me that policing services have a long way to go.  The area that I am interested and work in and on which Dr. Connolly touched is addiction.  I have often worked with families with loved ones who had broken into houses to feed their addiction, whether to alcohol, drugs or gambling.  I would like to hear from the witnesses about that.  I will not use the word "addiction" because we often treat that as another issue.  We are talking about society in general.  What is the role of alcohol harm and drugs, including for people who are dependent on drugs and those who have binge weekends?  What is the impact of that on fights?  I refer to fighting, accidents that happen, sexual abuse and domestic violence.  When we look at crime, including the serious issue of rural crime, what drives people to commit crime in general and what role do alcohol, drugs and gambling play in that?</p> <p>  Dr. Connolly spoke about respect and the policing service.  The policing service deal with huge trauma every day.  It works on the front line all the time.  A report was done recently on trauma and the mental health of garda&iacute;.  There are no supports provided for garda&iacute; in that respect.  All of that trauma comes back to addiction and the role it plays.  I work with families who have somebody they love with an addiction problem.  They live with trauma too because they are watching their loved one go down the route of self-destruction.  They are living with the chaos and crisis this causes.  I am bringing this to the policing service and community policing.  From my experience of working with these families, if one gives them the tools to cope with this in a way that does not traumatise them or cause them to burn out and enables them to treat their family member with respect while establishing strong boundaries and measures that prevent him or her from creating chaos, the results are unbelievable.</p><p> Coming back to community service, I have worked with many different families.  I worked with a grandfather, for example, who was not an old grandfather.  He was relatively young, in his late 50s.  He was rearing his grandson and they were both living in a house together.  This young lad started to get into drugs of some kind.  He was not taking them every day but he started to get violent.  It was pretty scary and the grandfather did not know what to do.  He did not want to go to the police because this was his lovely grandson.  He did, however, connect with the local community garda with our help.  He brought the community garda into his home and sat the young lad down.  The community garda talked to the young lad at length about the impact his behaviour was having and said that the next time it happened, he would be arrested if there was violence.  Immediately there was a shift with the young lad and, thankfully, through a lot of interagency work, and this was only this one young lad, with the help of the community garda, and with the addiction services really supporting the grandfather, that young lad is now in recovery.  This is just a small example of how such interagency work can work well.</p><p> I have another example of a sister who was very concerned about her niece.  She was only ten and was living in an environment of addiction.  Again, the sister went to the community garda, who was fantastic.  The community garda gave her support.  Unfortunately, they could not do anything for the ten year old child, which was devastating, but at least there were some supports there.</p><p> I listen to "Today with Sean O'Rourke", on which Paddy O'Gorman has a segment in which he meets people outside the courts.  Almost 95% of the people he talks to are before the courts for alcohol, drugs or gambling related cases.  I am trying to ask the witnesses, in their experience in the work they all do, how high a percentage of cases are alcohol, drugs or gambling related.  I hear what Mr. Garvey is saying, that this must come from the top when it comes to the Garda.  District policing only accounts for 10% of policing overall.  That is pretty shocking when one thinks of what community garda&iacute; could do, bearing in mind that we must be conscious of the fact that many of the garda&iacute; are burned out from dealing with crises all the time.  I loved what Ms Meally said about the community and understanding roles and responsibilities.  Again, this goes back not only to the training of garda&iacute; but also to supports for them and having that support there for them when there is a crisis.  The overall approach could be life-changing for the police force in such a positive way if it came from the top, instead of this kind of zero tolerance and lack of compassion and lack of empathy.</p><p> I will stop soon.  This is just an area I am particularly passionate about.  I have worked in the prison services and seen women in particular who have entered prison because of crime related to drugs or alcohol - probably more alcohol than drugs.  They act out in ways they would never act out if it were not for substance misuse.  When one works in that field and deals with people in a compassionate, respectful way, the results are phenomenal and off the Richter scale.  All of a sudden they start to feel good about themselves, even though they have acted out in ways that have resulted in their ending up in prison.  They start to feel good about themselves and shame starts to disappear.  They start to realise that there may be hope.  In the witnesses' experience, what role do alcohol, drugs and gambling play in crime?  How high is the percentage?  Has there been any research done on this?</p></speech>

By this I do not mean that one sees drunkenness as 50% of youth crime in the statistics for the country or for particular catchment areas.  What one sees are the likes of minor assault as a result of a young person getting drunk and ending up in an argument and a physical altercation with someone.  One might see the likes of criminal damage, whereby someone is drunk and smashes all the wing mirrors on the street as he or she walks home, or one could see the likes of theft from a shop, whereby a person either steals alcohol to drink or steals other items to make the money to get alcohol.</p> <p>  If one were to look at the statistics on drugs, one would believe there is not a drug problem among the youth population in this country at all.  We know anecdotally, however, that there are pockets where there are huge issues of drug use and substance misuse.  For us, one of the major challenges in this regard is the real lack of under 18s substance misuse services and supports.  In some areas and counties there is nothing.  We have youth workers and youth justice workers who will access any training they can to be able to work with a young person.  Our area of expertise in respect of substance misuse in the youth work arena is around education, awareness and prevention.  When it comes to the field of intervention, there are other professionals who are much better placed to meet a young person's needs.  If a young person is actively engaging in substance use to the point at which it goes beyond experimentation and there is the start of a dependence on a substance, professionals should be working with those young people.  What we have in many communities are youth workers and other community organisations doing their very best to support these young people because no service is available or there are huge waiting lists to access those services.</p> <p>  The other issue we find is that many young people with substance misuse issues have underlying mental health issues.  A young person who is drinking or using substances could be doing so to help deal with anxiety, depression or chaos at home or for other reasons.  We find, however, that the community adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, will not work with that young person in dealing with his or her mental health issues because he or she has a dual diagnosis of a substance misuse issue.  Then there are people - again, I am talking especially about youth workers - in a community trying to hold and support young people and getting them to a point at which they can engage with a mental health service.  It is just very challenging for those working on the ground.</p></speech>

The misuse of alcohol and drugs is an unusual one when it comes to rural crime in that it is more of an undercurrent in rural communities.  It is not a matter of out-there, in-your-face street brawls and wing mirrors being broken off cars because that just would not be accepted in a rural community.  The social mores still have that effect.  It may be a factor behind visiting gangs carrying out burglaries and so on.  That is a separate issue.  That is not to say that that misuse is not there; it is, of course.  It is there in domestic situations such as those the Senator described.  She is correct that the community garda can provide support in such cases - as I said earlier, the good ones do - but then it is about priority and focus.</p><p>Specialist drugs units have been set up everywhere that have a very clear focus on tackling one end of the spectrum.  We do not have that focus in the community garda's job.  It is a by the way.  If somebody knows a helpful garda, he or she will do the job.  It should be part of the job and have equal priority to the enforcement on the other end of the scale.</p></speech>

The Health Research Board has produced quite a bit of research on this area.  Generally the link is understood using three models, one of which is psychopharmacological model.  This relates to the product or the quality of the drug that contributes to violence.  We have significant evidence that supports the link between alcohol and violent crime but not so much in respect of illicit drug use.</p> <p>  Recently, I was invited to talk at an event on benzodiazepine use among young people and the impact this was having on them in terms of forgetting their actions, for example, engaging in violence and forgetting about it the next day.  The event was organised by youth workers.  It is a very serious issue that is largely hidden but the consequences are not hidden, which is of concern in this area.</p> <p>  I was struck by Senator Black's point on the impact of trauma on work of garda&iacute; because it was a major issue that the commission confronted in our work.  We wrote a chapter calling for the introduction of a properly resourced wellness programme within the Garda and obligatory counselling to be provided following traumatic events.  A programme is being rolled out in the organisation but we were very strongly of the view that it needs to be well resourced.  We were struck in particular by the very high suicide rate in the Garda organisation on which data were published just before we reported.  The Garda survey also highlighted the types of issues that were being confronted by garda&iacute;.</p> <p>  One of the most positive features of the commission's report is that we discuss not only the prevention of crime but also the prevention of harm and responding to harm.  Harm is often the result of a dual diagnosis, serious addiction issues or family trauma.  As I mentioned, a recent report in the UK showed that 80% of police interactions involved non-crime events and usually involved vulnerable people with mental health issues, addiction issues, etc.  That is what police organisations are doing on a day-to-day basis.  Often they are doing it because other agencies may not be available after 5 p.m.  That is the reality of police work and we have made it a central part of our work that people need to be trained in this.  Garda&iacute; are often the ones left to try and deal with these issues.  They should be trained or, if not trained, they should be close enough to other agencies to be able to divert people to them.  They understand the signs, for example, in cases of sexual violence issues, particularly associated with alcohol, which often arise.  They need to have sufficiently close links with other organisations, be it in the addiction or sexual violence field, to ensure they do not do more harm in their initial reaction to the victim and can subsequently divert people to other organisations.  That is central to what we are talking about in terms of a multi-agency approach.</p></speech>

I have read the opening statements and I know that the committee will them very helpful in producing our final report.</p> <p>  I will share some of my own experiences with everyone.  In my role as justice spokesperson for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, many of my colleagues ask me to attend meetings in their constituencies.  I have found these meetings a very insightful experience and a couple of issues have stood out at them.  First, there is still huge confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  People want to see An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na succeed notwithstanding the problems in the force in recent years.  Second, a large number of people attend meetings when they are about community policing or rural crime, much more so than any other political issue.  That reflects a genuine concern and interest among the public.  The Garda has a good base upon which to build. </p> <p>  People say the same thing at every meeting I attend.  They want to see more garda&iacute; on the beat and they want more community policing, which is what we are discussing here.  The committee's objective is to see what we can do to give effect to that, how can we make the force more efficient and, primarily, how can we get more garda&iacute; out into the community doing work that is valued by the community.  Every politician in this room goes knocking on doors and meets people.  Most people are not particularly interested in a politician calling to their door but there is a much greater level of appreciation and trust in garda&iacute;.  I would like to see circumstances in which communities would know who their local community garda&iacute; are, in the same way as they know Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in or whoever else is their Deputy in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  Are there ways whereby that can be done?  Maybe there is too much staff turnover in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and people move on too quickly.  I do not know whether the issue has been covered but what are the witnesses' views on having a separate grade of community garda and a separate line of progression for community garda&iacute;?    </p> <p>  Criminality has been greatly enhanced by technology.  Criminals use the Internet to defraud people and to identify whether people are at home.  Similarly, peace minded people and those who want to obey the law can also use technology to fight criminality.  I have seen the Garda work with people on community watch schemes to try to get a whole area covered by a Garda division.  People in these areas may form a WhatsApp group or community alert scheme.  The witnesses may have covered this matter before and I apologise if they have.  Could the committee make any recommendation in our report to improve the situation in this regard?  </p></speech>

We touched on the matter in the sense that the commission is talking about a district policing model where everyone is involved in community policing and outward looking.  We have gone into great detail on that.  We had a chat about whether there should be a community policing unit.  On the basis that we do not know the demand being place on garda&iacute; locally and because there is no clear workforce plan, we did not present figures for community policing.  We were reluctant to do so because, whereas community garda&iacute; account for approximately 10% of the force, we do not want the issue to be put to the side as if it is irrelevant.</p> <p>  We also have a chapter on digital innovation and social media.  One of the things that we have called for is for mobile Apps to be made available to front-line garda&iacute; and for the Garda to ratchet up its social media profile because, in this day and age, there is no reason people should not know their local garda.  There should be regular contact and there are mobile Apps that can facilitate that.  We went into that in some detail in the report.</p></speech>

I noted in my opening statement that in many of the communities in which we are present people can be fearful or mistrusting of the Garda.  The one person that they tend to trust is the community garda because that is the person who visits their youth club and attends community meetings or they have met him or her on some pleasant trip.  People have learned to recognise their community garda as a person, not just someone in a uniform which can be a major barrier for people.</p> <p>  It is important that there is some continuity for communities.  It takes a long time to build up trust with somebody and if there is quick turnover in Garda personnel, the community must start from scratch every time a new community garda is appointed.  For us, building trust takes time.  Whatever supports that can be put in place to ensure community garda&iacute; can be present or visible in the same community over a longer period would be a positive development.</p></speech>

Muintir na T&iacute;re fully agrees with the recommendation that all garda&iacute; should be community focused.  It is important that the community has a face, or two or three, to cover a roster and that they have a contact point with which, as For&oacute;ige has said, they can build up trust.  They attend community alert meetings and youth club meetings and so on, and that is important.</p> <p>  The crime prevention officer is becoming the de facto contact point for the Garda in many areas because he or she is going out to meetings and giving crime prevention advice.  In many cases there is one crime prevention officer for a division which can cover two counties.  Such officers are not contactable.  It is not feasible.  There needs to be a contact point.</p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is woefully behind in technology and that is something everyone accepts.  Muintir na T&iacute;re operates a text alert scheme and it sends out texts on behalf of the Garda.  In many cases, Muintir takes a phone call from a garda on a mobile phone asking it to send out a text because garda&iacute; do not have smartphones or even Internet access in many stations.  Where are we going if we do not even have that as a starting point?</p></speech>

I thank the Chair.  Would there be any value in a voluntary system of central registration, where the Garda or another organisation would maintain a register?  Marking equipment is a sensible precaution but people might sell stuff.  If garda&iacute; go to a market or find someone who is selling ill-gotten goods, it is not necessarily easy to disprove a claim that they were sold to the man or woman selling them.  Would there be a value in a central register where tradespeople or farmers could register expensive equipment?  If they sell it on, they can contact the register or, if it is stolen, they can report that.  When that equipment is found, garda&iacute; can refer to the register and see that the item was registered and then stolen.  Is there sense to a system like that?</p></speech>

There are a number of registers already but the problem is they are disparate and there is no agreed national database.  Muintir na T&iacute;re has looked at this and done a pilot programme on property marking, and we might see if it can be further developed with a database.  There is one in the UK which operates successfully.  The police force is behind it and it is sponsored by an insurance company, which makes sense.  That operates as the de facto national database.  I think it should be looked at.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for his invitation to address the joint committee today.</p>  <p>  Let me begin by telling the Chairman and members about myself.  I was raised in the 1970s in the then small rural village of Dunboyne, County Meath.  I went to local schools and like many, was among the first generation of my family to access third level education.  The community I come from is part not just of who I am, as community is a large part of my life&rsquo;s work professionally, as a volunteer and as an activist.  For me Pobal is not simply a professional interest, though I promise to bring the highest standards to my new role. </p>  <p>  Pobal is the continuity of community activism I believe in.  I am privileged to be asked to lead it forward as Chairman, having served on the board since 2013. </p>  <p>  For more than 25 years, I have worked professionally in local economic and community development.  I have worked with local communities, with local development agencies including Leader, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, SICAP, and with local authorities.  I teach at the Dublin Institute of Technology and I am an academic engaged in research.  I am the chairperson of the All-Ireland branch of the Institute of Economic Development, a member of the executive committee of the Irish branch of the international Regional Studies Association, and an adviser to the Irish Social Enterprise Network.  Community development is my work, it is my world and it is my passion. </p>  <p>  Community is about inclusion.  It is about enabling activism.  I am chairman of the Ballymun Town Civic Alliance and secretary of the north Dublin chamber of commerce.  I am a member of Dublin&rsquo;s local community development committee and its social enterprise committee.  I volunteer my time and for me, Pobal is a catalyst; community is its purpose.</p> <p>In 26 years, Pobal has developed in response to Government priorities.  It adapted its skills to respond to changes and challenges.  As chairman, my approach<b></b>will be to provide leadership and oversight of the future strategy and policies, in particular on implementing Government policy on social inclusion and early years.  Central to this is ensuring that internal controls and implementation are effective and that the CEO and Pobal management team have the direction and support required, while ensuring Pobal is lean, fit for purpose and responsive to the future needs of communities and stakeholders.<br/><br/>Looking to the future contribution of Pobal, I am very conscious we are responsible for managing significant amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money allocated by Government.  A key strategic priority for me as chairman will be ensuring that Pobal continues to provide a highly effective service for managing Government grants and payments to communities.  This must be underpinned by high standards in accountability, in financial management, and in the support we provide to all those with whom we work.  Pobal manages a wide range of programmes and as a result it has built up specialist skills and systems to support its work.  In recent years, the ranges of skills required has increased, with ICT, procurement, governance, accountability and more, becoming increasingly important.  I am committed to Pobal continuing to develop and deepen its skills so that Ireland has a vehicle through which Government can confidently allocate funds to communities with the knowledge that the funds will be properly managed and the programmes delivered effectively.<br/><br/>Another key priority area for me is bureaucracy.  I am acutely aware of changes in the regulatory environment for the organisations that Pobal supports.  Personal experience of serving on many small boards means that I understand the need to ensure procedures are fair, proportionate and appropriate to the scale of funds allocated.  This is not easy in a world where there is an expectation for increased governance, oversight and financial prudence.  It is Pobal&rsquo;s policy to identify the minimum data requirements needed for effective administration, acknowledging that issues such as European level data requirements must be reckoned with.  Pobal has made real inroads in this area in the last year, increasingly using online platforms to reduce red tape.  The strategic plan for 2018 to 2021, to be launched shortly, identifies reducing bureaucracy for community organisations as a clear objective and the board and I will ensure this objective is met. <br/><br/>The policy changes I referred to earlier have seen a growth in early years services and Government investment has been particularly important in recent years.  Pobal is working hard to support this growth.  Further development of these services and especially the development and implementation of the affordable childcare scheme, will be a significant challenge for Pobal over the next two years.  It is change we are committed to meeting and managing effectively.<br/><br/>I am proud to say that every day, in towns and villages across Ireland, there are Pobal staff on the ground working with communities delivering services locally to combat social exclusion.  Pobal&rsquo;s commitment to social inclusion and to community development through working with local groups, agencies and childcare providers is what we do and what we are.  As chairman designate, I want to acknowledge the leadership and commitment to Pobal of every member of the board and in particular our outgoing chairman, Mr. S&eacute;amus Boland who has contributed enormously over the last seven years.  I want to take this opportunity to thank him for his contribution and service.  I also want to commend the work of the staff of Pobal, working alongside local and national community organisations to build stronger communities, support families, assist individuals and to nurture children every day.  I am deeply honoured to have been nominated by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring, as chairman designate for Pobal.  I am conscious of the responsibility I have undertaken and I come here today to present my credentials to the committee, to begin my work and to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I have no doubt, having listened to the details of his curriculum vitae, that he has the vast experience that is required to lead Pobal over the next few years.  Politicians may end up as policy makers and legislators but fundamentally, like Dr. &Oacute; Broin, we come from our communities where we were activists.  We were grounded in our communities and were working with those in most need.  I acknowledge Dr. &Oacute; Broin's attributes and look forward to him leading Pobal in the time ahead.  It is not only his voluntary and community activism that I want to acknowledge but also his professional experience, his involvement at various levels with chambers of commerce, in academia and in social enterprise.  I am impressed by his curriculum vitae and wish him well as he leads Pobal in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  As chairman of Pobal, Dr. &Oacute; Broin will have enormous responsibility.  In 2017, Pobal allocated approximately &euro;615 million to various development programmes and community projects around the country.  I am delighted to hear that Dr. &Oacute; Broin intends to have strong oversight and accountability in relation to how Pobal does its business.  I have only one question for Dr. &Oacute; Broin before wishing him well in his new role.  In terms of the allocation process, as with so many governmental organisations and institutions, there is an historic way of doing business.  Does Dr. &Oacute; Broin have any plans to evaluate previous Pobal allocations to determine their impact on communities and to make any changes or reforms necessary on foot of that to maximise the impact of funding allocations across the various headings, including social inclusion, equality, assisting families and young people and so on?  I look forward to Dr. &Oacute; Broin's response and wish him well.</p></speech>

There are two distinct components to my answer.  The first is that each individual programme will be evaluated on a regular basis to assess its impact.  That is an ongoing process.  The second element is more relevant to today's discussion.  We recently carried out a feedback and engagement process with beneficiaries, communities and stakeholders on funds managed by Pobal.  A number of issues were highlighted in terms of impact and we are actually working on implementing those at the moment.  The board has taken a very strong role in taking on board the lessons from that feedback and engagement process.  Bureaucracy is one of the issues that came up.  We have to strike a balance between accountability for the allocation of public funds and the capacity of the organisations, groups and communities with which we work.  We must try, to the best of our ability, to limit the bureaucratic overhead or burden.  We are using technology to help in that regard and we are also redesigning some of our processes.  The senior alert scheme is a useful example in this regard.  That scheme is rolled out across the country and has been managed by Pobal for a number of years.  It is a good example of a technical solution being delivered by Pobal and the Department to reduce administration and delays in getting personal monitored alarms to the homes of vulnerable older people across Ireland.  We can turn around requests for personal monitored alarms within 24 hours or less.  Previously, depending on the individual's location, such requests could have taken a number of weeks to process.</p>  <p>  The board serves on a voluntary basis and its members all come from local organisations.  We bring that very particular experience to our work.  The board is very strong and very keen to make sure that our experience informs the work of Pobal.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018100300004#G00500"><p>I am glad that Pobal is looking at this because as times get busier, it gets harder and harder to find volunteers in communities who can commit the time required to stay with projects.  We need a certain resilience.  We get a lot of people presenting with nice ideas and nice projects but to actually deliver such projects on the ground, we need people to commit and stay with them through their development and into their achievement and delivery.  I have been involved in both local and national politics for almost 20 years.  Like Dr. &Oacute; Broin, I grew up in the 1970s and have seen the ups and downs in various communities.  I represent a rural constituency and know that local volunteers are finding it harder to deal with high levels of bureaucracy.  Some people call it bureaucracy while others may call it accountability and there is a balance to be struck here.  Of course we all want good governance but we can overdo the bureaucracy to such an extent that it becomes a barrier for local communities.  They get frustrated and scared by it and do not have the time to commit to it but Dr. &Oacute; Broin seems to recognise that, which I acknowledge and welcome.  We must ensure the programmes that are available through Pobal are accessible, especially to more vulnerable, isolated and disadvantaged communities.  We must support such communities in accessing supports, grants, funding and professional expertise.</p> <p>I am delighted to hear Pobal is examining and evaluating ways to lessen the bureaucracy or accountability involved for community projects, and that is not to take from the need for proper governance.  We all have to learn from the mistakes of the past.  We must acknowledge mistakes were made.  Where public funds are being expended, they must have as positive an impact as possible.  We must strike the right balance, make such funds accessible and allow communities know that there is support available without scaring them away with over-burdensome bureaucracy, form filling and all the rest of it.</p></speech>

I echo Senator Coffey's comments on the bureaucracy and difficulties community projects find in meeting the very high bar that has been set around accountability for many of them.  That point is regularly raised with us.  The issue seems to have become more burdensome in recent years.  I have dealt with many community projects during the years and I know Paul Skinnader quite well from the past.  The issue that seems to have come more into focus now is that it is all about ticking boxes and checking.  Many people involved in community projects find that when they apply for a relatively small grant the level of accountability around it is not proportionate to the amount of money they receive.  A person working in a community project said to me recently that all the people working in the community trying to get things done are just an excuse for other people to have good jobs, to go around checking on them, rather than delivering for them.  I am not saying that is the case but that is an experience people have and they reflect that back to us.</p>  <p>  Pobal carries out the role it has been given by the Department.  I refer to the article 48 checks that are carried out around the country.  The Department advises it that they must be done in a certain way.  How does Dr. &Oacute; Broin find the Department to deal with in that respect?  I understand responsibility for those checks will be moved from Pobal to the local authorities soon.  There are 28 local authorities covering rural areas around the country.  How will they be trained to do that work which is now being done by one single body nationally, namely, Pobal?  I live in Leitrim and the local authority there is under stress and pressure to do the work it does every day and now it will have the additional role of carrying out these checks.  What level of training and capacity building will there be in the local authorities to carry out these checks?</p>  <p>  Is the reason for that transfer of such responsibility that Pobal recognises the risk involved in such checks?  For example, if Pobal says a project in south Kilkenny is doing very well and that everything is above board and then an inspection service of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine does another check and finds something wrong, is Pobal concerned it will be held responsible because it passed the check on the project?  Is that the reason Pobal is passing the responsibility for these checks to the local authorities, or is it considered that role is more appropriate to the local authorities?  If the latter is the case, why did the local authorities not have that role from the start?</p>  <p>  Another area is the childcare sector.  I visited a childcare facility in recent weeks and the issue of the financial checks they have to go through was raised with me.  It is appropriate that childcare facilities are checked to see what way they are running their businesses.  However, people can call to a childcare facility without notice at 9.30 a.m. and say they want to carry out a financial check.  The difficulty with such a check is that the people running the facility must also comply with the regulations on the other side and ensure they have the appropriate number of staff in place for the number of children for whom they are caring.  A member of staff may have to spend a day with a officer from Pobal checking through the books when that staff member should be looking after children.  If, on the same day, an official from the other side of the regulations were to arrive to check on that aspect, the childcare facility would be found to be out of kilter in terms of its responsibilities.  I have checked the position north of the Border where the same regulations are in place and a childcare facility is given three to five days notice of the carrying out of such a check.  That means they can organise to have staff in place to ensure they have the necessary cover.</p>  <p>  What has been the cost to date for Pobal to carry out the article 48 checks?  It has been doing those checks for three years.  How will that cost be borne by the local authorities?  How much training on the carrying out of those checks will local authorities get? </p>  <p>  Another issue is the level of wages paid to people who work in community projects.  I know that is not directly the responsibility of Pobal.  For example, people who are highly qualified in the childcare sector have very poor wages.  That same applies to workers in all the community projects around the country.  The maximum they can be paid is &euro;8.65 an hour but if they need to be paid a living wage, from where will they get the balance to make that up?  I would like Dr. &Oacute; Broin to comment on what message that sends to the voluntary sector, which I acknowledge he clearly committed to, where workers are underpaid and under-resourced to such an extent?</p></speech>

The first four will go in January 2019 and that process will roll on again and that will continue over the year.  That was a decision for the Department.  To take up Deputy Kenny's point on whether the local authorities are the appropriate place for this, my understanding is the local authorities were always the appropriate place for the article 48 checks to be carried out.  Pobal, historically, had an involvement through its involvement with LEADER but the article 48 checks were to go to the local authorities.  The Deputy asked a related question about building capacity and training for the local authorities.  That is an ongoing process and Pobal has been involved in that.  I have seen that from my own involvement through local community development committees, LCDCs.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's query about supervision or inspection visits of childcare facilities, that issue was raised in the feedback and engagement process.  We would have a number of people on the board who come from a community childcare space and it is an issue they have flagged also.  It is in the process of being addressed.  We will see a more flexile regime in place.  I would refer to my statement.  We identify what we consider the minimum requirements.  We are not trying to create a burden for organisations.  This feeds back to one of Senator Coffey's points.  We come from the community sector and most of us have a significant involvement in it.  We are not trying to create extra work or difficulties for organisations and individuals in the sector.  We have a role to balance the burdens we place on organisations because of the funds that are going to them.  We believe they are appropriate and proportionate but it is a constant evolution.  Even during the past year, if we consider the European level data requirements, our local organisations had not even thought about that issue three years ago.  I know from organisations in which I have been involved on a day-to-day basis, that two to three months was spent earlier in 2017, as well as some time spent later in that year, completely reorganising the communications system to deal with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Many of the burdens in organisations arise on a regular basis.  We, as a board and an organisation, strive to reduce to the best of our ability the burden of administration on organisations, and that is definitely one of my priorities.</p> <p> The Deputy's final question was on the cost.  That is a matter of administrative detail on which I would ask him to engage with the chief executive officer.  If it is okay, we will go through the costs and come back with that.</p></speech>

We thank the committee for the invitation to attend today.</p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland was established in late 2012 to manage the microenterprise loan fund scheme, set up by the Government under the Action Plan for Jobs.  It is a not-for-profit lender and a registered charity.</p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme, as outlined in the Act, is to promote economic development and to increase employment and enterprise by providing loans to newly established or growing microenterprises across all business sectors, with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk appetite applied by commercial banks.  We fill the gap in lending supply but are not intended to replace any current bank lending.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the fund is to provide loans of &euro;2,000 to &euro;25,000 to microenterprises, be they sole traders, limited companies or partnerships, that cannot obtain funding from traditional sources.  Each borrower must be creating or sustaining a minimum of one full-time job.</p>  <p>  Essentially, MFI is mandated to underwrite loans at a risk beyond that of commercial lenders.  The loans are unsecured, at an affordable fixed interest rate, and not priced for risk.  This overall proposition is unique in the marketplace.  All applicants are given a full and fair credit assessment and, where appropriate, applications are approved.  Our objective is that applicants do not take on unsustainable levels of debt.</p>  <p>  Recognising the market we aim to serve, our loan offering is simple and transparent.  We provide loans for up to five years at fixed interest rates for working capital or investment purposes.  Repayments are generally fixed throughout the period to provide certainty for the borrowers.  There are no fees or charges.  Applicants may request interest-only periods or seasonal repayments where the circumstances of their business require.</p>  <p>  In addition to lending, MFI provides mentoring services to its borrowers.  This is an important support in helping our borrowers develop their business acumen and supports the sustainability of the business.  The mentoring services are delivered through the local enterprise office network.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s economy is built on a foundation of entrepreneurship and microenterprises.  There are approximately 220,000 microenterprises in Ireland, representing 90% of all small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in Ireland.  These small businesses are the lifeblood of the economy and, without these businesses, many local communities would not survive.  These micro businesses tend to be small indigenous businesses, with little or no export potential, but they are essential to their local community and economy. They bring services to local communities, create jobs and play a major role in rural sustainment and renewal.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, many of these businesses struggle to meet the normal credit criteria of banks as they are financially weak or are burdened with legacy debt, poor credit history, lack security and financial history or have other social or demographical issues impacting their loan assessment.  This is particularly true for start-ups.  Without State supports, many of these businesses would not exist and their communities would decline.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the Government&rsquo;s investment in the microenterprise loan fund has always been that of job creation and sustainment across all areas of the country and across all industry types.  MFI continues to fill this mandate, lending to all industry types, across every county, with a particular emphasis on more vulnerable groups including migrants, females, youth, unemployed and more mature entrepreneurs.  </p>  <p>  Some 79% of all loan approvals by Microfinance Ireland are outside of Dublin.  We have a strong focus on supporting new and existing rural businesses.</p>  <p>  MFI, as a not-for-profit lender, is highly dependent on a range of financial supports and partners to fulfil its objectives.  To date, the business has spent &euro;8.3 million of State funds, provided through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in running the business and absorbing bad debts.  The commercial banks have committed &euro;15 million of funding for on-lending to our applicants, all of which will be drawn down before the end of 2018.  The European Investment Fund has provided risk sharing guarantees for up to &euro;50 million in lending, of which approximately half has been utilised to date.</p>  <p>  While we are a small team based in Dublin, through our business model we have a presence in all areas of the country.  We have a team of more than 30 external assessors located across Ireland who meet with our potential loan applicants.  We also have very strong partnerships with the 31 local enterprise offices, the 49 local development companies, LDCs, or area partnerships, which assists businesses apply to us.  We also have created a referral programme with the main commercial banks for bank loan applicants who are declined or deemed unsuitable to apply for bank finance.</p>  <p>  Our marketing strategy is around promoting our offering and increasing brand awareness across the country.  The majority of our marketing and public relations, PR, is local, utilising local radio through advertising campaigns, interviews and sponsorships, local press, local marketing campaigns and attending and speaking at events across the country.  In addition, digital marketing and social media have proved very successful in getting our message out among our target market.</p>  <p>  We accept loan applications via our website or directly to our office in Dublin.  Loan applicants can also work with the local enterprise office or the LDCs to submit an application to us, and our loan pricing reflects this by offering a 1% interest rate discount for loan applicants coming through these channels.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that Microfinance Ireland is a loan provider, not a grant agency.  Our application process is comprehensive to ensure we safeguard as much as possible both the State funding provided to Microfinance Ireland and the loan applicant.  We have to recognise that microenterprises, and particularly start-ups, are inherently risky.  That said, it is our policy to work with borrowers if they struggle to make loan repayments.  Our first priority is to maintain the borrowers&rsquo; business and we offer a range of additional concessions in such circumstances.</p> <p>To date, our loan approval rate is 45%.  The level of loans actually written off is 16% but the underlying rate is higher.  MFI has recently been approved to grant further borrowings to previously successful borrowers that are still too financially weak to borrow from banks.  This is proving very beneficial to our customer base.</p> <p> Over six years we have built strong capability, brand awareness and in-depth knowledge of how to lend to micro-enterprises.  Microfinance Ireland is the only Government initiative directly lending to the "unbankable" micro-enterprise sector.  Following modest beginnings in 2013, the business has grown year on year and at this stage of the fund, MFI is currently ahead of the original job numbers objective and by the end of the fund is forecasting to significantly beat it.  It is doing so at a cost of less than &euro;2,000 per job, the lowest cost of job support of any current Government initiative.</p> <p> MFI will be in business for six years in October 2018 and since inception it has approved loans totalling &euro;26 million to 1,830 businesses.  Through these it has helped to support the creation or sustainment of 4,375 jobs.  To give some headline figures, some 82% of businesses supported have one to three employees, 79% of loan recipients are located outside Dublin, 57% are sole traders and 56% of loans are to start-ups.  At this point, MFI is attracting 1,000 applications per year.  It is supporting in excess of the target of 770 jobs per annum.  It is working collaboratively with the local enterprise offices, LEOs, the local development companies, LDCs, and banks.  We are financially supported through the Government grant and bank borrowings and we are in receipt of a European Investment Fund EaSI Guarantee credit commitment out to 2022.  MFI is certified by the EU under the European code of good conduct for microcredit provision.  It was one of the first four microfinance organisations in Europe to receive this award, which is seen as the quality benchmark in Europe for the provision of microcredit.  By the end of 2022, the business is forecasting to have approved &euro;58 million in lending to in excess of 4,000 businesses, supporting the creation or sustainment of more than 9,000 jobs.</p> <p> MFI is currently experiencing record numbers of applications.  This is being achieved against the backdrop of recent positive trends in the Irish economy - low unemployment and increasing optimism in consumer confidence coupled with a very strong culture of entrepreneurship in Ireland.  Ireland, however, still suffers from unemployment black spots in many areas of the country and in certain demographic sectors which are not achieving the same level of improvement in employment.  MFI's continued growth highlights the ongoing need for microfinance support for unbankable promoters and propositions, particularly start-ups, irrespective of the economic cycle.  While MFI&rsquo;s model is unique in Ireland, across Europe and globally microfinance is a well established business model and is seen as a key element of the funding ecosystem.  When benchmarked against similar institutions in Europe, MFI is performing well.</p></speech>

Our core business is to provide leadership to the co-operative movement in Ireland.  We use our collective voice to put the needs of the co-operative movement and our member co-operatives to the forefront of what we do.  We draw upon the pioneering and innovative spirit of our founding members to help strengthen our co-operatives operating in today&rsquo;s ever changing and competitive world.<br/><br/>Starting from the agricultural co-operative path set by our founding president, Sir Horace Plunkett, in 1894, ICOS today has evolved to serve the co-operative sector in seven core categories, namely, multi-purpose dairy co-operatives; livestock co-operatives; store, trade and wholesale co-operatives; service-related co-operatives; community-oriented, culture and leisure co-operatives; food, fishing and beverage co-operatives; advisory and education-related co-operatives.  ICOS member co-operatives, their subsidiaries and associated companies collectively have more than 150,000 individual members owning shares in them, employ more than 14,000 people in Ireland and a further 24,000 abroad and have a combined turnover of almost &euro;15 billion.  A significant proportion of this turnover is spent in rural Ireland through employee wages, payments to suppliers such as farmers and other small rural businesses and payments or dividends paid to the 150,000 co-operative members.<i></i>On top of the economic benefits, ICOS co-operatives place great emphasis on enhancing the skills of co-operative staff and management through ICOS Skillnet structured training.  This allows co-operatives of all sizes to avail of a wide variety of training resources.<br/><br/>It is important to recognise that one of the most common small rural businesses in Ireland is the family farm, and co-operative ownership in the dairy sector and the livestock mart sector in particular has sustained these businesses throughout rural Ireland for more than a century.  The benefits of the co-operative model in agriculture can be seen clearly when compared with the volatility experienced in the sectors of the industry that do not have a significant co-operative presence, such as the meat processing industry in recent years.  As a result of this sustainable growth Irish family farms engage in a significant level of regular commerce with thousands of small rural businesses from a broad range of sectors and have therefore contributed to their success and sustainable growth.<br/><br/>Rural Ireland is facing a number of unprecedented challenges.  These include: centralisation and rural depopulation; lack of access to broadband and other services; the next EU Common Agricultural Policy reform; the growing regulatory compliance burden across a number of sectors; the consequences of Brexit and the obvious and severe ramifications of a hard border with Northern Ireland.  ICOS sees rural depopulation and centralisation as significant challenges for rural Ireland, manifested recently in the closure of post offices, the difficulties in providing broadband coverage in rural areas and the more long-term trend of concentration of the majority of employment and economic opportunities in a few centralised areas in the east of the country.ICOS believes this trend must be arrested and reversed through implementing and promoting innovative development strategies and policies.  For example, rural Ireland has the potential to offer unique opportunities to those establishing businesses and those availing of flexible and remote working arrangements, each of which could play a notable role in arresting rural depopulation.  With that in mind, ICOS urges the Government to facilitate and promote such commercial and workplace innovations by getting the national broadband plan back on track as a matter of urgency.  The availability of reliable broadband is essential for sustaining businesses of every size and location in the 21st century.  If small rural businesses do not get broadband access, they will almost certainly be left behind.<br/><br/>To give an example of the opportunities rural Ireland is well placed to take advantage of, ICOS believes that sensible financial tools are required to stimulate widespread uptake of community-based renewable energy projects, including biogas from anaerobic digestion and energy and electricity from solar panels.  With this in mind, ICOS welcomes the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment&rsquo;s recently announced renewable energy support scheme and with it the proposal to offer favourable status to community-owned energy generation schemes.  ICOS urges the Government to follow through on prioritising the establishment of community-led and co-operative projects in the area of renewable energy and micro-generation.<br/><br/>Throughout the last number of months, ICOS has noticed increasing requests for assistance from our small to medium-sized affiliates with their growing compliance burden.  While we recognise the key role a robust regulatory framework plays in providing stability and fairness in the economy, small businesses are struggling under this burden and, frankly, are living in fear of the consequences of a minor slip-up under the numerous regulations to which they are subject.  ICOS encourages the Government to provide more information and resources aimed at small rural businesses to assist with the aforementioned regulatory duties and to consider the small businessperson in the drafting of such legislation and regulations.<br/><br/>On a separate but no less important matter, it is the view of ICOS that continuation of a well resourced and strong CAP budget post 2020 is absolutely essential to sustaining small rural businesses.  Expenditure cuts to the CAP budget will have a detrimental impact on the numerous small businesses that depend on a vibrant agribusiness sector.  The strength of the co-operative is that the members own and oversee the business.  Co-operatives are answerable to our members and to future generations of members.  It is essential that this strategic involvement is not overlooked as the Government supports rural Ireland in dealing with the challenges it faces. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Fitzsimons" time="10:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018100300007#K00500"><p>It is my pleasure to talk to the members of the committee today about ACORNS, accelerating the creation of rural nascent start-ups, "nascent" being early stage.  I will outline the background of how it was set up.</p> <p>A report by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, recommended that a rural innovation and development fund be developed to support innovative small-scale pilot initiatives that explored the diverse range of potential identified through the CEDRA process.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine provided for the setting up of that fund out of his budgets for 2015 and 2016.</p> <p> A request for tenders was made through a public procurement competition for the provision of a service for the development and delivery of a tailored pilot programme to address the skills, enterprise and capability gaps of nascent female entrepreneurs living in rural Ireland.  The focus was on female entrepreneurs because research by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, GEM, in which I am involved, had shown that there were approximately 2.5 male early stage entrepreneurs setting up businesses to every one woman.  There is a gap.  Entrepreneurship in Ireland is also more focused in urban areas than rural ones.  Hence, there was a focus on female entrepreneurs in rural areas.  Rural areas were defined in the CEDRA report as those outside the administrative city boundaries of Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  We applied for and, I am delighted to say, won the tender.  We then developed ACORNS, which, as already stated, involves accelerating the creation of rural nascent start-ups.  The initiative focused on women with businesses with fewer than two years of sales.  One could be at an advanced stage with a clear understanding of what one wanted to start a new business around or one could already be trading in that new business.</p> <p> Initially, we did not know whether there would be an appetite for ACORNS, but there clearly was, which is good.  The team that I work with has experience in supporting female entrepreneurs.  We have developed Going for Growth, which has been recognised by the OECD and the EU and has won many awards.  We learned from that.  We knew that peer support worked.  We took the idea of placing voluntary lead entrepreneurs - people who had experience of doing this in rural Ireland - with a group of earlier stage entrepreneurs in rural Ireland.  There was not just the normal role model effect, the strength of which we know from research, but also the role model effect of women who had already started businesses in rural Ireland.</p> <p> We developed a structured methodology that would run over a six-month cycle with a start, middle and end and in which we would measure everything.  We measured where people were when they came in and where they were at the end of the cycle.  In addition, the Department was clear that it wanted all entrepreneurs to be aware of what supports were available to them, so we developed a booklet of supports, which we have on our website.  We renew it every year.  We have won the tender to run ACORNS three times.</p> <p> It is my strong experience that entrepreneurs learn best from one another.  Therefore, those who facilitate the round-table sessions are not consultants, academics or professional trainers, but entrepreneurs.  They give of their time freely, so they are all volunteers.  They have experienced the benefits of peer learning because they were all participants in Going for Growth.  They have seen the benefits, and this is now their way of giving back.  They are the backbone of the initiative.  Besides being an effective initiative to run, it becomes quite efficient because they are volunteers.</p> <p> We are leveraging their impact by undertaking group as opposed to one-to-one mentoring.  The benefit of the group has all sorts of serendipities.  It reduces the psychological isolation of the individual who is setting up, as she is meeting others like herself who are encountering the same challenges as her.  Participants have the benefit of being mentored by someone who has already done it all successfully.  The ACORNS lead entrepreneurs are all based in rural Ireland and drawn from all over the country.  They are in Donegal, the Gaeltacht in Galway, Kerry, Wexford, the midlands, etc.</p> <p> From the very beginning, we set out for participants that this was based on confidentiality, collaboration and mutual respect.  Those are the hallmarks.  Anything that is discussed around the table stays there.  That would be a challenge for any group in some respects, but especially for a group of people who feel that their business could become public.  Therefore, everything has to be confidential.  The programme reduces isolation, which is not only psychological, but also locational.  We set out to form participants into a strong network.  They meet twice at the beginning and end of their cycles in a residential forum.  I am thankful to the Department, as the way in which we have been able to structure this initiative means there is no cost to anyone involved and the residential elements are paid for.  It allows participants to form tighter bonds than they might otherwise.</p> <p> The initiative's outcomes are strong.  We measure everything.  The results are evident qualitatively and quantitatively.  I could provide the committee with the results from the beginning, but it does not have all day.  Instead, I will focus on the cycle that just concluded, ACORNS 3.  It had positive outcomes.  Some 50 people completed the cycle, or 88% overall, and all who completed it felt closer to achieving their growth goals.  These figures support our belief that we are doing the right thing and people feel good about it, but we also want to know whether the programme has been effective in terms of increases in turnover, employment and exports.  For example, the difficulties encountered in having rural businesses focus on export markets were mentioned.</p> <p> I can provide the detailed figures, but I will show the committee the salient points now.  Of the 50 who completed ACORNS 3, their combined turnover at the start of the cycle was &euro;888,000.  At the end of the cycle six months later, they had annualised sales of &euro;1.75 million, representing a significant increase.  There were eight exporters at the start of the cycle and nine new exporters by the end, representing a 112% increase.  At the beginning, 77 people were employed, including those involved in the initiative.  By the end, there were an extra 13 full-time jobs and 19 part-time ones.  These are positive outcomes.  Of the participants, 96% said that their participation brought about practical change and 100% felt nearer to achieving their ambitions, would recommend it to others and wanted a way of staying in contact with ACORNS.</p> <p> With the Department's support, we have been able to offer those who go through an ACORNS cycle an opportunity for further development.  They can stay, meet twice per year with a lead entrepreneur and continue to move their businesses forward.  We track all of that, so we can show various increases.  Participants in ACORNS 2 initially had &euro;731,000 in turnover between them.  Two years after undertaking the further development cycle with us, their turnover amounted to &euro;1.8 million and the number of jobs involved increased from 38 to 63.</p> <p> As we moved from pilot to ACORNS 2 to ACORNS 3, we wanted a means to help those who wanted to focus on the further development of their businesses.  We created a community and, more than that, a new set of round-table sessions called ACORNS Plus, which are facilitated by two of my Going for Growth leads.  The outcomes are stunning.  The seven involved in the first ACORNS Plus round-table session, which was a pilot, came into it with a turnover of &euro;355,000 between them.  By June 2018, they had &euro;1.5 million in turnover.</p> <p>They plan to grow and stay connected.</p> <p> We have just launched ACORNS 4.  There was very strong interest in applying for it.  The selection process has just been completed.  We have offered further development to those who completed ACORNS 3 and over 80% have said they would like this.  Owing to the demand to participate in ACORNS Plus round-table initiatives, which are for the community, we put two in place.  It is widely recognised that it is a grassroots movement.  What is happening is that people are telling one another about it.  More than that, while we talk about the role models as being those who facilitate the round-table initiative, each of those who becomes a participant is in effect a role model in her family and community.  The media has been very supportive and there is great interest in this.</p> <p> We will represent Ireland, I am delighted to say, at the European Enterprise Awards in November.  We just got word last week that, in our category, which is investing in entrepreneurial skills, we have reached the final three.  We are up against initiatives from Austria and Lithuania.  That is ACORNS.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Leamy" time="10:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018100300009#M00300"><p>I am thankful for the opportunity to present.  I am joined by Ms Michelle Tritschler, head of corporate services, and Mr. Paul Skinnader, director of community supports and services in Pobal.</p>  <p>  Our vision is one in which Pobal, government and communities work effectively together to create a cohesive and inclusive society.  We work to ensure resources and supports are targeted to meet community needs, including those of rural communities.  Our core role in delivering this vision is through providing an effective programme and grant management service for the Government.  Over 26 years, we have worked to deliver programmes in rural and urban areas alike.  Those programmes have been astonishingly varied in their purpose and application but all stem from a single public purpose.  That purpose is to realise a vision for our country whereby, regardless of one's postcode, be it urban or rural, one's community has the opportunity to be strong and sustainable.  That vision is much wider that any one issue, and no single aspect is a cure-all or a quick fix for the multifaceted challenges.  Clearly, however, rural communities need indigenous local business.  They need it to deliver jobs, provide services and show, one successful example at a time, how positive change can foster a positive attitude.</p>  <p>  Major challenges exist for rural communities.  The continued flow of young people to cities, the depopulation of some rural areas, difficulty in accessing local employment and key resources such as broadband feature high among these.  The major setbacks faced by businesses and families during the recent crisis have added to these pressures, as has the threat of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Earlier this morning, members heard our chairman designate explain that Pobal's work includes the delivery of a very wide range of programmes across rural and urban Ireland.  We have been in the field doing the job for 26 years.  We have seen a sustained attempt to address rural and development issues, through mechanisms such as the Action Plan for Rural Development and the setting up of local and community development committees in each county.  Old challenges persist in some respects but they have also changed substantially.  The challenge for public policy and for Pobal, which is charged with delivering on elements of policy, is to adapt, keep pace and move ahead of the changes.</p>  <p>  Social inclusion and communities are core for Pobal.  The impact our work and the Government funding we manage have on communities motivates us.  Our support for businesses is embedded in programmes that aim to improve the quality of life in the community.  Pobal is not focused specifically on business as a primary aim but we know business is an essential part of the response of delivering for communities, which is our objective.  Within that wider context of supporting communities, we value the supports we can offer to businesses.  Thriving communities need thriving businesses. </p>  <p>  Our work is shaped both by knowledge of the challenges communities face and the strategies set in place by the Government to meet them.  The range and scale of Pobal's work mean we can offer assistance to communities across many service areas, including through community enterprises, education and training, employment support and childcare.  The examples I wish to highlight are components of wider programmes that Pobal manages rather than stand-alone business support programmes.  These programmes offer support to help business development, assist in training and upskilling rural workforces, provide the staff that businesses need, and offer services that help sustain rural businesses.</p>  <p>  Let me give some relevant examples of our work that are relevant to today's discussion.  The social inclusion community activation programme, SICAP, addresses high and persistent levels of deprivation through targeted and innovative locally led approaches.  It offers, among a range of services, direct help to individuals who want to set up their own businesses.  During the three-year period from 2015 to 2017, over 7,000 individuals in rural areas were supported by SICAP to go into employment.  An additional 17,000 availed of other SICAP employment development supports in the areas of self-employment start-up, career advice, labour market training, work experience and mentoring.  Some 257 social enterprises were supported in rural areas.  Each of these figures represents an individual, a family and a business whose lives have been changed as a result of the supports they have received.  Together, every individual and family is part of a stronger more sustainable community.</p>  <p>  The community services programme, which we manage on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development, offers direct support to set up and to fund the ongoing work of community enterprises.  The programme promotes social enterprise as an approach to alleviating disadvantage and addressing local social, economic and environmental needs that are not being met through either public or private funding, or other resources.  It creates sustainable jobs for those most distant from the labour market and targets those who are long-term unemployed and from particular target groups.  It promotes sustainable social and economic development.  In 2017, 400 enterprises were funded through the community services programme, and 46% of individuals working in these enterprises lived in rural areas.  For example, the Arigna Mining Experience, a community tourism initiative based on Arigna's 400 year old mining story, is an example of a community services programme project that builds upon a local opportunity to develop a business and provide employment at the same time.</p>  <p>  In 2017-2018 academic year, Pobal provided supports to 4,543 early-years service providers, of which 1,538, or 34%, were located in rural areas.  The childcare capital funding scheme helps these businesses to increase capacity and the quality of their facilities.  In addition to providing supports to early-years service providers, we are also involved in managing targeted childcare initiatives that reduce the cost of childcare for parents, enabling many to return to the workforce.  These are not just economic initiatives.  Childcare is an essential building block for stronger communities.</p>  <p>  Pobal does not work alone in these areas.  The programmes we deliver are directed and funded by the Government, in each case through a lead Department.  Our funding and support flow through to local groups such as local development companies, which made a presentation to the committee last week through their representative organisation, the Irish Local Development Network.  We support the local community development committees in each county in terms of the delivery of programmes.  We support county childcare committees in their work.  In our work with partners, we attempt to bring consistency, co-ordination and high-quality standards to bear.  The information-gathering tools we have, including the deprivation index, are good examples of the practical assistance and knowledge we bring to the table.  As our chairman stated this morning, our commitment to minimising bureaucracy, within a context of increasing regulatory demands, is also central to our work.</p>  <p>  I thank the Chairman again for the opportunity to present to members this morning.  I am happy to take any questions members may wish to pose.  As I said at the outset, the supports I outlined are embedded within the programmes.  Their aim is to improve life quality for communities as a whole.  That includes the part they play in supporting rural businesses.  When Government funding achieves more than one goal, it brings added value without increasing expenditure.  We believe helping to develop and sustain businesses while achieving our primary aim of increasing community development and inclusion is a good example of this.</p></speech>

Their statements were very informative.  A few issues arise.   With regard to Microfinance Ireland, it is very good to hear that so many jobs are being created and that employment is being provided in rural areas.  My concern, which probably relates to every topic we are considering, is that money is being lent to people who cannot get money.  Microfinance Ireland is a lender of last resort.  The approval figure of 45% seems a bit low.  I realise the organisation has to be prudent and protect the money but where there is any glimmer of hope, it should be given to people who want to start up.</p> <p>Sometimes we fail before we succeed.  We are probably better people if we do fail, provided we pick ourselves up and go again.  If somebody has an idea, we should not be afraid to support it because even if it does fail, it is worth trying.  </p> <p> Perhaps Pobal is not selling its service to the public well enough.  It should be done in a more open way to advertise the availability of the fund.  The biggest issue for people who have an idea is that they do not know where to go.  I want to address this issue with everybody present.  If I was the chairman of a community council, as I was in Galway for a long time, and either I or the community group had an idea, I or it would be confused about where to go, as many people would say they could do this, that and the other.  A person who goes to the local development company or Pobal is sent somewhere else.  This might be an issue at which Pobal could look.  People who volunteer within their communities and want to do something within them usually run out of steam very fast if their ideas do not gain traction and there is confusion about how things are done.  There does not seem to be a definitive line on how someone can be sent to the right place such as a one-stop-shop to get the information he or she needs.  There seem to be too many organisations that are trying to do the same thing or at least using the same language about what they provide.  For me as a public representative, this is confusing and it creates frustration for representatives in communities who just throw their hands up in the air and forget about it.  It is a pity there is not a streamlined approach.  </p> <p> The other thing that really kills communities is the bureaucratic nature of everything that must be done in form filling.  Everybody has mentioned broadband, but people living in rural communities are expected to do everything online.  We know that is not possible, but we still insist that people will receive a better service if they do it online.  Until broadband is provided, this is unfair on communities that do not have access to it.  </p> <p> On the Leader programme, not a lot of money has been spent, particularly in County Galway, for reasons to do with tendering.  There were disputes and court cases.  The people who have suffered - the process has been badly managed - are those in communities that are only beginning to draw down funding.  This should not be allowed to happen under any other programme.  Disputes can take place, but the delivery of funding cannot be held up.  There is a need for a better structure to deal with issues that arise in order that we can get on with the business of funding communities.  The provision of funding in County Galway under the Leader programme has been held up for about 18 months because of a dispute which should have been dealt with differently.  Even if court cases are ongoing, communities still need to be serviced.  </p> <p> The representatives from ICOS highlighted a number of issues in rural Ireland.  I am from north Galway which has a number of co-operative livestock marts that also provide other services and that are at the heart of the farming and rural community.  They are all located in towns that gain great benefit from the business being done.  Some of them may have ambitions to develop, grow or modernise, but they find it hard to obtain funding.  Are sources of funding available for co-operative livestock marts that have the vision to try to create facilities for a modern society and are willing to do so but find it hard to gain access to funds?  One mart with which I have dealt is finding it difficult and coming up against a stone wall.  Are loans and/or grants available to help such marts?  The real benefit of a mart in any town stems from the fact that it serves the community by bringing people into the town from surrounding rural areas.  What used to happen on what used be the old fair day can now take place  on one or two days a week.  It happens in Tuam on a Monday or a Tuesday and on a Saturday in Headford.  People know that if the mart is open, the town will be busy.  Is there any way the delegates can support them?  </p> <p> The Atlantic economic corridor is mentioned in the programme for Government.  How do the delegates view it in rejuvenating and reinventing rural Ireland in order that we create a counter-balance to the east coast which is overdeveloped?  </p> <p> I thank the delegates for their concise and interesting presentations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="11:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018100300010#N00300"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  One thing that strikes me immediately about Microfinance Ireland is the fact that sums of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 are available.  A figure of &euro;25,000 seems very small and to be a very low threshold because many people in starting a business would need three times that figure to get it off the ground.  As three times the sum of &euro;25,000 is about twice the average industrial wage, it is not an awful lot of money.  Why has the threshold been set so low?  Is there a solid reason for it?</p>  <p>  It is clear that the cost of creating a job has proved to be very low in the model with which Microfinance Ireland is working.  It is not the case that people are receiving grants.  They are actually getting loans that they will pay back.  Forty-five per cent is the level at which Microfinance Ireland supports loans.  A total of 55% of applicants do not receive a loan.  Even if the figure was twice that percentage, it is my experience that people do not fail, rather it is businesses that fail.  When a business fails, the person concerned learns a lesson from it.  He or she often comes back a second or third time and the business may fail a second or third time, but eventually the person who perseveres will succeed.  On the level of funding about which Microfinance Ireland is talking, we are all conscious of IDA Ireland, foreign direct investment and the huge amounts of money the State has put into creating 20 or 1,000 jobs somewhere.  A few years ago we heard that the cost per job created through foreign direct investment was &euro;1 million, yet in this instance we have a tiny amount to create one job in rural areas in businesses that have the most potential to do well and trade.  A total of 82% of businesses are in the sector in which companies have between one and three employees.  As they are usually flexible and will work with the community around them, they have greater potential to sustain employment into the future.  </p>  <p>  On the amount of money in Microfinance Ireland's fund, the total value of loans approved in a six year period comes to &euro;26 million.  There was also mention of 1% being the rate.  Is that the standard rate, or does it vary much?  On the amount of money in the fund being higher, the rate being kept at that level and Microfinance Ireland having the ability to offer higher loans, even if the failure rate was higher, the cost per job created would still be low.  Why has the model not been expanded?  </p>  <p>  I welcome the contribution of ICOS.  On the issue raised by its representatives, with particular reference to the farming sector, we see the dairy sector doing so well and many others basically been run by co-operatives compared to the meat processing sector which during the years has moved into private hands.</p> <p>Is there a need for a new round of co-operatives to deliver for the farmer?  The delegates might also comment on the training provided for community groups that want to set up co-operatives.  </p> <p> The ACORNS story is magnificent.  I congratulate Ms Fitzsimons on the work she has done.  Can the six-month model be expanded?  What three actions or measures would enable the outcome to be multiplied?</p> <p> Some of the questions I asked in our earlier session are more appropriate to the delegates before us.  I thank them for their contributions.  On the issue of checks on childcare providers, are there plans to change the current system?  It has been proposed that the local authorities take over responsibility for the checks on community groups, about which people are concerned.  They may be experiencing problems, but they know that under Pobal they will all be subject to the same level of scrutiny.  How will the process be scrutinised when responsibility is devolved to the local authorities?  Also, what will be the cost of that scrutiny?  People are concerned that the cost will be equal to the level of funding delivered.  It is akin to a model of management developed in America some time in the 1980s and abandoned very quickly thereafter, whereby for every person working there were four measuring what he or she was doing.  We must be careful not to end up with this scenario.  In all cases, there has to be a sense of proportionality.  I could give examples of cases where I felt the level of scrutiny was totally out of proportion with the funding being sought, but I do not propose to go into them in such a public forum.  Where a community project receives funding to purchase equipment, it is purchased and an official from the local development company visits to check the invoice to check that the equipment has been paid for, including by viewing bank payment details and so on.  In the past the word of the applicant was accepted.  In my experience, it is no longer being accepted and everything is being rechecked over and over again.  There is no trust.  Trust needs to be re-established as community organisations are doing their best forcommunities.  They are not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes.  If there is a little slip here and there, it is not intentional.  Trust must be extended to people who are, by and large, working voluntarily.  I understand we are speaking about public money and accept that there is a need fir accountability, but at the same time there has to be a sense of proportionality.</p></speech>

Each application is considered on its merits.  The reality is that every one of our applicants is a non-bankable deal; therefore, the starting level is very low.  Not providing funding so as not to waste money and not providing funding to help somebody to waste his or her own money while also trying to create jobs is a very difficult balancing act.  It is not an exact science by any means.  The overall default rate is less than 30%, which means that there is a 70% success rate.  This is a very positive message.  Any time the approval rate has gone beyond the 45% mark, the default rate has risen dramatically.  As I said, it is a difficult balancing act.  I hear what members are saying, but we need to strike a balance between achieving best value for money and using the fund appropriately and not helping people to do something which, on examination of a deal, we believe they should not do.</p>  <p>  The &euro;25,000 limit is provided for in the statutory instrument.  I was not in my current position at the time, but I think it was based on a perceived need in the economy and also on the fact that the European guarantee in place at that stage for micro-finance was for a maximum fund of &euro;25,000  On a point of clarification, the 1% rate mentioned was a discount on our normal rate for people coming to us through the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and the local development companies, LDCs.  We do this to encourage people to use the services of the LEOs and LDCs because many of our clients desperately need the additional services and training.  It is an incentive to encourage them to go for that rate.</p>  <p>  It is true that with a larger fund we would be able to do more.  We would also be able to increase our presence in the marketplace.  As things stand, we are working with a fund that has a lifespan of approximately ten years and trying to manage our way through the process.  </p>  <p>  I ask my colleague Ms Parkinson to respond to the question about the landscape and the marketing side.</p></speech>

There are multiple agencies, which leaves people unsure of where to go.   The LEOs, as one-stop-shops for businesses in their local areas, do the job of signposting.  Microfinance Ireland is a core component of their offering when dealing with small business owners.  I take the point that there is some work to be done, but there is a lot more to be done in getting the message out.  Two years ago the supporting SMEs online tool was introduced.  It lists the 170 State supports available and the bodies that support small business owners.  People are encouraged to register their requirements online to access the relevant support.  When Microfinance Ireland was set up in 2012, it was envisaged that all referrals would be through bank declines and the LEOs, but we learned quickly that we needed to have a much stronger brand presence.  We are working hard on it and have seen it grow in the last couple of years.  I take the point that there some work has been done, but there is a lot more to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.470" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Leamy" time="11:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018100300011#O00500"><p>On Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney's point about the one-stop-shop, the need for people to be signposted to where they need to go and people being confused by the multiple agencies in this space, we have received feedback in the last couple of years, in particular through our feedback and engagement mechanisms.  We meet groups regularly to seek feedback from them on our services and how we might do things better.  We held a number of regional seminars and workshops in the past year, at which we engaged with all of the people with whom we worked.  The issue raised by the Deputy is one that continually comes up in our engagements.  To address it, we have dedicated central help desks in Pobal and client service desks where people can make a telephone call or deal with any issue that they need to have resolved.  In the past year we received over 5,000 telephone calls and 75% of the issues raised were resolved within one day, while 95% were resolved within three days. </p>  <p>  We are endeavouring to improve our communications.  We have developed a new website which is more user-friendly in assisting people to access information on local services.  We are also working closely with local community development committees and local development companies to support them more.  I accept the point that this is an area in which we continuously need to improve.</p> <p>We are not there yet and people do get confused by the range of entities.  There is a requirement for all of us to work more collaboratively on that.  We are increasingly using online systems and are trying to make things as efficient as possible for groups accessing them.  We are conscious of people in rural areas where there is not effective broadband.  In those instances we have services whereby people can talk to us on the phone and forms can be filled out over the phone.  People are encouraged to access the county childcare committees, which have facilities to use this or their local libraries, or to link in with the local community development committees.  We are considering a variety of ways that people can access the services.  On the other side, we are trying to make our systems as efficient as possible to do the work and online is the way we will proceed.  We are very mindful of that.  </p> <p> On the Atlantic economic corridor, it is fair to say that in all the programmes we have managed on behalf of Government, a significant percentage are allocated to the west coast because it is a question of focusing on the areas that need it most based on the data we have.  We are endeavouring to do that.  The local economic community development plans in each county are prioritising different areas. </p> <p> On childcare compliance, a good percentage of the visits are unannounced.  That arose when a few years ago significant issues about the quality of childcare intervention were raised in the public domain.  The response from the Government and the Department was that there should be a percentage of unannounced visits.  I know it creates stress for childcare providers, especially if Pobal comes in to do a compliance visit and Tusla inspects them.  We are working with Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to try to integrate them more and to achieve clearer communication with the childcare facilities.  We have fed back people's concerns on that to the Department but it is a policy issue.  </p> <p> It was not initially envisaged that Pobal would carry out the Article 48 checks.  It was always envisaged that local authorities would take them on for LEADER.  The Department asked us to take it on because it was felt that the local community development committees were not well established and needed more time before taking it on and having local autonomy.  We and the Department have been anxious to ensure that there is a transfer of that service to the local areas.  There is and will be significant training provided to each of the local authority areas over the next few months on the Article 48 checks to ensure consistency.  We are still involved with them for oversight or in the areas where a local authority is not carrying it out.  I have asked my colleagues to search for the costs of the Article 48 checks.  We will give the committee the absolute detail on that by next week.  </p> <p> The point that there are many regulatory requirements is well made and we are always considering that from the board and executive perspectives.  Volunteers involved in these services are overburdened in taking responsibility for those.  Our chairperson designate gave an example of how we have tried, through the senior alert scheme for example, to take the administration off local groups in order that they can focus on visits to people in their homes as opposed to filling out forms.  That is the direction we are going, to take as much as we can for most of the programmes.  If a community or voluntary organisation has charitable status it must meet all the regulatory requirements and there probably is more work we can do to support them.  We will be launching toolkits fairly soon to help groups with that.  We will be running regional workshops with groups to support them and we are looking to expand our helpdesk to respond to people on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether it is just six months and the initial pilot was developed over six months.  It is good to have a beginning, middle and end because the outputs can be measured but it has grown like a snowball.  There were 48 participants on the pilot and now 160 people are actively engaged with ACORNS.  The Department has allowed us to develop this community.  Once one has been through a cycle, one can be held to do further development, go into the community, go to topic-based workshops or find other round tables to get involved in.  It is ongoing but we always measure over six months.</p>  <p>  Our bureaucracy is limited because we are small.  People can post in applications, email or fill them in over the phone.  We judge people on a few pieces of paper and that works very well.  I would say we get it right 98% of the time.  We ask where the people are now, where they would like to be, what are their barriers, how they think we can help them and what for them, not for anybody else, constitutes success.</p>  <p>  As for the supports available, Microfinance Ireland is here and I compliment it because from the beginning we felt it would be important for people to be helped navigate the quagmire of what is available.  We developed a booklet of available supports highlighting the information, advice, mentoring and networks provided by local enterprise offices, LEOs, LEADER and Enterprise Ireland, among others.  We then decided that it is much better to have people come and talk to us besides having information available online or in a booklet.  For each ACORNS cohort that comes in we invite the LEOs, Enterprise Ireland, Microfinance Ireland and the Credit Review Office and they explain to people what they can do individually.  Those attending have the opportunity to talk to them afterwards.  Then they feel that they have a personal connection and if they have a problem they can talk, for example, to Ms Deirdre Parkinson who has come to us.  We find that works particularly well. </p>  <p>  Our ethos is built on volunteerism.  The Deputy asked what are the three things we would like.  We would like to be allowed to do what we do in spades because it is making a difference.  The individuals going through ACORNS have become advocates, role models, ambassadors and they are making a difference on the ground.  When we ask them what stops them setting up they mention issues that affect all entrepreneurs, male and female, such as marketing, how to identify customers and how best to finance the business.  These are the types of issue we see all the time.  If we can continue with grassroots initiatives they will make a real difference.  The Austrians and the Scots have been on to us to know if this is transferable and whether they can do it in other countries.  Certainly they can.  It is terrific for Ireland that we are leading from the front by being innovative and our initiative is making a real difference to those in rural Ireland. </p></speech>

We are quite conscious of that because many of our affiliates run their co-ops from their kitchen tables.  My only contact with one not too far from the Deputy's home is the landline and we manage with that.  As to whether we can help them or should be the first place to go, we provide a business plan in our first interaction for the prospective co-op to fill out.  From that 15-minute exercise they will know pretty quickly whether we are the right organisation for them or whether the co-operative is right for them.</p>  <p>  We cannot comment on the specifics of the mart query but the marts have shown themselves to be pretty agile and good at raising those funds.  </p> <p>We are on hand and happy to help in whatever way we can if they are ICOS affiliates or co-operative marts.</p> <p> Deputy Martin Kenny asked about meat processing and why co-operatives do not have a major presence there any more.  It is a long story and, at the minute, there are a couple of barriers to that second round occurring, since necessary hygiene regulations, which are quite difficult to adhere to for a small, start-up level site, would have to come in on quite a large scale.  To be profitable in general, meat processing has to happen on a large scale.  That is a barrier to it happening now.  Recent headlines and economic and weather conditions have made it all the more pertinent.  There is also new EU support of producer groups, which may accelerate things.</p> <p> Our chairman, Mr. James O'Donnell, will answer the question on education.</p></speech>

We provide training including mart drovers' courses in marts, training for directors in large multinational co-operatives and for production supervisors on the ground.  In total, we provided 1,350 people with training in the co-operative sector, which was funded through Skillnet Ireland, at a cost of &euro;550,000 with matching funding coming from the co-operative sector, which cost the sector more than &euro;325,000.  ICOS helps and this year we intend to develop it further with regard to health and safety in the marts and with the director of training at the Plunkett Institute, in conjunction with University College Cork.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.476" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="11:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018100300013#Q00300"><p>I will try to be brief because much ground has been covered by various speakers.  We are discussing sustaining small rural businesses.  We often hear through media and even in debates in this House that rural Ireland is dying.  Depopulation is a challenge, as is supporting rural businesses.  I am heartened to hear that there are substantial supports for rural dwellers.  We have heard of some of these supports through the various agencies that are presenting here this morning.  Maybe we are not communicating these supports enough.  Listening to discussions this morning, I believe many of us can be caught up in our own environment and work and we forget about communicating to the wider populace.  Perhaps this committee can assist with co-ordinating communication of various supports from the agencies we have heard about this morning to the wider rural populace.  There is work to be done in that regard.  One hears confusion about one stop shop services or access to supports.  Whatever it is, there is a lack of communication.  That is not a negative.  I am trying to be constructive in how we co-ordinate and communicate the supports for rural Ireland.  I ask each agency to take that away and, when devising their strategies for next year, with their five-year and ten-year plans, consider how we can penetrate into rural Ireland in order that there is a better understanding of the supports they provide.  We would be doing a good day's work with that.  We would be creating awareness and educating the people that need the agencies' supports, and then they will not come to politicians, Citizens Information and other places.  They will know exactly where to go to get the required support.</p>  <p>  In my experience, it is often the same people who go back for supports because they understand how it works and where the grants are.  In each county, one will find pockets of villages or towns that are very good at drawing down grants because they have that understanding and capacity.  Multitudes of other rural towns and villages do not have the capacity and probably need the support more than anybody.  The challenge for all of us is penetrating into those areas.  It is great to hear about the positive work that has been done to support rural Ireland because we often hear that nothing has been done.  We are hearing quite the opposite here this morning.  I want to emphasise that fact.</p>  <p>  I gave my views on Pobal and, while I do not want to call it bureaucracy, how we can break down accessibility to funding and awareness, as I emphasised already.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of ICOS and the co-operative movement.  I remember learning about the co-operative movement in Ireland in my history books.  We should never forget about its power, about how it works from the ground up and about how it can build on our natural assets and strengths.  I encourage the witnesses to continue in that work.  It integrates well with rural living.  It is a proven model of working.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge new initiatives such as accelerating the creation of rural nascent start-ups, ACORNS.</p>  <p>  I am open to correction but I understand Microfinance Ireland came into being because our banking system was broken and people did not have access to credit.  Microfinance Ireland stepped into the breach to provide credit lines where they were not being given through the traditional method.  I have a couple of questions to Microfinance Ireland with regard to that.  The witnesses gave us some percentages relating to the number of loans being allocated outside of Dublin.  What is the regional loan allocation?  Will the witnesses be more specific on that in order that the joint committee can hear exactly where those loans are going?  Are they going to larger towns or to smaller towns and villages?  I am not sure if the witnesses have that level of detail to hand today.  If they do not, perhaps they could forward it to us.  Are the loans for rural enterprises or both urban and rural enterprises?  Is there a specific loan category for rural enterprises?  Whether rural tourism, food production or other rural initiatives, since that is this committee's focus, is there such a category of loans in the microfinance structures and, if not, will they consider distilling their loan book in order that we have a better understanding of where the loans are going and whether they are having an impact in rural Ireland?  The witnesses mentioned the quantity of loans and that they are lending some millions of euro per year.  Have they risen or fallen each year since Microfinance Ireland was established?  Are the banks getting back into their traditional market?  If they are, while I do not mean this disrespectfully, the function of Microfinance Ireland should be diminishing since it was set up to step into the breach for struggling areas.</p>  <p>  I have a general question for all the agencies.  Are they competing for the same public funding to allocate to the various people that they support?  Are they competing for the same client base in rural areas?  That could be healthy.  That is not a disrespectful remark.  If there is a certain number of rural entrepreneurs in County Waterford, where I am from, do the witnesses' organisations all compete for those customers to support them?</p>  <p>  There is a huge amount of rural opportunities.  The Waterford greenway is a perfect example of a rural initiative supported by a multitude of agencies, local authorities, Leader and State funding.  That has been the catalyst for the development of rural enterprise along a 50 km route in Waterford, which we are amazed with.  It shows that, when we exploit our natural assets and spin off a bit of initiative and momentum, it can work with the support of agencies such as those in attendance today.  I am positive and hopeful for rural Ireland.  The negatives that we often hear are challenges which have always been there.  There are changes in life, including online challenges, changes in globalisation, and Brexit.  There are always challenges but rural communities have always been resilient.  They innovate and reinvent themselves.  We will continue to live in rural Ireland but we need to innovate in how we assist it.</p> <p>We all mentioned broadband.  It is a huge challenge for us.  How can the agencies, whose representatives are attending at the committee today, collaborate to ensure we assist in delivering broadband to the people who need it in rural Ireland?  We should not just leave it to one Government Department.  How can we, as agents of the State and people with connections in all areas of rural Ireland, assist in collaborating to deliver rural broadband?  The technology and the will is there.  If we get together we can do it over the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="11:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018100300014#R00200"><p>I do not necessarily agree with what Senator Coffey has said about a number of things.  Some of the agencies who have dealt with me in the past will know my view.  Ultimately when one looks at sources of money there are two strands - European and Government.  It is really only one source because normally what the Government does is disburse European money mixed with Government money.  The Government does the mixing before it gets rid of it.  Having multiple agencies funding the same project always reminds me of the Nile Delta.  It starts with one river, breaks into a whole lot of bits and then joins at the end again as one river running into the sea.  It does not seem to be efficient for the applicant group or as a way for the Government to be dispensing money because there are so many agencies involved.  Each agency has its costs and overheads and each one is an overhead for the applicant body.</p>  <p>  The greenway to Dungarvan, which I had a bit of an association with in its earliest form, is an example.  I cannot understand why one Government Department could not fund it from beginning to end.  That leads to a point that relates to Pobal.  There was a multitude of small partnerships and LEADER companies which overlapped.  Poor customers on the ground in some areas often found they did not have access to SICAP but their next door neighbours did.  In some areas one could go to a LEADER partnership company and get all one's services.  In other areas one had to go through a LEADER company and a partnership company and it was a case of never the twain shall meet.  We amalgamated all of that so there was a LEADER partnership company covering 100% of rural Ireland and partnership companies on their own covering all of urban Ireland.  Everybody was covered.  We put in the rural social scheme and the T&uacute;s scheme.  The idea at the time was that in any one area one could go to a one-stop shop for a whole wide range of services.  The idea was that if any new services were provided and if there were any gaps in the market, the services would be delivered through the one-stop shop which requires a Government agency locally.  Is Pobal a more efficient model, particularly for the applicant, than a model in which there are all these different agencies and people come into their offices and given a big list of people to go to when in 90% of cases there is no money there for the applicant?</p>  <p>  The other problem with the multi-agency model is not that they are all queuing up to compete to give but that they are queueing up to tell people why to go to the other guy, particularly if it is not a particularly good application.  It is not the position that somebody evaluates the application and tells applicants what they need for a successful application.  In that context I am a little surprised that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine did not put the money into the ACORNS scheme through the LEADER partnership companies.  I accept there is a total slack in the market and that there are more male entrepreneurs than female.  That issue should have been dealt with.  I have no problem with that.  SICAP should have dealt with it.  It was supposed to deal with its target groups.  SICAP is about target groups.  It was about one-parent families.  It was about older people.  It is about all the unemployed and so on.  If it was an identified subset of what SICAP was doing, I cannot understand why a new agency was set up.  That is just a particular hang-up of mine.  It is not a new hang-up.  Those who have dealt with me for well over ten or 15 years will know that as somebody who was involved in development on the ground as a manager of a community co-op, I could write a book on all of this.</p>  <p>  My second question relates to forms and a fetish I have.  More and more forms seem to require answers in essay format.  An example of a question is "Please explain why your area is disadvantaged".  If one is a good professor of disadvantage, one would write a whole lot of stuff.  I will not use the term I would like to use to describe it in this respectable forum.  It seems to me now that there are professionals who will write the stuff if they are paid enough money and who know exactly the buttons to press.  It does not mean they have a better case than the person who just writes the truth.  This has become a whole industry on every side.  One needs to get an expert to fill in one's application for sports capital funding.  One has to pay money to get the form for the sports capital funding filled in.  There are other forms.  Bidding wars go on for filling out forms.  One night I got a form that was in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as it was at the time, and I stayed up late and I got the form and there were all these "Yes" or "No" questions such as "Are you in a deprived area?".  I decided to get rid of all the questions that required essay responses and replaced them with questions about whether an applicant was in the RAPID area or CL&Aacute;R area.  No matter what case the applicant made I knew that RAPID areas had been scientifically defined as being urban areas with higher social deprivation and I knew the CL&Aacute;R areas were the ones with the biggest population decline.  If I wanted a definition of disadvantage, it was all mapped to the square inch.  Therefore, I came in the following day with a nice simplified form with questions that required a "Yes" or "No" answer to virtually every question.  It did not rely on the ability of the person writing the form or judgment of the person reading it to determine how good the essay was.  It just became an essay writing competition.  I felt there was a more objective and fair way of giving out the money.  We seem to have regressed to the essay form.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has a lot of new forms that require a lot of essay answers.  Has Pobal in particular looked at this issue and asked why essay replies are required for obvious questions?  Does it favour the people who are strongest at writing over the most worthy groups?  Are we pushing more vulnerable groups that could do great work on the ground away?  They are people who just get the job done but are not big into the writing phenomenon that seems to be a modern thing.  </p>  <p>  Pobal had a decentralisation programme and 30 or 40 jobs in Clifden.  I understand they operate very efficiently.  Is it the intention to pursue that?  We did it on the basis that all new jobs given to Pobal by the State would be located outside of Dublin and that Pobal would not move people who were settled in Holbrook House.  Has Pobal pursued that?  This city is full of civil servants trying to get out of the place.  From what I hear the office in Clifden works perfectly and the wages get paid every week without fail.  It has a very high level of performance with very little oversight from Dublin.  One of the best ways of creating rural jobs is to bring all those services that we control ourselves to rural Ireland.  We talk about the IDA going to rural Ireland but companies coming in will do whatever they want to do.  There is an easy, soft way of doing it by basing all new jobs in Clifden.  </p>  <p>  The community services programme is a programme I really like but I was shocked to learn recently that the one-for-one payment covering the minimum wage to full-time equivalents, FTEs, has been eroded considerably in the past two or three years and it is putting huge pressure on things like meals on wheels and community centres with limited incomes.</p> <p>Was that recommended by Pobal or was it imposed by the Department against Pobal's will?  It might be an unfair question but it is valid.</p> <p> I read Microfinance Ireland's report with interest.  I remember ten or 15 years ago talking to somebody in a county enterprise board who was boasting that jobs were being created for &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 a piece.  I was cynical enough to say that if they could be created with that kind of money, the board's money was probably not needed.  As somebody who was involved in job creation for a long time, I always get a bit worried when I find out the cost of creating a job is less than &euro;2,000.  One might set up a hairdresser's which, while it is a fantastic and necessary service, will require displacement.  Every time I see a supermarket is opening with 500 jobs, I ask how many small shops are being pushed out.  That is the nature of life, but it is not net 500 jobs.  If one is talking about industry and so on, my experience is that &euro;2,000 will not do anything.  Most businesses, if they are to have any success, will be well over a &euro;25,000 requirement after a year.  When do they graduate to there?  </p> <p> I have travelled around for the past year and a half.  There was a guy who employed eight people in a factory that closed.  Enterprise Ireland, EI, suggested to me it would be reopened, and I managed to locate somebody to take it over.  He is doing high-quality work, some of which in its previous existence was in this House.  He needs the two buildings to be relocated into one, and he requires &euro;1.5 million.  In fairness the Minister came down to visit.  We have scoured all the agencies, from the Western Development Commission, EI, IDA, the enterprise board and so on.  The businessman needs some assistance with the building because if he borrowed at commercial rates it would not be viable, but there are eight jobs that will be there.  It is totally sustainable, but not if has to put &euro;1.5 million on the table for a building.  With all the plethora of agencies, it does not seem there is any that can help.  Where does Pobal graduate to after it is finished with Microfinance Ireland?  What interest rates are being charged?  What rate of failure does Microfinance Ireland have?  If it is a low rate of failure, Microfinance Ireland is a failure.  If bodies are lending money and they never have a failure, they are a failure themselves.  Microfinance Ireland is meant to be the borrower of last resort and, therefore, there will be winners and losers.  I am curious to know of the 1,830 businesses since Microfinance Ireland started, how many failures have there been?  Fair enough, you win some, you lose some, but how many have succeeded beyond Microfinance Ireland's wildest dreams?  </p> <p> When Microfinance Ireland is assessing, how much does it assess the person and the promoter, and how much does it do it on a desktop analysis?  The desktop analysis must obviously be done, and if a business does not make common sense it should not be funded.  I am blue in the face saying that.  On the other hand, when I was involved with people who worked for me in my previous life, I would pick out the likely people and encourage them to set up in business, some of whom had successful business.  There had to be something to do, but equally there had to be the person to do it.  How does Microfinance Ireland balance those two?  I have seen in many cases that if one got the right person, the sky was the limit, whereas if one got the wrong person, no matter how good the idea was, it failed.  Is it just desktop or does Microfinance Ireland interview these people?  Is it allowed to do what credit unions used to be allowed to do, and which they seem not to be allowed to do anymore, which is make a judgment on the person sitting before them of whether he or she has that X factor to make it happen?  We recognise that with the big entrepreneurs and that not everyone is a Michael O'Leary.  If someone else had got Ryanair at the time it was going bust rather than Michael O'Leary, we might not have cheap flights to Britain.  Is Microfinance Ireland allowed to assess the person, or is it totally rigid?</p></speech>

I was in another meeting.  My questions relate to Pobal's presentation.  In supporting volunteers and committees, will Mr. Leamy elaborate on the toolkit to which he alluded?</p>  <p>  Senator Coffey mentioned the supports that are available, but we need to try to communicate them to people.  What is Pobal's view of how we do that?  Is it with financing, information or support?  I know the local enterprise offices, LEOs, have been mentioned, with which we are familiar, but it seems from our discussions here that something more is needed.  Otherwise, the LEOs need to be better resourced and supported in order to be that vehicle.  I am not sure, but I ask the witnesses, who are experts in the area, to try to find out how best we can create that point of information about all the issues that involve businesses in rural communities.</p></speech>

I totally agree on the communications side of things.  We need a greater alignment across all the agencies with a stronger focus on indigenous local businesses.  We do not acknowledge or advertise that as much, but anything we can all do together is beneficial.</p>  <p>  On the allocations, we mentioned 79% in our statement, and all the regional and county breakdowns are in the overall larger document which we sent the committee.  To give a flavour of it, one statistic is that if Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick are removed, it leaves 60% of applications as "real rural", if one can call them that.  We have a breakdown by region in the report which the committee has, which we can reshare if necessary.</p></speech>

Dublin is 21%, Border counties are 13%, the west is 11%, the mid-west is 8%, the south west is 10%, the south east is 17%, the mid-east is 11%, while the midlands are 9%.  It is right across virtually every town and village in the country.</p>  <p>  On the quantity of loans, it is an interesting and good point.  The business has gone in the opposite direction to what people probably assumed on day 1.  People did not have a desire to borrow during the recent crisis, but as the economy has settled down more and more people are looking to do so.  Our volumes are growing year on year.  We are up at approximately 19% this year in applications.  There is an ongoing demand but, despite the banks being back in the market, the area in which they do fewest approvals is the micro-enterprise space because it is a harder area for them to do.  Credit supply has definitely improved, and demand has thankfully begun to pick up.  While we are playing in a smaller pool, the combination of credit supply and demand means there is a market that we will always need to feed into.</p> <p>  I will turn quickly to the forms.   Hopefully, nobody is paying somebody for a form.  The form should be simple and we do our best to make it more so.  Documents are required for a loan application but it is not a long process.  On the cost for jobs, the cost per job is a measure of our effectiveness.  It is all of our costs and bad debts divided by the number of jobs created or sustained.  That includes all of our overheads and interest paid back on loans.  The person has, of course, borrowed money on top of that.  A business cannot be set up for &euro;2,000.  That is the cost per job of the process we are doing.  </p> <p> The &euro;25,000 limit was also mentioned.  That limit is set down in the statutory instrument.  Where do people go after that?  This year, thankfully, a change we have achieved is that a person can now come back to us a second time.  Up to earlier this year, the logic was that if people got a loan from Microfinance Ireland, they should be bankable after that.  As the loans have begun to mature, the reality is that they are not.  They are sustaining themselves and employing people but they are still weak businesses.  We have now been allowed to do repeat business with our existing customer base.  On our loan rates, our standard rate is 7.8% fixed APR.  For partner referrals through the banks, LEOs and LDCs there is a 1% discount, so it is 6.8%.  Our default rate is 30% all in.  We have only written off 16% so far but the default rate is 30%.</p></speech>

We have many online tools and infographics.  They are easy to see on each of the programmes.  We have also engaged in a number of regional workshops.  We were, for example, involved at the National Ploughing Championships, getting word out about the programmes where people are engaging with them.  I take the point that there is much more we can do.  There are many programmes and many initiatives to support people in rural Ireland.  It is about letting them know about them.  One example is the senior arts scheme.  There was an underspend in that about a year ago.  A number of members of the committee raised it.  Significant effort was put into communicating the scheme and engagement has significantly increased.  There has been a massive increase in those numbers to the extent that we are now chasing to try to keep up with the demand.  That is good and it shows what can be delivered when the communication is right.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised a number of points on form filling.  We have had conversations in the past on the essay competitions and some of the forms that might have to be completed.  We are constantly revising the forms.  We are restricted, to some extent, because we have to collect certain data on the completed forms.  I would also like to think that anybody that submits an application to us gets direct feedback.  If someone is rejected, he or she gets direct feedback by letter or phone on the areas that could be improved in the future.  Help and resources are available, through our help desk and client services desk, for people who wish to submit for a new round when it becomes available.  </p>  <p>  On regionalisation, as has been mentioned, we have a strong office in Clifden with up to 40 staff.  Slightly less than 50% of all of our staff are based in the regions.  We now have 12 offices throughout the country.  The point was well made.  We are expanding with new programmes, especially the early years programme.  In our new strategic plan from 2018 to 2021, we have stated that if there is any further expansion, we are going to make every effort to do it regionally.  That is because of costs in Dublin and also because technology makes it much easier now to do business on a regional basis.  We have every intention of carrying that out over the next couple of years.</p>  <p>  On the CSP and the minimum wage, that is, ultimately, a decision to be made by the Department.  If some organisations are in particular straits, there is a support fund that organisations can apply for to have subvention to support them in paying the minimum wage.  The committee will be aware that the Minister intends to have a review of the CSP and that will be one of the issues reviewed.  I will hand over to my colleague Mr. Skinnader to give some detail on the toolkit for Senator Hopkins.</p></speech>

It is a toolkit that seeks to provide information on human resources, corporate governance and financial management.  We have revised that this year because of the changed landscape.  It is now available to all our of organisations on our website.  In addition, we are going to run workshops in the next number of weeks on the CSP and we will be making reference again to that toolkit.</p></speech>

As Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address it on the performance and expenditure targets of the Department during the first half of 2018.  It has been a very significant year for my Department, with the launch of Project Ireland 2040 which, as we know, is a comprehensive national planning framework and associated ten-year national development plan.  It explicitly recognises that our culture, language and heritage are essential parts of the sustainable development of the country and acknowledges the centrality of culture and creativity to our national development.  For my part, it has afforded my Department an unprecedented opportunity to invest over &euro;1 billion in our cultural, linguistic and heritage infrastructure to safeguard and future-proof this precious resource for generations to come.  Of this investment, some &euro;725 million will be invested directly in our cultural infrastructure, creative industries and enhancing the cultural experience for citizens.  An investment programme of &euro;285 million over the period of the plan emphasises the amenity value of our natural and built heritage.  A further &euro;178 million is being provided to support and protect the Irish language, Gaeltacht communities and communities on offshore islands.  This is particularly fitting in 2018 as we celebrate Bliain na Gaeilge.  </p> <p>  In April this year I was delighted that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, could join me in launching the historic capital investment plan for my Department on foot of Project Ireland 2040.  The level of investment proposed will transform our cultural and heritage infrastructure across the country and represents an important statement for this and future generations.  I look forward to implementing this programme of investment and seeing stakeholders and citizens alike reaping its rewards in the years ahead.  </p> <p>  For my appearance today, members have been provided with a report by my Department outlining details of performance and expenditure across all programme areas during the first half of 2018.  The 2018 Revised Estimates provide for a gross allocation of just under &euro;303 million for my Department.  In addition, a further &euro;700,000 in capital funding was carried over from the 2017 provision.  Gross total expenditure incurred by my Department in the period to 30 June was &euro;143.5 million.  This expenditure represents 47% of the overall 2018 gross allocation.  My colleague, the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and I will speak about the highlights in each programme area during the first half of 2018.  I will commence with the culture programme and will be happy to expand later on any matter members may wish to raise.</p> <p>  Funding of &euro;167.3 million is provided in 2018 for the culture programme.  Total gross expenditure on programme A up to 30 June was just under &euro;85 million, representing 51% of the 2018 programme allocation.  A cornerstone of my Department's culture investment programme under the national development plan is the &euro;460 million being set aside for the renovation of the national cultural institutions, the protection of the national collections and the enhancement of visitor experiences and services.  The funding programme will build on the success of the renovation of the Milltown and Dargan wings of the National Gallery of Ireland and include significant capital investments across many of the institutions.  This is a critical year for the appraisal, planning and design of these flagship projects, with a view to moving to the implementation phase in the following years.  We have made progress on a number of key projects, including the redevelopment of the National Library of Ireland and the renovation of the National Archives.  We are also moving other projects through the appraisal and evaluation stages, including the Natural History Museum and the Crawford Gallery in Cork.  </p> <p>  Under a new culture and creativity programme, an investment of &euro;265 million will be made in enhancing regional cultural infrastructure to ensure people in all parts of Ireland will enjoy opportunities to engage with the arts and culture; in the digitisation of the national collections to ensure they are preserved and made available to a global audience and in the expansion of the audio-visual sector as a key element of the Government&rsquo;s creative industries investment.  In June this year my Department launched a major new strategy for the audio-visual industry which will guide the &euro;200 million Project Ireland 2040 investment in expanding this vital creative industry.  </p> <p>  The Creative Ireland programme goes from strength to strength and continues to enable increased creativity and access to cultural activity across communities.  The funding provided for the programme has meant huge progress under pillar 1 - creative youth.  Working in partnership with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Arts Council, we launched Creative Schools in March.  Some 10% of all schools in the country applied for inclusion in the pilot programme and 150 were chosen from 400 applications.  Over 38,000 students will have access to this initiative during this year and into next year which will explore the potential impact of the arts and creativity on school life.  </p> <p>  Funding provided for local authority culture teams from my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has led to the development of ambitious and challenging five-year culture and creativity strategies for each local authority.  All 31 were launched last week by me, the Taoiseach and my colleague, the Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  With the additional funding provided this year, local authorities have risen to the challenge of rolling out the Creative Ireland programme in communities all over Ireland and already doubled the initiatives to over 500, with more expected by year end.  On 23 June Cruinni&uacute; na n-&oacute;g was the first national day celebrating children and young people&rsquo;s creativity and it was a great success.  The funding provided allowed local authorities to hold over 500 events and initiatives throughout the country free of charge.  Events ranged from photography to theatre and drama to coding.  The culture teams in the local authorities showed imagination and innovation in their approach.  </p> <p>  In May I launched the Creative Ireland programme scheme seeking new partnerships across the various creative activities.  There was huge interest expressed and I will make a formal announcement in the coming weeks of up to 30 new partnerships focusing on creative industries, the environment, film and media, heritage, music, theatre and drama, the arts, including the visual arts, and, of course, mental health.  I look forward to feeding the learning from the new partnerships into wider Government policy, making the Creative Ireland programme a real cross-government initiative.  </p> <p>  This year will also see the presentation of Culture Ireland GB18, a special year long programme to celebrate and renew the unique cultural relationship between Ireland and Great Britain.  Over 100 Irish artists are touring England, Scotland and Wales in celebration of this unique cultural connection, as well as forging new connections which it is hoped will be further developed in future years, ensuring our close cultural bonds for the future.  </p> <p>  In the context of the culture programme, it would be remiss of me not to mention the new cultural and heritage centre at the Bank of Ireland, College Green which opened its doors to the public in July.  Bank of Ireland has generously made space available to the State for the centre for a ten-year period, during which time my Department will manage and animate the space.  The first exhibition in the centre is "Listen, Now, Again", an exhibition exploring the life and works of the Nobel prize winning poet S&eacute;amus Heaney which is being run and curated by the National Library of Ireland and certainly worth visiting.  </p> <p>  I am happy to expand on any issue members would like to raise in respect of this programme area before proceeding, or I will move on to the section on heritage, if the Chairman prefers.</p></speech>

I want to make a couple of points on culture and another on heritage.  I thank the Minister and Minister of State for their engagement with us today.  The Estimates process is very important.</p> <p>  On Galway 2020 projects, it has been disappointing to see changes in the management team.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Madigan, met the chair of Galway 2020 to discuss the CEO stepping down and the cultural leadership plans.  It is essential that leadership matters are resolved as soon as possible.  The appointment of a new CEO yesterday is a positive development, but it is crucial that Department officials finalise the performance delivery agreement with Galway 2020 promptly.  Galway can be a fantastic European Capital of Culture if all parties work together in a positive and proactive way.  It has been a disappointing couple of weeks, but I believe we have turned a corner and I encourage the Minister to continue her very proactive approach to it.</p> <p>  There should be increased funding for small-scale local festivals and summer school schemes.  The big events get the headlines, but small events in local communities, in the areas children are from, are critical.  They help bring culture and creativity to life.  Big events in big cities are great, but I ask that consideration be given to increasing funding at smaller-scale events such as local festivals and summer school schemes.</p> <p>  I commend the work of the Creative Ireland programme, including its work on Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g in June.  It was very successful, and it was great to see children being encouraged and celebrated in their local communities.</p> <p>  I will speak about heritage later.</p></speech>

He acknowledged the fact that I met the chair of Galway 2020, Ms Aideen McGinley, on 13 September to discuss recent developments on Galway 2020.  It is obvious that my Department, as the biggest funder of the event, has a keen interest in making sure it is a success.  The European Capital of Culture project is very important.  The Deputy also acknowledged the appointment of Ms Patricia Philbin yesterday as the new CEO of Galway 2020.  She was seconded from Galway city council, where she worked as the director of services, and she has been welcomed by the current board.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's comments on the performance delivery agreement.  My Department is acutely aware of it and wishes to expedite its signing.  We hope to have that done by the end of September.  It is important that we are in a position to support this programme as much as possible.  It is a very ambitious programme.  Galway will be in a European and possibly global spotlight, so we want to make sure it is carried out in the best way possible.  There has to be accountability for all of the funding we have given.  My Department has committed &euro;15 million.  We have spent more than &euro;250,000, and the rest of the money will be spent in 2019 and 2020.  I believe it will be a success.</p> <p>  Redundancies or resignations can occur at any stage of such a programme, particularly at the beginning or at the delivery and implementation phase.  We are very aware of what is going on.  It is important to point out that an EU monitoring committee is involved as well, ensuring that it is progressed in a proper way.</p> <p>  My Department has a very small budget for festivals - some &euro;50,000 - and the main funder in that space is the Arts Council.  I am in the process of negotiating with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to increase moneys to the Arts Council, although I cannot make any guarantees about that.  The Arts Council provides funding to support festivals throughout the country.  I agree with the Deputy that small-scale festivals are very important.  I have spoken to the Chair about it also.  We launched local authority programmes recently which provide moneys for small-scale festivals as well.  My Department provided &euro;2 million and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government provided &euro;1 million towards those festivals.</p></speech>

I am mid-negotiation with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, so I would not like to comment on the current spend.  I have been given &euro;1.2 billion for capital expenditure over the next ten years.  The aim of the Government is to increase spending over seven years, and I hope we are on track to do that, but I am not in a position to comment at the moment.</p></speech>

I want to contrast the two.  The Arts Council has, thankfully, received a 50% increase in funding over recent years.  Foras na Gaeilge, however, has gone in the other direction.  These two bodies have had very different experiences, although they are under one Department.  One section has received a welcome increase to its funds, but the other has been reduced radically.  How does the Minister propose to fix that?</p></speech>

I wish to acknowledge the very significant work the group has done in this area over the past year in formulating its guidance to the Government.  We are looking at the group's recommendations and I expect to bring a memo for consideration to my Government colleagues shortly.</p> <p>  I will also convene a meeting of the all-party group on commemorations next Thursday, I hope, to approach the coming period.  I think Deputy Brophy has recently joined the group, so we now have the entire group together.  I am of the view that it is very important that the commemorative programme over the remainder of the decade adopts a broad focus and acknowledges the military activity as well as the many other dimensions that are interwoven with conflict, including its political, social and cultural impacts.  The State's approach will continue to encourage reflection on the multiple identities, traditions and perspectives that are a part of the overall Irish historical experience.</p> <p>  This is a very complex and sensitive period in Ireland's history, and we must ensure that it is remembered appropriately, proportionally and with sensitivity.  I envisage that there will probably be some formal State ceremonial commemorations and that they will be focused on significant points on the historical timeline.  Some of the details of these commemorations still have to be worked out.  There will be historical exploration, community engagement, community participation and artistic endeavours.  It will be a very important contribution to the national conversation about these events and the local context.</p> <p>  One of the cornerstones of the State's approach to commemorations in general over the coming years will involve further reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain, particularly taking into account Brexit, which I think a member here mentioned.  We will also take account of sensitivities across the communities in Northern Ireland, continue to recognise that very different perspectives exist, and try to be as inclusive as we can in the commemorations in this regard.  That worked especially well for the 1916 commemorations and we want to ensure that continues.  The local authorities and the national cultural institutions - the institutions of learning and the custodians of records - will have a role to play along with artists.  I hope there will be a very authentic engagement in this regard.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State have any idea of the number of Gaelscoileanna that were set up this year, considering it is Bliain na Gaeilge?  As for promotion of the Irish language, does he have any idea whether many Irish language primary schools have been set up, given the year that is in it?  This is really more of a comment.  I noticed over the summer months that the one post office in the Gaeltacht area in County Kerry was closed.  It is very disappointing to see that post office close when we are spending so much money, which is welcome, to support and protect the Irish language in Gaeltacht communities.  The post office is one thing for which there should have been special protection, considering it was in a Gaeltacht area.</p> <p>  Will the Minister expand on the &euro;700,000 carry-over, how it occurred and what it came from.  There are 38,000 students engaging in the creative schools for March 2018.  That is very welcome.  From my experience working in the arts, continuity is hugely important.  During 2018 to 2019, 38 students have accessed the initiative.  Will these 38 students be involved repeatedly or are these once-off projects?  Continuity is what will mark the success of Creative Ireland.</p> <p>  Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca was set aside and we were introduced to Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g.  Is Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca gone off the agenda for Creative Ireland?  If so, will Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g continue year on year or will it be wiped out next year?</p> <p>  I refer to the small festivals funding from Creative Ireland.  As the Minister will know from our debates and discussions in the Chamber, I feel very passionate that the Arts Council should continue to do the job it has been anointed to do.  To me, to start handing out small grant funding from Creative Ireland is to duplicate the role of the Arts Council.  Small as it might be, I think the Minister said she has &euro;50,000 to spend.  To me, this is the role of the Arts Council and should not be the role of Creative Ireland.  Will the Minister expand on this?</p> <p>  We have seen the debacle in Galway.  I was at the Galway International Arts Festival this year, and we had John Crumlish and Paul Fahy at our last committee meeting.  They do wonderful work to promote the arts nationally and of course to promote Galway city.  At that time the excitement was palpable around the city because of it being a 2020 European Capital of Culture.  It is very disappointing to see how it has unravelled in recent months.  This is more of a comment, but I believe the Minister sees that the Government could play a huge part in bringing people together there.  There needs to be someone who will wrap his or her arms around everyone, as it were, and get everyone singing from the same hymn sheet because not only is this important for Galway city, the eyes of the world, particularly the European Union, will be on Galway and Ireland as a county and a nation in 2020.</p> <p>  I support what the Chairman said about the roadmap for Arts Council spending.  The Taoiseach himself outlined that in six years from now we will be back at double the amount of spending, and I emphasise the fact that that is current spending and not a muddle of current and capital.</p> <p>  Those are my questions.  I would like to get comments back on them.</p></speech>

Much of it is being spent at present.  The councils make applications and work ranges from piers to roads to small minor works and so on.</p><p>It is in the process of being spent.</p><p> The second question was about post offices and there is a commitment from An Post that if post offices close in a Gaeltacht, the services as Gaeilge will be provided in the next nearest post office.

If the services have been taken from a post office in a Gaeltacht area, the services will be provided for native Irish speakers in the next nearest post office, wherever that is.  I know there is a complication as there is a massive gap in services if the last remaining post office is taken from a particular Gaeltacht area.  I am conscious of that.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of the number of established Gaelscoileanna.

I was part of that.  There was a wide range of events.  The councils have been very much involved as well.

We are advertising to fill 72 positions for translators and interpreters in Brussels and Strasbourg.  We should be honest that it is a challenge but we constantly encourage people to go for these posts.  With the amending Bill to the official languages legislation coming up and which we hope to publish this session towards the end of the year, we will look at a 20% recruitment drive for Irish speakers in all Departments and sectors in the public service.  A measure will be how many people we get to provide a service to people inside and outside Gaeltachta&iacute;.  The ultimate measure of a language is the daily use and whether people use it daily.

The last question she asked related to Galway 2020.  I expanded on a question to Deputy Heydon already.  As I stated earlier, my Department has a key role in ensuring the success of Galway 2020 and I will do all I can to ensure parties work together and see that it is a success.  I can reassure the Deputy in that regard.  We are in close contact with the chair and we very much welcome the new chief executive officer as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy and I have spoken many times in the D&aacute;il and on Question Time about Creative Ireland and the Arts Council.  Creative Ireland is not intended as alternative funding to the Arts Council.  Creative Ireland has a budget of &euro;6 million and the Arts Council has &euro;68 million.  There is no question of Creative Ireland in any way undermining what the Arts Council does, nor should it.  It is a cross-Government policy and it aims to put creativity at the heart of policy-making, as the Deputy knows.  The Arts Council is at arm's length and makes its own decisions, and it is important it has the opportunity to carry out its roles through funding from my Department.  I am looking at what I am going to be in a position to give the council.  I do not know what that is as of yet.</p> <p>  As I stated, I will announce a number of creative partnerships as well and they will be aimed at developing some of the objectives of creativity, well-being, innovation and cross-Government objectives.  The Deputy also mentioned small funding and festivals.  Creative Ireland funding for local communities comes directly through local authorities.  This Department does not make local decisions relating to that funding.  It is a matter for the local authority or cultural teams.  It should be noted that this cuts across heritage, culture and library services.  The aim is to broaden not just the arts but the funding that complements the Arts Council support to local authorities as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Creative Schools programme and the idea is to build on and expand it over the coming years.  It has been very welcome across the sector.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, 150 schools were selected for the pilot and these schools have approximately 38,000 pupils.  It is a diverse range of schools.</p></speech>

It is something that has been very much welcomed across the board.  There is every type of school and there are diverse backgrounds.  They include DEIS schools and schools in rural and urban areas.  It is something we want to roll out in future because it is such a success.  The cost of the creative associate expertise for schools ranges from &euro;4,100 to &euro;5,211, depending on the school size.  It is a pilot programme and the impact and cost of the model must be reviewed before being rolled out in any large way.  The schools in the programme in Cavan and Monaghan include Col&aacute;iste D&uacute;n an R&iacute; in Kingscourt, Knocktemple national school, St. Patrick's national school and St. Mary's national school in Ballyhaise.  Those are the participating schools in the Deputy's constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</p></speech>

On the doubling of funding, I accept that the Minister cannot give any commitments this close to the budget despite the seven-year commitment in this regard but Governments have a responsibility not to make promises they cannot keep and to keep every commitment they make.  When the Taoiseach referred to a doubling of arts funding was he referring to a doubling of departmental funding, capital and current, or to a doubling of funding for the Arts Council?  I ask the Minister to outline what she believes the commitment of a doubling of funding entails, in terms of allocations rather than areas.</p></speech>

The Department is in the process of negotiations in regard to the forthcoming budget so I cannot comment on my allocation for this year.  I will give the Senator a flavour of what is happening.  In 2017, the current allocation increased from &euro;237 million to &euro;249 million, a 5% increase, and the capital allocation increased from &euro;51 million to &euro;54 million, a 5.8% increase.  I do not yet know the shape of this year's allocations.  However, &euro;1.2 billion is a great start in terms of the capital investment over ten years for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is a real signal of intent on making good a promise by the Government to deliver.  It is unprecedented.  Ultimately, everything the Department does is with a view to implementing the Government's commitment.  The Senator will be aware of the steering group's oversight of the national development plan and delivery in this regard.  As I said earlier, the National Library of Ireland has already commenced its plan and many of the other national cultural institutions are also working on their master plans.</p></speech>

I am not the Minister for sport.  I can only concentrate on the areas that come within the remit of my Department.  I am doing what I can to secure funding but not only for the cultural sector which tends to get more attention than the heritage sector.  I am also seeking funding for the heritage sector and I believe the Government will deliver on its promise in terms of doubling the investment over the next seven years as indicated in June 2017.</p></speech>

Will the Minister accept that there is a notable absence in Project Ireland 2040 around capital funding for artist spaces?  The local authorities, including Dublin City Council, do very good work in this regard.  The Dublin City Council development plan makes provision for artist spaces but there is much more to be done at a local level.

The sum of &euro;265 million is provided for under the NDP for a culture and creativity investment programme, within which one of the areas for investment is the programme for regional arts and cultural facilities.  The aim of this provision is to enhance opportunities for people and communities to participate in Irish culture life.  There is also investment in the creative industry, within which there is a emphasis on the audiovisual industry.  I do not accept what the Senator says.  There is also a &euro;40 million programme specifically in regard to artists' studios, as well as archives, museums and galleries and this will be delivered on.</p></speech>

It will provide support for the maintenance and development of regional arts centres, theatres, regional museums, galleries, archives, multi-use facilities and, specifically, artists' studios.  This is set out on page 32 of Project Ireland 2040.

From my reading of the plan I do not get a sense that there is a commitment to a shared national storage facility.  We are hearing from our national institutions that there is an unprecedented storage crisis as collections continue to grow.  We all know that without intervention those collections are at risk or degradation or damage and, perhaps, permanent loss.  The consortium of national and university libraries made a proposal a number of years ago about a shared national storage facility to be delivered within the timeframe of 2022 to 2025, with the cost of maintenance of this facility to be shared by the institutions, which includes the National Library of Ireland.  Is the &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million identified by the consortium of institutions as the required State investment in this facility - a memory store - provided for in the plan?</p></speech>

There is also investment of &euro;10 million for the digitisation of our national collections.  The Department is working closely with the OPW on the protection of collections, including the major investment referenced by the Senator in the National Library of Ireland, which is ongoing in terms of records being decanted from the National Archives and various other projects to suit its needs as a national museum.  We will consider other options but it is certainly provided for in Project Ireland 2040, and very important that it is.</p></speech>

When I leave this meeting I will be going to the Seanad for the debate on the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Bill 2018.  I accept that this does not come within the Minister's remit but her Department did some work in this area under the former Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  Fianna F&aacute;il passed an amendment in the D&aacute;il which states that a feasibility study would be conducted around a legal digital deposit 12 months after the legislation is passed.  As I understand it, it takes at least one year to complete a feasibility study.

It is a great attraction for the town and the county of Kerry.  My father ensured it was put on the investment programme in late 2010, and it has progressed well since then.  On behalf of the people of Kerry I welcome the final stages in the gardens and so on.</p> <p>  The national park was given over to the State free of charge.  It is 26,000 acres and while it is a wonderful place and a great attraction it needs to be maintained.  There is much work that must be carried out to ensure the product is to a high standard.  The rhododendrons are still a big issue there, and considerable investment is needed to rid the grounds of this plague.  </p> <p>  The deer situation has been exacerbated beyond all control, and there needs to be significant culling to ensure the safety of people travelling on our roads, whether they be on the Ring of Kerry or on the other roads around Killarney, such as N72, the Killorglin road and the N22, the national primary road.  Lives are important and the volume of the traffic is growing.  More investment and a big cull are needed to ensure people can travel safely on our roads.  </p> <p>  Deer are also affecting adjoining landowners who are robbed, beggared and broke by them.  Putting out costly fertiliser is no good because the deer are coming from the national park into their lands and they create havoc with crops, soilage and so on.  Farmers in these places cannot keep half the stock that they kept heretofore.  I ask the Minister to ensure this issue is dealt with.  Lyme's disease which is spread by a tick that is prevalent in deer has a serious effect on so many families, young children, mothers, expectant mothers and many other people.  It is sad our doctors and our medical service do not even properly recognise this disease and, therefore, many people must travel abroad to get treated for this disease which is emanating from the deer.  It is only right I highlight this on behalf of the people I represent here in this important committee.</p> <p>  I would like to return to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, about the post offices if that is alright.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.623" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018100300002#H00900"><p>On the important deer issue first, there is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation to ensure the deer populations occupying the land are managed at a sustainable level and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Where the deer are increasing in range and number, depending on the annual count and the incidence of damage by deer to habitats, especially woodlands, culls are necessary on occasion to ensure the deer populations do not reach a level that is unsustainable or that would have a negative ecological consequence.  Every year the deer numbers have to be reduced as part of the ongoing management of the deer population within the park.  On foot of a number of recent reports and surveys of the deer population, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has undertaken a significant cull this year in the Killarney National Park, in which more than 120 deer have been culled to date.  Both the sika and red deer are included in that cull.</p> <p>  I appreciate the Deputy's comments on roads, about which there is an ongoing dialogue with Kerry County Council.  We must ensure the safety of people within the area also.  We continue to erect public notices about the issues the Deputy raised such as Lyme's disease.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned Killarney House, the second phase of which we will look at after the opening of the exhibition last week.  We will look to the gardens also and see what we can do.  The opening has been a great success and the house has been completely renovated and rejuvenated, according to people in Kerry.  It has brought much extra tourism into the area, which is a bonus.</p></speech>

The total gross expenditure for programme B until 30 June 2018 was just over &euro;6 million, which is slower than anticipated due to a number of tiny issues which are expected to be resolved before the year end.  Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, my Department manages some 87,000 ha across our national parks and nature reserve network.  These parks annually attract 4 million visitors and support a broad range of enterprise and employment opportunities for the communities in which they are situated.</p><p>Following on from the highly successful visit by the Royal Highnesses, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, to Killarney National Park in June, August saw the completion of the major restoration project at Killarney House, to which I alluded, with the opening of the spectacular 18-room visitor centre exhibition.  The exhibition serves as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the national park.  It highlights the beauty and interprets the richness and significance of its landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna.<br/><br/>Killarney House now links the national park directly with the town and is a significant new asset in the south west&rsquo;s tourism offering.  As the committee will be aware, this final phase of the Killarney House project follows on from the successful opening of its restored ornamental gardens in April 2016 and the opening of three refurbished historical rooms last July.  More than 375,000 people have visited the ornamental gardens since their opening in April 2016.  Early indications are that the visitor centre and exhibition in the house will be an equally important attraction.<br/><br/>In July last, as part of our strategic investment partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which is aimed at enhancing and promoting the tourism offering at Ireland&rsquo;s national parks and conserving and protecting the natural environments of the parks for the enjoyment of future generations, my Department published a document entitled Experiencing the Wild heart of Ireland, which is a tourism interpretative master plan<b><i></i></b>for the national parks and nature reserves.  The plan sets out  a framework that will guide the phased development of enhanced visitor experiences and improved visitor facilities at our national parks and nature reserves, taking into account our conservational objectives and based upon research into international best practice.<br/><br/>The plan recommends a suite of capital projects of varying size from smaller scale interventions, such as the installation of viewing platforms, to larger projects such as the development of new boardwalks and trails and the construction of new visitor centres.  From these proposals, projects will be funded jointly by my Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland through a multimillion euro investment package over the coming years.<br/><br/>The first such project is a &euro;2.1 million investment in the Wild Nephin-Ballycroy National Park, which was announced on 31 August of this year.  The aim of the project is to develop a continuous 53 km walking and cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way through the national park.  The project will eliminate the need on the western way to walk the busy R312 route by creating a spur that will provide a more direct and safe route on quiet tracks through bogland and forests.  The outcome of this project will be an off-road continuous cycling and walking trail in challenging terrain that will link the popular Great Western Greenway with the Wild Atlantic Way.<br/><br/>Our historic buildings and structures are also a vital part of our heritage.  While the primary responsibility to care for and maintain our built heritage structures rests with the owner, the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund invest essential capital in our built heritage and help the owners and custodians of historic structures to safeguard them into the future for the benefit and enjoyment of communities and the public.  There are almost 50,000 protected structures around the country.  Many of them are in great need of investment to ensure their preservation and continued use so that they remain a living part of our history and community life into the future.  Last April, funding of some &euro;3.3 million was allocated to 431 projects across every local authority area under the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund.  These projects are well under way with funding due to be drawn down in the final quarter of the year.  I am pleased to note the structures at risk fund will be revised and refreshed as the historic structures fund<b></b>for 2019.  This will offer improved supports to those who work hard in our communities to ensure our historic buildings remain alive and in use so that they are passed to future generations in better condition than we found them. <br/><br/>I will be pleased to expand on any issues members would like to raise in respect of this programme area before my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, speaks about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, the Irish language and the islands programme area.</p></speech>

I will pick up on a point made by Senator Warfield about repositories and cultural institutions.  I raised previously with the Minister a large former IT factory in Ballivor, County Meath, that has lain empty for some years.  The factory is in good shape and is similar to the former Motorola factory that currently hosts the National Museum of Ireland's repository.  If, as I understand, the State is looking for a new repository, the former factory in Ballivor could be an option.</p> <p>  The amount expended by the Department seems very low.  While I acknowledge that much of the allocated was targeted for the second half of the year, it is significantly lower than profile.  There must be a concern that the Department's spending objectives will not be met.</p> <p>  Yesterday, we had a conversation about the importance of the Hill of Tara and the time a project at the site is taking.  Since I raised the issue with the Minister last March, a small amount of research has been done on the plan.  I imagine she must find it frustrating that, notwithstanding our objectives and worthy projects, it takes forever and a day for the wheels of the State to turn.  The Minister would leave behind a fine legacy if she ensured these projects proceeded in a more timely fashion.</p> <p>  Does the Department have responsibility for greenways or is it just when they traverse national parks?    </p></speech>

It is a purpose built factory that now lies idle but is in good shape.  It is pretty much the same genre as the Motorola factory, which is the current repository of the National Museum of Ireland's materials that are not on show.</p></speech>

The Chairman may wish to contact the Office of Public Works as the sourcing of an appropriate building is a matter for it.  It may be worthwhile for the Chairman to make the suggestion to the OPW.  The factory may well be a suitable venue and it is worth consideration.</p> <p>  The Chairman is correct that we discussed the Hill of Tara in the D&aacute;il yesterday when he and another Deputy raised the matter.  He is also correct that he raised the matter previously.  A management plan is at draft stage and an online survey was conducted recently to ascertain what people want to be done at the Hill of Tara, the symbolic capital of Ireland.  As I mentioned yesterday, a balance must be struck between the conservation perspective and all of the issues that pertain to Meath County Council such as parking.  We received approximately 400 responses to the online survey, which will be fed into the conservation management plan.  We have a draft plan and we hope to have the matter sorted as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The issue is complex and I have asked my officials to redouble their efforts in this regard.  I appreciate the Chairman's forbearance and patience but, as I am sure he will appreciate, because the Hill of Tara is so special, we must ensure the plan that is put in place is appropriate and take into account the sacred nature of the site.  I will meet the chief archaeologist to discuss the project over the next coming days.  We will discuss where we take the project from here.  I appreciate the comments and concerns expressed by the Chairman.  </p></speech>

A large extraction company is operating in the vicinity and on part of the site.  Steps have been taken to stop works around the prehistoric road.  The discovery of the road is one example of how something wonderful can be hidden just beneath view in many parts of the country.  Anybody who drives or walks past the site would not have sense of the value of the find.</p><p>I have raised previously the possibility of providing some form of interpretative facility at this site and other sites.  I am not proposing intense or deep interpretation but perhaps information panels that people could read.  However, the site seems to have fallen between a number of stools, with some arguing that the responsibility lies with Westmeath County Council, while others say it is a matter for the Heritage Council or Department.  It would be wonderful if someone could take control of that. </p></speech>

Officials from the National Monuments Service met representatives from Westmeath County Council in August to discuss possibilities for the site.  Further research is also ongoing in co-operation with the landowner.  The status of the development of the bog remains before the courts.  The National Monuments Service considers that the prospect of preservation<i>in situ </i>of ancient trackways or toghers that traverse an open working bog and have been dissected along their length by approximately 45 open drains is severely limited.  These ancient features only come to light during peat extraction.  Once a bog has been drained to facilitate such extraction, the conditions that ensure the preservation of the wooden toghers are no longer present, with the result that they will inevitably decay slowly over time.  The Department will continue to focus its efforts on seeking detailed information on the toghers through appropriate methods of recording.</p></speech>

It was wonderful to see the national monuments that were found at the site, including Neolithic art in stone.  I hope it will be protected so that future generations will be able to see the heritage there.  However, I am told that the German Government currently spends more on research and investigation into these types of monuments in County Meath than the Irish Government.  Could the Government put in place funding streams to enable archaeologists and experts to further investigate the heritage of the area?  The Minister will recall that during the dry weather in the summer a drone was able to identify a circle feature hidden underground.  The area has a large amount of valuable heritage and archaeology.  It is startling that the German Government is spending more on research in the area than the Irish Government.</p></speech>

However, I agree that the finds in Dowth were extraordinary.  We are planning a major effort of interpretation of 66 new national monuments that were discovered in counties Meath and Louth this year.  This is a remarkable development and significant funding will be required to ensure they are protected.  There are moneys in the national development plan for heritage spending.  No one expected these finds to be made but now that we know about them, we must ensure they are protected for future generations.  Approximately &euro;30 million has been provided in the national development plan for national monuments.  A special conference will also be held on this issue in the coming months.</p></speech>

By the end of June only 18% or &euro;1.811 million of the allocation of &euro;10.12 million for heritage had been spent.  Does the Minister have more up-to-date figures?  Those figures are so historical, they could be put in a museum.  Will the Minister indicate what was the capital spend under subheads B3 to B8, inclusive, at the end of September?  We should have discussed this figure in July, if at all, because it is historical.</p></speech>

Only &euro;3 million of the &euro;10 million allocation had been spent.  An issue arises, which has been ongoing in the public service for a long time.  The Minister is not the first to come up against it because I came up against it in my time as a Minister.  If the Minister has only spent &euro;3 million of &euro;10 million in nine months, which is 30% of the allocation in 75% of the time, one of two things must be happening, and both are totally unacceptable.  Either all the work is being packed into the final three months of the year or the agencies are not billing the Department for the work as it is done.  Either one is bad practice because if the work is not being done in the first nine months of the year, particularly during the good weather months and long days, the craziest thing happens, and it is a practice I have seen myself.  This involves the work being done in December and people are paid overtime to work in dark, cold winter nights.  If the agencies are not sending in the bills, that is bad accountancy practice because it means the Department is taking people's word that they will spend all the money.  If they have spent &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million - they should have spent &euro;7.5 million by this point - they should have submitted bills for that amount and the Department should have paid them.  Will the Minister explain why this always happens with capital?  This is not an isolated case.  This practice occurs across the Estimates.  The Minister would be correct to point out that it also happened in my time.  While that is true, I fought against it, just as I am fighting against it now.  It is bad practice.</p></speech>

We continue to predict that the allocation will be fully spent.  We have reached 80% of profile.  This level of expenditure is what we expected by now so we believe we are on track.  The bills are coming in.  Almost &euro;4 million has been spent under the built heritage investment scheme, BHI, and the structures at risk funds.  Bullet payments are made in October and November.  Work on 431 projects is ongoing during the year.  That may help clarify the position.  We will spend the full allocation.  Sometimes the bills come in at the end of the year.  Apologies, I indicated we had reached 80% of profile when I should have said 90%.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, with go deimhin the Chairman, I have been very involved in the issue of Moore Street.  It is a very important issue on which work is ongoing in the Department.  Will the Minister indicate what the Department's plans are for 14 to 17 Moore Street?  Also, we notice in the ten-year plan, to which the Minister alluded in her opening statement, that capital moneys will be made available.  We welcome this.  Two projects were specifically mentioned.  There is to be an Irish language centre in Dublin, while further space is to be provided for the museum.  I wonder if work is ongoing in the Department to scope out these projects.  Is the Minister looking at Moore Street and its environs as possible locations for both projects?  The Irish language centre project will be central for the city, the northside, in particular, with its many transport links.  On the museum project, I could not think of a place in the city where there would be a better footfall than the area around O'Connell Street, Moore Street and Henry Street.  What are the Minister's thoughts on the matter?  I know that she has a big interest in this issue and wonder if progress has been made in scoping out the projects to see how we will progress from here.</p></speech>

Is orainn at&aacute; an fhreagracht fhorioml&aacute;n as cur i bhfeidhm na Strait&eacute;ise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030 mar aon leis an bPlean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta c&uacute;ig bliana 2018-2022 lena mbaineann, ina leagtar amach spriocanna sonracha agus na hamsc&aacute;la&iacute; a bhaineann leo.  S&iacute;lim go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach a aithint gur cuid l&aacute;rnach de chur chun feidhme na Strait&eacute;ise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge an obair agus an infheist&iacute;ocht lean&uacute;nach at&aacute; ar bun i nd&aacute;il le raon leathan sc&eacute;imeanna, beart, cl&aacute;r agus tionscnamh at&aacute; &aacute; maoini&uacute; &oacute; rann&oacute;g na Gaeltachta sa Roinn.</p> <p>  &Oacute; cuireadh t&uacute;s leis an bpr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga ceithre bliana &oacute; shin, is ar ullmh&uacute;ch&aacute;n pleananna a bh&iacute; an pr&oacute;iseas d&iacute;rithe den chuid is m&oacute;.  Lean an obair seo ar aghaidh i gcaitheamh na bliana anuraidh.  I mbliana, &aacute;fach, is ar chur chun feidhme na bpleananna sin at&aacute; an f&oacute;cas.  T&aacute; mo Roinn ag cur all&uacute;ntas ar fi&uacute; &euro;850,000 chun cuidi&uacute; le cur chun feidhme an phr&oacute;isis plean&aacute;la teanga sa bhliain reatha.  T&aacute; an ch&eacute;ad deich gcinn de na pleananna seo seolta anois agam agus t&aacute; all&uacute;ntas ar fi&uacute; idir &euro;100,000 agus &euro;150,000 an ceann &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il sa ch&eacute;ad bhliain chun t&uacute;s a chur lena gcur chun feidhme.  Tabharfaidh an t-all&uacute;ntas seo deis do na coist&iacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;la oifigigh plean&aacute;la teanga a fhost&uacute; chun t&uacute;s a chur le cur chun feidhme a gcuid pleananna.  Anuas air sin, d&aacute;r nd&oacute;igh, beidh f&aacute;il ag na coist&iacute; seo sa ghearrth&eacute;arma ar na taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il faoin r&eacute;imse leathan sc&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; &aacute; riaradh ag mo Roinn agus ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; beartaithe c&uacute;ig phlean eile a chead&uacute; i mbliana.  N&iacute;os luaithe i mbliana, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;ach mo Roinn ar na riachtanais choiteanna a bh&iacute; sonraithe ag na pobail &eacute;ags&uacute;la ina gcuid pleananna agus rinneadh leas&uacute; ar sc&eacute;imeanna na Roinne chun freastal ar na riachtanais sin.  Ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;ide as an gcur chuige seo, leithdh&aacute;ileadh l&iacute;on suntasach airgid bhreise do Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta, Tuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta agus Comhar Na&iacute;onra&iacute; na Gaeltachta chun tac&uacute; le hearn&aacute;lacha na n-eala&iacute;on, an teaghlaigh agus na luathbhlianta faoi seach sa Ghaeltacht.  Tabharfar taca&iacute;ocht bhreise chun tac&uacute; le forbairt &oacute;ige sa Ghaeltacht fosta.  Ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;ide as an gcur chuige seo, t&aacute;im thar a bheith muin&iacute;neach go mbeidh an St&aacute;t in ann freastal ar an mbealach is cu&iacute; agus is &eacute;ifeachta&iacute; ar riachtanais an phobail leis na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il.</p> <p>  Cuireann mo Roinn maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il do &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, agus oibr&iacute;onn s&iacute; i ndl&uacute;thchomhar leis mar an ghn&iacute;omhaireacht forbartha r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach don Ghaeltacht.  Maidir le buis&eacute;ad caipitil an &uacute;dar&aacute;is do 2018, arda&iacute;odh an figi&uacute;r bunl&iacute;ne go &euro;7 milli&uacute;n i mbliana.  Cuirfidh an maoini&uacute; breise seo ar chumas &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta poist a choinne&aacute;il ina chliantchuideachta&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht agus tuilleadh infheist&iacute;ochta a mhealladh go ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Chuige sin, de r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, t&aacute; s&eacute; mar aidhm ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s 500 post nua a chruth&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht in 2018.  Cuireadh acmhainn&iacute; reatha breise ar f&aacute;il don &uacute;dar&aacute;s i mbliana freisin d&rsquo;fhonn taca&iacute;ochta&iacute; do chomharchumainn agus eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; pobail a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;.</p> <p>  Glacadh roinnt c&eacute;imeanna anseo in &Eacute;irinn agus sa Bhruis&eacute;il chun deireadh a chur leis an maol&uacute; ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge in institi&uacute;id&iacute; an Aontais Eorpaigh in 2021.  T&aacute; thart ar &euro;1 milli&uacute;n &aacute; leithdh&aacute;ileadh ar&iacute;s i mbliana don earn&aacute;il tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al chun c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oili&uacute;na cu&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar do na phoist san Aontas Eorpach.  T&aacute; borradh faoin earn&aacute;il sin faoi l&aacute;thair, agus d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair an European Personnel Selection Office, EPSO, 72 phost d&rsquo;aistritheoir&iacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  T&aacute; an obair maidir le deireadh a chur leis an maol&uacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir an sceidil agus t&aacute;im l&aacute;nmhuin&iacute;neach go mbeimid in ann deireadh a chur leis an maol&uacute; in 2021.  Maidir le teagasc na Gaeilge in ollscoileanna thar lear, t&aacute; an-rath ar an gcl&aacute;r seo agus t&aacute; m&eacute;ad&uacute; lean&uacute;nach ag teacht ar l&iacute;on na n-iarratas faoin sc&eacute;im bliain i ndiaidh bliana.  Mar aitheantas ar an m&eacute;id sin, t&aacute; deontais ar fi&uacute; &euro;1.8 milli&uacute;n san ioml&aacute;n iad ceadaithe don tr&eacute;imhse 2016-17 go 2018-19 le haghaidh os cionn 40 ollscoil agus col&aacute;ist&iacute; tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al timpeall na cruinne.  Cuireann an sc&eacute;im seo go m&oacute;r le l&eacute;ann na Gaeilge sa phobal acad&uacute;il idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus arda&iacute;tear st&aacute;das na teanga d&aacute; r&eacute;ir.</p></speech>

Istigh anseo i dTithe an Oireachtais b&iacute;mid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag caint faoi silos.  Is cuma c&eacute;n coiste at&aacute; ann b&iacute;mid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag caint faoi silos agus nach mb&iacute;onn na Ranna ag obair le ch&eacute;ile ar chor ar bith.  Chuir an Teachta Smyth ceist ar an Aire St&aacute;it n&iacute;os luaithe faoin m&eacute;id Gaelscoileanna at&aacute; cruthaithe sa t&iacute;r seo agus d&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach raibh a fhios aige c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad a bh&iacute; t&oacute;gtha an bliain seo agus go bhfaighidh s&eacute; an t-eolas &oacute;n Roinn Oideachas agus Scileanna.  Mar Aire St&aacute;it at&aacute; freagrach as an Ghaeltacht, t&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte nach mbeadh s&eacute; ar an eolas faoi c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad Gaelscoileanna at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha sa t&iacute;r seo.  Taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; an easpa ceangal agus cumars&aacute;id idir an Roinn agus an Roinn Oideachas agus Scileanna - an Roinn ina bhfuil an t&aacute;bhacht is m&oacute; ann i leith an Ghaeilge.  I rith an tsamhraidh seo, chualamar go mbeadh na p&aacute;ist&iacute; ag dul ar ais go dt&iacute; an me&aacute;nscoil in Inis Me&aacute;in agus nach mbeadh m&uacute;inteoir le f&aacute;il do cuid de na h&aacute;bhair i nGaeilge.  Taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; sin an mana uaf&aacute;sach at&aacute; ag an Roinn ar an Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an d&aacute; Roinn fite fuaite le ch&eacute;ile mar gheall ar a chuid pleananna agus gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta&iacute;.  Nuair a bh&iacute;onn Creative Ireland, an Chomhairle Eala&iacute;on agus &Uacute;dar&aacute;s Craolach&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann anseo labhra&iacute;onn siad faoin easpa dualgais at&aacute; orthu an Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  An seachtain seo chaite chualamar go raibh an Aire Sl&aacute;inte, an Teachta Harris, chun dul ar aghaidh le rabhadh sl&aacute;inte a chur ar buid&eacute;il&iacute; alc&oacute;il ach nach mbeadh s&eacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh ach in aon teanga amh&aacute;in.</p><p>Is cos&uacute;il go bhfuil blinkers capaill ar an Roinn seo agus go bhfuil s&iacute; d&iacute;rithe ar a cuid oibre amh&aacute;in agus gan a bheith ag f&eacute;achaint ar an tionchar ioml&aacute;n at&aacute; aici ar gach taobh den Rialtas.  Chun troid in aghaidh an n&oacute;is sin, bh&iacute; an tAire St&aacute;it chun bheith mar chathaoirleach ar choiste idir-rannach chun go mbeidh an t-eolas sin ag sruth&uacute; &oacute; gach taobh go dt&iacute; gach taobh eile.  D'ardaigh Teachta eile pointe faoi na hoifig&iacute; poist sna Gaeltachta&iacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;in go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag brath ar gach Roinn a bheith ag obair le ch&eacute;ile ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  Muna bhfuil aon duine in ann &eacute; sin a tharraingt le ch&eacute;ile, beimid i dtriobl&oacute;id.  Sin an ch&eacute;ad cheist mar gheall ar na blinkers at&aacute; ar an Roinn seo.</p><p> Mar gheall ar chaiteachas, d'ardaigh mise an t-&aacute;bhar faoi Fhoras na Gaeilge ach m&aacute; fheictear ar an gcaiteachas ioml&aacute;n ar an nGaeilge t&aacute;imid f&oacute;s ag caint faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; na leathphingine i gcompar&aacute;id leis na Ranna eile.  T&aacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta f&oacute;s th&iacute;os mar gheall ar an airgead a chaitheann s&eacute;.  M&aacute; bhreathna&iacute;onn duine ar an IDA n&oacute; Fiontar &Eacute;ireann, t&aacute; ard&uacute; de 50% tar &eacute;is teacht ar an airgeadas a fhaigheann siad.  Sin an cheist eile.</p><p> Mar gheall ar na pleananna teanga, b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil an t-eolas m&iacute;cheart agam ach ceapaim nach bhfuil pingin faighte ag aon phlean teanga go dt&iacute; seo f&oacute;s.  Bh&iacute; an t-iarTeachta Dinny McGinley i gcathaoir an Aire St&aacute;it in 2013 agus th&oacute;g seisean an Bille sin isteach.  T&aacute;imid ag caint faoi 2018.  T&aacute; c&uacute;ig bliana imithe anois agus, c&eacute; go bhfuil a fhios agam &oacute;n r&aacute;iteas a thug an tAire St&aacute;it dom go bhfuil s&eacute; ar t&iacute; an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar an earn&aacute;il seo, n&iacute;l an t-airgead ag dul isteach i leith na ruda&iacute; seo f&oacute;s.</p><p> Mar gheall ar Bhliain na Gaeilge, is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n bhfreagra a thug an tAire St&aacute;it don Teachta Niamh Smyth nach bhfuil aon slat tomhais ann.  D&uacute;irt an tAire St&aacute;it go bhfuil an CSO n&oacute; an daon&aacute;ireamh ann mar gheall ar bheith cinnte faoin m&eacute;id daoine a bh&iacute;onn ag labhairt na Gaeilge l&aacute; i ndiadh lae, ach t&aacute; go leor pobalbhreitheanna ar f&aacute;il &oacute; RED C agus a leith&eacute;id.  B&iacute;onn comhlachta&iacute; pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; sin i gc&oacute;na&iacute; chun a fh&aacute;il amach an bhfuil daoine ag cloiste&aacute;il a gcuid teachtaireachta&iacute; n&oacute; an bhfuil siad ag aithint an branda at&aacute; ac&uacute; n&oacute; ruda&iacute; cos&uacute;il leis sin.  Is f&eacute;idir leis an tAire St&aacute;it agus an Roinn a bheith giota beag cruthaitheach idir daon&aacute;irimh chun a fh&aacute;il amach an bhfuilimid ag f&aacute;il luacha mar gheall ar an gcaiteachas ar an rud sa t&iacute;r seo.</p><p> An bhfuil aon sc&eacute;al faoin gcult&uacute;rlann i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath?  Chuala m&eacute; go bhfuil dul chun cinn tagtha ar an &aacute;bhar sin agus ba mhaith liom dea-eolas a chloiste&aacute;il faoi m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir.  Nuair at&aacute;im ag dul thart timpeall na t&iacute;re agus ag caint leis na comharchumainn &aacute;iti&uacute;la agus clubanna &oacute;ige sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, t&aacute; siad i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag gear&aacute;n faoin m&eacute;id airgeadais at&aacute; siadsan ag f&aacute;il agus faoin mbr&uacute; uaf&aacute;sach at&aacute; ag teacht orthu d&aacute; bharr.

Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; go leor d&eacute;anta maidir leis an obair a &eacute;ir&iacute;onn as an Bhille teangacha freisin.  Mar shampla, an ch&eacute;ad uair a th&aacute;inig mise isteach mar Aire St&aacute;it le freagracht as an nGaeilge in 2014, n&iacute; raibh an caidreamh idir an Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe, an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna agus an Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta r&oacute;mhaith ach anois t&aacute; s&eacute; an-difri&uacute;il.

Le bheith ionraic, t&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; ann.  Mar shampla, t&aacute; deacrachta&iacute; maidir le teacht ar mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; scoile le Gaeilge.  T&aacute; an ceart ag an gCathaoirleach.  D'ardaigh s&eacute; ceist fad&uacute;da Inis Me&aacute;in.  T&aacute; rud soil&eacute;ir ag baint le hInis Me&aacute;in.

T&aacute; m&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag lorg breis airgid f&aacute; choinne c&uacute;rsa&iacute; caipitil.

T&aacute; gealltanas d&eacute;anta maidir leis sin.</p> <p>  Maidir le plean&aacute;il teanga, bh&iacute; an Cathaoirleach ag caint fad&uacute;da 2012.  T&aacute; an ceart aige.  Thug an t-iarTeachta Dinny McGinley, mar Aire St&aacute;it ar a raibh freagracht don Ghaeilge, an Bille isteach ag an am sin.  Bh&iacute; muidne ag obair go dian ar an phlean sin.  Anois t&aacute;imid ag streachailt chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an &eacute;ileamh ar an talamh.  Is l&eacute;ir go mbeidh an pobal tiomanta don phlean&aacute;il teanga fosta.  Mar shampla, chas m&eacute; le fear &oacute; Ghaoth Dobhair D&eacute; Luain.  Th&aacute;inig s&eacute; isteach sa phost c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; Gort a' Choirce agus ceantair eile, mar shampla, Cois Fharraige, ag iarraidh agallaimh a chur ar dhaoine.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta leis na pleananna a bheidh &aacute; mbaint amach sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus taobh amuigh d&oacute;ibh freisin m&aacute; chuirtear na bailte seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta san &aacute;ireamh.  D&aacute; mbeadh an t-&eacute;ileamh ann, bheadh an gealltanas ann.  T&aacute; an bunl&iacute;ne anois &euro;2.2 milli&uacute;n.  Beidh sin ina bhunl&iacute;ne.  Sa bhuis&eacute;ad an tseachtain seo chugainn beimid ag iarraidh airgead breise mar t&aacute; an t-&eacute;ileamh ag ard&uacute;.  Beidh na daoine uilig ag teacht isteach sna poist, agus b'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh an t-&eacute;ileamh n&iacute;os m&oacute; an bhliain seo chugainn.  T&aacute; an bunl&iacute;ne s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte agus t&aacute;imid ag dul ar aghaidh ina dhiaidh sin.</p> <p>  Bh&iacute; an Cathaoirleach ag caint faoin slat tomhais.  T&aacute; slata tomhais difri&uacute;la ar f&aacute;il maidir leis an nGaeilge.  Mar shampla, i leith ceantar l&aacute;idir Gaeltachta, mar shampla, Gaoth Dobhair n&oacute; an Ceathr&uacute; Rua, beidh l&iacute;on na ndaoine a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann an teanga &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute; ina slat tomhais.  Is &eacute; an slat tomhais l&iacute;on na ndaoine a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann an teanga agus iad ag dul isteach sa siopa n&oacute; go dt&iacute; Aifreann.  Sin an slat tomhais.

For some time I have been hoping to talk to the Minister of State in a public forum such as this because what I have to talk about is very important to some on the Ballinskelligs side of my constituency.  Across the road today we met wonderful people from Conradh na Gaeilge which does great work and is trying to survive.  We also met people from the islands.  The Minister of State also comes from a county that has islands lying off it.  We must support them in whatever way we can to ensure people will remain on them because it is tough going.  I know that they do well in the summer, but the winter is long.  They point out that since 2007 or 2008 the budget for the islands has been cut by 70%.  They are not asking to have it restored all in one year and have made out a programme.  Their hope or wish is that from next year, through 2020 and 2021, the Government will at least restore the budget to what it was in 2007 and 2008.  As we all know, costs, including the cost of living, have gone through the roof.  This is a very reasonable request because the people in question do wonderful work.</p> <p>  I am not a good Irish speaker, but I can understand what is being said, in case anyone thinks I do not.  Again, we have to support those who speak the language.  They are part of our heritage and trying to do their best.  It is very important that the Minister of State remember and fight for them.  I know that he is not the senior Minister, but he must tackle the fellows to ensure he will get a slice for the people both he and I represent.  </p> <p>  The proposed closure of the post office in Ballinskelligs has frightened the daylights out of the people living there.  It is a wonderful community which is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean on three sides.  If one were to travel westward, the next stop would be New York.  When I hear the Minister of State say that if the post office is not retained in Ballinskelligs - I hope it will be - he will provide supports in post offices in adjoining areas - Cahersiveen and Waterville - I have to remind him of the distances involved.  For many living on the islands, it is 22 km one way or a return journey of 44 km, or about 30 miles, which is not on.  We have the advantage of having a local shopkeeper who has signalled that he would prepared to tender for the post office contract.  One of the early meetings we attended was in respect of Ballylongford post office.  I am sorry to say I was notified today that the appeal to have the contract tendered for has been refused by An Post.  I hope that will not happen in the case of Ballinskelligs post office for reasons to do with the Gaelic language and culture.  There were up to 400 people at the meeting which I attended.  What was very interesting about it was that everyone of the many who spoke mostly spoke in Irish.  In that context, it would not be fair to take them out of that environment to a place where English is mainly spoken such as Cahersiveen or Waterville.  When they go into the post office in Ballinskelligs, they speak in Irish to their neighbours and whoever else is in it at the time.  It is totally different.  If we cannot save this one post office, we do not have much hope of saving the Irish language and I cannot see where we are going.  In the light of the fact that the Minister of State said he was prepared to provide resources in adjoining post offices, I ask him to ensure whatever resources he is prepared to provide be used to support the retention of the post office in Ballinskelligs and that he support any associated appeal.  We are very lucky.  We have the one person who is interested and has another business that would be run side by side.  His name is Nicholas Brown.</p><p>I will do everything to support his application.  I appeal to the Minister of State to follow this up because I believe he has a role to play in supporting the Irish language.</p><p> Peadar Mac Fhlannchadha travelled all the way from Galway to that meeting in the very deepest corner of south Kerry to support the people who were badly upset and completely at sea.  If they lose this post office, they will lose their identity as a Gaeltacht Irish-speaking community.  I am asking the Minister of State for all the support he can give in the appeal by this community to save its post office.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.683" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018100300002#O00300"><p>I thank both Ministers for appearing before the committee today.  The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, said that approximately &euro;700,000 of his budget remains to be spent.  This might be an ideal opportunity for him to spend a little more of that budget on education and housing.  My constituency has eight islands off the coast of west Cork.  People are coming to my constituency clinics and I am going to Sherkin Island, Hare Island and other islands.  They are finding it difficult and costly.  The schools have been closed on both those islands.  The parents are trying to work.  They are leaving early in the morning.  There is nobody to bring their children to school on the mainland other than perhaps an aged grandparent.  The schools were closed because of the falling numbers on those islands.  This issue has been going on for some time.  They have been looking for a chaperone or some resolution to the issue but none is available.  I met parents who are being charged for bringing their children from the island to the national schools on the ferry.  I respect that the ferry operators need to survive.  Part of the budget should be set aside to address these issues because the education of the children on our islands is very important.</p> <p>  Housing on islands is being totally ignored.  If social housing is repeatedly overlooked in budgets, there will be no future.  Young couples and young single people are leaving the islands and not returning.  The census shows falling population numbers on all the islands.  The Government must find some way to turn this around.  The only way to do so is to make life a little easier for those who have to leave the island to work every day by ensuring the do so in the knowledge that their children are brought to and from school.  On the mainland, schoolchildren are given bus transport.  On the islands, parents are asked to pay the ferry operator which causes serious financial difficulty for some of them.  They also need somebody to accompany the children on their way to and from school.  In schools, special needs assistants and all sorts of other help are provided to children who have difficulties.  Maybe something along these lines could be considered to help people on the islands.</p> <p>  As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, we met representatives of Conradh na Gaeilge today.  I am not very fluent in Irish and I will not point the finger at anybody who can speak the language.  I wish I could.  Maybe down the road I could tune up on it a bit.  The language is in need of extra funding because it is dying on its feet as we speak.  We might have an opportunity next Tuesday to turn that around.  I ask the Minister of State to look at that.  I know we are in the dying hours before the budget and I presume many decisions have been finalised.  Investment in our language is vital for this country.  Most other countries are very proud of their languages.  We also should think along those lines.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne is operating in west Dingle.  One of the managers, whose name is P&aacute;id&iacute; &Oacute; S&eacute;, highlighted the problem it has getting people to participate in the community employment scheme.  One of the difficulties the organisation is encountering is that people cannot be on the scheme after the age of 60.  It is difficult to get people on these schemes because of reducing numbers.  Youngsters have gone, people are emigrating and everything.  Community employment does invaluable work for communities.  The local authority is fine for certain things.  Particularly in Gaeltacht areas I ask the Minister of State to look at the silly rule that people have to leave the scheme at 60 years of age.  It should be extended to the normal pension age and the schemes should be allowed to operate away.  Participants  are only getting &euro;20 more for their trouble, but they feel they are doing a service and the work gets them out of the house.  It is good for their mind and for the organisations for which they are working.</p></speech>

It proves how multifaceted rural Ireland is.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, has contacted me about the issue Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned.  I wish the individual who is making the application well with the process.  It is an independent process and obviously there will be no political influence on the outcome.  I wish the community well and hope something good comes out of that.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's emphasis on the language.  Men and women coming in from very rural areas to meet people engaging in the language goes back to the point I made to the Chairman earlier.  How can we measure scientifically or exactly who is using a language, when they are using it and what groups are using it?  I always go back to the core basics that if somebody is going to the shop to buy a loaf, to the post office or other public area or to the bingo, our aspiration is that he or she will not think twice about using the Irish language.  It should be natural to speak Irish.  I acknowledge what the Deputy is saying.</p> <p>  My predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, was involved with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, in setting up an interagency task force in that part of Kerry.  We might be able to set up some sort of connection with Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and the group in question.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is very much involved.  It would be an important group to contact on this issue also.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned community employment schemes.  Outside the CE schemes, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta also has a brief.  Obviously it works within the rules and regulations.  It might be worth the Deputy's while exploring that through the task force because it is an interagency and interdepartmental group.  Its report should be completed shortly.  We can connect the Deputy into that.  P&aacute;id&iacute; &Oacute; S&eacute; would be in the Dingle area.  We will get that connection.</p> <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned Comharchumann Forbartha Chorca Dhuibhne.  It has great people working on the ground and it is very hard to put a job description on their role.  Let us say they go straight to the category of any other business assigned.  They work with elderly people and the younger population and in healthcare, education and the community.  They work on a broad spectrum of areas and I agree they need support.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raised it in the D&aacute;il yesterday that we need to look at resources for them.</p><p>I am working hard.  I have had a meeting with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, regarding the budget.  Nothing has been decided.  We will find out next Tuesday.  In the past two years, we have increased the funding by &euro;350,000.  I know we can increase it further.  I take the point that has been made.  I know there is a big stocaireacht, or campaign, in Buswells Hotel today.  I will try to get over to meet those involved.</p><p> Deputy Michael Collins raised some broad issues and referred specifically to ferry services.  We were involved in that.  We dealt very closely with Aisling Moran, a great worker who has led on a number of fronts in the arts area, etc.  We found solutions when we had difficulties.  The community took the decision to close the school.  We understood that there were issues with ferry times because people had to get back and people had to wait.  We allocated extra money for additional ferry services.  Obviously, that is still not a solution.  I implore the people who have a role in making decisions on the timetabling of ferry services to continue to link with the community.  There is an extra funding stream there for an extra service.  Obviously, it is still not a solution.  The Deputy also referred to the resources being sought by the Irish-language comharchumann.  I will take that on board as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.687" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018100300002#P00200"><p>It is unfortunate that there was an overlap with committee meetings earlier.  The Minister stated that an unprecedented amount of money is being provided for the Irish language under the national development plan.  Given that the provision of &euro;178 million works out at &euro;17.8 million a year, I ask her to outline the basis for her statement to the effect that the amount is unprecedented.  In 2008, national expenditure on Voted services was &euro;61.86 billion.  In 2018, it is &euro;61.7 billion.  The amounts are almost exactly the same.  All of the Estimate to which I refer was spent.  That can be seen by looking at what was spent in 2007.  The Estimate for 2008 provided for total expenditure of &euro;121 million under the Vote for an Ghaeilge, an Ghaeltacht, na hoile&aacute;in agus an Foras Teanga.  The equivalent figure for 2018 is &euro;62 million, which is approximately half of the figure from a decade ago.  I remind the Minister that I am comparing two periods of identical national expenditure.  The amount of money being provided for an Ghaeilge, an Ghaeltacht agus na hoile&aacute;in has been halved.  An examination of capital expenditure, which is basically what is in the national development plan, will show that there was capital expenditure of &euro;73 million in 2008, whereas &euro;10 million is being provided for in 2018.  That is a ratio of over 7:1.  I have to say I find the Minister's statement to the effect that this is an unprecedented plan difficult to take.  I ask the Minister to outline the basis on which she refers to the plan as unprecedented.  Perhaps she means that it is unprecedentedly small.</p></speech>

The &euro;1.2 billion capital investment plan, which we launched earlier in the year, is an unprecedented plan.  It relates to cultural heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It is the tripartite of all those different sectors.  It is absolutely unprecedented.  I do not think there has ever been a spend of such significance in this area.  That is well acknowledged.  The announcement was made at the launch with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.  I do not think we should take 2008 as a benchmark.  I assume that is the benchmark.  We all know what happened.  I do not think we should look at it in that context.  I am very pleased with the amount of money - &euro;178 million - going into the Irish language.  It will create 1,000 jobs in the Gaeltacht each year, supported through &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  We have the Bliain na Gaeilge, which has been mentioned, this year.  We have support for the island communities.  It is hoped that a flagship language and cultural centre and hub will be developed in Dublin city.  Help is being given to the Aran Islands and Tory Island, etc.  I think it is unprecedented because it is a ten-year plan.  It is limited to the national planning framework as well.</p></speech>

In my view, what we are doing now is worthwhile.  I think it is unprecedented.  I think it will help the Irish language as well as culture and heritage.  Luckily, after ten years we are in position to do this.  We were not in a position to do this before now because of the unrealistic spend we saw over previous decades, including in 2007.

There was a budget surplus in 2008 and an even bigger surplus in 2007.  The overall spend of &euro;61.8 billion in 2008 is exactly same as the overall spend of &euro;61.8 billion this year.  Those are facts.  It is also a fact that the slice of the cake being given to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language is absolutely minuscule compared to when we were in government.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

On reading the reports, I want to make a comment on the expenditure in the area of the development and enhancement of the amenities we have around the country.  In my time in the Office of Public Works, OPW, my eyes were opened to the amount of assets we have, like hidden gems.  I am delighted to see that Coole Park is being developed by the Department and it is important that we continue to do these in the regions.  It is very important that we create and promote all of the good things we have in the constituencies and in the regions.</p> <p>  The other important thing is the collaboration between the OPW, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, local authorities and F&aacute;ilte Ireland in promoting all of these assets as part of our tourism product.  Very simply put, we have the assets, we just need to make sure that we use them and enhance them for the user and the increase in tourism we need to get into the regions.</p> <p>  I have one small problem for Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.  In our talk about the Irish language I have one mystery about it.  We spend time in primary and secondary school - I am not from a Gaeltacht area - learning and being taught Irish, not just my generation but my son&rsquo;s generations also, and we cannot speak Irish after 13 years.  This is a bit of a mystery to me.  We spend a lot of time teaching but it seems that we lose it the minute we go out the door of the school and do not want to use it again.  It has come home to me, because I am learning Irish now again to have the confidence to speak it.  I would not dare try it with all of the experts in Irish that are here today.  It is a deficiency in my language skills that I am ashamed of, after spending 13 years learning it and still not being able to speak it.  We need to ensure when we are teaching Irish that we are teaching it for the love of the Irish and that people will be able to speak it afterwards and have that legacy.</p> <p>  I have some problems with signs in Galway after the completion of the motorway. The Gaeltacht comes out to Claregalway and is called Baile Chl&aacute;ir.  The signage, unfortunately, is in Irish and a substantial number of people using the motorway, which is great, are arriving in a small pace called Belclare beside me.  They are going into the local pub wondering where Claregalway is because Belclare and Baile Chl&aacute;ir look very similar.  The signs need to be changed in that the English version needs to be added as well so that we can get around the motorways.  Perhaps the Minister of State could see his way to give a few spare euros to put up a few signs, because it is very important.</p> <p>  We had a book launch in Claregalway two weeks ago about ploughing in Galway.  One of the national directors of the ploughing association came up from Cork, and he was an hour and a half going around the motorway, trying to find Claregalway in the dark and he could not see a Claregalway sign any place.  The satnav was not working right because of poor reception.  It is a small thing and I would appreciate if this could be done.</p><p>I thank the Minister and say "Well done".</p></speech>

I appreciate them in respect of Coole Park.  As he will know, I launched a master interpretative plan there in July.  It is a very special place, particularly Lady Gregory's Irish home, which was the great salon of Irish literature.  I am even more determined to ensure that we protect the nature, culture and heritage which all coalesce in that area.  I thank Deputy Canney again for his comments and I accept everything else he said also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.788" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018100300002#S00300"><p>I congratulate Deputy Canney for his iarracht, his effort to go back learning Irish.  Many people talk about doing it.  I was one of those people who talked about it for the best part of two decades.  That was up to the point when I was put in a corner and had no choice.  It was either sink or swim.  My experience is different to most people but anybody who makes that decision to go back and learn has to be admired.  Deputy Canney will also act as an inspiration for people in his constituency, so well done. </p> <p>  The Deputy has already spoken to me about the Claregalway sign and I have had a number of other representations from Galway, including from Councillor Frank Kearney.  I have already asked my officials to organise a meeting with a delegation from Galway, including Deputy Canney, Councillor Kearney and whomever else wants to be part of it.  We would be happy to facilitate that.</p> <p>  There was another matter.  It was the teaching of Irish.  We are fortunate at the moment with the calibre of education we have.  I see my children coming home from school.  It is not the usual doing of homework by ticking boxes.  They have to use their imagination.  My kids are in a non-Gaeltacht school but they are doing great work and they are creative with the language.  It is a different type of experience now compared to some of the more negative experiences some of us had.  Going back 30 or 40 years, some people say they were taught in a positive way as well.  It was for some and not for others.  There is an issue with the demand for Irish teachers at the moment but part of the Gaeltacht policy is trying to encourage more people to go in and look at the different funding streams for training.  We are doing quite an amount of work on that.</p> <p>  There was also a question about the number of Gaelscoileanna built this year.  I am going to get those figures.  I will put those I have on the record.  Of the 30 new primary schools established since 2011, seven were Gaelscoileanna.  There are 47,614 pupils in Gaelscoileanna outside the Gaeltacht.  Of those, 37,090 are in the bunscoileanna.  There are 59,084 pupils in Irish-medium education.  There are 189 Gaelscoileanna outside of the Gaeltacht areas, that is 145 bunscoileanna and 44 secondary schools.  There are 134 Irish-medium schools in Gaeltacht areas.  That is 106 primary schools and 28 secondary schools.  The stand-out figure is that there are 59,084 people going through the medium of Irish and learning Irish in primary school and secondary school.</p> <p>  That bodes well for the future, especially when we look to provide opportunities for people as translators and interpreters in Brussels and Strasbourg.  Those are well paid jobs and there is no great tax on them.  It is &euro;4,500 per month for people who are proficient in Irish.  That is an unbelievable opportunity, especially at a time when there is much talk in different countries regarding the EU and either remaining or leaving it.  We have an opportunity as part of the EU and there are tremendous opportunities.  That message has to go out not just to the 59,000 people in the Gaelscoileanna but also to the people who are learning Irish outside that category as well.</p></speech>

There is also the fabulous Col&aacute;iste Oiriall secondary school in Monaghan town.  We have just one primary school, namely, that in Cavan town.

One will recall the Minister's appearance before the committee in July on this subject, where he explained that the Government has approved a process that envisages enactment of this Bill by the end of the year.  That reflects recognition of the urgency required to implement the regulation, which came into effect more than two years ago.  We are hopeful that the approach set out in this general scheme will provide us with a comprehensive and cohesive Bill later this month that will find favour with the Oireachtas.  To reach that point, namely, a finalised draft Bill, this general scheme will be thoroughly reviewed by the professional drafting and legal advisory services in the Office of the Attorney General over the coming weeks.</p> <p>  The general scheme provides for all of the requirements contained in Regulation No. 598.  In that respect, it introduces, for the first time, a bespoke and robust airport noise regulatory regime for Ireland.  As the regulation applies only to major EU international airports, in Ireland it will apply only to Dublin Airport.  That is highly unlikely to change for the far foreseeable future.  </p> <p>  The general scheme sets out the process for the introduction of noise mitigation measures at Dublin Airport from the perspective of a custom-built legislative framework for noise impact and noise management, and it integrates this with existing environmental and planning and development laws and procedures.</p><p>The regulatory process conceived in Regulation No. 598 and reflected in this general scheme is evidence-based and transparent, is subject to public consultation and includes provision for a robust appeals process.<br/><br/>Regarding noise regulation, to characterise Regulation No. 598 is to say that it sets out a structured approach to assessing and addressing noise at airports with the objective of facilitating airport development in a way that minimises, as far as is practicable, the noise impact of that expansion.  It is intended to ensure that major European airports are developed in a sustainable manner and are subject to oversight and scrutiny, not just in terms of planning and environmental laws but, in the case of airports, specifically noise levels. <br/><br/>The regulation and, therefore, the general scheme, provides for the so-called balanced approach, which was conceived and developed at the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, the UN body that governs global aviation under the Chicago Convention.  The balanced approach is about ensuring airport noise is managed by applying a whole range of measures, and that the impact of these measures is fully realised before recourse is made to operating restrictions.  Under the UN's balanced approach, operation restrictions are considered as a last resort for airport noise management; to be applied when all other measures have been exhausted.  In that respect, the balanced approach is designed to ensure that airports can still grow and that air connectivity can continue to be improved, as a key enabler of international trade and in the general interest of global access.  What is proposed in this general scheme, therefore, is an airport noise regulatory regime that has been developed as international best practice and adopted as EU law. <br/><br/>Based on the regulation, the general scheme sets out a noise regulation regime that has not been in place heretofore, providing certainty to stakeholders and a framework for managing the often conflicting interests of those stakeholders in a fair and balanced way.  It is careful to provide for public consultation.  It sets out requirements for non-technical summaries of key documents, submissions and decisions during the process, and for the open, transparent publishing of applications and decisions throughout.  <br/><br/>If it is agreeable to the committee, I propose to give a brief overview of the main parts of the general scheme.  It comprises eight parts.  Part 1 designates Fingal County Council as the competent authority, that is, the airport noise regulator, which has exclusive competence regarding operating restrictions at Dublin Airport, subject to an appeal.  This part also outlines the funding arrangements for Fingal in its role as the airport noise regulator.<br/><br/><b></b>Part 2 outlines the regulatory process, which includes public consultation.  Part 3 sets out the process to be followed when a noise problem has been identified and the powers of the airport noise regulator to act in such circumstances.  It also makes provision for the airport authority to make an application to have current operating restrictions reviewed under the new system, and for the competent authority to make a regulatory decision under Regulation No. 598 on the most appropriate noise management measures for the next five years.  These, in turn, will be reviewed in five years' time.  It includes the facility for submissions from interested parties and for an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Both the board and Fingal County Council must have regard to the ICAO balanced approach in coming to a decision.<br/><br/>Part 4 provides for ongoing monitoring, review and enforcement of the noise mitigation measures at the airport.  The regulator will have the power to enforce compliance with such measures.  Part 5 sets out the obligation of the airport authority, the DAA, to engage with the regulator on noise implications when considering development at the airport.<br/><br/>Part 6 sets out the operating restrictions notification requirements to the European Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency, as provided for in Regulation No. 598.  Part 7 sets out the obligation of the aircraft operator to provide information to the European Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency as requested.<b></b>This part also declassifies development at Dublin Airport as strategic infrastructure development for the purposes of planning applications.  It will no longer be possible for the airport authority to apply directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for permission for development.  It will have to, in the first instance, make an application to Fingal Country Council, as used to be the case.  The purpose of this is to align the planning and development process for the airport with the noise regulation process, that is, Fingal County Council as the first port of call and An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the appeals body.  It disadvantages the DAA in terms of planning and development timelines, but it is necessary.<br/><br/>Part 8 also sets out the steps that must be undertaken as part of the Regulation No. 598 decision-making process to comply with any appropriate assessment requirements.  An appropriate assessment is an assessment of the implications of a project on a site&rsquo;s conservation objectives.  This part of the Bill is modelled largely on Part XAB of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  <br/><br/>I wish to draw the committee's attention to a number of documents submitted in advance of today's meeting, specifically the background briefing paper, which I hope has provided a useful initial guide to the proposed legislation which we are discussing, a copy of Regulation No. 598, upon which the general scheme is based, and two versions of the general scheme.  One version is the clean version and the other version is a colour coded version, the purpose of which is to signpost for the committee all of the text in the general scheme which is either directly from Regulation No. 598, in other words, pretty much non-discretionary in terms of complying with EU law, or directly from existing domestic legislation related to planning, development and environmental protection, which is intended to make sure that the approach to implementing Regulation No. 598 is properly aligned and integrated with those areas, as necessary.  The text which is not coloured is our draft text and describes how we see the Regulation No. 598 process working in an Irish context.  It is our proposed implementation element.  I hope members will find this coding useful during our discussion.</p></speech>

I now turn to the members and ask them to try to confine their comments to questions.  I will start with the Fine Gael members, as is normal.  Does Deputy Troy have any queries or questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.808" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018100300002#B00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to have this pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  Giving effect to the EU directive is long overdue..  It is more than two years since we commenced this process.  Many bodies have been considered in terms of whether they would be more appropriate to be designated as the competent authority.  Despite the Government taking this decision, there are still question marks as to whether Fingal County Council is the appropriate competent authority to deal with this EU directive.  How does this proposal compare with other European countries?  Has a single other local authority been appointed?  The Minister alluded to the fact that this was happening in many European countries, but that is not the case.  When one reads down the list of the various European countries, the competent authority tends to be their respective Department with responsibility for transport or an aviation agency.  Does Mr. Gallagher consider that Fingal County Council is the appropriate body and has it the appropriate skills to deal with the complexities that this will entail?</p></speech>

As Fingal County Council gets an income from rateable valuation and from premises, how will the decision making be seen to be independent of that council in its role as a beneficiary of airport income?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.810" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Gallagher" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018100300002#B00500"><p>To take Deputy Troy's question first, in terms of other member states, there is a mixed bag of how this has been implemented and, in a way, it reflects how member states organise their aviation policy and regulation.  In some jurisdictions it is true that the transport department has taken responsibility for this.  That tends to be in member states where the transport department directly regulates aviation as well, which is what was the practice in the 1990s when the Department was directly responsible for aviation regulation, but that is mostly done now by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  I understand that Germany and the UK have gone down the road of local authorities.  During the summer the UK implemented Regulation No. 598 in that way.  We are confident in an Irish context that this makes sense.  We have engaged with the European Commission to check that our ground on this is safe and it has not has not raised any issues on that and, in many respects, it has reinforced the idea that Fingal County Council is a sensible choice by virtue of the very strong relationship between Regulation No. 598 and a previous noise directive, No. 2002/49, which is a much broader environmental noise directive for which Fingal County Council already has responsibility.  The Commission views Regulation No. 598 as a top-up of that regulation.  Much of the work done under the 2002 directive in terms of noise mapping and the preparation of a noise action plan, on which Fingal County Council has already been working this year, lead into Regulation No. 598.  Therefore, there is a high level of synergy on that front.</p><p>We are confident that Fingal County Council has expertise on the environmental side, but it will have to build up additional expertise in this area.  However, it is already involved in monitoring and measuring noise levels in Fingal, specifically around the site of Dublin Airport.  While giving it these new functions will certainly add extra work, it will be an extension of work it is already doing.</p><p> The issue of conflict has come up a few times at Question Time in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  As the Minister explained, rates revenue from Dublin Airport is approximately 15% of Fingal County Council's total rates income, but when all of the council's income is considered, the figure is about 8%.  It is not an insignificant amount, but at the same time the council has many other sources of income, including local property tax from residents.  We were very careful to examine the issue of conflict, but we are clear that given the way local authorities work, they often need to issue planning permission for commercial or residential properties and make decisions on zoning and planning, all of which give rise in due course to an income stream.  Therefore, they have existing systems to ensure there are no undue influences or conflicts in that regard.  We are confident in building on this.</p></speech>

I can understand that if I had professional knowledge of all of these issues, I would have to be an expert.  Therefore, I presume the chief executive would have to be advised by an expert.  Could he ignore that advice in the context of this legislation or would he be bound by it?  If somebody were to make a recommendation, how could he overrule it if he were not an expert in the area?  What factors would he take into account?</p> <p>  I call Senator Frank Feighan who will be followed by Deputy Robert Troy.  People should feel free to come in and out.</p></speech>

It is encouraging that Fingal County Council has the expertise and competence for it.  What other options did the Department consider?  Were there other options?  I understand that in areas throughout Europe local authorities have also been used.  Were other options open to the Department, other than using Fingal County Council?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.814" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018100300002#C00400"><p>I come back to what Mr. Gallagher said about how we compared with other European cities.  How exactly have the other European countries transposed the directive into their national legislation?  What competent bodies have been put in place for this purpose?  Mr. Gallagher cited as examples countries that used their respective Department of transport as a competent authority.  He has said they are more capable of doing it as the competent authority because their Department of transport is responsible for aviation.  He has pointed out that in this country that responsibility lies with the Irish Aviation Authority.  However, one of the reasons the authority was deemed not to be suitable to be the competent authority was a perceived conflict interest.  If it is acceptable in another country, what was the problem here?</p> <p>  Head 3 states the provision designates the competent authority for the purposes of regulation and aligns the functions already undertaken by Fingal County Council under the environmental noise directive with the functions of the competent authority.  Is it referring to the 2002 directive?  What is the difference between that directive and Regulation No. 598/2014?</p></speech>

It has made it quite clear that it will need to acquire some expertise.  The benefit of the council in general is having institutional knowledge of how to run many of the processes that will be required to be run in putting Regulation No. 598/2014 out for public consultation, including the submission of data and that kind of thing.  It does considerable work in meeting existing noise level requirements, a matter to which I will return.</p> <p>  What was the other part of the Senator's question?</p></speech>

Our first option was to use the Irish Aviation Authority.  While I was not there at the time, my sense is that the authority put up its hand.  It is well resourced and competent.  Therefore, we went a long way down the road, supported at the time by legal advice that it could be done.  There were developments in case law at European level, but largely the issue of conflict came from the fact that the authority, as well as being regulator, also had a commercial wing that was providing air traffic control services.  Therefore, in the end the conflict arose from it having a commercial interest in traffic levels at the airport.  On the one hand, it regulates and, on the other, has a skin in the game in the development of the airport.  It was felt that would be too much.</p> <p>  Reverting back to why the Department would not be an option, the State owns Dublin Airport.  Therefore, in a way the Minister, with the Minister for Finance, is a shareholder.  We might also have been facing the same questions about conflicts in that respect.</p> <p>  Other options were quite limited.  Given the amount of time and resources put into exploring the IAA option and given the timeframes, we did not have much time for an extended beauty contest to see who might want this.  In a way, there was a limited field.  We looked at a few existing agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency which was quickly ruled out by its line Department and the agency, I suppose, because of its inability to step up to the plate.</p> <p>  We also looked at the Commission for Aviation Regulation, but it is a small body.  As it is an economic regulator, the very technical noise and environmental aspects, the scope of the mapping required and the carrying out of a public consultation process were beyond its capability within any reasonable timeframe.  In the light of that, Fingal County Council became a very clear candidate.</p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy asked about the 2002 directive.  It is an important factor.  The directive requires Fingal County Council to map noise levels in its area.  As I am not an expert, committee members will need to cut me some slack in giving what will be a non-technical explanation.  Part of it specifically relates to mapping noise levels and their impact at Dublin Airport.  It is required to come up with a noise action plan.  I believe last week or the previous week it published a draft noise action plan for Dublin Airport.  Therefore, it does much of the groundwork.  It measures noise levels at Dublin Airport and identifies the people living in the area who are affected by them.  It identifies the scale in different estates and areas in Fingal.  It also identifies the drivers behind it.  It does all of this under the 2002 directive.</p> <p>  Regulation No. 598/2014 is an extra piece specifically related to airports.  With the 2002 directive, Fingal County Council takes account of Dublin Airport, but it also considers the M50 and other generators of noise.  Regulation No. 598/2014 specifically refers to the mapping of noise levels at the airport and then applies a balanced approach to identify how we can manage and mitigate noise levels at the airport using the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, scheme which involves a series of measures, land use, aircraft technology and aspects such as landing patterns and traffic movements around the airport.  A combination of things can be done to manage noise levels and if at the end of them they are not sufficient to bring the noise down to a reasonable level, operating restrictions, the levels at which they might be and how they might function at the airport, will be considered.</p><p>Regulation No. 598 provides for that but the 2002 directive does not.  The latter is a much more general piece about measuring and monitoring noise whereas Regulation No. 598 has a suite of actions that can be taken in response to it.</p></speech>

The timelines actually fit in with Regulation No. 598/20014.  What we are trying to do in this Bill is to have these two processes running in parallel and feeding into one another.  It is a recurring piece and the 2002 directive and Regulation No. 598 both provide for periodic reviews, with monitoring in between.  Assessments are made of the current position as well as the future position, particularly in the context of development plans at the airport and in the region as a whole, the noise implications of same and the steps that need to be taken to manage that into the future.</p></speech>

It requires a periodic review every five years and we need to determine how well that is being implemented.  The directive is 16 years old but was commenced 12 years ago.  It would be important to scrutinise how the directive was implemented before giving further responsibility to the organisation in terms of implementing Regulation No. 598.  That is the rationale for my question.</p> <p>  My questions are very basic.  We are aligning this new regulation with an earlier one and I would have expected-----</p></speech>

In our dealings with the European Commission in particular, my sense is that Regulation No. 598 was introduced because despite the 2002 directive, noise management at EU airports was not as proactive as it should be.  I do not know the details of the 2002 directive but I know it is not as prescriptive as Regulation No. 598.  The regulation is very prescriptive in terms of what is done at airports.  There is no doubt about the fact that it is an extra layer of regulation that was not there previously.  In terms of the performance of Fingal in the context of the effectiveness of the regulation, it can be a difficult thing to measure.  It lends itself to subjectivity too but from our perspective, introducing another party into this space would have created a very complex administrative space.</p></speech>

Does that have implications for development timelines or the growth of the airport?  Perhaps this is not relevant, but in terms of the working through of this Bill, will there be implications for night time flights and a possible reduction in the number of same?</p></speech>

We did not want the situation to arise where An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be dealing with the planning application first time out and would also be the appeals body for that application.  We had to do it through Fingal.  In terms of whether it extends the timelines, we have been advised that it will not affect them materially.  Even if it does affect them, we can feed that into our planning process and provide for it.</p> <p>  In terms of the night time flights, the Deputy is no doubt aware of the existing permission for a second runway.  It includes operating restrictions which the DAA has said are deeply problematic for the airport in terms of its long-term development.  In that context, the Bill proposes to allow for those operating restrictions to be run back through this new regulatory regime to see if there are alternative ways of mitigating noise at the airport.  At the moment, those restrictions exist until such time as an alternative is found.  The question of whether there is another way of managing noise at the airport that is not as prohibitive as the current operating restrictions will be posed through this Bill.  That is part of what we are trying to provide for here.</p></speech>

The aim is to find ways to allow airports to grow, within reason, while also taking steps to ensure that the impact of noise on those who live in the vicinity of airports is managed properly and does not get out of hand.  In terms of the outcome, it will be matter for the regulator to determine what is appropriate.  I do not have any view on whether the current operating restrictions are too much or too little.  All that will be put into the mix again but this time there will be a broader consideration of other measures that may be taken to manage noise.</p></speech>

I see the potential for significant conflict between the views of communities, elected members and the chief executive, or his or her nominee, of the county council because the legislation as proposed does not allow the council to "influence or seek to influence".  Does that preclude a debate in a council chamber?  The statutory body has a view but when it meets the corporate body it cannot raise the issue with it.  That is problematic.</p> <p>  Mr. Gallagher mentioned a number of bodies that were approached with a view to taking on this role.  It is my view that regardless of whether those bodies wished to take it on, if it is the view of the Minister that they should do so, then they should.  I do not think any body, whether it is the EPA or another body, should have a choice in that.  It should be the most independent, qualified and competent authority, in my view.  Was An Bord Plean&aacute;la considered in this context?  Could An Bord Plean&aacute;la be the authority?  In that way, people who live in the area, as well as those who work in the airport, could engage with a democratic debate in the council chamber, with the manager not being pulled one way or the other.  </p></speech>

I will take them in reverse order and deal with the question about An Bord Plean&aacute;la first.  The issue with An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that it makes decisions whereas what we need is a regulator that will also monitor and manage noise proactively.  It does not have such executive functions and is not, therefore, appropriate.</p><p> In addition to that, because Regulation No. 598 needs an appeals mechanism it seemed obvious it would provide it.  With regard to the choice of other agencies, I would not characterise it as people being able to step out of the limelight by choice.  When we sat down with officials and the agencies and worked through it, it did not need a huge amount of in-depth analysis to work out the obvious problems and capacity issues.  It lent itself to Fingal County Council being the competent authority.  There is certainly no attempt in the general scheme of the Bill to cut across local democracy or the role of council members.  That part reflects the norm in the planning process.  It prevents - "interference" is not the right word - that type of link to specific decisions in the council's work on local area development planning.  That will all be the big picture stuff.</p></speech>

Ultimately, he or she has to make the decision and if he or she wants to give a permission that is not in compliance with the development plan he or she has to go back to the elected members and they have to make that decision.  The Bill provides that on any development that is part of a Regulation No. 598 decision, the manager can only make a decision about that element of development in his or her decision, which is in compliance with the development plan.</p></speech>

I accept that greater regulation of noise at our airports was not a decision of the Irish Government but of the EU.  It is a directive that has been imposed on all EU countries.  From what the witnesses have said today, we need to make sure we get this right.  We have to ensure it is the right body and that it has the capabilities to implement this directive.  I have a worry because the directive is 17 pages long.  One might talk about it being cumbersome, but the heads of the Bill is 73 pages long.  In certain areas there seems to be duplication.  I will give an example of that.  Head 9.3 requires a parallel planning application with a noise assessment process.  The application is to the same body.  The planning application is submitted to Fingal County Council with the CEO as the line manager.  The line manager for the noise assessment process is also Fingal County Council.  Head 26 requires all development in the airport to be considered by the competent authority to assess the likely effect of the proposed development on the noise situation in the airport in addition to going through the ordinary planning process.  We seem to have parallel procedures.  We have talked about ensuring efficiency and ensuring it is non-cumbersome, which is the word Mr. Gallagher used, but it appears to be very cumbersome.  It will be problematic.  It will lead to significant delays.  It is a worry in terms of the long-term sustainable development and growth of Dublin Airport.  The Bill removes Dublin Airport from strategic infrastructure zoning.  This has the potential to slow down the national aviation policy and the long-term objectives and plans for Dublin Airport to grow as an international hub for transatlantic flights from mainland Europe.  Can the witnesses please supply the committee with a list of countries and the competent authorities they have used?  Will the witnesses supply the committee with information on how the EU noise directive of 2002 has been managed and rolled out by Fingal County Council since it was taken on board?</p> <p>  I have a number of other questions but perhaps the witnesses will answer those questions first.  </p></speech>

The purpose of the duplication is to ensure that when the current operating restrictions, which are a result of planning permissions, are put through this new regulatory regime if there is cause to change them as a result of the application of the noise regulation it is safe to do so and that it can be done without being seen to undermine the planning process.  Essentially what we are doing is looking again at the second runway through the prism of Regulation No. 598 and acknowledging there are planning related restrictions.  The reason for that clunky bit to make sure we are not seen as just scratching off planning related pieces that the airport or the Department did not like.  It is clunky to start with.  That is not how it will happen in future.  All that stuff will fall off.  There is still some work to be done in getting to a Bill to put to the House which is clear about that interplay between planning and Regulation No. 598.  The Deputy is right to identify it as a bit clunky.  It will be necessarily clunky at the start and we hope it will be a bit less clunky when we get to the Bill stage.</p></speech>

The whole purpose of the directive is to identify a competent authority that can deal with noise regulation.  The airport needs certainty to deal with those two planning conditions.  The residents also need certainty.  That is supposed to be the purpose of the independent authority.  We will have a parallel process by the same body, reporting to the same person, which seems bizarre.</p></speech>

The clunky bit to which the Deputy referred is meant to ensure the DAA and local residents will have certainty that a three-card trick is not being played and that the existing operating restrictions will be applied to the new regime.  If it is subsequently decided that other measures must be introduced, they will be but subject only to public consultation.  That is why it is clunky.</p> <p>  The regulation does not speak to planning and development issues.  Some of the complexity in adapting it for use in Ireland stems from the fact that we are introducing it in the middle of Dublin Airport's development.  No other member state is developing in that space.  The directive envisaged being let loose for the future; it did not envisage any legacy issue.</p> <p>  Without speaking ill of a European regulation, when read from cover to cover, it does not move seamlessly from one step to the next.  Frankly, it has been a job trying to interpret in what order things are to happen and when.  That has also caused us a significant amount of grief.  This is a much larger Bill than we ever would have liked, but we are trying to be as honest and transparent as we can, which is why we have ended up with it.</p></speech>

The captain of the ship has moved the goal posts a number of times; a great deal of time has been expended on the IAA and we are now trying to develop a robust authority within a tight timeframe.  I respect the fact that the Department is working within a timeframe, but we must get the Bill right.  We do not need a complex authority or a parallel process.  Mr. Gallagher should revisit these matters before the Bill is published.  It is cumbersome and overly bureaucratic and will not be of benefit to the residents who have fears about noise regulation or the DAA which needs certainty in determining how the airport is to develop and grow.  A key component is the noise abatement objective, but even in head 6 there is no clear timeframe.  It is meant to happen "as soon as practicable after the commencement day".  One would have thought it would be the starting point of the process and that a clear timeframe would be set out in order that the process could be kept on track, that residents with concerns could feed into it and be aware of the timeframe and that the DAA could develop and grow its business.  The wording "As soon as practicable" is vague and not good enough.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about the objective being the key first step, but we would not include a calendar date in primary legislation.

It will be funded by the industry.  What level of engagement has the Department had with the CEO of Fingal County Council?  To be fair, Mr. Gallagher has acknowledged that an increase in the council's capacity will be required.  Have the additional resources that will be needed been identified?  What is the ballpark figure for the funding that will have to be levied from the DAA?</p> <p>  I identified a further point while going through the documentation last night, but I cannot find it now.  It was related to someone making an objection.  In any fair process it is right and proper for someone with a legitimate objection be able to make it, but the fee remains to be set.  I have found the relevant part.  It reads: "Any submission must be made within a period of five weeks and must be accompanied by the appropriate fee which will be set out in regulations".  We might be waiting until the regulations are made.  No one would have an issue with the making of a legitimate observation on a planning file or, in this case, noise regulation, but are measures being taken to mitigate against persons who make objections that are not legitimate?</p><p>I am thinking of what happened in Athenry.  A significant development in this country was held up because of somebody on the far side of the country on the east coast, on whom the development was having no impact.  Legitimate concerns need to be dealt with in a fair, open and transparent manner.  We need to ensure that but we also want to prohibit any possibility of somebody putting in an objection illegitimately. </p></speech>

If the organisation is part of Fingal, will it be separately audited or how will it account for itself?</p></speech>

On Deputy Troy's point on the right to make observations, how we strike that balance is the issue of the day.  Mr. O'Duffy advised me that is being looked at in the planning context.  In respect of the fees, we will mirror what happens in planning.  It is &euro;20 as far as I understand.</p> <p>  I have a couple of points on funding.  Fingal has been asked to go off and work out what level of funding it will need.  I do not want to give a ballpark figure and create a floor.  For example, if it is a full review, there will be consultancy costs and, in the interim, there will be monitoring costs.  We could speculate on a figure between &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million.  It might be less.  I do not know but we will know before we get to the final stage.</p> <p>  We will look to provide accountability.  Dublin Airport will be entitled to that and there will have to be engagement.  The fees will be reflected in the regulations on publication and in consultation with the industry.  That would be pretty normal for regulators.  It is standard right across the Irish system that regulators impose an industry fee.  The Exchequer does not fund them.  We mirror whatever the normal practices are on accountability, transparency and reporting.  </p></speech>

They may need to come back in respect of a timeframe for the noise abatement objective, which is important.  It is a critical component of this legislation.  I would like that as quickly as possible.  I cannot think of the wording but it is vague.</p></speech>

Proceeding with a a planning application running at the same time as an application to remove a condition on noise is again cumbersome.  That has been acknowledged by Mr. Gallagher.  I think he used the word "clunky" but clunkiness can cost money and cause delay.  That needs to be revisited and the need for it examined.  I am not a technical expert but reading through EU Regulation 598/2014, there does not appear to be any planning requirements.  The appeal will be made to the one body.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if Mr. Gallagher would also examine that.  We mentioned this earlier, and perhaps I missed it, but why was a decision taken to remove Dublin Airport from strategic infrastructure development?  It certainly is of strategic importance in national policy, SID.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-03a.894" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Gallagher" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018100300002#G00900"><p>That took a bit of explaining to the Government as well and to officials.  It is the natural fallout of what we are doing.  The idea was not to have a situation where we would have a planning application for a significant development at Dublin Airport directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and then appeals on noise at the airport also going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board is supposed to be the independent appeals body for development at the airport in respect of noise and also the planning decision body for development.  The only option was to revert to a two-step process for both where they needed to be aligned.  Where development and noise were happening at the same time, they could go in tandem.  In discussions on this with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and the Local Government and the DAA, we have a view that it should not make a material difference.  There were not evidentially huge advantages to the DAA in respect of SID.  It works differently for different areas but this is a one site one company issue and there was a feeling that the other system would work as well.  We are, however, conscious of it.</p> <p>  We will endeavour to address the timeframe as Deputy Troy has suggested.  We will try to be specific on that front.  On the dual process, it is essentially a case of risk.  We need to make sure we have as much cover as possible in the system for all parties, the DAA and the stakeholders.  When we are looking at the legacy issue, we have to make sure there are not any chinks or avenues where people can say the process is not right and proper.  That is what it is trying to do.  Hopefully, over the next few weeks when we get into further detailed legal consideration, if we can find a more streamlined way that is legally sound, we will certainly go for it.  We may end up, though, with something that is slightly suboptimal.  The two Departments are clear on the general point about Fingal.  The Government has decided it is the only game in town.  Our challenge now is to make it work and give it the resources to make it work.  It is in everybody's interest to have a process that is transparent but also comes to a decision in good time.</p></speech>

It does have a broader role in respect of the environmental aspects.  It is not scratched from the airport site, I imagine, but it will not have any role under EU Regulation 598/2014.  We are at the mercy of this committee and the D&aacute;il on the legislative framework.  The Government has agreed a timeframe that is challenging but it is dictated by the certainty that needs to be given to the airport and to the residents in Fingal.  That is where the urgency is.  We are certainly planning for it but we are passengers on that front.  We can only do so much.</p></speech>
