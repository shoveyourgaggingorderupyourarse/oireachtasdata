The increased frequency of extreme weather events, flooding and drought are manifestations of what will be a growing trend, unfortunately, until the world halts the momentum of climate change.  Without urgent action, we are facing a global climate disaster. </p> <p>  Ireland has a moral imperative to play its part in helping to address the problem of climate change.  As a result, we have set ourselves a binding target to decarbonise Irish society by 2050, with key milestones along the way.  Failure to reach these milestones will have multiple adverse consequences.  The task of the CCAC is to provide independent advice on policy.  The council considers that it is critical to assess how Ireland can best meet this challenge at least cost and to identify other benefits, such as improved air quality or health outcomes, to which I will return.</p><p>Unfortunately the very limited policy actions so far means that we are going backwards.  Emissions are rising not falling.  Improved economic performance will make this even worse because greenhouse gas emissions remain strongly coupled to economic growth.  We have, therefore, a really big problem. </p><p> The council believes that Ireland needs a suite of new policy initiatives to make a real difference.  There is potential for progress in particular through the national planning framework and the national development plan, but also the national mitigation plan and the upcoming national climate and energy plan.  We need to move these plans forward into concrete action and implementation with monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of delivery.  We have commented on this in terms of the national mitigation plan in that it needs concrete actions to put it into effect.  </p><p> This is a task not just for the Government, but also for the Oireachtas.  Without broad-based support in the Oireachtas for serious new measures Ireland will continue to move ever further from its targets.  </p><p> We know from a very wide range of research in Ireland and elsewhere that changing incentives can help us to change our behaviour.  That is why one of the key messages from the council, identified in our first report in 2017 and repeated in all subsequent reports, is that we need to reflect the potential damage done by emitting greenhouse gases in the price of those emissions.  Without a full reflection of the cost of emitting greenhouse gases it will not be possible to effect or deal with the problem of climate change.  The wide range of other measures and policies that are needed - a whole suite of additional policies is needed -  to bring about decarbonisation will be undermined if emitting greenhouse gases remains the cheap option.  It must no longer be the cheap option if we are to go anywhere. </p><p> The carbon tax in Ireland, and the carbon price in the EU emissions trading system, are too low and do not reflect the costs of climate change.  This is a key factor in our failure so far to make progress on tackling the problem. </p><p> There are three key reasons pricing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is important: it discourages use of fossil fuels and encourages us to switch to alternatives such as renewables thus making it comparatively cheaper and more attractive to use electric cars, upgrade our homes and buy A-rated appliances and, equally, pricing emissions appropriately means that business and Government would also find that eliminating greenhouse gas emissions saves money, for example, by purchasing and operating high emissions buses needs to be much more expensive than zero emissions buses; second, carbon pricing, and especially the carbon tax, provides the Government with revenue which it can use to compensate or support those who are on low incomes who would be affected by the rise in the price and can be used in the budget to reduce other taxes or increase expenditure - an issue that came up last week - as research shows that shifting from taxes on labour to taxes on carbon can actually increase employment - it is possible to take action on climate change which actually improves things in terms of the economy rather than making things worse as well as playing a crucial role in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases; and, finally, the most important effect of appropriately pricing emissions is to incentivise business to invest in new technologies, which will allow us to continue to enjoy a high standard of living while eliminating emissions of greenhouse gases. </p><p> The prospect of a higher price for carbon is already driving essential innovation, for example, in electrification of transport.  The motor industry worldwide would not be investing, or have invested as it has, in new technologies without the prospect of the high price of carbon.  Similarly, we also need to drive investment in finding ways of producing low-carbon heating for homes. </p><p> The current carbon pricing levels are too low to see these effects reach their potential.  The carbon tax should be increased to at least &euro;30 a tonne in the next budget, with a commitment to raise it in subsequent budgets.  That is why one Oireachtas cannot commit a future Oireachtas to action but getting broad support from this committee, that raising the tax in this budget will continue into future budgets is important because it will tell people that if we invest in reducing emissions, it will be even more profitable in the future than it is today.  Low levels of carbon pricing do not deliver sufficient results.  A significant carbon price would not only deliver immediate emissions reductions, but would also put the conditions in place for a longer-term ambitious low carbon transition through improved investment choices.</p><p> We face major challenges across a range of areas of the economy - energy, heat, transport, agriculture and industrial emissions.</p><p>I want to pick on one example.  In the case of heat, we need to upgrade most of our 1.5 million households.  Actually, we have 2 million houses.  If this is to happen, it needs to be the cheap option and must reflect the appropriate price of polluting.  However, that is only the beginning.  If Mrs. Murphy, a pensioner living in County Mayo, is to retrofit her house, improve insulation and change to renewable heating, in the first instance we must be able to tell her it will save her money.  That is only the beginning, however, because she might not be able to fund such an investment.  Even if she can, the need to manage a major building project will probably be a bigger obstacle.  She might be concerned that the builders will do a bad job or that they might tip off potential burglars.  For these reasons, we need to build a suite of supporting policies to ensure Mrs. Murphy can and will upgrade her house.  There would be no point in her going through all this effort if it does not save her money and does not save the planet.  If a suitable range of policies is developed so that Mrs. Murphy retrofits her house, this will save her a significant amount of her limited income over the rest of her life.  There are substantial potential benefits.  She will be much more comfortable.  She may well experience enhanced health and life expectancy as a result of these improvements.  She will have made her contribution to tackling climate change.</p><p> Extensive ESRI research shows that poorer households spend larger portions of their budgets on heating than richer households.  While poorer households need to be part of these reforms, they must be protected from the consequences of such reforms for their budgets precisely because they spend significant amounts of their money on energy for heating.  Successive studies indicate that this is best dealt with by means of an appropriate increase in social welfare to ensure poorer households are fully compensated.  As long ago as 1992, an ESRI study conducted by my then colleague, Sue Scott, indicated that approximately 30% of the revenue from a carbon tax would need to be allocated for this purpose.  Support can also be directed to help low-income households to retrofit their houses, thereby reducing the portions of their incomes required for home heating.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has introduced programmes in this regard and this needs to be expanded.  The authority is doing good work to assess what works and what does not.  There is no single answer.  We need to assess various projects.  Some projects do not work when they are tried, whereas others are successful.</p><p> The State is the largest landlord in the State, with approximately 150,000 tenants in social housing.  Like all landlords, the State has a duty to upgrade its housing stock to move to a carbon-neutral world.  If it does not do this, how can the other 1.35 million households be expected to do so?  Reports suggest that the cost of upgrading a dwelling is between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000.  If that is the case, the State will need to spend approximately &euro;5 billion on upgrading its housing stock.  It is a lot of money.  As I said when I spoke about Mrs Murphy, this investment will leave tenants better off, more comfortable and healthier, while also implementing the State&rsquo;s commitment to decarbonise the economy.  I appreciate that &euro;5 billion is a very large sum, especially in the context of the need to build more social housing.  It would probably buy 15,000 social houses.  The State will need all the help it can get from carbon taxes to fund this transformation.</p><p> I have concentrated on how appropriate pricing of carbon is essential if we are to tackle the problem of global warming in the heat sector.  The same is true for the other sectors that we need to tackle.  We are happy to discuss them in more detail.  While it is crucial to get the price of carbon right, as I have illustrated, various other policies are essential if we are to do our job of helping to save the planet.  As I have indicated, some of these policies might save us money, as investment in renewable electricity has done.  Up to 2012, we had to pay more through the public service obligation for electricity, but the effect of renewables was to reduce the price of electricity.  There was a win-win.  We were emitting substantially less carbon and the households and companies of Ireland were paying less for their electricity.  We need to target such measures.</p><p> Our first job is to pick the easy wins where we can save money while improving our living standards in other ways.  Some easy wins that save money and also cut carbon emissions, such as the closure of peat-fired generation, might have adverse effects on employees and local communities.  Supporting individuals and communities that are adversely affected and helping them to make the transition to low-carbon economic opportunities will help to speed the adjustment.  Approximately 3 million of the 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide we are emitting comes from peat-fired electricity.  It is costing everybody money.  There is an easy win in this area, as long as we deal with the fallout for those who are directly affected.  There will be a need for very significant investment by the State, companies and households.  This will pose problems in the context of the continuing strain on Government resources.</p><p>Identifying and maximising co-benefits in terms of health, air quality and a range of other benefits from climate policy is important if we are to move forward.  In prioritising this work the council has emphasised that Ireland must implement a major increase in the cost of emitting carbon in the coming decade, moving to a substantial carbon tax by 2030 of approximately &euro;80 a tonne or higher.  Because of doubts about the success of the reform of the EU emissions trading scheme, ETS, the council has also recommended that Ireland implement a carbon price floor for electricity, something which has already been implemented in Great Britain which is the leader in this regard.  It could be done, for example, by joining with a coalition of willing partners such as France which is very keen on the idea, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the new government of which announced in November that it would go down this route.  That would guarantee that if Ireland were to invest in renewable electricity, it would make money in the future, whereas the current uncertainty about the ETS price makes such investment a risky option.</p><p> In the coming year the council will focus successively on the detailed policy measures needed in the areas of agriculture, heat and transport.  Although we have not reached detailed conclusions, we are still happy to discuss these areas with the committee.</p><p> Research shows that how we communicate the need for action on climate change is of importance.  The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly has shown the potential of citizen engagement and it is hoped the national dialogue on climate action will expand its effects throughout the country.  These will be important to maintain public support for the changes required in the coming years, especially those which involve expenditure.  Policy must take account of the complex factors that affect human behaviour.  I refer to the example I gave of the obstacles for Ms Murphy in upgrading her dwelling.  We must choose policies which will help us to make the right choices for the future.</p><p> Carbon pricing alone will not deliver the necessary emissions reductions, but delivering emissions reductions without a sufficient carbon price will be almost impossible and certainly far more expensive.  Increasing the cost of emitting carbon is not a once-off commitment, rather it must be sustained in the coming decade.  If we are to decarbonise the economy and our society, it is essential that there be wide support across all political parties for this essential step on the decarbonisation journey.  That is why the work of this committee is so important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Chairman" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#H00200"><p>I thank Professor FitzGerald.  I will begin with a few short questions before I move to members.  </p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly stated it was important that whatever plan the State came up with was enforceable by law.  As Professor FitzGerald is aware, it recommended that an independent statutory body be established with powers of enforcement over the State if targets were not met.  What is his view in that regard?  Would he support the establishment of such a body?</p> <p>  One of the most difficult sectors to address is the agriculture sector.  How much detailed consideration did the advisory council give to the economic effects on farmers' incomes and Exchequer returns?  A major concern for many of the members present is getting the balance right in meeting our targets, while not disadvantaging rural Ireland and keeping our agricultural interests in mind.</p> <p>  I do not know if Professor Fitzgerald has formed an opinion on the proposal for a stand-alone Department of climate action.  In the light of the scale of the work that must be done, does he think it would be a positive step to have a separate Department of climate action?</p> <p>  On the potential of offshore wind energy generation, I note that the United Kingdom is tapping into it on a large scale, with 10.6% of electricity being generated from onshore wind and 8.5% from offshore wind.  What do we need to do in Ireland in that regard?  What are the challenges or blockages?  Has a licensing regulatory framework been set up?  What do we need to do?  Offshore wind energy can easily be tapped into, but the committee must know what are the challenges in that regard and the council's view on how we can take that step to use it.  All present know about the objections and planning problems with onshore wind energy projects; therefore, offshore wind energy generation seems to be one of the areas on which we must focus.  </p> <p>  I ask Professor FitzGerald to elaborate on these points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#H00300"><p>On the Citizens' Assembly recommendation that a body be established to legally enforce implementation of climate strategy, the Climate Change Advisory Council should not be given such responsibility.</p><p>The council is there to provide independent advice.  The four statutory members could not be on it under those circumstances.  It is about having the independence to say what we think is best without having to enter enforcement.  Once one is into enforcement then one is into the democratic process, which is very different.  For four years in the last decade I was on the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation.  Under law, the mission of the regulator there was as an enforcement body.  We were there to do that.  The law said we were to ensure that consumers, in the long run, had a secure supply of electricity at minimum cost.  This gave the regulator a clear objective, given to us by the legislature.  The problem was that it also said we were to do something on the environment, which was difficult because as regulators it was up to us to decide whether to impose more costs on consumers in Northern Ireland in order to benefit the environment.  I believe that distribution issues are for the Oireachtas to deal with and are not for the regulator.  Regulators should have a clear mission on what they are to do.  In certain areas one can see how setting up a body might help with implementation but  it would be very different from the regulator.  That is not our branch.  One would be starting from scratch in setting up another body to do that.  I am not sure that the failure so far of the Oireachtas to act, or of successive Governments to act, would have helped.  The legislators are the experts on that, not me.<br/><br/>I will now turn to the economic effects on agriculture.  We will spend the next six months considering this aspect in detail.  When I was appointed as chairman of the council it was my understanding of the science that I was going to have to tell farmers they would have to get rid of their cows.  It turns out, however, that the scientific evidence on this issue is more complicated.  Methane lasts some 12 years in the atmosphere, and perhaps Phillip can elaborate on this.  This means that agriculture needs a more nuanced solution.  It is not a get-out-of-jail card.  Agriculture has to make a major transformation if Ireland is to decarbonise.  The first problem is that we need to define the objective for 2050 and what carbon neutrality means for agriculture.  In the case of carbon dioxide it is easy to define.  A tonne of carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for 100,000 years or indefinitely.  It continues to do damage, not just when it is emitted and not just for 12 years; it remains for 100,000 years.  We have to get rid of all carbon dioxide.  The same goes for nitrogen oxide, NOx, which presents a big issue with agriculture's use of fertiliser.  We must eliminate it also.  With regard to methane, if Ireland had the same number of cows as there were in 1841, the impact on global warming would be the same as it was in 1841.<br/><br/>We need to define the objective for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and I would like the Department to spell out what the science means.  There is a problem in that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, will issue a paper on this in August 2019, which will define it.  Whatever Ireland defines as an objective must be consistent with the IPCC's definition.  I understand that the change in the science will be reflected in the IPCC report and we need to reflect that change.  I refer to a possible result of this.  Farmers make money from dairy farming.  Dairy cows are a priority.  Research shows that farmers make pretty much nothing, net, from beef cattle.  While beef cattle and dairy cows are biologically linked, if we de-emphasise beef and got out of beef production Ireland would save on the methane emissions, which might give more scope but saving on methane emissions is not the issue; the issue in agriculture is land use.  The issue is about changing land use.  Today's <i>Financial Times</i>carries an article on what Britain plans to do in agriculture after Brexit.  There are many issues around sucking the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through changes in land use.  Ireland also needs to look at this.  Perhaps the CAP reform will incentivise it.  For example, if it costs a farmer to have cattle on their drumlin soil in Cavan, research suggests that they may make more money switching to biomass forestry.  This could be part of the solution.</p><p>There are a lot of problems for farmers in doing that, however.  If I planted trees, I would be dead before I could get the benefit from them.  We need a suite of policies that move agriculture onto a sustainable path.  We need to define that path.  It will involve some wins but there will also be costs.  Teagasc published a very interesting suite of policies, some of which are cheap and can make a real difference, for example, on changes in fertiliser use.  It might be possible, although the advisory council has not decided on the issues, that the price of a particularly damaging fertiliser might be made more expensive.  Alternatively, we might have a carrot instead.  Another measure that is specifically mentioned in today's <i>Financial Times </i>for Britain is flooding wetlands so they absorb more carbon.  Farmers are not going to do that unless there is an incentive.  That might be an area where we might have carrots.  We do not have a detailed suite; it is for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come up with the policy and objectives.  There are solutions that leave agriculture productive and farmers earning an income and that could be consistent with a sustainable future, but we need to define the path.  <br/><br/>On a stand-alone Department of climate - this is my personal view - one of the reasons we have made so little progress in the last two years has been the dislocation caused by moving climate from one Department to another.  Key officials who had the expertise, for example, in developing scenarios and modelling what the effects of policies would be, did not transfer from one Department to the other.  The current Department has had to develop the expertise from scratch.  Switching again to another Department will delay progress for another two years.  It may work in theory but, in practice, is this what we want?  We want an administration that has the expertise and can deliver rather than to be constantly changing the administration.  That will make problems, not solve them.  That is my personal view.  I do not know if Ms Burke wants to say something on the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#K00200"><p>We have not discussed this but the risk in setting up a separate, stand-alone body is that everyone will think, "that Department over there will be responsible."  With regard to climate and broader environmental issues, we need them to be integrated - "infiltrated" would be another way of describing it - into all the Departments.  Then, for any decision, whether it was being made in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Transport, Tourism and Sport or whatever other Department, climate would be taken into consideration.  There is a risk that by separating it out, we would be absolving the other Departments of responsibility.</p> <p>  With regard to setting up an independent body, the other thing that needs to be taken into consideration is that there is already oversight at EU level.  We have commitments there and if we do not meet them there will be repercussions for our EU compliance.  How they would fit in and be aligned is a question that would need to be asked.</p> <p>  On agriculture, Professor FitzGerald mentioned the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  We had 100 scientists from across the world in Dublin last week looking at the IPCC report on agriculture and land use.  The chairman of the IPCC also attended and one of the things he was saying to the group was that although over the last 30 years the IPCC has focused very much on the science of climate change and the issues, it is now moving its focus to some of the solutions.  That is a really interesting change of dynamic.  We now all know the issues and there has been great work done in bringing attention to them.  It is really important to have that expertise from across the world looking at solutions.</p></speech>

One of the reasons the people of Ireland and the climate are a winner in what we did on renewable energy compared to anywhere else in Europe is that we have delivered it in a way that has reduced the cost for people and helped clean up our emissions.  There are issues which I will not go into here in terms of getting acceptance for onshore wind.  However, the cost of offshore wind has come down dramatically.  One has to be careful with lobbyists when they are lobbying, but one major international company asked to speak to me and said it was happy to put in a very large amount of offshore wind development in Ireland.  I thought the man was going to say the company wanted a subsidy.</p><p>Actually, the company wanted interconnection between Ireland and France.  If there was such interconnection which enabled Ireland to export its surplus wind energy, it would be done.  We are approaching a stage where offshore wind may be deployed in the next decade.  Our remit until now has been to decide how we are to clean up our act at a minimal cost to the people of Ireland.  Until now, onshore wind has been the answer.  To meet our commitments for 2020 we need to see a substantial increase of onshore deployment.</p><p> The Chairman raised an interesting issue, and has obviously been briefed on this, as I have.  There are problems with offshore power in terms of foreshore licences, etc.  Legislation, which has not yet come before the Oireachtas, would help us to clean up our act and make it easy to acquire permits for offshore wind.  It would be good if the Department could bring forward that legislation soon.  Offshore wind may not yet be profitable, but we should at least be ready for it and make it easy for people.</p></speech>

Ms Justice Laffoy suggested the fines may not be imposed, but oversight would provide a stick which the State could use to meet its targets.  While I acknowledge that this would not be a role for the advisory council, would the council support a statutory oversight body in Ireland that would ensure we meet our targets?  Last week, I asked about fines at European level and at national level.</p></speech>

It depends on how we want to go about tackling climate change.  Within the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act Ministers already have a responsibility to report what their Departments are doing.  I am aware that this committee will ask various Ministers and Secretaries General to appear before it.  Whether that is deemed to be sufficient, along with the reporting role the EPA has in highlighting it year on year, remains to be seen.  I am slightly concerned about putting a large amount of effort into a body which then starts holding various Departments to account and threatening them rather than focusing on getting things done.  If such a body was set up, it would be important to ensure that we still get the traction.  Professor FitzGerald alluded to the fact that we do a great deal of talking.  We have to make sure our national policy ambitions become actions.   That is a concern I have.</p></speech>

Thinking about timeframes, Professor FitzGerald reminded me that Sue Scott wrote something about this issue in 1992.  I recently found a dust-covered book on my shelf written by my colleague, John Gormley, which set out the science of climate change.  It was written in 1988 or 1989 but it could have been written yesterday.  The time for marginal change is over; it is time for a change to the system.  In our work we have to think about the world 30 years from now and 30 years is nothing.  We have to change our entire transport, agriculture, land use, energy and industrial systems if we are to play our part in halting runaway, dangerous climate change.</p> <p>  While I support the introduction of higher carbon tax and absolutely agree with the idea of a carbon floor price in the emissions trading scheme, ETS, those steps would represent marginal change.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, made it clear, as did the Department of Finance's tax strategy group, that such actions do not send out the correct signal.  Even if we doubled the carbon tax to twice the level proposed by the advisory council or twice the level the Department of Finance has stated it would even consider, it would still not deliver system change but rather marginal change.</p><p>By Christmas, we have to have a new national climate and energy plan.  Our Government has admitted the existing plan is a complete failure.  That is only in terms of three months, forget about 30 years.</p><p> In terms of the approach we take to this, should we not start by asking the question Professor FitzGerald asked, namely, what carbon neutrality means for land use in 2050.  In that way, we will know where we are going.  Is that not the first thing we have to determine?  Similarly, what is a zero carbon energy system?  In my mind, I am thinking of three decades.  Where would I get the answer to these questions?  Has anyone in the State written some sort of vision for zero carbon energy, transport and carbon-neutral land use systems?  That has knock-on consequences.  Where do I get that analysis?  Who has written it?  Is that not the way we should go?  Rather than just obsessing on 2020 or 2030, should we not think big?  We will have to take some bets on electrification of everything and on land use in various ways, but do we not need to start by thinking at the end point and considering the system changes we need to get there?</p></speech>

The detail of that vision is not there.  We have seen work from University College Cork, UCC, which gives various pathways to it.  There is sometimes a reluctance to pick the technology.

From the beginning, the Council wanted laid out, given our knowledge today of the technology, the cost-effective path to decarbonising Ireland by 2050, for example, that we would need to be at a certain point by 2030, that this would be the cost-effective way to proceed, which might involve doing more than we are committed to doing for 2030, the technologies involved, which would be so many electric cars and so much in the way of retrofit, and to have scenarios on that.  The fact that we failed to do so is a problem.<br/><br/>It is interesting watching our equivalent in the United Kingdom and in Denmark.  They have laid out this path and said what they need to do, the cost-effective way of doing it, and that it will not happen without a suite of other policies.  The Danish Council on Climate Change is very clear on that.  We need to set out the path, put in place evidence-based policies and say we need this policy on electric cars by 2025 or whatever.  It is interesting that the United Kingdom has gone quite far on that.  According to today's <i>Financial Times</i>, they are discussing the last stage - 2030 to 2050 - because they need to eliminate net carbon emissions.  I believe 450 million tonnes are emitted in the United Kingdom.  We emit 60 million plus tonnes.  They can get down to 120 million tonnes by 2050, but that is not carbon neutral, so they are looking at how they can offset that 120 million tonnes by carbon capture and storage and a range of technologies.  In the case of agriculture, because of the special nature of agriculture, it would require more afforestation, and they specifically mention flooding of wetlands and so on.  They have laid out this path.  The Danes have laid out this path, and they are now looking at the policies which would deliver on that path.</p></speech>

Our committee has a role in that our remit is to inform and open up consultation on this new European national energy and climate action plan, which I understand is the definitive plan.  Everyone here is guessing in terms of what the future holds, but will he outline his thinking on the direction we are going in for 2050?</p> <p>  On that, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC did a good job on it and set a much more ambitious target than did the Government by recommending we decarbonise 100% by 2050.</p><p>There are examples such as New Zealand where interesting work has been done in planning for this.  One can even look at an example from as recently as last week where California, the fifth largest economy in the world, has gone way beyond the Government in saying it will have a 100% renewable and 100% decarbonised energy system by 2045.  While I have not read the full text, the targets may be even wider than that.  Does the council have the resources and modelling capacity, or does the EPA have the modelling capacity, to do some of that work for presentation to us in aid of the public policy process in circumstances in which we are required to have a first draft by Christmas?  It does not exist now.  We do not have it anywhere from the Government.</p></speech>

We do not have the resources.  That is what we have a Department for.  As I have indicated, I am concerned that the Department has failed to deliver on this.  Part of the problem it has faced has been that, in the establishment of the new Department, the expertise to do that, which was available in the old Department, did not transfer.  It is a problem but we are not in a position to do it.  We can throw out ideas and we have looked at the price of carbon to begin with, as that is essential.  We are moving now to agriculture and, successively over the next year, we will look at transport and heat and give our views.  However, we are not in a position to put forward a full framework on how we deliver.</p></speech>

As he said, land use is one of the biggest issues.  I have concerns about methane.  The latest scientific research this week means that alarm bells are ringing across the world regarding methane.  The latest science is scary on the release of methane from permafrost.  Methane is not to be discounted in any way.  Aside from the scientific issue, does the council agree with a national land-use plan, as we need to work out where the forestry we need is going to be?  Forestry is one of the most significant abatement measures we may have.  What is the new future for Irish farming in circumstances in which the current model is not working for the vast majority of farmers?  We need to pay them properly for the land-use services they will deliver.  We need a plan to protect biodiversity.  As I am sure Ms Burke will acknowledge, we have a biodiversity crisis as well as a climate crisis.  We need a plan to address flood management and water quality management.  We have many of the tools to deal with that if we follow the water analysis.  If one uses water as one's metric, it delivers many cross benefits in biodiversity, carbon storage and so on.  As such, does the council agree that we need a national land-use plan?</p> <p>  More specifically, I ask the EPA, which is there in terms of the inventory, if it can present the committee, in written form if not in person, with its understanding of the latest IPCC analysis and trajectory, or the UNFCCC analysis?  What sort of carbon abatement or storage capacity would we have if we did 10,000 ha, 15,000 ha or 20,000 ha of afforestation a year?  Would different types of forestry deliver different results?  I refer to continuous cover versus clear fell or mixed versus single canopy forest, which is what we need.  We need that level of analysis or we are flying blind.  Can the committee also be provided with a written assessment on where we are on 2020 and 2030 targets?  UCC has a model but I do not agree with the fundamental assumptions it contains.  Does the EPA have an emissions reduction model for the period to 2050 on the various gases for Ireland?  Can we be provided with that written analysis to inform our work?  While the IPCC report will not be available until August, the UNFCCC is setting rules on accounting and storage.  Mr. McGovern is our representative on the UNFCCC panels.  I ask that the committee be presented in writing with the latest details and analysis as to what the rules may be in regard to land use in particular, as that is the most technical, complex and important issue.  I ask for the presentation of a written report to the committee as part of our ongoing analysis.</p></speech>

To be clear, we cannot deliver everything.  It comes back to the role of the EPA.  I am now exchanging my Climate Change Advisory Council hat for an EPA hat.  I agree with the Deputy about targets for 2050.  We have a national policy position and we need to work backwards from that.  If we want an 80% reduction in electricity, we need to consider what needs to be done to achieve that.  Based on current projections relating to emissions, the EPA has identified that a reduction of about 800,000 tonnes per year would be needed if we are to achieve the desired levels by 2050.  I will not call it a target because it is something the EPA is seeking to do.</p> <p>  There are many ideas and plans as to how to achieve this.  There is a national mitigation plan that contains many ideas for what needs to be done and what needs to be prioritised.  There are also numerous joint Oireachtas committee reports already in existence, including a very recent one on agriculture that identified 35 different actions.  That is worthwhile considering.  There is a risk that there are many different plans.  There is a White Paper on energy which examines how our energy system should be decarbonised.  There are many different plans and papers there.  It is a question of pulling all the disparate plans together in order that there is one national approach, and that should be the aspiration for the national energy and climate plan.</p> <p>  There is also a need for clarity.  Different sectors have a role and a responsibility in identifying what they are going to do about mitigation and adaptation.  This comes back to not abdicating responsibility and seeking to place it on somebody else.  The sectors in question are responsible for looking at their activities between now and 2020, 2030 or 2050 and, as part of their role, identifying what they are going to do to mitigate their impact on climate.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine does a substantial amount of work in afforestation - different types of forestry and considerations regarding carbon abatement and storage.  I would be looking to the Department to state which type of forestry is required where.  Over the past ten years, the EPA has committed &euro;26 million in State funding to conducting research, with the money coming from either the Exchequer or, at times, the environment fund.  That can be research on things like land use and there are reports looking at opportunities and mitigation.  There is research that can support this committee but I am conscious that there is only so much the members can take.</p> <p>  The EPA makes predictions and its projections work.  There is a short summary report on the website which - in the context of every sector - indicates what the EPA thinks the issues will be as far as 2035 and where the growth is.  It is not modelling.  There is a multi-departmental technical group - the technical research and modelling group, TRAM - which is looking at modelling and making predictions for the future of the State.  It will be interesting to hear more from that group on what it is doing.</p></speech>

More forestry and more biomass constitute part of the answer.  I published research I carried out with Teagasc and ESB International 20 years ago.  What became clear to me was that one can work out in theory that more trees means more biomass but making it happen, from a farmer's point of view, is something else.  It goes back to what I said about behaviour.</p><p>We must get the price right but even if the price is right, things will not happen so it is about finding out the obstacles to the owners of the land making the necessary change.  A very interesting article by Jasmina Behan, the head of the Government's economic service, talks about some of the obstacles facing farmers in shifting.  That is where a significant amount of work is needed.  How can we make it profitable or attractive for the owners of the land to change its use in a way that is consistent with climate change?</p></speech>

Professor FitzGerald's role is to advise on policy, not to sell the policy, but if we reverse the roles for the purposes of conversation or argument, how can he sell what he has given us this morning, particularly regarding CO2?  If we use Mrs. Murphy in Mayo as an example, Professor FitzGerald started off brilliantly.  If she is tuned in, she will save so much money into the future.  He then swiftly moved along to the fact that the Government is going to introduce a carbon tax immediately, which Mrs. Murphy will most likely end up paying if she is burning fossil fuels, before she gets a chance to retrofit her house.  She is then told that it will cost her between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 to do so.  If she was a dragon in "Dragons' Den", she would be out at this stage.  How do we sell this?  The cart is before the horse to a certain extent and the circle is not squared.  It needs to be squared.  Irrespective of what decisions are made by this committee or any other committees or Departments, at the end of the day, we must bring the people with us.  How do we sell that to the people and square the circle?  How do we reach a scenario where Mrs. Murphy is still prepared to invest in such a project even though it will be a long time before she gets her money back - possibly not in her lifetime?  If she is selfish, as we can all be sometimes, and says that she only needs this climate or world for a maximum of 20 or 30 years and will let somebody else worry about it, how do we change this because that attitude is out there?</p> <p>  The main focus of the presentation is on increasing carbon tax.  It almost comes across as if this will solve everything.  As was highlighted here last week and using diesel as an example, regardless of the rise in carbon tax, it only takes a very small fluctuation in the ratio between the dollar and the euro or a minor reduction in the price of a barrel of oil or both for carbon tax to be neutral when it comes to the net cost to the user.  Consequently, the incentive will be gone in certain scenarios.  How do we legislate for that?  More money will be coming into the Exchequer but there will be no incentive for the end user to change their habits.  We have seen the price of diesel fluctuating at the pumps and going down to as low as &euro;0.90 a year to 18 months ago. It is now up to &euro;1.30 but in the example I have given, there is nothing to say that were we to apply the carbon tax to bring up the price to &euro;1.35, it would not fall back down to &euro;0.95 again.  How does that work?  How does that incentivise anybody?  The witnesses will say that it could go the other way.  I am basically asking them how we can sell this.  I know that selling it is our job but I would like to hear their opinion in this regard.  </p> <p>  If it sounds like I am defending agriculture, it is because I am.  After two meetings, we seem to be going down a road that is very focused on agriculture.  Rather than almost being critical, we could look at and learn a lot from where agriculture has been and where it has come.  It is a fact that from 1990 to 2016, CO2 emissions in agriculture reduced by 3.5% while production increased by 40% in the same period.  This was not done through taxation but through incentives such as grants for farm buildings and the REP scheme.  We must look at incentives far more stringently than taxation.  This has been proven.  Agriculture is drifting at present because production has increased again, the caps have lifted or quotas have been done away with but during the period from 1990 to 2016, transport emissions increased by something like 139% while those from energy production increased by 116%.  If we are talking about changing land use to sequester carbon that is being abused in other sectors, it is really taking the whip out to hammer agriculture.  We still will need to eat and we still will need to increase food production by 50% before 2050 based on the rise in population.</p><p>We are also running the risk.  This is our remit, as I stated last week.  We have to think of the Irish situation here.  If we sow trees on all our land, stop producing milk - we produce the lowest CO2 emissions per kilogramme of milk in Europe - and get our house in order, the milk will have to be produced far less efficiently somewhere else and that methane cloud will not remain over the country where it is emitted.  This is a global issue and we must be cognisant of the overall picture.</p></speech>

That is Senator Paul Daly's career.  It is the Senator's job to sell.  When I took on this job, I was not going to go out and sell.  Our job is to provide advice.  However, having worked in the research area for 30 years, I would say the Senator is quite right that we need to explain to the wider public the nature of the research and the nature of the task.  Essentially, we must try to do that.</p> <p>  I picked the example of a mythical Mrs. Murphy.  One must be able to say to somebody, as I have done, that it is very disruptive to one's life but that it will actually save him or her money.  It will not save a person money unless the carbon tax is there.  The carbon tax has to come first and then one can say to people that they can save money.  If one says to people to do it now and that the Oireachtas will introduce a carbon tax in ten years' time and they will save money then, for somebody of my age that will not make a difference.  One has got to say that it will make a difference today.</p> <p>  I had a grand-aunt who was badly off but who was left a small amount of money in 1920.  She decided to go to Cambridge to read economics.  She put herself through Cambridge and graduated in 1923.  She did not get a degree, because they did not give degrees to women in Cambridge until after the war, but I have her very good notes on the lectures from Professor Pigou, a famous economist, which were delivered in October and November 1922.  One hundred years ago, the answer was one taxes pollution if one wants people to change.  It is the same today.  We have a problem with climate deniers and the science on how one makes people change in economics is unanimous.  One must begin with a carbon tax but, as I explained, it is only a beginning.  If it is not there, nobody will change.  One will be much less effective unless one brings in other policies.  In the case of Mrs. Murphy, she will need a lot of help in changing through other schemes.</p> <p>  On the point the Senator made on transport, that is why I said &euro;30 a tonne in the next budget.  Somebody who the committee will hear from next week may advise making it much bigger.  I would be happy if we did more but I am looking at it in terms of deliverables.  If we went to &euro;80 a tonne, which would make a different in transport - it would give a big push to electric cars immediately - it would make a substantial difference to the cost of motoring but my guess is that one would find that very difficult to do.  That is why we say &euro;30 a tonne.  We need a much higher price to reflect the damage that we are doing.</p> <p>  In terms of what was referred to as incentives rather than sticks, the problem is that the money has to be raised and we are talking about a lot of money being spent.  In terms of social housing, I said the bill could be &euro;5 billion for social housing.  It is the landlord's job to spend it and the Government will have to raise the money somewhere else.  Going back to Pigou, unless one uses sticks as well as carrots, one is going nowhere.  The State will not be able to finance the change.  Saying to everybody in Ireland that they will pay for their houses and their electric cars by not raising any taxes on them is not sustainable.  As would be asked in the Department of Finance, where I worked for 12 years at the beginning of my career and which, like the Jesuits, gets one at a young and impressionable age and has one for life, "Where is the money going to come from?"</p> <p>  On agriculture and milk, I am feeling my way.  We will discuss this over the autumn.  Is there a solution for agriculture?  Agriculture will have to make major changes but given that milk seems to be most profitable for farmers, can we find a model which is consistent with decarbonising Ireland which leaves farmers doing what is profitable - we have seen a substantial increase in milk production - but which makes other changes which will offset that in areas in which farmers are not making much money?</p><p>Is there such a model?  I am not saying there is, but there may be a way of doing this.  Agriculture changes.  There may be a model out of which farmers will do reasonably well and out of which climate will do very well.  I do not have the plan but it is hoped that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will come up with it.</p></speech>

He put a great deal of emphasis on carbon tax in Ireland and on carbon pricing under the emissions trading scheme.  He advocated an increase in carbon tax to reflect the costs of climate change.  As we are in the second week of our journey towards finding realistic solutions to implement on climate action, can Professor FitzGerald explain the data upon which his view of the cost of climate change is predicated?  I am not just mean national figures relating to the tonnage of carbon or greenhouse gases we are emitting, but data in the international sense.  The figures we are coming up with require every country in the world to take similar steps.  To what extent are certain countries not being required to take these steps?  I am looking for something tangible.  People are watching this and we are talking about tonnage and so on.  I count myself among those who might be ignorant of these issues but I would like to know how the council is arriving at these figures and how Professor FitzGerald puts a value on the price of climate change in an international context, not just a national context.  Are they just comparing us to our European partners?</p> <p>  He stated that we should shift from taxes on labour to taxes on carbon and that there is research which shows that this is the way to go.  To what in particular is he referring?  What will that look like?  Last week, ESRI representatives appeared before the committee.  They told us that imposing carbon taxes on business will not affect exports, which does not make sense to me.  Many people asked questions last week and, as far as I was concerned, that was not dealt with or answered sufficiently.  We are looking at being competitive and at all the costs for businesses that feed into that.  How can that not ultimately affect exports?  </p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald also said that he served on Northern Ireland's committee on electricity.  Was that the single electricity market committee or something similar?</p></speech>

We are looking at introducing a new support scheme for renewables to contribute towards achieving our targets.  Could Professor FitzGerald please outline the technologies he would prefer to see us supporting?  Onshore wind is being given priority at the moment.  Can he speak to the cost-benefit analysis of that technology as compared to other renewables such as offshore wind, biomass, anaerobic digestion and so on?  He might deal with them individually.  He might also deal with solar energy and what that can bring to the table.</p> <p>  As we have tried to achieve change over the past number of years, we have often talked at a high level but nothing has ever filtered down into action or into progress towards addressing issues.  With regard to offshore wind energy, is there a problem with the planning system?  We do not have a planning regime for people who want to develop this renewable resource.  We do not have a planning authority similar to the county council or to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to which such people can go.  Is that not an issue?  </p> <p>  I am from County Mayo, which has great renewable resources, including wind, wave and so on.  Eirgrid's plans do not include the development of transmission infrastructure beyond Bellacorick where the old peat-fired power station is located, yet there is a test site for wave energy off the coast of Belmullet.</p><p>Would this not need to be a priority if we are going to consider wind energy?</p><p> Before briefly mentioning farming, I wish to talk about roads.  The Citizens' Assembly is advocating two thirds public transport and one third road transport.  As an economist who provides advice, would Professor FitzGerald accept that there are areas which never experienced major road investment, for example, major interurban routes such as the west and north west, although there are at least some plans there now to do so?  A Bus &Eacute;ireann bus can be put on a road but we need the roads to facilitate our economic growth if they are going to be considering anything like this.  When the Green Party was in government with Fianna F&aacute;il, it put the emphasis back on public transport, but we still have a deficit on roads.  There should be nuanced thinking in areas that need to be developed when we are developing these policies and they will need more support to be self-sustaining.  I am talking not just from the environmental point of view but also from the people point of view if we are to create jobs and investment in areas.</p></speech>

I know that for the purpose of debate we talk in generalities.  Other than at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine where we prepared that report, the impression is often that farmers can be collateral damage regarding the efforts we make.  I feel that was the impression the Citizens' Assembly gave to agriculture in its recommendation.  I do not accept this as somebody who comes from that region and sees the significance that farming has to rural areas.  We can talk about dairy, but if beef is taken out of the equation at one sweep, it would close down the west and north west.</p> <p>  The witnesses alluded to forestry.  I do not consider it a community where people are looking out at trees, and this is a problem.  I know there are competing interests.  As other colleagues here have done, I would also like to highlight the real issues of ordinary people on the ground.</p> <p>  We have targets for Food Wise 2025.  We are selling food into 180 countries.  If these beef farmers, who seem to be a problem for so many people, are removed from the equation, it will not be just the farmers who are gone.  They supply to people finishing the beef and the whole food industry.  What the Climate Change Advisory Council is proposing is massive.</p> <p>  I agree that we need to try to improve the situation, as do farmers and the farming organisations.  At the end of the day, when we talk about decarbonisation of society, we still have to eat, so why not have Ireland become the carbon-efficient people?  If this idea is taken to the extreme, we would all become vegans.  Where is the choice in all this?  Where is the reality in all this?  It does not match with what I see.  I would be in favour of innovation, thinking outside the box and all the rest.  Much of the conversation seems to be at an academic level.</p> <p>  In my area there have been objections to wind farms, transmission and everything else.  I have never seen the people, who are telling us that we need all of this, at a public meeting advocating why we need this infrastructure etc.  The people on ground and their public representatives are trying to advance the cause of their areas and also help people deal with the fallout of being asked to cater for infrastructure.  Everybody is an expert at the round table but when they go on the ground, they are not listening to the ordinary person and the ordinary communities who are being asked to facilitate infrastructure.  As the witness said, the margins for farmers are so small because they are so regulated in everything they do.  As Senator Paul Daly said, they are taking great steps towards reducing carbon emissions.  While farmers and the farming organisations must step up to the plate, if we want to bring them with us we need to acknowledge what they are doing.</p></speech>

If we do not do so, we can give up.</p><p> On switching from taxes on labour to taxes on carbon, I published a series of papers dealing with Ireland.  I published the first of them in 1992 and the story is the same in 2018, namely, if one taxes labour, it raises the cost for employers who employ fewer people, whereas if one reduces taxes on labour, more people are employed.  If one raises taxes on carbon, it reduces the amount of carbon emitted.  It goes back to what Pigou said in October 1922.  It does not just apply to Ireland.  If one looks at the research from prominent economists in the United States, the Netherlands and Britain, it is accepted across the economics literature.  Will carbon taxes affect exports?  Yes, they will.  However, if our competitors are other countries within the European Union and they do it at the same time - for example, Sweden has made much bigger strides than we have - the research which specifically looked at this issue has found that there will be a small effect on exports, but it is the cheapest way if we want to do something about climate change, although, of course, as a society, we may not want to do so.</p><p> On the support scheme for renewable technologies and the point about the carbon price floor which we have suggested, there is a competitiveness issue in that regard.  If we were to do it as a coalition of countries within the European Union, electricity prices would go up by a bit, probably by less than what we pay in the public service obligation levy, but it would make renewables profitable.  The research we have carried out suggests the carbon price floor which would be enough to produce a dramatic change in emissions from electricity generation in Ireland would add about &euro;200 million to bills.  However, because the price went up and we were not able to take account of this, renewables would be much more profitable and what we pay in the PSO levy - over &euro;200 million; it was perhaps &euro;400 million last year - would actually come down and there might as a result be a net gain for people.</p><p> On the different technologies used, in 1992 there was a conference on wind energy organised by the ESB, at which I said: "It is very expensive.  Don't invest in it now."  Former Taoiseach Charles Haughey who was chairing the conference said: "Typical economist.  No vision."  I was right, although he is not around for me to tell him.  We have delivered a lot in a way that saves the people of Ireland money.  One can move to use a technology too soon, at a time when it is very expensive.  I had thought that use of solar energy was for the birds - perhaps not for the birds exactly - but it is interesting that it is now coming down in price rapidly in parts of the world where there is a lot of sunshine; it is competitive and the cheapest way of producing electricity.  The problem lies in its intermittency.</p><p> There are various technologies that could be used.  There is onshore and offshore wind energy.  Solar energy is still expensive, but the cost is coming down fast.  We may well, therefore, see solar energy being part of the mix.  </p><p> On wave energy, there is a very important paper by Dr. Eleanor Denny of Trinity College Dublin which shows that one would never invest in tidal energy production owing to a technical issue.  For example, the tide in Strangford Lough flows out very fast for a short period midway between high and low tide and for a lot of the time it is not flowing at all, whereas in the case of wind energy, on average, it flows 30% of the time.  While they are both intermittent, tidal energy is utterly predictable.  Dr. Denny came to the conclusion that unless the cost of tidal turbines was much lower than onshore wind energy, one would not do it.  Wave energy production is possible, but it would also be intermittent and at the moment is incredibly expensive; therefore, it seems unlikely that it will ever be part of the solution for Ireland.  As it could be part of the solution elsewhere in the world, it is something to be researched, but it is not going to be part of the solution for Ireland in the next decade or 20 years.</p><p> On biomass, the study we produced in 1995 showed that it was expensive.  I have twice visited the farm in Derry of Mr. John Gilliland, former president of the Ulster Farmers Union.</p><p>He switched from growing grain to growing pollard willow.  He actually made money out of the latter and was selling his woodchips to the Bogside community centre.  Biomass used in heating, probably in rural areas or hotels and so on, may well be the way to go.  I do not know.  I am not an expert in this area and I have probably gone on for too long about it.</p><p> Roads versus public transport is an issue to look at project by project.  Is a certain project justified?  As for completion of the road to Mayo - is it the N4? - the stretch to Roscommon is truly awful, and the return from the completion of that stretch would undoubtedly pay off.  Public transport, specifically the deregulation of buses, is much more an urban issue.  Going to Galway, people are much faster taking the train, and the emissions will still be significant until the buses are decarbonised.  Our first recommendation in the NDP was that Government needs to reflect appropriately the issue of climate change in its criteria for investment decision-making, which it was not doing, but in the national mitigation plan it announced it would change the methodology.  If this is incorporated in the methodology, it may be that we will spend more on public transport than on roads, but I do not know what the appropriate split is, whether two thirds, one third etc.  One must factor in the cost of climate change and the fact that people must get from Mayo to Dublin to the Seanad and come up with the right answer.  I do not have an ideological answer to this.  It is project by project.</p><p> Forestry-----</p></speech>

If it did not, it would not be an appropriate methodology.</p> <p>  I will make a final point and then I think Ms Burke will say something about agriculture in her reply.  On forestry, a very interesting study was done 30 years ago, I think, by Bob O'Connor, then deputy director of the ESRI, since deceased, and Brendan Kearney, then of Teagasc, which showed that if one switched from cattle to forestry - I am not saying forestry is the answer; it could be something else - employment in rural areas would actually be higher, not lower, in the medium term, which is interesting.  Paid employment is important in the development of communities in rural areas, so I urge members not to write forestry off.</p></speech>

That is a very important point.  Yes, we are doing more in Europe than in many other parts of the world.  Parts of the United States are doing more than we are doing, in spite of Donald Trump - California, for example.  We are laggards compared with some US states.  In the long term, if we are to decarbonise the world, which we must do if we are to affect climate change, we should not expect Africa to start spending huge sums of money because this will not happen.  However, we need Africa to decarbonise.  The way this will happen is that we will raise the price of carbon in the developed world in order that it pays to develop technologies like wind, solar and electric cars and they become the cheap technology.  Already in Chile, for example, they are deploying without subsidy a large amount of solar because the price has come down so much.  In India, regarding the outturn in terms of investment in coal-fired power generation, which is incredibly dirty, they have invested much less in the past two or three years because solar has come down so much in price.  The development of solar has been driven by the higher prices and the expectation of higher prices in Europe, Japan and elsewhere.  Therefore, we must, through the price of carbon, incentivise the world to develop carbon-free technologies in order that they become the cheap answer for the rest of the world, that is, the poor part of the world.  Otherwise, this planet is going to cook.</p></speech>

This is very common.  We do not need research on the technology but we need to look at the barriers to implementation.  The EPA has carried out research in respect of the initial upfront capital costs.  None of this should be discounted.</p><p> Senators Paul Daly and Mulherin mentioned the carrot-and-stick approach in agriculture.  The EPA has a wide range of roles.  We have a regulatory role regarding intensive agriculture and we have worked very closely with the IFA in recent years in terms of focusing on behavioural change.  In our regulatory role, we need to ensure compliance and that various organisations do not cause environmental damage.  However, we must also think about incentives and working with the 130,000 farms throughout the country in order that they will be more resource efficient.  This would be a win-win situation through the money the farms would save, as Professor Fitzgerald has already alluded to, and through the environmental benefit.  We have been working with the IFA for a number of years on this.  The relevant programme has been very successful programme and involves peers talking to peers, with farmers talking to farmers.  It is not the EPA or some other entity instructing people what to do.  Farms volunteer to do various tests and they then speak to their neighbours and their communities to tell them that by doing certain actions, on which the EPA, Teagasc or other bodies have advised, they have saved money and helped the environment.  This programme supports and works with people rather than talks to them, which is important.</p><p> The EPA has a regulatory role over intensive agriculture.  Recognising the points made by Senator Paul Daly, we have a priority site list for enforcement.  We enforce just under 800 industrial licences, including for intensive agriculture.  Disappointingly, the food and drink sector is high up on the priority site list for non-compliance with licence requirements.  This is not about going above and beyond.  It is about the industry causing nuisance through odour, noise and environmental damage.  We cannot say that we are clean and green - and sell to other countries throughout the world on this basis - while not being in basic compliance with these requirements.  I hear what members have said about some of the work in the agricultural sector but there is an awful lot more to be done.</p><p> We have tracked greenhouse gas inventories since 1990.  There were reductions but we are now seeing an increase in the sector year on year and this is very much linked to livestock numbers.  When numbers decreased, emissions also decreased.  With livestock numbers increasing, however, emissions are also increasing.  We will have to have a discussion on what carbon neutrality means.  There has to be encouragement and support but we also need to recognise that the sector has a responsibility to comply with environmental requirements.  We need a combination of all of these factors.</p></speech>

From listening to Professor FitzGerald in particular, the communication strategy on this is essential.  We are creating a rural-urban divide, which I can see increasing.  The agricultural sector is our largest indigenous industry and it gives employment to approximately 300,000 people.  Professor FitzGerald suggested that a carbon tax is the only way forward.  There has to be a balance between the carrot and the stick and we have to get that balance right.</p><p>If there is more of one than the other, there will be serious difficulties.</p><p> Professor FitzGerald mentioned the forestry issue as well as suckler farmers in, for example, the west.  Ireland is a small but diverse country, and some parts of it are able to do some things better than others.  There has been much talk in recent weeks, particularly last week, of the demise of rural Ireland.  We are closing post offices, there are no school buses for kids, etc.  That line is rattled out day in and day out.  If we were to have a carbon tax and eliminate an entire sector of agriculture, for example, the suckler sector, it would put the final nail in rural Ireland's coffin.  As Senator Mulherin mentioned, there is a substantial number of suckler farmers in the west compared with the east.  If we apply a significant carbon tax on them without analysing the potential consequences, then instead of looking out her window at trees, Senator Mulherin will only see a barren place in the years to come.</p><p> I was delighted to chair the committee that launched a report on the forestry issue.  We put a great deal of effort into our report.  This committee should analyse that report from the point of view of agriculture.  It contains some good elements.  Even though the agriculture sector has made many good changes, there is undoubtedly much more to do.  The sector, particularly the farming organisations, realise and accept that.</p><p> Turning back to the suckler industry, one of the main initiatives of recent years has been the beef data genomics scheme.  It was the first such scheme in Europe, and it may have beneficial consequences for the future that even many farmers do not realise.</p><p> We must be careful that the communication strategy is right going forward and that there is a balance between carrot and stick.  It is important that we not encourage the urban-rural divide that seems to be developing and is not good for our country and society in general.</p><p> Forestry has a large part to play and its incentivisation has to be key.  Since the abolition of milk quotas in recent years, we have seen the development of more large dairy farms in the east and south particularly.  What about having an incentive for intensive farmers to grow a certain number of trees?  One of the witnesses might be able to enlighten me about something I heard.  If every farmer in the country grew 50 more trees, it would solve many of our problems.  The witnesses might correct me if I am wrong, but I heard that figure cited somewhere.  I might not be 100% right.  It would not solve all of the problems for the agriculture sector, but it would be helpful.  Incentivisation of the forestry sector in areas where there is intensive livestock farming could be beneficial.</p><p> Much could be done in the tillage sector.  While working on our report, we received a presentation from the BASE Ireland farmers' group.  It discussed how tillage farming could be done without using extra amounts of fertiliser or chemicals or having to plough the land using extra machinery.  In its presentation, it showed that, financially speaking, an extra livestock unit or man hour could be saved in this way.  We would be reeling in the years to what was done previously.  This would not be reinventing the wheel, but doing the work more efficiently.</p><p> The agriculture sector has a large part to play, and it should not be forgotten that it has done much already.</p></speech>

Agriculture is lower in terms of priorities.  Dealing with the problem of carbon dioxide is the top priority.  </p><p> In terms of agriculture, I take Deputy Deering's point on the need for a carrot and stick approach.  What is interesting in the research that I have seen on changes in land use is that it is not the carrots and sticks but other problems that farmers face in changing land use, such that the policies needed in this area will be different from those needed elsewhere.  There will have to be some sticks.  We have not suggested a methane tax on the herd.  This would not be where I would begin, and I am not sure this is where I would end either.</p></speech>

That is an open issue.  For example, the paper by Jasmina Behan showed that the problem for farmers in committing to turnover their land to forestry is that they can never go back.  They would never be able to get the stumps out and have the pasture back.  The move is irreversible.  Another problem is that farmers are nervous that if there is only one buyer they will get screwed.  We need a market.  These are the types of issues arising.  If we are to achieve a big change in land use, which might make farmers more money, we will need to talk to the farming community about how it could be achieved and the real obstacles.  Carrots and sticks may not be the most important thing in this area.  It is work in progress for us and it ought to be work in progress for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have not reached any conclusions on this.  </p> <p>  The Deputy's point regarding the need for balance in terms of carrots and sticks is important.</p></speech>

I am from Dublin but I have been living in the countryside for the last 14 years.  It is very different in terms of public transport and in many other areas and this needs to be recognised.  When one finds oneself giving out about Dubs, etc., one knows one has gone native and there is no going back.</p> <p>  On the numbers, emissions from agriculture are now 2.4% below what they were in 1990.  The numbers overall of dairy and non-dairy cattle are similar to what they were in 1990.  Sheep numbers have halved.  Emissions have increased in four out of the last five years.  I would be very surprised if they do not increase again, which is the warning signal from us.  As I said, emissions increased in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  This is data to support policy.  We are not the policymakers.  What we are seeing is that the fluctuations in agriculture emissions are underpinned by higher animal numbers.</p></speech>

The ambition of Food Harvest 2025 is to have sustainable intensification.  There was discussion about no net increase because of other factors such as beef, as mentioned by Professor FitzGerald.  On the ground, the evidence is that emissions are increasing.</p> <p>  On what can happen, it comes back to behaviour, as mentioned by Professor FitzGerald.</p><p>A marginal abatement cost curve developed by Teagasc looks at actions that can be taken at low cost and no cost.  The question that arises is why these actions are not being taken already if they lead to a cost saving.  We then get into behavioural change which leads me back to smart farming and so forth.  We in the Environmental Protection Agency and other bodies can say what should happen from an ivory tower, but we need to engage with communities on the ground and find out what the barriers are.  Some of these barriers were alluded to in the context of forestry.  That is the evidence we are seeing.</p></speech>

It is apparent that Departments are not working interdependently or cross-sectorally on climate change.  If an independent body was set up, as recommended by the assembly, it would have longevity unlike Governments, which change.  Why does the advisory council believe it may not be necessary to have an independent body?  Given the scale and urgency of the problem we face, is it not better to have a properly resourced independent body with teeth to go after the Departments?  The witnesses indicated that was not the remit of the advisory council.  The independent body would be charged with putting pressure on Departments to create some coherency because policy at the moment is all over the place.  Departments are not working together.  We need a body tasked with ensuring we have a long-term pathway rather than dealing only with short-term problems.  In addition, the body would have the teeth to go after Departments to make sure they deliver.</p></speech>

In my view, the Oireachtas is the teeth and, failing that, the Judiciary is the teeth.  I would not be happy to hand over to a separate body the responsibility the Oireachtas has to bite the Government.  Constitutional law is not my area but what would this body do?  Would it lock up Ministers or Oireachtas Members for not delivering a carbon tax?  That would not be democracy.</p> <p>  I understand the frustration felt by the 100 citizens of the Citizens' Assembly about what was not happening but that frustration is not just about the Government.  The carbon tax cannot be implemented by the Government unless the Oireachtas supports it.  It needs the support not only of the governing parties but also of others in the Oireachtas.  What does Senator O'Sullivan want this proposed new body to do?  The Oireachtas is extremely important and if we are to make progress, its work will also be important.  We play a minor role in advising the Government.  It is for the Oireachtas to make Departments work properly and to hold them and Ministers to account.  It is not clear that setting up an independent watchdog body is feasible.  That is my personal view as opposed to the view of the advisory council.</p></speech>

In a way it comes back to my first comment on setting up a single Department for climate change.  To do so would put the issue "over there", as it were.  It may be a simple solution and sometimes simple solutions work.  However, as the question has been asked, I will give a personal view, which is not the view of the EPA.  I believe that having a Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, as we now do, along with these types of committees and the engagement of the various Departments may be more productive than having an independent body.</p><p>What would be its powers if a democratically elected Government decides something else is more important?  It is about trying to figure out what exactly this would look like versus the theory.  I am having a little difficulty seeing how it would work.  As I said, that may be teased out.</p></speech>

It is recommendation No. 1 so it is part of our remit.  I have a few other questions.  With regard to taxes, vulnerable members of the community may be on a lower income, so how would they be compensated?  Have the witnesses done any analysis on the impact of taxation on the vulnerable in society?</p> <p>  It is highly frustrating to be part of a committee like this; it is hard because there is so little coherence in policy and the position is so dire for the country because we are so far behind.  The national development plan and the national planning framework were subject to entirely inadequate strategic environmental assessment, and the process failed to qualify the effect of proposed polices and investment on emissions.  What is the view of the witnesses on how climate considerations should be factored into appraisals of projects in the national development plan?  Do the witnesses agree that quantified climate assessment of policy and decisions must be incorporated into the 2015 low carbon Act?</p></speech>

We should remember that many of the other policies we are implementing may also raise costs.  For example, the Government has quite rightly indicated it will close Moneypoint in 2025, and this will raise electricity prices.  Poorer households spend a higher share of their budget on electricity than richer households.  We should look at whether closing it by regulatory decision is the right answer, as it will mean gas-fired generators will make more money because the price will increase, or whether it would be better to have a carbon price floor in Ireland.  That would mean the price would go up but some of that increased price would go to the Government, which would have money to compensate the people who are adversely affected.  If there is no carbon tax, where will we find the revenue?  If there is a tax, it is more likely that those who are affected will be compensated than if there is regulatory action, where the rise in costs is hidden and not transparent.<br/><br/>There are other issues in making a difference.  On average, people in social housing tend to be among the least well-off in society.  If the State decided to spend &euro;3 billion, &euro;5 billion, &euro;7 billion or whatever it would be on upgrading social housing so people would spend pretty much nothing on heating because the properties would use sustainable sources, it would be a big gain for those households.  The long-term transfer for poorer households would be very substantial in that case.  Probably even more important would be the health effects.  I understand older people may have heating but they get nervous about spending money so they under-heat houses and end up with pneumonia or whatever.  If they do not need to spend the money, perhaps there would be health benefits.  It is not an issue for me; I am elderly but I heat my house and I do not have to worry about the cost.  There are policy changes we need that could improve the distribution of income rather than the opposite.</p><p> On the NDP and no coherence of policy, I share the Senator's frustration.  It is a rather technical issue, and I think Deputy Ryan referred to the work done in Cork.  We should spell out a pathway or pathways of where we are going to go so we can fit the policies in, which is what the Danes have done.  Then the Government can come up with a policy, which would allow us to say that is the difference it is going to make and measure it.  Such a situation would make it much easier for politicians.  It might be technical telling members the pathway but one could then bring in policymakers and ask them what they are doing to improve things.  Such a situation would be helpful. </p><p> In terms of the national development plan and factoring in climate considerations into appraisal, it is one of the few clear gains we have had in terms of recommendation.  We went to the Minister and said that the appraisal network framework for public investment does not take appropriate effect of climate change.  The Minister said that was a bad idea and he would talk to Paschal.  A fortnight later it was announced that the Government was going to revise the appraisal scheme because the scheme really must take climate change into account.  The problem is a discount rate is used, which is relatively high but probably appropriate for most things.  If one uses a high discount rate one would not do anything about climate change because the damage done today is significant but the damage done in 50 years' time, if we do nothing, will be massive.  That is an issue that the Government must deal with.</p><p> The price of carbon is another issue to be dealt with.  This is a spin-off of having the right price of carbon, which maybe should be between &euro;80 or &euro;100 a tonne, certainly by the end of the decade.  In its appraisal, the Government needs to not just put in the &euro;20 per tonne that we have today.  It needs to put in a price that reflects the huge damage done to the world by climate change.</p><p> The Government has not completed its revision of the appraisal but that would bring more coherence to the national development plan.  The Government has said that there is a lot of money available for climate change.  However, we want that money spent in the most cost effective way so that we produce the biggest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions for the sum of money that is there.  This is a work in progress.   </p><p> In response to the Senator's final question, I am a bit nervous about putting measures into the Act and then bringing judges in to decide.  I keep coming back to the role played by the Oireachtas.  I am not an expert in this area and I would not be ideological.  Is Ms Burke ideological? </p></speech>

What strikes me, in the context of all of these things, and we had the discussion on transport previously, is that the issue tends to come back to money and costings.  We have had recommendations in previous reports on transport moving away from buses in Dublin using diesel because there would be a co-benefit in air quality.  There is a leadership piece there as well as the climate piece.  If one is given a certain amount of money and one can buy so many buses that use diesel or a lesser number that are electric or hybrid vehicles then it makes decisions much more difficult.  I agree with the Senator in the context of actual purchases and projects.  One needs to bring in externalities.  One also needs to be costing for win-wins but it does come to Department of Finance appraisals.</p></speech>

Research done by the ESRI  showed that the third level sector - this was done about 15 years ago - that  universities had done a reasonable job of trying to improve their energy efficiency but the institutes of technology had done a lousy job.  Why?  The Department of Education and Skills controlled their budget.  They did not have a capital budget and unless they saved the full cost of the energy efficiency investment within the one year they were not allowed to proceed.</p> <p>  Twenty years ago the headmaster of the school that my children attended sent me the school's electricity bill for two years.  He had halved the bills because he had found a mechanism for hiding the money from the Department of Education and Skills and used the money to make furniture for the school.  Therefore, how we assess the capital budget is really important.  The State needs to spend, and has allocated in the NDP, a lot of money but spending money efficiently is essential.</p></speech>

It has been a very informative and engaging session.  I was struck by the reference to whether we should have a single statutory authority with teeth.  Has the council considered proposing a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach to tackling climate change?  I am very <i>au fait</i>with the Healthy Ireland agenda which has taken that exact approach, whereby every Department must have Healthy Ireland policies in place.  It goes from the Taoiseach's office across all Departments, through to the local authorities and into the local communities.  It then filters out through sports clubs and all sorts of organisations.  As it appears to be a good approach, is that something the council has recommended to the Government as part of its advisory role?</p><p>I was also thinking about how to get the message out about climate change.  I have highlighted the important role Met &Eacute;ireann has in this, and in its strategic plan it refers to its responsibilities and goals for getting information to the public on climate action.  Would the council recommend that Met &Eacute;ireann play an important role?  Some other meteorological services internationally have taken innovative approaches to getting messages to citizens on this issue, be it through animated YouTube videos or through their own broadcasting services for weather reports.</p><p>Professor FitzGerald spoke about the fictitious Mrs. Murphy and we can all probably visualise such a Mrs. Murphy.  I am familiar with the work the Tipperary Energy Agency does.  Is that a model that could be replicated to reach the Mrs. Murphys of the country in respect of linking with the local community through the local authority and so forth?</p><p>With regard to forestry, the biggest landowners in the country are Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na in terms of the amount of land that is available in that regard.  Would the council recommend that they plant a significant amount of the area they hold with broadleaf trees?  That would be a shift for Coillte because although it has some broadleaf it primarily has coniferous plantations.  Bord na M&oacute;na was mentioned earlier.  There is a significant shift in its strategic plans around moving away from peat.  Being from County Offaly I am familiar with this and with the challenges that exist in terms of communities transitioning and coping with the massive loss of employment that has already occurred, not to mention what will occur in the future.  They are coping but, as others have mentioned, they need help in doing so.</p><p>As regards what will replace the peat, there were references earlier to agriculture.  Many in the farming community are open to making changes.  If there are attractive schemes in place many of them are happy to try them, but the problem arises when they do not work.  Miscanthus is an example.  Many people in my area and in other areas across the country went along with planting miscanthus only to find that they had no market for it.  The company that was to buy it from them suddenly realised that it was not suitable and left all those people, who were happy to make that transition, with a product they could not sell.  This was a big issue.  Has the council made recommendations on what is suitable biomass?  There is not much point in peat-fired stations shifting to biomass if the biomass they will use is not coming from within this island but is being brought in from India or elsewhere.  That would be ridiculous.  It is not the direction we should take.</p><p>I believe anaerobic digestion has been hugely underutilised.  However, where there have been proposals to move to anaerobic digestion in some areas, whether it is a farmer who wants to do it for his own use or for the wider community, there are immediate objections to it because people do not understand.  This brings me to the original point about communications on this.  We have failed massively to communicate with the citizen about what is happening.</p><p>I think we have left the door open for climate change deniers to step right in and create all this uncertainty around renewables and so on.  That is an absolute disaster, for which we as public representatives and policy makers have to take the blame. </p><p> I wish to ask about the reform of the EU emissions trading system, ETS.  Professor FitzGerald referred to the doubts about the success of the reform of the ETS and I would like him to expand on that.</p></speech>

My colleague, Professor Edgar Morgenroth and I had the job of helping to develop the Structural Funds plans for Ireland over a period.  That involved co-ordination across Departments.  Professor Morgenroth also did the same work for the German Government on the East German plan.  He found it very interesting that in Ireland there was no structure for co-ordination but seven or eight people came into the room and it worked very well, whereas in Germany, one had 80 people in the room who had never met each other but they had a structure for doing it.  I think we are getting bigger and a structure for co-ordination across Departments will be an issue.  The technical research and modelling group, TRAM, does I understand perform this role but we can see evidence that it is not working perfectly.  I think the administration needs to do a better job - things that could happen in fact do not happen.  I have no great ideas on how to do that.<br/><br/>I will now respond to how we can get the message across.  I was watching BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; a couple of weeks ago when they had a representative from the Met Office and somebody else who for 15 minutes discussed the problem of climate change and how to deal with it.  This was informing the wider public on climate change.  In Ireland we tend to put on a television discussion programme with a representative who is a denier of and somebody who acknowledges climate change rather than a programme that explains the issues to people.  <br/><br/>In a newspaper article in <i>The Guardian</i>last Friday, the head of the BBC talked about the need to look at the model of balance, and that balance is provided by two people fighting, when climate science has the answer.  There is no doubt about that.  How we communicate the message is the issue.  The expertise in Met &Eacute;ireann is very important.  We need all the help we can get in communicating the message.<br/><br/>The experience in Tipperary was raised.  I talked to somebody last week who had a big job done on his house and had a great experience with an agency in Tipperary.  A model that works is where the system is rolled out following experiment.  The system in Tipperary works because there are good people involved.  One needs good people elsewhere so one cannot suddenly go global.  Let us build on the good examples we have.<br/><br/>There was a suggestion that Bord na M&oacute;na would plant broadleaf trees.  When I walk the mountains I find the spruce plantations boring and would prefer to see more variety but that is not an environmental assessment.  Bogland is a big issue in terms of sucking carbon out of the atmosphere, but I am told and I have read it in the <i>Financial Times </i>that the British are considering re-wetting the wetlands.  The answer may be not to plant trees but to wet the wetlands again.  I do not know.  This is a scientific issue.  We need to do work on how we can make best use of this resource.  A best use that provides alternative employment would be a win-win.<br/><br/>The EU has implemented a major reform of the emissions trading system, EMS.  It is highly constrained because of the Polish Government and to a lesser extent the German Government obstructing progress in this area.  Poland has significant coal mines and the coal miners have a similar view to President Trump on coal.  Basically the EU proposes to take permits away which hopefully will raise the price of coal.  The research done by our Danish colleagues suggests that it will not produce a decent price for carbon, although it is &euro;20 a tonne today, which is a significant rise with the prospect of this reform.  Also Thomson Reuters at a conference in UCC reached a similar conclusion that this would not do enough.  Our concern is that we, the Climate Change Advisory Council are recommending that we electrify transport and we electrify heating as the solution but if we do not have in place a system across Europe, an ETS which will decarbonise electricity, we will have locked into the wrong answer.</p><p>We are very concerned about it.  As a backstop we are recommending a carbon price floor for as many countries as will adopt it, which is a backstop because if the ETS works, it becomes irrelevant.  If the ETS price goes to &euro;80 a tonne by 2030, then the ETS will have worked and it becomes irrelevant.  The research I have seen suggests that it will be under &euro;30 a tonne, which will be way too low.  In that case coal will not close in Europe, Moneypoint will not close and we may be importing electricity produced with coal.</p><p> We do not know for certain but it looks as is the EU trading system reform will not be enough and we need a backstop which will guarantee to us that we will decarbonise electricity in Europe over the next 20 to 30 years.  The research we have done suggests that a coalition of France, Netherlands, Scandinavia, Ireland and Britain would make a substantial difference.  One would see Moneypoint and peat close by at least 2025.  That would reduce our emissions by more 5 million tonnes.  One twelfth of our emissions would disappear because of that.  That is our best recommendation.</p></speech>

Has the council examined that report to see if the recommendations are something it would put to Government in terms of the council's advisory role?  Ms Burke also mentioned about emissions rising.  Does she have a breakdown of those?  She was answering a question on whether it was carbon, methane or whatever.</p> <p>  On making progress in the electrification of our motor vehicles, if I decide to change my car in the morning and want to buy an electric vehicle, I have to ask, living as I do in the foothills of the Slieve Bloom mountains is, how I am going to get to the D&aacute;il in an electric vehicle.  If I do get here, can I plug in the car outside in the car park?  No, I cannot.  If I am going to Tullamore to a county council meeting, can I plug it in over there?  I do not know if I can or not, but I probably cannot.</p> <p>  This comes back to the cross-departmental approach.  Whether it is new builds, existing buildings being retrofitted or public buildings, surely it must be part of building regulations that they would all have electric car chargers.  Is that something that the Climate Change Advisory Council has recommended to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?  I am not sure I am seeing them in new builds.  Whether these are in towns or housing estates or private developer estates, surely there must be standards in place.  If we do not lead by example in public buildings, how can we expect the citizen to follow?  Is that something the witnesses feel is important too?</p></speech>

The ESB has been deploying the charging points infrastructure, and it is regulated by the regulator which is under the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  If we are dealing with houses, it is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We need a plan.</p> <p>  I was talking to somebody who has an electric car and is leading by example.  He was going north and he ran out of juice halfway to Northern Ireland.  One charging point in the lay-by was not working.  He had to turn around and go back towards Dublin to the one charging point on the other side of the road, wait for it, and then do another loop to get back.</p> <p>  I looked at this issue and said that I would like to buy an electric car, but not unless it could get me to Kilcrohane in one charge, which is my test, and it could not.  I therefore bought a hybrid.  We need to deploy the infrastructure well in advance.  For people to adopt electric cars, they must know that when the range is there, it is going to work for them.</p><p>We have not seen that plan, which is one of the things we need.  We are going to tackle transport over the coming year.  The council has not expressed a detailed decision on this.  I anticipate that it will say what the Deputy is saying.</p></speech>

I do not have the figures off the top of my head to answer the question that was asked about carbon dioxide and methane.  We will send those figures to the committee.  I do not want to lead the committee astray.  I know we have the figures.  I cannot remember how they break down.</p> <p>  I agree with what the Deputy said about public buildings.  The EPA is in the midst of ensuring there will be a small number of charging points in each of its buildings by the end of the year.  We will then look at rolling out those facilities.  I recognise that we need to lead by example.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about how we communicate.  The EPA provides the secretariat to the national dialogue on climate action, which has just commenced.  This links in with one of the ancillary recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, which relates to engaging people on the challenges of climate change, including in a positive way.  We need to try to motivate changes in behaviour.  We are looking to create structures at local, regional and national levels to support the generation of bottom-up ideas, as well as their transition into actions.  Our first meeting in Athlone in July was attended by 125 people and had 75 participants from nine counties.  They were self-selecting.  We went through the public participatory networks of the councils and the local community professional bodies.  It is sometimes the case that the same groups of people who all know the issues talk to one another.  It is interesting that at the end of the meeting in Athlone, 70% of the participants felt that they had a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities.  I remind the committee that I am talking about a self-selecting group.  Some 70% of participants felt at the end of the meeting that they were more aware of the climate action initiatives that are happening in their region.  Some 90% of participants felt more inspired to take action.  It was great that 90% of them felt that they had a better understanding of the purpose of the dialogue.  Some 92% of them felt that the regional gathering enabled them to express their hopes, concerns and ideas.  I wanted to mention in the context of our discussion on communication and engagement that after one day, this group felt positively disposed to take action on the issue.  There will be four more dialogues across the country between now and early 2019.</p></speech>

Many different views on these issues are expressed when conversations take place around the dinner table.  We are a small island nation.  If the waters around us rise, our cities will be flooded.  Pretty soon after that, the water will come flowing up the River Shannon and out into the tributaries and we will all be underwater.  As Ireland has a population of just 6 million, we can only make certain changes.  As an island nation, we will be dreadfully affected by rising sea levels.  As a small nation, how should we communicate with bigger emitters, such as Russia and the USA, that are resisting efforts to accept that climate change is happening?  Should we use our massive diaspora to speak for us?  When I was talking to somebody about this issue the other day, that person said that Ireland is small and asked who would listen to us.  We have a massive diaspora.  Should we consider reaching out to the members of our diaspora to ask them to make the point that Ireland is a small country that will be significantly affected by this matter?  Some other island nations are already underwater.  This could happen to Ireland.  It might not happen in my generation, but it could certainly happen in the future, perhaps in my daughter's generation or my granddaughter's generation.  Is this something that the witnesses have looked at?  How can Ireland as a small nation go out there and make its point?</p> <p>  My other question relates to the work being done in the area of sustainability by local projects like Cloughjordan ecovillage in north Tipperary.  The district heating system in Cloughjordan is working very well.  It is a fantastic model for sustainability.  Local communities need to rely on and support one another to deal with the challenges we are facing.</p></speech>

We do not have a large diaspora in Russia or Saudi Arabia to make a difference and I am unsure that our diaspora in the United States, many of whom I suspect voted for President Trump, would offer support.  Australia should also be considered.  It is an interesting idea in terms of how we communicate.  Climate justice is what happens in Africa, where we have a significant development aid programme and may be able to bring technology to bear.  While I was working in Vietnam two years ago, I developed a model on the environmental impact on the economy for the Vietnamese institute with which I was working and which held a conference on adaptation.  Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and it had done some very impressive things which have yet to be done in Ireland.  Interestingly, the President was there during my stay and attended the signing of a major contract by an Irish company to develop wind energy.   There are ways in which we can impact on and make a difference in the wider world.</p><p> I ask the Deputy to remind me of her final point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#FF00600"><p>I realise I am the last contributor so I will try to be as brief as possible.  Many of the issues have been covered.</p><p>I will begin on agricultural issues.  There has been discussion of forestry and its potential impact, in particular on rural communities in certain parts of the country.  The Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Pat Deering, stated that if every farmer was to plant 50 or 80 trees on his or her land it would be a very significant contribution.  A solution such as that would spread the load far more effectively than whole communities being affected by significant afforestation in their areas.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, mentioned that possibility in an article published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>in August.  It is one of the things we should be progressing and looking at as a possible solution to the issue of forestry.</p><p>Ms Buckley mentioned the issue of digesters, which is of particular importance in light of the growth of the dairy herd and the current issues with excess manure.  How that organic waste is used is a key issue that must be considered and incentivised.  International models and smart farming must be taken into account.  Wind and solar energy contribute to the operation of milk processing plants on dairy farms in countries such as Italy and Germany.  We must utilise a combination of energy generation from solar, wind and anaerobic digestion.  If the digestion model is to work in Ireland, in particular in regard to the dairy herd, crops must play a significant role as they provide the ability to finance it and to tie farmers together in the project.</p><p>We need to think outside the box on the issue of organic farming, which would be of benefit to the current water shortage issues.  I am sure Ms Buckley will inform the committee of the position regarding water quality and supply.  We are probably at a tipping point in many ways.  A significant organic farming programme would help in many respects and should be one of the issues which the council is considering and driving forward.</p><p>On communication, one of the questions that many farmers have is how the global population increase of approximately 2 billion between now and 2050 will be catered for if the amount of land used to produce food is to be reduced.  That is a significant issue.  Ireland currently has a largely GM-free policy of which we are quite proud.  Such crops are not grown here to the level that they are in certain other countries.  Is it now proposed that GM products will form part of the solution to the world food issue?</p><p>It is an issue about which many people have a view.  If one reduces the quantity of land used to produce the food, then one needs also look at the GM issue, which brings its own questions.  This will present a conflict for many farmers.</p><p> With regard to the decarbonisation proposal, if Ireland had a large carbon tax, do the witnesses believe there is a possibility of nuclear power becoming part of the solution?  Is nuclear power a solution to the issue, if the carbon tax was a part of that?  How would it fit into the cycle itself?  Perhaps the Professor FitzGerald could comment on that.</p><p> On the electric car, during the summer I drove from Cork to Dublin in an electric car.  There was one charging point midway in Portlaoise where we stopped, and we made it quite comfortably.  It worked out very well.  The technology is there and the incentives are quite large with &euro;5,000 off vehicle registration tax and with low motor tax rates.  The issue, however, is with the infrastructure itself.  If the infrastructure was there tomorrow morning, the uptake of electric cars would be significant.  Already, the uptake from one year to the next is more than 250%.  I am aware this is based on small numbers, but that is the actual percentage.  This will be a key issue for the main provider, the ESB Networks, which provides the 1,000 charging points currently.  That is the delivery mechanism we need in order to get more electric cars.  We have the incentives, and people know they are there.  People want the technology.  I know people are very interested in the technology.  The battery life power is there to make the journeys but without the infrastructure one would be looking around for a charging point or waiting for it to happen.  Infrastructure is the area in which debate needs to happen.</p><p> I will move on to my last point as the Chairman is looking at me.</p></speech>

Are we proposing that incineration be part of that model?  Are we looking at that as a progressive model we can use to generate energy for the grid or are we of the view that we should shy away from incineration due to environmental issues?</p></speech>

On planting trees, very interesting research has been done by a company that owns a large farm, which it has mapped using light detection and ranging sensing technology, LiDAR.  This helps to measure the amount of carbon that is fixed each year in the hedgerows.  This could be an idea rather than planting everywhere with forest.  Last weekend I walked around a part of rural Oxfordshire and while the countryside is not quite as attractive as Ireland's I noted that the mixture was good.  It is an interesting idea.  I do not have the expertise on it but certainly it should be pursued.  We do not really deal with water, but as a result of the mapping, that same company could see where the run-off was from fields into the local river.  The company experimented with planting hazel where the water ran underground to see if the leaching into the river of undesirable nutrients could be stopped.  Research in the agriculture area is really important and is something that Ireland is doing well.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of reducing land area and food production.  We need food.  Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy referred to importing biomass product.  It seems to be mad, for example, to wipe out the growing of grain in the US to grow maize to make ethanol.  This does not seem to be a sensible environmental solution.</p> <p>  Reference was made to nuclear power.  When he was the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that he was happy to have an open discussion on nuclear, knowing what the answer would be.  Economically, it is not on.  I have done research.  First of all, nuclear power stations come in too large a capacity of 1,000 MW.  For Ireland they have got to be around 400 MW.  Unless one could buy a used Russian nuclear submarine and stick it in Dublin Bay, nuclear power stations would not be an option.  The cost overruns in France and Finland are bloody massive.  I have no ideological view on this but we are not going to see nuclear power stations in Ireland in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  On the issue of electric car infrastructure I was interested to hear the Senator's example of getting from Cork to Dublin.  It is about getting the infrastructure right.  We would like to see, as would the members, the Department rolling out a plan that brings together all the agents involved.</p><p>I have not thought about incineration.  I will leave Ms Burke with the difficult question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#HH00200"><p>Nuclear, genetic modification, GM, and incineration are an interesting combination.  I am conscious of the EPA's role as regulator in the context of the use of GMs under their various classes, whether in medical usage or in terms of the potential for growth.  Ultimately, it is a policy decision that the Oireachtas and the Government need to make.  We always say  incineration is lower on the chain.  Reducing, reusing and recycling come first, then we look at incineration with energy recovery and, finally, landfill.  I am moving away from climate now but it is related in a way.  Over the past number of years, there has been a reduction in capacity to deal with Irish waste in Ireland.  Waste is being exported to other countries, where it is used for energy recovery in many instances.  That does not make sense either.  Whether it is waste or climate, we need to have a mature discussion overall about what we do with what is generated.  The EPA is the regulator so we deal with each individual application in front of us in its own right.</p> <p>  I would like to touch on water and highlight that there are no simple issues here.  Everything is interconnected - air quality and climate, too - for good or ill.  The promotion of diesel happened throughout Europe, which impacted on air quality, although it was good from a climate perspective.  If not dealt with properly, biomass has the potential to impact on air quality.  Using electric cars is the opposite; they have a positive impact on air quality.  Water is also connected; none of the environmental issues is isolated in its own box.  With regard to growing trees and afforestation, the right trees need to be planted in the right place, otherwise there could be a negative impact on water quality.  It is the same with agriculture and so on.  Everything is interconnected.  What we have seen overall with regard to water quality is that the worst of the badly polluted waterways have gone but we are also losing the best of the best.  We are losing the pristine water quality areas and rivers and that is something we need to watch in all of this.  This is probably best left for a separate discussion on water, which we should have at some stage.</p></speech>

There are some tools out there such as the carbon navigator that is available as an advisory tool to farmers on management of carbon at the farm scale.  I do not know what Senator Lombard had in mind in terms of planting 80 or so trees, whether it would be as a commercial enterprise or just an element of offsetting the carbon or other emissions on a farm.  It would not be enough but it would certainly be a contribution.  The navigator is an important tool for creating awareness of the other dimensions of carbon such as soil, hedgerows and the other elements of biomass within the farm.  It also addresses elements like nutrient management, which have a knock-on for N2O emissions as well.  It is not just the fertiliser but the animals themselves with their waste and methane as well.  It creates a more holistic appreciation of the entire farm and I suppose efficiencies come into it as well.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is something we should consider.</p> <p>  If the EPA is not the right body to answer this question, the witnesses might know whom I should ask.  Who would tell us whether the targets we have set ourselves in the White Paper and the mitigation papers for an 80% reduction by 2050 are ambitious enough?  My understanding is that those levels of ambition were set prior to the Paris Agreement.  Whose job is it to reassess whether they are ambitious enough and if we are likely to have a higher target?  Has anyone in the State done that research and could it be provided to us?</p></speech>

We welcome the establishment of the members' committee and wish them well in their important, urgent work.</p> <p>  Our civil society delegation includes members of both the Environmental Pillar, the national advocacy coalition of 26 environmental non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and Stop Climate Chaos, the coalition of 28 overseas aid, youth, faith and environment organisations campaigning for Ireland to do its fair share to tackle climate change.</p> <p>  These hearings are very timely: Irish climate policy is at a crucial crossroads.  Three paths converge here, namely, the increasing impacts of climate change, Ireland&rsquo;s track record on climate action and the emerging all-party consensus that new policies and measures are required.</p><p>Our presentation will briefly address the three paths that converge here, namely the increasing impacts of climate change, Ireland's track record on climate action and the all-party consensus that new policies and measures are required.  We want to look briefly at those areas before scouting the path ahead, which the committee is charged with mapping.  We are seeing the increasing impact of climate change in Ireland through an increase in extreme weather events that have economic and social impacts such as the fodder crisis and flooding.  The global picture is even more stark, as evidenced in our written submission, which demonstrates that floods, droughts, wildfires and extreme temperature events are on the increase.  UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, described climate change as a global emergency and told the world, &quot;It is time to get off the path of suicidal emissions&quot;, in a major speech in New York last Monday.<br/><br/>How does Ireland stand in the face of this existential challenge?  To borrow a phrase, I would not start from here.  Our written submission contains graphs which show that Ireland has the third highest greenhouse gas emissions per person among the EU 28 and the eighth highest in the OCED.  Ireland is one of only two EU countries that will miss the 2020 targets.  The current projections from the EPA show our emissions increasing and suggest they will be 30% above 1990 levels in 2030, notwithstanding the fact that our 2050 target is to be between 80% and 95% below the 1990 level.  In two studies in the past year, Ireland placed last or second last in the EU in the context of climate performance.  No one is asking Ireland to do more than its fair share.  Ireland is being asked just to do its fair share and to live up to the targets we have set ourselves.<br/><br/>The big development this year, which is positive, is that the Government has conceded frankly that current policies and measures are not working and that we need a reset.  The significance of these admissions is that they clear the decks for the work of this committee.  Government Deputies and Senators need no longer feel honour bound to defend the current plan while Opposition Deputies and Senators no longer have an incentive to score points against it.  It is back to the drawing board and the committee's work can shape the outcome in that regard.  Like the all-party committees on the eighth amendment and health care, respectively, the committee has a historic opportunity to forge a climate action plan for the next decade that puts Ireland on track to do its fair share to meet the Paris commitments.<br/><br/>What we lack in Ireland is the road map of agreed policies and measures to put us on the right path and get us to our destination on time.  The most damning critique of the 2017 climate action plan - the national mitigation plan - comes from Professor John FitzGerald, with whom the committee engaged this morning.  He said it contains many bright ideas but no new decisions.  The national energy and climate plan the committee is shaping is the first step towards putting that right.  If members take one thing away from our presentation, it should be this.  To build on the promise of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and to maintain credibility in this process, the committee's final report must recommend new decisions that reduce emissions.  It cannot simply recommend more research, analysis and consideration.  As Al Gore, quoting Winston Churchill from 1936, has put it:</p><blockquote>The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close.  In its place we are entering a period of consequences.</blockquote><p>In the face of the global emergency, as the UN Secretary General called it, and Ireland's baffling procrastination, the committee's role is to usher in an era of action.  We are not lost.  The report of the Citizens' Assembly and the modest proposals in the joint submission to the assembly of the Environmental Pillar and the Stop Climate Chaos coalition give the committee all the tools it needs to set Ireland in the right direction.  We look forward to discussing those and other proposals with the members in this session.  My colleagues and I will touch on various sectoral areas in that regard.  Our written submission mentions energy.  We need to put energy efficiency first, phase out fossil fuels, establish a just-transition commission to move off peak now and kick start community ownership of renewable energy with a price for solar which allows schools, farms and community buildings to get involved in energy resolution.<br/><br/>In my final few minutes, I will focus on the policy architecture needed to ensure action and accountability, as envisaged by recommendation 1 of the Citizens' Assembly which is to &quot;ensure climate change is at the centre of policy-making in Ireland, as a matter of urgency&quot;.  No doubt when it comes to specific sectors and measures, differing perspectives and priorities will be expressed in the committee's hearings.  I hope, however, we all agree on the urgency of designing and implementing a policy architecture that puts climate change consistently at the centre of policymaking.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 was a step in that direction and we campaigned for it for eight years.  However, the failure of the national mitigation plan has demonstrated the weakness of the legislation.  Comparing this Act to similar laws in other countries makes the gaps clear.  First, the 2050 target should be in the legislation.  Analysis of the UK legislation indicates that inclusion is the cornerstone of the effectiveness of the law in that jurisdiction in driving policy change.  Second, a provision is required to ensure that all new Government policies and plans are audited for their emissions impact before they are approved.  While such a provision was discussed in the context of previous Bills, it did not make it into the Act.  It is clear now that this provision is necessary.  Crucially, and our central point having regard to the overall architecture, the statutory requirement for five-year carbon budgets, adopted by parliament for the entire economy, drives action across all departments in the UK.  These five-year emissions envelopes are adopted 12 years in advance on foot of the advice of the UK climate change committee.</p><p>We consistently argued for those carbon budgets in the Irish law but they did not make the final Bill.  We had one for the Kyoto period, from 2008 to 2012.  We need them now on a five-year basis for the 2020-25 period.  They need to be adopted by Parliament, not just by the Government.  We believe that will help us move in the right direction.  </p><p> If one looks at the carbon budget outline from this joint committee, one will see that non-agricultural emissions must go down by 5% every year from now until 2050 to meet our own national targets, even before they are amended for Paris.  I refer not to EU or other externally imposed targets but to our own target of an 80% reduction by 2050.  The task of this committee is to identify policies and measures that will reduce Irish emissions by 5% in 2020 and every year thereafter until 2050.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleagues to address some of those policy areas.  Our message is that it is up to the committee members to choose the measures.  We want to reinforce the idea that we have agreed to targets that are just about getting us towards our fair share of the Paris commitment.  This committee's challenge is to actually choose the measures that deliver those reductions.</p></speech>

On recommendation 4, the vulnerability assessment, we agree this is a necessary requirement and there needs to be serious public participation in the design of the process.  The assessment should be down to the level of individual structures such as individual dams or rail lines.</p> <p>  On recommendation 7, ending subsidies for peat, Mr. Coghlan has already talked about this and argued there should be a means of transitioning and using the money from the PSA to do so.  I note, however, there currently is no sustainable biomass in the world to run Moneypoint and the peat stations.  It does not exist.  We do need more interconnectors to Europe, an issue which is not talked about enough.  Modern forecasting methods are leading to better control of wind and solar generation.  This means that the need for base-load generation, which is normally provided by Moneypoint and other peat stations, is actually dropping.  It is becoming increasingly possible to run the grid much more actively than is currently the case.  The other side that is not taken into account and does have a climate change effect is the extraction and export of millions of tonnes of horticultural and other peat products.  This needs to be counted in our overall emissions.  While we argue that the bogs should be rewetted, the arterial drainage scheme - started in 1945 when none of this was important - must be reviewed.  We are currently draining high-carbon soil and this is producing around 5% to 10% of agricultural emissions.  Any farming affected by this needs to be compensated, of course.  However, it is a huge cause of agricultural emissions. </p> <p>  Moving on to recommendation 8 on bus lanes, cycle lanes and park and ride, the national planning framework understands the need for walkable communities and encourages investment in the provision of public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure.  However, the national development plan, NDP - which is the money to be spent on that - is very different.  A huge amount of it is going on motorways and the second runway at Dublin Airport.  The Government make great claims that one fifth of the NDP is specifically for climate action, which is very positive and very true.  Unfortunately, however, much of the other four fifths is counter-productive.  A two thirds share of the transport budget for walking and cycling would be needed to drive the necessary behavioural change.</p> <p>  On the transition to electric vehicles, we believe the first priority should be to move away from car ownership altogether and towards public transport, car pooling, and shared electric car schemes such as those we see on the street now.  Then should come the move towards electric cars.  They should be supported not just through fiscal encouragements but also fiscal discouragements as the continuation of petrol and diesel engine cars must be stopped.</p><p>A date for banning petrol and diesel cars in urban areas must be set to the same as other European cities.</p><p> The conversion of public transport to clean, electric power is a no-brainer; it just makes sense.  It will improve the inbuilt air quality.  Dublin's air quality is okay but it still leads to the death of a considerable number of people.  Nitrogen oxides are a cause of huge health problems.</p><p> The Climate Change Advisory Council considered the issue of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture and recommended that carbon tax be raised to &euro;30 per tonne in general, rising to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  The Environmental Pillar feels that should start at &euro;70 per tonne in 2019 and rise by &euro;5 thereafter.  Half of that should be given straight back to the people of Ireland in a carbon dividend shared to every adult.  We do not want to introduce harm and hurt to people.  They should be compensated all around the country.  The other half should go to the Just Transition Fund, the climate action fund I have talked about.</p><p> A carbon tax of agricultural emissions should be similar to the polluter pays principle on the grounds of equity.  A new report by Teagasc states that &euro;50 per tonne is required to enable climate mitigation efforts in the sector.  Teagasc has also stated that by far the largest driver of agricultural greenhouse gases is cattle numbers.</p><p> Ammonia emissions are another cause for concern in the agricultural area.  They are harmful to health and add to carbon emissions.  Ireland is definitely above the UN norms, if not the European norms, in ammonia emissions.  </p><p> Ireland needs to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is reformed so that it can move from intensive ruminant-based farming to high nature value farming that provides more environmental protection.  This would be particularly beneficial to the farmers in the west who really need the support.</p><p> On recommendation 12 on food waste, the Environmental Pillar believes that reporting of food waste at every stage will begin to encourage initiatives to address food waste at the start of the food supply chain, including farms.</p></speech>

It is in charge of the largest public land bank in the country, comprising approximately 7% of the land mass.  We believe it is neither managing this land to ensure climate resilience nor is it delivering full public goods.  In 2010, the McCarthy report into State assets found that approximately 500,000 acres of the public estate was not commercially viable.  Mr. McCarthy also found that the annual return from the forest business was 0.4%, which he called economically unacceptable.  The Environmental Pillar would like to see an independent review and sustainability audit of Coillte's forest business and other activities.  The 1988 Forestry Act created Coillte with a commercial timber production and primacy of profit mandate.  The Act predates the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, where the concept of sustainable development stemmed from and when the world realised that climate change and other issues were threatening our collective future.  The 1988 Act is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  The Environmental Pillar wants to see the transition of this, the largest public land bank, to mixed native woodlands and forests that ensure sustainable management of this natural resource for long-term benefits in climate mitigation and adaptation, in line with international best practice.  The Environmental Pillar is looking for a very different type of management to what is going on.</p><p> Under recommendation 13, diversification with focus on planting forests and encouraging organic farming, at the outset we need to differentiate and move from the industrial tree farming forest model that was adopted in this country to a close-to-nature system focused on native species, which is proven to have multiple benefits.  We have serious concerns regarding the viability and validity of the current State forestry policy, which I reiterate is an industrial tree-farming model, especially in respect of the climate change mitigation claims and other co-benefits made for this forest industry.  The State has spent approximately &euro;2.5 billion in the past ten years on a forestry programme.  That is not a good use of public money and is not delivering the multiple public goods it should.</p><p> The sustainability of the current model is predicated on increased annual harvests of 35 to 50 year old trees, combined with at least 15,000 ha of new planting, to maintain a balance.  This is what is known as the "sustained yield".  We now see younger trees are being harvested and Ireland has averaged only 6,000 ha in afforestation or new planting in the past ten years.  It is predicted that this year only 4,000 ha will be planted in new planting.  Meanwhile harvesting of a younger age profile is increasing.  That will lead to possible deforestation.</p><p> Between 2012 and 2018, there was only a 0.2% increase in tree cover, which is already low.  When this poor planting is combined with ongoing higher harvesting rates, we are looking at deforestation.  The current forest policy may be making climate change worse.  This forestry model also ranks as the second greatest threat to designated habitats and species in Ireland after agriculture.  Almost 40% of designated habitats and 20% of species designated under the habitats directive have forestry as a direct pressure or threat.  At a species level, over 20% of species designated under this directive have forestry as a threat.</p><p> There is an urgent need to change the direction of forest policy in line with the 2013 forest policy review, one of the main recommendations of which was to separate commercial timber production from the environmental and social objectives of what is known as sustainable forest management, that is, to ensure that the forest policy can deliver climate change mitigation and resilience, as well as other multiple environmental and social benefits which also are tied in to climate resilience.  The pillar believes this can be achieved by the creation of a forestry task force as a component of the independent body to ensure climate change at the centre of policy making in Ireland, in line with recommendation 1 of the Citizens Assembly.</p><p> There is a need for a task force which operates between the Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Heritage Council, the environmental sector and other stakeholders to knock heads and pull together a more co-ordinated, more beneficial policy transition.  It is in line with the need for an acceptable global forestry model focused on native trees and woodlands, which are the richest land-based habitats for biodiversity and are still the life-support system for many indigenous peoples and for us all.  These future forests must be created for longer-term multiple environmental and social objectives, allowing the trees to grow old to absorb more carbon and to bank it long term and develop invaluable complex ecosystem services.  The current model is short term.  It is 25 to 30 years long.  They are cutting the trees down far too early and are not allowing them to develop or to give the multiple benefits that could accrue.</p><p> I refer to recommendations 11 and 13, reward farmers for carbon storage and land diversification.  It is linked to what Mr. Stanley-Smith stated earlier.  The pillar would like to see options and rewards for diverse agroforestry systems, that is, to integrate different smarter-type forestry into farming.  I note farming came originally from forests.</p><p>The recommendation from the 1896 recess committee set up by Horace Plunkett was the integration of forestry and farming.  We have moved well away from that.  Native trees on farms can also alleviate flooding - by reducing the flow of water from land to river channels - and reduce soil-quality depletion.  It also protects soil fertility which is very important.  Riparian and ecological corridor planting would increase our low tree cover, focus on our native species, collect runoff from pollution by nitrates, etc., and be a win-win for farms.</p></speech>

Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan said we should stitch the 2050 targets into legislation.  I would be nervous about such an approach because I believe our targets might not be sufficiently ambitious.  Today, the President of the European Commission, Mr. Junker, has come out strongly saying that we need to increase Europe's contribution to the Paris Agreement, which, in turn, would lead to us having to review our target.  Our target is complex because it calls for an 80% reduction across energy transport.  It also calls for carbon neutrality; I am uncertain as to what that means.  I am nervous about the 80% because it leads to every Department looking to be the 20% that does not have to do its bit and expecting all the other Departments to cover for it.</p> <p>  Have Stop Climate Chaos and An Taisce done any assessment or has the environmental pillar done any review of our likely final climate target within the Paris Agreement if it stays?

It has become quite clear that countries have made pledges which are, to some extent, aspirational but which now need to be tied down with a common methodology.  Hopefully the conference will agree a common rule book with which all parties will be required to comply.</p> <p>  In the lead-up to that, the European Union has been very active over the summer months in positioning Europe to resume, hopefully, a position of leadership in respect of this problem.  Two quite important directives have been passed - one on renewable energy and one on energy of efficiency - both of which call for reductions or improvements of the order of 32%.  Coupled with that is the 2030 effort-sharing decision, as we used to call it, to which Ireland was party.</p> <p>  As a result of all of this, the positioning of Europe internationally is such that there is a probability that at Katowice in December Europe will make a new pitch for a higher and more ambitious target of probably approximately 45%.</p><p>In fact, 14 countries have called for stronger EU climate action over the past few months.  Sadly, Ireland was not in a position to join those 14 countries calling for stronger EU climate action, which is a source of regret.</p><p> What we are now seeing is that the net is tightening around the kind of pledges we made in the past, which were almost in spirit rather than in practice, and we have seen in the Irish case that we failed to deliver on those.  With the next stage of European policies bringing together those three strands of energy, efficiency of renewable energy and emissions, there is now a requirement on countries to produce an integrated - that is the important word - climate and energy plan, a draft of which has to be produced by the end of December.  There is a template for that in circulation which countries will be required to adhere to, and that template will stop countries making aspirational claims which may not be delivered on.  It means that we in Ireland will have to come clean on what we are going to do, how we are going to do it, what our targets will be and how we will comply with annual limit values commencing in the early 2020s.  Failure to comply with those will have automatic penalties, which are built in.  Of necessity, this will mean hard choices have to be made and, of course, it is the job of this committee to make those hard choices.  Politics is about setting priorities, and I believe the priorities that are set will have to be set within that envelope.  Of course, that envelope will extend beyond 2030 up to 2050.</p><p> The indications are that decarbonisation of the global economy cannot wait until 2050 if we are to avoid the dangerous climate change scenario.  The IPCC will publish in the next few weeks an important report on the 1.5&deg; Celsius issue with regard to what are our chances and what steps we need to take to comply with the Paris objective of doing everything we can to avoid a 1.5&deg; Celsius warming.  I can tell the committee now, without breaking any confidence, that it will say it is going to be extremely difficult unless we accelerate the rate of decarbonisation of all economies, especially the economies in the developing world, but also that we take more stringent steps in the developed world, where we have a historical responsibility to bear the burden of immediate short-term reductions.  The current consensus is that 2050 is too far away and that 2040 will be the required target for decarbonisation.  To do that, we will have to go on an accelerating trend of emissions reductions.</p><p> For us in Ireland, effectively, the longer we put off making those hard choices, the steeper the fall off the cliff will be in the next ten to 20 years.  If we want to have any kind of equity with the next generation, or any kind of phased adjustment to decarbonisation, those hard choices have to be made now.  This committee is in the very important position of being able to make those hard choices.  They are unpopular choices, which will cause disruption and a great deal of angst in some sectors.  That is why we will have to try to take them in an orderly and in an equitable way, as Mr. Stanley-Smith said, in order to protect vulnerable people and vulnerable assets, where possible, by a reallocation of resources.</p><p> To answer the question, the time for procrastination is gone.  The signs are that we are now seeing a climate change system which is changing more quickly than we thought.  We are getting much more confident about attribution of human activities to individual extreme events.  We know of the heatwave this summer and we can attribute a probability that this will occur twice as often in the future, and the study that said this was carried out in July before we had the drought.  We are facing a situation where extreme events are going to become more frequent, and the cost of coping and adapting will become even greater as we move through the timescales.</p></speech>

Ms Cliona Sharkey might be interested in answering this as well because she represents an agency with a global perspective.  In some of the arguments and discussions we have had about land use and the area of agriculture, the message we have heard is that Irish farming and agriculture are low-carbon relative to that of other jurisdictions, that we have an obligation to feed the world, 10 billion people, and that we should be able to meet our Food Harvest 2020 plan targets as well as the targets of our climate plans.  Is there a scientific or, indeed, a global perspective on this?  It is a global argument, I suppose, in the sense that our beef is lower-carbon than Belgian beef or Brazilian beef, perhaps.  What cognisance do the witnesses think we should take of these arguments?  How do we assess them?</p></speech>

Yes, we believe that the production of Irish beef is probably less carbon-intensive than that of many other countries, but that argument only works if someone is prepared to go and talk to the Belgians, the Brazilians or whoever else and say, "The Irish are so good at this that you should let them produce all the beef in the world and you should stop."  Otherwise, what will happen is that we will continue producing beef and so will the other countries and the argument of Ireland being so much better than anyone else will just fail because both countries will carry on producing beef.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliona Sharkey" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#EEE01100"><p>Yes.  To build a little on that point, we certainly recognise the relative efficiency of Irish agriculture.  We do not work in Irish agriculture, as the committee knows quite well, but we have been working on global food security and hunger in some of the poorest countries in the world for a number of decades.  In the context of climate change, we are very conscious that globally, the food system will have to transform.  Agriculture in all countries will have to transform, no more so than in the countries where we work.  We believe strongly that the policies for the agricultural sector in every country need to be just, ambitious and managed to support farmers and rural communities in order to deliver a resilient, low-carbon and profitable rural economy that can contribute to local economies and to the national economy.  However, we also wish to be very clear, because there is often a lot of confusion around this discussion, that hunger is caused by poverty.  Food insecurity is caused by poverty rather than inadequate food supply.  We know that the world currently provides enough food in theory for the global population, but lack of access to resources or the ability to produce that food means that almost 800 million people between 2014 and 2016 were unable to access sufficient food.  What we know, therefore, is that increasing food supply globally will not solve hunger, but increasing emissions will certainly exacerbate it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#EEE01300"><p>Yes.  I am sure members have already heard a great deal on the point about efficiency and carbon intensity and I am sure they will hear a great deal more about it.  From an atmospheric point of view, however, it is an irrelevant term.  The atmosphere does not recognise efficiency or intensity.  All it recognises is absolute emissions.  Those are what count.  Therefore, if one wants to increase overall emissions, that is a choice one must make at the expense of something else.  For example, according to the CSO, there were 6.67 million cattle in Ireland at the end of December.  This represents 750,000 more than there were at the end of December 2011.  That is a choice one must make if one wants to continue down that path, but it will have to be at the expense of something else, and it is for the committee to decide on those priorities.</p> <p>  As for the leakage argument, unfortunately, national sovereign governments are the units which must operate in this field.</p><p>It would be nice if we had sectoral allocations globally but unfortunately that is not going to happen.  If we wanted to use the argument that we are more efficient at producing beef the Germans would use the argument they are more efficient at producing cars and the Italians would use the argument they are more efficient at producing olive oil.  We would end up in a very difficult situation.  This reminds us that we have to take responsibility for our own actions.</p><p> In addition to the number of cattle, we are exceeding our national emissions ceiling for ammonia.  How long we will be allowed to do that by the Commission is not clear, but that is a choice the committee has to make in terms of where it wants to take the country.  I remind committee members there is an envelope that must be maintained, which is the absolute amount of emissions and not intensity efficiency or anything else.  It is the amount of emissions with which we can meet our obligations.</p></speech>

There is so much research out there, as members can imagine, on these issues.  I have information from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization from 2016.  It produced a report, The State of Food and Agriculture, that focused on climate change, agriculture and food security.  The report states:</p><blockquote>The effects of climate change on agricultural production and livelihoods are expected to intensify over time, and to vary across countries and regions.  Beyond 2030, the negative impacts of climate change on the productivity of crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry will become increasingly severe in all regions.<br /><br />Productivity declines would have serious implications for food security.  Food supply shortfalls would lead to major increases in food prices, while increased climate variability would accentuate price volatility.</blockquote> <p>We agree with the fact that agriculture has to be treated differently.  It is not just an emissions or economic sector, it is the means by which we feed ourselves as a species so it has to be treated as a special case.<br/><br/>Our primary concern as an organisation is for the people who are struggling with the level of impact of climate change today.  They are already unable to produce enough food to feed themselves because of increasingly frequent and intense disasters.  This is a global issue of which Ireland must be cognisant.  Perhaps the committee could engage with the Department in the coming weeks to ask about the implications for Ireland's food security down the line in a situation where we do not deliver on the 1.5&deg; or well below 2&deg; temperature limits set in the Paris Agreement.  There are some scenarios we should consider.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#FFF00300"><p>To return to Deputy Ryan's comments on how targets might change and the role of the committee, I agree with everything said by Professor Sweeney.  To bring it back to the work of the committee, the existing EU objective for 2050 is 80% to 95% in all emissions reduction compared to 1990.</p> <p>If I remember correctly the fifth assessment report, AR5, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this means Europe's share would give us a 50:50 chance of staying below 2&deg;.  The target adopted in 2014 by the Irish Government in the national policy position on climate action was the lower 80% target.  Carbon neutrality means net zero.  In mathematical terms, never mind how it is achieved, that means the whole economy of Ireland would reduce 1990 levels by 80% by 2050.  The very next year, in 2015, we adopted the Energy White Paper, which has a target for all CO2 emissions, encompassing everything bar agriculture, of 80% to 95%.  That is State policy in the White Paper.  This echoes the EU objective.  If everyone in Europe does this it will give us a 50:50 chance of staying below 2&deg;.  At the same time as the White Paper was adopted the Paris Agreement was adopted.  This sets a much more challenging climate temperature target.  It states 2&deg; is too dangerous and that we need to be well below 2&deg;, ideally as close to 1.5&deg; as possible.  All existing targets have to be revised in the context of the Paris Agreement.  They will all get more challenging.</p><p>Essentially, Ireland faces a net 80% reduction target by 2050.  There might be talk of a global net 0% by 2050.  As Professor Sweeney said, it will be at least net 0% in Europe by 2040, which is only 22 years away.  From 1998 to 2020 will only have been 22 years.  That is a short time to get to net 0% emissions if we are to do our fair share under the Paris Agreement.</p><p> While it is worth being cognisant of that fact, when Ireland is so far off track in reaching our existing targets according to all independent assessments, the committee's focus should be on what measures to take.  I have suggested putting the cap into law.  In the production of the national mitigation plan, every Department kept its cards close to its chest and offered as little as possible.  There was no legal backstop, to borrow a phrase, to force us to share out the emissions within a limit.</p><p> More important than any given target for 2050 in the law is the five-year budgeting process.  Although I do not like using the analogy of the troika, we really had to stick to our budget limit for five years or more.  All negotiations were on how to divvy that up, what the priorities were - in this case, the priority is pollution - and where the greatest savings could be made.  When making such decisions, we should bear in mind the economics of what is the most efficient, but also issues of fairness, justice and protection of the weakest.  All of this would happen underneath a hard limit on emissions rather than an aspirational target that does not require action.</p><p> I will make a related point, as what I have just said sounds negative.  As Professor Sweeney stated, we face disruption in taking climate action but, as Ms Sharkey mentioned, we face disruption and change regardless of what happens next or whether we like it.  The only question is whether to take hold of the situation and manage the change so that we make the most of the innovations and possibilities of the transition or sit back and hope that someone will solve the problem for us, in which case we are much more likely to face the sort of abrupt adjustment we got when the bubble burst ten years ago and Lehman Brothers collapsed.  We do not want the latter.  We want the managed, just and prosperous transition, which we can get by taking action now.</p></speech>

Irish farmers are already suffering from climate change.  We saw it this summer.  If we have a long, cold winter, agriculture will be in deep trouble.  Urban or rural, we all realise that.  We must help our farming community.</p> <p>  Mr. St. Ledger set out a new model for a close-to-nature forestry.  He does not have to answer now, but is there any paper he could share with us that sets out how much that would cost, where it would be done and, as Professor FitzGerald asked earlier, how we could get farmers to switch into it?  What would be the incentives and mechanisms to deliver it?  I agree with the different vision of forestry that he set out, but is there a good paper on this matter to which he could refer us?  Where could we look to see the real nuts and bolts - I am sorry for using the wrong metaphor, as I should have said "branches and twigs" - of how that would be delivered?</p></speech>

It is not as specific as what the Deputy is seeking and is global rather than focused on Ireland.  However, Ireland has one of the best climates in the world for growing, particularly for hardwoods.  It has ideal conditions.  That is the reason for our timber production model, with fast-growing non-native trees.  That model served a purpose when we had low forest cover, but it is time to move away from it.</p> <p>  Bangor University in Wales, which is not too far away, has been working with a group of hill farmers in similar conditions to Ireland's.</p><p>It has researched and shown amazing results by having only 5% specifically targeted small groups of trees on a 1,000 ha model area.  This research, which is ongoing, is applicable to Ireland.  In terms of forest policy in general, there would be papers from Austria and Switzerland on close-to-nature, continuous cover, longer term mixture coppicing and standards for timber, which allows for continued timber production but with multiple benefits.  The model we have chosen provides only a timber benefit, which is  economically good for the pension funds and the bigger players but not the small contractors.  They are not getting a good deal because they are being paid by weight and, having invested in expensive machinery, they are struggling, which, again, is damaging to our environment  They need to be helped transition away from this model.  There is research out there on the multiple benefits of a different model, but specific to Ireland, not so much because we follow a different model, which is an industrial fast-growing model.  </p></speech>

We are where we are.  We all know where we are and why we are where we are.  We probably should have had this meeting decades ago.  However, we are here now.  The committee is seeking guidance on what positive actions can be taken, the starting point being the Citizens' Assembly recommendations which the witnesses have referenced and quoted.  This is only the second hearing on this issue.  I can almost rhyme off the targets in respect of where we need to be by 2020, 2030 and 2040.  In terms of the committee's work, I would like to hear more about where we should start and what should be prioritised because these are the issues on which we will need to make decisions.  We are a country dependent on agriculture, which some say is carbon efficient and others say is not but in the absence of it being carbon neutral, there is a problem.  We have to incorporate where we are into the solution.  We have to consider the 300,000 employed, directly or indirectly, by the agriculture industry.  Afforestation of all agricultural land will result in job losses, which will have a knock-on effect on the economy in terms of tax take, which would lead us to square -1 in that we will not have the resources do many of the things that are desired or requested.</p> <p>  On Coillte, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. St. Ledger that it leaves a lot to be desired.  In regard to afforestation, when balancing the books on emissions versus sequestration or mitigation, is only the 7% Coillte registered land taken into consideration or are all hedgerows, sporadic trees, forts and overgrown areas on practically every farm taken into consideration?  Has any analysis been done of the average size farm in Ireland, including hedgerows, taking into account the method of farming, or are we, when speaking about trees, speaking about officially recorded forests?  Generally speaking, are we not seeing the forest for the trees?</p></speech>

I will say a few words about the bit I skipped over in my presentation.  There is real scope in energy, in particular, for win-win-wins.  I am sure the committee has heard this already.  In some senses it is the least sexy of them all but the area where the most difference can be made is in energy efficiency by not using as much energy in our homes.  The European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Mr. Miguel Arias Ca&ntilde;ete, said that the dollar of energy not used is the best one of all.</p> <p>  We built one third of our housing stock during the boom and not to the highest standards.  We have to retrofit at least 1 million homes and probably more over the next 12 years but we get significant benefits when we do that.  In a funny way we do not have to talk about it being a climate thing.  We get a much more stable climate inside a house when heat pumps are used compared with old fashioned up and down with boilers.  The air is cleaner, the homes are healthier, the fuel bills are lower as are the emissions.  Perhaps Mr. Stanley-Smith might speak about this as he had a deep retrofit done by the Tipperary Energy Agency.  It is a transformative experience for a house but it is a big deal.  It is not only a grant that is needed but also project management support to help choose the right contractor etc.  </p> <p>  We have to do that at a scale of a million homes.  That is at least 100,000 homes a year for the next decade.  It is good that the national development plan referred to resources for this but the question is what mechanism gets people engaged.  I am not stuck on this but as a thought experiment, I have used the analogy of something like the special savings incentive account, SSIA.  First, if it is &euro;2 billion per year for the next ten years, that is not all going to be State money.  We have to get household investment involved and we also must think about households in fuel poverty, as well as low-income households and give them more support.  For the majority of households it needs to be a scheme that gets them spending their own money while also getting some State help.  What has done that the most in the last 20 years is the SSIA scheme.  </p> <p>  It was in a sense like taking off value added tax, VAT.  For every &euro;4 invested, there was a &euro;1 return after five years.  It was the simplicity of the offer that attracted people.  We need something like an SSIA scheme for insulation where for every &euro;4 a householder invests in a deep retrofit, he or she gets a &euro;1 subsidy from the State.  I refer to something that is this simple to understand and which is rolled out at a scale that allows us to get to 100,000 houses a year.  I know from the small bits of home improvements I have done that project management is the other side of that coin.  Getting something done to the outside of a house is one thing but when the fabric of the home is being reworked inside, the householder needs to trust the contractor.  He or she needs to know what is happening and needs guidance.  </p> <p>  Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes do not offer that level of support at present whereas the Tipperary Energy Agency deep retrofit scheme - now a kind of national pilot scheme - does give that type of support.  It does the assessment with the householder and then offers two or three contractors that the householder knows are up to the job.   That makes it so much easier.  It is essentially like accompaniment by a supportive agency through the process.  Mr. Stanley-Smith might talk more about the experience.  That is one side.</p> <p>  The second is renewables.  We are often critical of Government policy in my job but we have welcomed the renewable electricity support scheme.  It is a genuine attempt to operationalise the commitments to renewables and community involvement in the White Paper.  There is, however, one crucial bit missing for real public engagement.  I mentioned it in passing and that is the idea of a payment for solar electricity that can be spilled to the grid from a solar panel.  There is a small grant now for putting a solar panel on a house as a householder but we think that community buildings and farm buildings are the real front line.  I want every school in the country to be not just a green school but a solar school with a solar panel on the roof.  That is not just because schools can save on their energy bills and then spend more on whiteboards and education because fuel bills are currently paid for from capitation.  It is because it is a real way to engage the community in energy.  On a sunny day, the meter in the lobby of the school would be going backwards.  There would be real possibilities for engagement.  Perhaps some fundraising might be done to put the panels on.</p><p>They could get a real gain from it.  It involves the State giving a payment for the solar energy they spill onto the grid, as schools are not used at weekends or during the summer.  If they cannot be paid for it, as is the case currently, it does not become economically viable.  Equally, for GAA clubs, parish and community halls and farm buildings, it is a real way to get the vast majority of communities involved.  We know that is at the community level where Ireland shows that it is best; it takes in the Tidy Towns competition, GAA clubs and parish groups.  That is where the real action is.  If we can harness that energy to help us to engage in the transition, the game will change.  There would also be a stream of revenue for rural communities, in particular.  It is not purely about megawatts as that will not resolve our issues in meeting overall targets.  It will, however, change the discussion.  We will get past the discussion we have had about big corporate wind energy projects for the past ten years into a real societal project involving transition and transformation.  These two elements would make a big physical difference to people's lives and the conversation.</p><p> Mr. Stanley-Smith and I mentioned peat in passing.  Peatlands are our Amazon.  We are burning them in order to produce electricity, which is very inefficient.  Peat gives us 9% of our electricity but 23% of the pollution caused by electricity generation.  We must stop using it.  We were first told to stop 20 years ago by consultants hired by the Government to tell us how to meet our targets.  We need to do it in a just transition and cannot just abandon the workers.  I have used the analogy before that when a US company pulls out, overnight a task force will be set up by the Minister and the Taoiseach, with all of the agencies, employers, the trade unions and local groups.  We need that now for the peat sector in the midlands, with a target date to come off peat of two, three or four years.  It should involve the community and the sector should ask what kind of future it wants.  We should use the subsidy that currently goes to the sector and some of the revenue from the carbon tax to fund the transition and ensure the workers and communities will have the opportunities to envisage a sustainable and prosperous future.</p></speech>

It is very important that we also have a just transition in agriculture.  </p> <p>  With regard to suggestions, we have seen the renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy, where our negotiators were putting the stress almost exclusively on Pillar 1, the single farm payment, and not emphasising enough the Commission's proposals under Pillar 2 which were in very admirable areas such as rural development, having an ecological focus and so on.  These are the very areas where a just transition will be required, especially in the west.  If we think of where forestry can go in Ireland, we will not grow huge forests on the very rich soils in the east or in ecologically sensitive upland peatland areas.  The real target areas will be the wet soils in the west.  Therefore, we must have a just transition.  We must ensure people will not be disadvantaged by the policies we are making elsewhere.</p> <p>  We must look at the way in which we can support smaller farmers, beef farmers, if necessary, but particularly farmers who have an important role to play in keeping rural communities together.  This is something for which the Common Agricultural Policy was designed originally; perhaps we have lost a bit of vision in that sense.  Let us look at how we can reward farmers who look after biodiversity.  We could reward farmers who look after flood control.  These are the areas that can enable the fabric of rural society in the west, with which I am quite familiar, to be held together much better in this transition.  We must not go down the road of simply encouraging a monoculture ethos, with a single farm payment and nothing else, leading to intensification and all of the consequences, not just for our emissions but also for the quality of waters and so on.  We can do it if we make those choices and encourage our negotiators to do so.  Who knows what is their brief currently when they attend the sessions either on climate change or agriculture?  We could encourage them to prioritise the just transition mentality.</p></speech>

It includes scrub.</p><p>In 2014, the EPA produced a report that calculated there were more than 440,000 ha of hedgerows, scrub and random areas of woodland which have not been linked to our carbon footprint.  The EPA has suggested that one hectare could sequester 3.3 tonnes of carbon.  Multiplying 440,000 ha by 3.3 tonnes equals a substantial amount of carbon.</p><p> The hedgerow system is an example of agri-forestry that takes place in Ireland.  Farmers in France and Austria have formed co-operatives to manage hedgerows, small woods and copses to supply local biomass for combined heat and power systems that are used in schools and communities located in public buildings.  Such work is sustainable and provides farmers with an income in the wintertime, which is welcome.  At the moment these areas of woodland are not included in carbon calculations but should be.</p></speech>

I highly recommend deep retrofitting but one must employ a trusted agency to do the work.  Let us remember that houses vary and, therefore, have different requirements.  Representatives of the Tipperary Energy Agency approached my wife and me and told us what our house and type of living required.  They told us that they would organise the right contractors, which they did, and the contractors were asked for quotes for the work.  The agency handled the quotes and grants.  One week about 12 people came to house to do different jobs such as fit solar panels and fit the walls.  Within one working week the whole job was done.  All that my wife and I had to do was to go through a list of options with the Tipperary Energy Agency, identify whether they met our requirements, sign the contract and pay the cheque.</p> <p>  My wife and I were fortunate enough to be able to pay for the work ourselves but there are options available if people require a bank loan.  The agency had gone to the local bank and explained to it that if anybody came in, the work was all bona fide stuff and hence it was reasonable and made sense for the bank to grant a loan.  I confirm that my wife and I have saved between &euro;1,500 and &euro;2,000 each winter for the past couple of winters.  We are very much on track to recoup the cost in about seven or eight years, which is very good.  If people want to visit Tipperary, I can show them my house and give a longer introduction.</p> <p>  I want to outline another thing that needs to be done in terms of a national planning framework.  What a lot of people do not understand or realise is that it has been estimated that the population in this country will rise by 1 million by 2040.  That means there will be more climate change because each person is responsible for a certain amount.  Therefore, we must be able to deal with the current population and the estimated rise in the population.  I seriously recommend the national planning framework.  It is a seriously good idea.  As I have said before, I am 95% in agreement with the national planning framework.  There is very little in it that I think is wrong.  The key thing is that people must live in smaller communities that one does not have to drive to.  The problems that are caused at the minute by urban sprawl and people having to drive for hours each day are not just climate change problems but social problems as well.  We must change the way we live today and provide support that enables people to live in communities located in towns, villages and cities.  Villages are the support lungs of rural Ireland.  I live in a village in County Tipperary so I know what it means to the rural area and, therefore, recommend very much that the national planning framework is absolutely followed.</p><p>I have a problem with the national development plan, which is that the money meant to support the national planning framework does not always match up.  Undoubtedly, there is a requirement to improve the road between Limerick and Cork, but do we need to spend &euro;1 billion on a motorway?  Would we not be better off spending &euro;500 million on doing up the road, as it undoubtedly needs work, and then spend the other &euro;500 million on other initiatives to improve life in that area?  Why must we have a motorway?  Let us have a decent road and spend the other half of the money on supporting that area of Ireland.  It is similar elsewhere.  We do not need motorways everywhere.  By all means, there should be better roads.</p></speech>

It might be a more efficient use of time rather than everybody on the panel answering all the questions.  Perhaps they will keep that in mind when asking their questions.  I invite Ms Sharkey to respond.</p></speech>

Tr&oacute;caire is engaged on this issue because we are deeply concerned about the current impacts on the people with whom we are working.  We can see that people are struggling with today's level of warming and we know that will increase over the coming years.  We are deeply concerned about the prospects for them if we fail to deliver on the temperature limits set out in the Paris Agreement.  That is the reason we are here.  We are doing what we can to provide a humanitarian response to support people to develop their resilience, but there is a point beyond which they cannot adapt and survive.  We must avoid reaching that point.</p> <p>  As Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan said, and as the ESRI said last week, there will be disruption.  There is no way to get away from the disruption in all sectors of society, but the impact of inadequate or delayed action will be even more disruptive.  We believe it is important to have these processes so everybody's views are heard and to ensure the actions and outcomes are fair and equitable.</p> <p>  As regards the outcomes from this committee in terms of the societal vision and transformation we need, the message that comes from it will be incredibly important.  We hope to see a clear, consistently communicated cross-party message that climate action at the level needed to realistically deliver on the Paris Agreement is in the overwhelming public interest.  It is essential if we are to have a habitable planet on which to pursue all our other social goals.  This committee can play an important part in making it clear to the public and private sectors, the media, investors and everybody else that there is a firm consensus that all parties and elected representatives are resolutely committed to this.  The outcome of this committee must be the starting point of that clear, consistent and explicitly cross-party communication.  It is up to the committee to decide on the specifics across the various sectors but there must be resolute, cross-party commitment to meeting them.</p> <p>  To return to Mr. Coghlan's original intervention in respect of the overarching framework, the five-year carbon budgets under which we agree to act across the various sectors are a clear starting point to ensure we plan together.</p></speech>

I will watch the rest of the contributions later.  Mr. Coghlan raised a point that I am interested in, which is trying to invert the carbon model we have and a localised exporting model into the grid.  That is very exciting.  Perhaps he will outline what other countries are doing to try to facilitate that or what is happening in terms of pipeline solar technology.  I read Jeremy Rifkin's book recently on inverting the entire economic model and how that will transform society.  If we are not at the forefront of that, our economic model will disintegrate anyway.</p></speech>

What has been said here shows that people have interesting and useful perspectives.  We are trying to drill down to find actions for how to proceed.  I do not agree with my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p><p>We have to recognise there is an urban-rural divide because a lot of what we talk about needing to be done will affect rural areas.  More will be required of people in rural Ireland, in respect of how they live, land use and so on, than will be required of people in the cities.  For example, there will be an issue if the peat-fired power stations are closed down.  I know people acknowledge there is an issue but this involves an urban-rural divide.  There will be an issue with the fallout from what people are being asked to do in terms of the local economy and so on.  It is a similar case with regard to farmers.  It is not much consolation to hear that our farmers are the most carbon efficient in the dairy sector and the fifth most efficient in the beef sector.  It does not really matter because of the actions of the Germans.  I do not think they are a good example in terms of their credentials in respect of the environmental aspects of cars, especially those of one particular brand.  </p><p> We need to say that food is different.  We need to be fed.  If it is desired to set a standard or a bar and we set it, other countries involved in farming need to recognise that.  I get that farmers in Belgium will not roll over and let Ireland do as we like; we have a market going on here.  I am for setting the standard if we get recognition that this is the way to farm and that this the most carbon efficient way to farm.  If we are setting the standard, there should be some recognition for it.  I do not find it very satisfying to hear in the general discussion that there are all these different sectors and that farming will just have to step up to the plate the same as everyone else.  One cannot modify a cow in the way one can modify a car.  There are certain issues and certain realities involved.  We have to eat.  Wind farms are not being built and transmission lines are not being put up in the middle of cities.  One does not hear of all these protests.  Sometimes it is literally like representing a whole different country in respect of some of the issues that are really pertinent to rural Ireland.  </p><p> If the peat-burning power station is removed, one then runs into the issue of what other investment can be made there to support work, jobs and investment and into this issue of critical mass.  It is said that an area does not have a critical mass.  The case for extending the Luas in the city is always better than our case.  It then becomes a vicious circle.  We lose population and we lose young people because of the way the economy is run.  We might achieve some nice desires, such as building a community centre or a football pitch, but more than that is required.  We need a tipping point to make rural Ireland sustainable environmentally but also sustainable from an economic point of view.</p><p> Mr. Stanley-Smith pointed out the problem with draining high-carbon lands but not being able to drain goes back to farmers again.  I assume it also applies to Coillte if it is doing drainage works for forestry, which we are encouraging though I know there is a dispute over what the nature of the trees should be.  To go back again, we have the habitats and birds directives.  Farmers are crippled.  Some 55% of lands in my county are designated.  Farmers are severely restricted.  I met a farmer who was asking to fence off a drain near his land.  He was told by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to go downstream and to put in a sump on a stream to protect freshwater pearl mussels on adjoining lands that were not even his.  </p><p> It is not just that.  The road from Galway to Clifden is running into difficulties on account of running partly through a special area of conservation, SAC.  We have had serious difficulties in upgrading one of our national primary roads in Mayo, the N26, because of freshwater pearl mussels and whooper swans.  I am talking about upgrading and realigning roads that are already there.  A whole area in which there is already settlement is an SAC.  It is an SAC even though there is already significant settlements of human beings in the area.  There is no recognition of this.  It is the same in Glenisland.  We got money to build a bridge but it cannot be built because it is a designated area for freshwater pearl mussels.  As I said at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, wild mushrooms are rarer than freshwater pearl mussels in Mayo.  I am not being facetious but we have to get the balance right.  Whatever we do, we must recognise the additional burden on people in rural Ireland in terms of infrastructure and restricting their lifestyles.</p><p>Farmers were encouraged to invest in the dairy and other sectors to achieve our food production targets under Food Wise 2025.  Are the delegates now making the point that we should scale back on the level of food production and decrease the size of the national herd because of the level of carbon emissions?</p><p> Moneypoint is a coal-fired power station which is proposed to be converted.  I understand there is a similar coal-burning power plant in Wales which has been partially modified for the use of biomass.  The point has been made that there is no sustainable biomass supply in Ireland to decommission the coal-fired power station completely.  What can we learn from the experience of the Welsh power plant?</p></speech>

As such, I am aware of many of the problems of rural life in the county.  Because I am a member of the local area Leader committee I am also aware that people are very good at actually coming up with ways and means to help themselves and innovative solutions if given the funding.  I will not discuss the Leader projects because the programme suffered many problems in the start-up phase, but it is now beginning to get in swing.  There are people, including farmers, who, if given sufficient help through the Leader programme, are quite able to start up new businesses in the locality.</p> <p>  Senator Michelle Mulherin referred to freshwater pearl mussels.  One of the issues at which we have to look is the failure to meet the terms of the water framework directive, for which we are facing severe fines.  The freshwater pearl mussel is an indicator of the purity of water.  Currently, high status water levels are very low.  The idea that we ensure freshwater pearl mussels are protected helps us to ensure we will meet the water framework directive targets.</p> <p>  On food security and exports, Food Wise 2025 came from Food Harvest 2020 which was an industry driven project which the Government expanded into Food Harvest 2025.  We have mentioned that it is up to the Government to work out whether agricultural production should be increased to export products.  In order to be able to export, we need to increase the number of cattle.  Unfortunately, increasing the number of cattle increases the level of greenhouse gases.  We make the point that it is up to the Government to make a decision on whether it is better for the country to increase the amount of agricultural exports knowing that it will increase the level of carbon emissions.  This is a decision the Government and Parliament will have to make.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.197" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charles Stanley-Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#OOO00600"><p>A mistake was made in the days of the Kyoto Protocol that biomass was zero carbon.  That mistake has permeated into European law.  In our opinion it is wrong.  The power station at Drax in the United Kingdom which is being converted to run on biomass is running on biomass imported from the United States and obtained in the cutting down of virgin forests.</p><p>No attempt is being made to regrow those forests, which would get the thing back.  Mr. St. Ledger has spoken about the whole business of how long it takes to recover the carbon by regrowing the trees.  In eastern Europe, virgin forests are being cut down to provide so-called biomass.  If there is any sustainable biomass in the world, it is already being burnt locally.  There is none left for any other country to buy on the world market.</p></speech>

I think this is the Government's position too.  All the advice being received by the Government is that even if we had lots of biomass, it would not make sense to burn it in Moneypoint.  Apart from all the issues that have just been raised by Mr. Stanley-Smith, it would be a bad use of biomass.  We would be better off using biomass for combined heat and power in situ in places that use a lot of heat, rather than burning it for electricity in the peat stations or in Moneypoint.  The development of the grid, of the existing gas-fired power stations and of renewables means we will not need Moneypoint.  We could close Moneypoint well before 2025 without compromising our security of supply or our grid stability.  There is a simply a transition out of coal but not into biomass.  The advice 20 years ago was to switch to gas, but I do not think that advice makes sense now.  We have built other gas stations in the meantime.</p> <p>  I would like to add to what Mr. Stanley-Smith has said on agriculture.  Any sovereign state can make a democratic decision on how to balance its emissions.  This State has already made a decision.  Perhaps it was not subject to that much debate.  A democratically elected Government decided to give agriculture a much easier target than the rest of the economy.  The target reduction for the rest of the economy is 80%.  If we look at the maths of the carbon neutrality target that has been set for the agriculture sector, we can see that by using the agricultural forestry techniques that have been discussed here and by looking at the Teagasc research, we can get between 4 million tonnes and 9 million tonnes of offset from our forests each year.  It might be pushing it to get 9 million tonnes, but we can achieve something between 4 million tonnes and 9 million tonnes.  If that is achieved and all of it is credited to agriculture, it will mean that agriculture will only have a 50% reduction target between now and 2050, compared to reduction targets of between 80% and 95% across the rest of the economy.  This sovereign State has made a democratic decision.  Obviously, we are still talking about a reduction requirement.  It is up to the Government and the farming sector to determine how that can be achieved.  We can shift the emissions around between sectors, but we cannot change the overall envelope.  That is where we do not have wriggle room if we want a liveable climate.</p></speech>

I think there needs to be flexibility and more understanding.  There also needs to be more joined-up thinking between agencies.  That is another problem for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the forest service.  It is linked to the call for a forestry task force.</p> <p>  In order to comply with the nitrates directive, some 16,000 km of fencing is being paid for under GLAS to keep cattle away from watercourses.  If it had been decided that this fencing should be set 3 m or 4 m back - this can still be done as part of an approach that features joined-up thinking - such areas could be planted with mixed native trees which have deep root systems that give them the ability to absorb runoff.  This would help the situation while also creating a resource for farmers.  It has been mentioned that we are not really doing anything with the 400,000 km of hedgerow and scrub in this country.  We are not valuing it.  People are cutting it.  It is being heaped up in piles to be burnt, with no benefit to anybody.  In Austria and France, farmers are working co-operatively to manage hedgerow resources and collect all of this material to use locally.  This feeds into local economic resilience.</p><p>There is a need to start looking at problems and finding solutions.  For example, 16,000 km of fencing being funded to satisfy a nitrates directive is a knee-jerk reaction.  Rather, we should consider using that money to create linear woodlands or ecological corridors.  As I indicated to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, at a forest policy group meeting, such ecological corridors linking rivers which have to be protected in any event would be of benefit in terms of biodiversity, climate and carbon.  It has been scientifically proven that our native trees have natural abilities which can be managed by and become a resource for farmers when they have been given some training.  Rather than it being a problem of having to fence the rivers, that solution would confer a benefit and help local economies.  We need to be look at more flexible arrangements such as that.</p></speech>

There is little of that sort of joined-up thinking in Ireland.</p> <p>  We are here on foot of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly regarding how the State can make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change.  It is a barometer of public opinion.  In light of the repeal of the eighth amendment following the relevant recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, its recommendations on climate change are very far-reaching and illustrate how distant is the Government from the will of the people.</p> <p>  All of our guests have been working in this area for many years.  What is inhibiting Ireland?  On many occasions, Mr. Coghlan has called Ireland the laggard in terms of climate change.  What are the barriers?  What is the resistance?  The witnesses have indicated the measures we can take in terms of energy efficiency, renewables and a just transition, but why is that not being done?  What is the problem?  It is definitely a major problem that Ireland is seen as a serious laggard in the international context.  The measures at which we are looking show that we are way behind.  What is stopping us taking the necessary steps?</p></speech>

To be fair, it is a difficult problem in a number of respects.  The gas is invisible.  Until recently, we thought the effects would be remote from Ireland, either geographically or in time.  It cuts across all sectors.  It is not like the Montreal Protocol, which sought to solve the problem of ozone holes and involved one specific technology being replaced by another.  In that case, a company in the United States was going to make money as a result and, therefore, the US was on board and the protocol was implemented.  It takes a while for the effects to become evident.  The Kyoto Protocol was modelled on the Montreal Protocol but this is a far more wicked problem and involves all sectors.  We are all involved in the pollution in this instance.</p> <p>  Although the long term is getting shorter, this seemed like a long-term challenge at the time of the signing of the Kyoto Protocol.  As we know, politicians, operate in, at most, five-year electoral cycles and 24-hour news cycles so it is challenging to address what are seen as long-term issues.  In addition, the actions required to reduce emissions benefit everybody in a relatively dispersed way such that most people do not notice those benefits, which may be the absence of something happening or, if direct, are unknown.  However, the impact of actions to reduce emissions directly impact on well-organised, very vocal vested interests.  I do not use the term "vested interests" in a prejudicial manner but, rather, to refer to those who have money at stake and who are plugged into policy-making.  Politicians are facing a decision matrix with a large swathe of silent beneficiaries and a smaller concentrated swathe of active opposers of action and that has been the downfall of many proposals over the past 20 years.  To give a brief example, 14 years ago Charlie McCreevy ran a consultation on whether to have a carbon tax.</p><p>The question was "Would you like a carbon tax?"  Oddly enough, most of the people who answered that question said "No thank you very much."  For a start, it was the wrong question to ask.  At the time, the calculations were showing that Ireland would be facing multimillion euro bills if it did not meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol.  The question should have been posed as a choice: Ireland faces this challenge so we can either have a carbon tax and reduce the amount of fines we are to pay on the polluter pays basis, which is the more one pollutes, the more one pays, or we can have higher fines and the money to pay the fines would be taken from PAYE.  This was the actual question, but it was not asked.</p><p> Much of it comes down to the framing of the debate with the public.  It also comes down to trying to engage in a balanced way not only with those who are fearful of the short-term challenges of change but also with the vast majority people who are busy with their lives in terms of every aspect of childcare, healthcare and caring for elderly parents and who are not focused on the threat that appears to be in the distance.  The threat is now hoving more into view and we need to engage those people and have a balanced discussion on the transition we need to make.</p></speech>

We have failed in this in recent years and that is why we have the problems with which we are faced.</p> <p>  Mr. Coghlan referred to retrofitting.  A CSO infographic I have in my possession highlights the fact that between 2015 and this year the heating market in new builds has remained dominated by gas, and that there is little evidence of a shift towards passive house standards, despite the opportunity presented by significant house construction.  What are we going to do?  There has been retrofitting, but it seems that this involved the installation of gas heaters in many instances.  Does this mean more retrofitting into the future?  Mr. Stanley-Smith referred to the retrofitting of his house and the energy efficiency improvements he has made.  During the summer, I looked at the Tipperary Energy Agency.  Demand on it is so great at present that it cannot provide services to the numbers of people who are requesting the type of retrofitting Mr. Stanley-Smith had carried out.  What will we do in that regard?  We have this huge problem whereby the agency is doing the right thing but it does not have the resources.  We are seeing all these barriers obstructing initiatives of this nature.</p></speech>

The fact that I come from Tipperary obviously helps.  We need trusted agencies, and not just in the context of retrofitting houses.  There is also a need to consider the best ways to not use gas and so on.  If we are to discuss putting solar panels on the roofs of schools or farms, we need somebody in a town to whom people can go for advice on the best way to do these things and on the best solar panels or other materials to use.  We need to clone the Tipperary Energy Agency right across the State.  Citizen information bureaus are in almost every town.  We should have a climate change and energy advice bureau in every town where citizens can get advice for themselves.  Everybody has different requirements and different needs.  A trusted agency of that sort operating throughout the country would make a huge difference in facilitating retrofits and community energy initiatives.</p></speech>

Both sessions have been very informative and it has been extremely helpful for members to get the required information.</p><p>I want to start by asking about the agricultural sector and where we believe it is going to go, not just in Ireland but globally.  By 2050, the date we are all talking about, there are expected to be two billion more people living in this world.  How do the witnesses believe that number of people can be suitably fed?  Some are taking land away from forestry.  Do the witnesses believe that genetically modified, GM, food will be part of the solution?  How will we find solutions so that we will have sustainable quantities of food for the entire population?  There will be 9.7 billion people living in this world by 2050.  Where do the witnesses see those figures going?</p><p> From the figures stated here this morning, there seems to be a conflict in terms of how many bovines there are in Ireland.  The Environmental Protection Agency was here this morning and said that there are the same amount of bovines here today as there were in 1990.  I believe there has been a slight contradiction in the evidence given here today.  Will the witnesses provide clarity?</p><p> Will Professor Sweeney talk about methane in more detail?  We had another discussion about it this morning when it was said that methane remains in the atmosphere for 14 years and should be considered on a different level compared with other greenhouse gases.  What is Professor Sweeney's view on that statement?  Where does he believe methane fits in the discussion around emissions, the carbon footprint and ancillary issues?</p><p> I agree totally with Mr. St. Ledger's statement on forestry, in particular the issue of buffer zones around green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments.  It is probably the simplest way to bring forestry into Ireland.  Some communities feel that forestry has been forced upon them because of the poor quality of the land, but if we all took a share of the burden it would be an appropriate way to achieve the level of forestry required.  If we all played our part, it has been suggested that we could increase forestry by over 4% very quickly.  We have to look at it in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The policy has to focus on forestry.  That incentive could be a game-changer for it.  There would be knock-on effects for good quality land and bad quality land.  It does not matter when the linear length is being discussed, but it is something that could be worked into the actual working platform of most farms.</p><p> Where do the witnesses believe digesters fit in, particularly in terms of agricultural waste?  The large number of dairy cows we have at the moment, and dealing with the knock-on effect of the waste produced by them, has to be taken into account.  How could we put that into the system?  Who should be the main driver of it?  My view is that the co-ops should be involved at a very basic level because they have the financial force behind them to drive this idea, but I would like to hear the views of the witnesses.  Do they feel it could be part of the solution?  I also include, along with digesters, solar farms, wind turbine farms and whatever is used to cool milk.  Can those things be made more energy efficient and be included in a smart farming project?</p><p> The final issue I want to raise is the planning of our towns and cities.  Do the witnesses see heat distribution centres as having a role to play?  Perhaps a biomass plant could be attached to a village or town, meaning that steam could power the heat systems.  Does that have a place in Ireland?  Should it be fitted into Ireland's planning framework?  Where could that be initiated, and what is the starting point for it?</p></speech>

We import more food calories than we export.  When Ban Ki-moon came to Dublin a few years ago, he made a very important statement in which he said that it is not enough to be a champion against hunger, but that one must be a champion of climate change.  The two are inseparably linked.</p><p>As far as Ireland is concerned, we certainly produce and export food.  Some 74% of our exports, however, go to developed countries.  We do not supply food to the developing world on any great scale and I do not believe there is any intention in the future to do so.  Irish Aid, however, as part of its programme has a policy of trying to encourage breastfeeding in underdeveloped parts of Africa and trying to discourage the use of powdered milk, for example.  At the same time, we export to and try to encourage the use of powdered milk in the Chinese market on a large scale.  We certainly have to face dichotomies in this regard.</p><p> As to our incomes, the Teagasc farm income figures indicate that one third of dairy farmers earned more than &euro;100,000 last year, which is quite a substantial increase on previous years.  There is certainly scope for some farmers to share a little more of that income with some of the poorer farmers, about whom we talked earlier, in the west and in the beef sector, for example.  </p><p> The other aspect of methane is quite important because methane has been recognised increasingly over the past three IPCC assessment reports as having a more important and significant effect on warming than hitherto recognised.  For example, although methane lasts in the atmosphere for a decade or so, if one is continually putting it into the atmosphere year upon year, one is keeping that effect going.  In the fourth assessment report, methane over a century-long period was considered to have 25 times as important a radiative effect as CO2 .or in other words, a tonne of methane  would be responsible for 25 times as much warming as a tonne of CO2 over that century scale.  In the fifth assessment report, however, this figure was increased to 33 times.  Our emissions inventory from the EPA, for example, recognises this.  A tonne of methane is 33 times more potent than a tonne of CO2 over a century scale.  As has been correctly pointed out, because it does not typically last in the atmosphere for a century, it is not really appropriate to consider it over a century scale.  If we take the 20-year spectrum or horizon, one tonne of methane is 85 times more potent than one tonne of CO2.  That is a measure of how important this gas is, in terms of its impact on warming.  </p><p> As for the national herd, we have seen that methane per cow has increased considerably since 1990.  The more we feed cattle, the more intensive the production system, the more methane they produce.  Although we may have the same cattle numbers even as 1990, prior to BSE and so on, we still have considerably more methane emissions to cope with today.  It is not a gas that we can by any means dismiss.  It is a gas where the move scientifically is towards looking upon it as a more important gas in the shorter timescale, and increasing the radiative effectiveness that it has.  There is no way that we can eliminate it.</p><p> Our negotiators in Europe - maybe not our negotiators but a very strong agricultural lobby in Europe - got methane completely eliminated from the national emissions ceiling directive revision.  To my mind this was very poor and I would love to know what was the logic.  It is not counted, for example, as part of our national emissions ceiling.  It is solely counted now as part of our greenhouse gas emissions.  It is a gas that we certainly cannot ignore.  As regards the 11-year cycle, if we stopped we would have no methane in the atmosphere after 11 years.  Are we really going to stop emitting methane?  If we are not and if we are increasing our herd, year upon year, we are increasing that contribution as time goes on and making its radiative effect even more substantial.</p></speech>

There is a very big opportunity there.  I have talked to Teagasc and to some people in the IFA and I gather there are some problems about how one ensures the end product, the distillate, is safe to deal with.</p><p>There seem to be many technical problems that I thought one could get over.  There seems to be a problem with how they are funded and the opportunity for farmers or whoever wants to do it to get funding for it.  In general, I am as bemused as the Senator as to why there is not so much of it.</p><p> Recently something occurred which I find strange.  An organisation - I cannot remember which - is looking for 10 million tonnes of silage to put into anaerobic digesters now, at a time we all know there is a problem.  There is a difference between carrying out AD on slurry and other things.  Growing silage has the problem of requiring inputs of fertiliser to grow which again have a climate-change problem.  That seems a bit different and somewhat off the wall.  However, I cannot understand why it is not happening for dealing with problems at a local level, a co-op level, that kind of thing.</p></speech>

We have chosen to pick from the 40% of measures that are strongly agricultural.  Funding is available within the RDP.  In our design of the next RDP we could incorporate more of those measures.  One problem is that I believe only 80% of funding is available towards forestry under the RDP.  Most European states get their forest funding under the RDP.  We have chosen not to; we are funding forestry using public funding.  Under EU rules. only 80% of a grant can be paid and the forest service here is claiming that without a 100% grant there would be no uptake whatsoever.  There must be a solution to that, perhaps by making up to 20% or so.  We are missing out on a huge suite of measures.</p> <p>  Linked to food security and the increased population, the World Agroforestry Centre report from 2009 proposes how integrating forests and farming can help with sequestration.  We are inclined to forget that trees are a huge source of food globally.  Fruit, nuts, coffee, chocolate and tea all come from trees.  Food does not just come from crops.  We need to consider the integration of agroforestry.</p></speech>

I ask her to describe the situation that faces the people in those countries where they are forced to migrate.</p><p>Given the type of migration we are witnessing at the moment across the Mediterranean Sea, we need to ask if climate change is contributing to that, as well as to economic issues and wars.  In her experience with Tr&oacute;caire, what is Ms Sharkey's view of what is happening in that regard?  Does she believe migration is related to climate change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cliona Sharkey" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#VVV00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Unfortunately, I could stay here all day and talk to her about what is happening in the countries where we work.  Climate change came onto our agenda about 15 years ago and it came very much from the ground up and through the partners we were working with.  People were struggling to produce sufficient food because of the increasingly unpredictable nature of the rain on which they were depending, and that has spiralled over the past decade.  Significant drought, for example, in southern and eastern Africa now occurs once every two years rather than once every five or eight years.  We are shifting from long-term development to a cyclical humanitarian response.  As an agency that provides a humanitarian response but seeks to enable people to move out of the poverty trap, this is a deep concern and this is why we are so engaged on this issue.</p> <p>  To give a sense of what it is like for people on the ground, members will have seen in recent years the news of significant droughts hitting the headlines such as in east Africa but by that time families have been struggling for months if not years with the impact.  They have been doing everything they can to try to cope, including selling off their assets, including farm tools, animals and so on - the equivalent of their savings.  They have taken their children out of school to send them to work.  They have cut down on the number of meals per day.  People have migrated, often the men, leaving the women and children to try to manage the home while they go to earn income, which is resulting in family breakdown.  When we see the media headlines, the human impacts have been rolling on for months and years ahead of that.</p> <p>  What we are seeing is that each time these incidents happen, it becomes harder and harder for people to bounce back and there is a downward spiral of poverty and vulnerability.  That is why we are so engaged in this issue, given we can see how precarious everything is on the ground.  We simply cannot fathom a situation where we fail to deliver on the Paris Agreement.  We know what that means but we cannot allow ourselves to imagine what it would mean for the people we work with.</p> <p>  Migration is an incredibly complex issue and there is a variety of push and pull factors.  Certainly, we are seeing increasing conflict in some countries we work in, whether local or regional, because of natural resource scarcity and tensions.  Natural resource issues were part of the Syrian conflict, so it is definitely in there among the issues.  We also see seasonal and other periodic migration at a local level due to each of these impacts.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Lombard for his question on global food security, which is an issue we are concerned with.  An important angle we hope to bring to that part of the discussion is that it is not just a question of increasing food production to meet the demands of an increasing population.  We know that we currently produce enough food to feed the population on the planet yet, in the past few years, almost 800 million people did not have access to enough food.  We know the increases in population will primarily be in the low income countries.  The important point is that while increasing production will not solve global hunger, increasing emissions will certainly exacerbate it.  We are conscious this is a complicated issue but, as I mentioned earlier, agricultural and forestry land use will have to be transformed not just in Ireland but globally.  It is something we are looking at in the countries where we work.  We will all have to change how we produce, consume and distribute food if we are to feed ourselves in the future.</p><p> I am not sure whether anyone else touched on genetic modification, GM.  I do not have an analysis of it in respect of Ireland specifically, but it is an issue that arises frequently in a number of the countries where we work.  For the people with whom we work, who are, as members can imagine, small farmers, GM results in challenges.  Because these are patented seeds, it can affect their ability to save seeds, which is a core part of how they manage from year to year, but it can also require external inputs which are not affordable to them on an ongoing basis, and in some cases it can also undermine the fertility and resilience of the soil and the other natural resources on which they rely.  We therefore focus more on diversified farming and rural incomes writ large to support diversity and resilience, working with local circumstances and the agroecological conditions.</p></speech>

Will he give me examples of what they are doing?</p></speech>

The farmers have formed local co-operatives and are managing the resource, not clear-felling.  They are sustainably managing the hedgerows and the small pockets of woodland dotted around their farms.  In Europe there is more of a tradition of integrated farming and forestry.  We lost the forest culture here with the loss of our forests and with the historical events that occurred here, whereas in Europe they continue to understand that farming and forestry are linked.  In eastern Europe, for instance, there is a system called shredding, whereby, come wintertime, they take the tops off the mature trees they have on the farms and dry them and that becomes fodder.<br/><br/>Coming back to food, in ancient Ireland, ash would have been a tree used for fodder.  There are also references to cattle and pigs being fed on acorns in the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>.  Again, farming and forestry in ancient Ireland were agroforestry.  The cattle were grazing in among the mixed woodlands.  This improved the quality of the butter and other dairy products.  Tacitus, I think, in the first or second century described the wonderful Irish butter.  The Romans were waiting for a shipment to come.  We were exporting butter and it tasted wonderful.  Why did it taste wonderful?  The wild cattle, the woodland browsers, were like deer.  The idea of just a field of grass, the monoculture, is not the natural origin of a cow.  Our forestry model is like a guitar we are playing that has just one string.  We are missing all the other strings.  Instead of this one note we should have a symphony of benefits.<br/><br/>I ask the committee to look at hedgerow management.  We have a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that wants to increase food production and wants more grass.  There is in the same Department the forest service, which is charged with increasing our forest cover, and there is the one playing against the other because the Department was penalising farmers on the basic payments for removing scrub.  Scrub is the first part of the forest coming back.  Scrub is what is called a natural succession of species.  Again, we have lost sight of this.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is having scrub removed.  It is again a case of just grubbing it all out.  One sees it piled up.  I live in the hills of east Clare.  One sees the farmers grubbing it out and no one getting any benefit from it.</p><p>It is heaped up and either allowed to rot down or burned.  It is the same with hedgerows.  A serious amount of biomass is involved.  Let us consider the idea of using nets to collect what a farmer cuts.  Somebody should be collecting it because it is embodied sun energy, even if it is only 1 cm in diameter.</p></speech>

What are the views of the witnesses on this?  Professor Fitzgerald and his colleagues were against it and did not think it would work very well.  I asked them whether we should take a whole-of-Government or whole-of-society approach with cross-departmental and cross-sectoral responsibility.  I referred to the Healthy Ireland agenda, which uses this model.  I asked whether it was something we should look at from the Department of the Taoiseach all the way to communities, whereby we get information out on the actions on climate change rather than having another agency using a stick to whip everybody into line.</p></speech>

My sense of this recommendation was that it came out of frustration at a lack of action, which committee members have heard us express at times.  The assembly was reaching for tools that could be used to ensure action, and the committee discussed this with Ms Justice Laffoy when she came before it.  When many of us in this delegation were involved over the course of eight years in seeking to influence the design of the climate law, the focus of Friends of the Earth was not on judicial accountability for action or inaction but on parliamentary accountability.  For us in particular it was about independent evidence, timely planning and a cycle of accountability underpinned by the legal target.  We did not get everything we wanted in the law to drive policy in the sense of legal targets and carbon budgets.  The accountability cycle is there, if not quite in the way we would have liked it to be.  It is not as tight as we would like.  In this context, we saw the Citizens' Assembly reach for the next step, which is bringing the Government to court.  This is not the space in which Friends of the Earth operates but over the years other environmental organisations have sought legal redress from Irish or European courts as a last resort for forcing compliance and action.  If we want to avoid this, we have to put in place stronger measures to ensure action in the first place.  As in most cases, everyone would prefer if we did not have to go to court to get something done if it could be done some other way.</p> <p>  Other colleagues might like to comment more directly on this proposal in terms of whether it should involve new or existing agencies.  We have the Climate Change Advisory Council, which is only just up and running with regard to its existing remit.  There is a discussion about whether it is the right body to have the legal backstop of last resort.  The first step is to put in place a tighter carbon budget over a five-year period and a tighter policy planning regime, and then hopefully we would not need judicial review as a last resort.  Judicial review is always there, and in case it is not known, the existing national mitigation plan is being taken to court by Friends of the Irish Environment on the basis that it does not comply with the existing law.  It will be a very interesting test case in January, albeit rendered politically moot by the fact the mitigation plan will be revised.  It will be very interesting to see whether the plan passes muster legally.</p><p>If nothing else, we know that it has not passed muster in terms of its impact.  </p><p> Others may wish to comment.</p></speech>

It has become an increasing trend.  I would prefer to see litigation not being resorted to because I would rather see the issue of climate change depoliticised as much as possible.  One of the exercises we undertook in the build-up to the climate change Bill was making people accountable to the Department of the Taoiseach on the issue.  It is clear that some of the frustrations Mr. Coghlan discussed resulted from a failure to break down silos.  The Secretaries General will appear before the committee during its next module.  It is important for the committee to find out from them why their Departments were dragging their feet on this issue and not delivering as promised.  If the silos could be broken down institutionally by providing for accountability to either the Taoiseach or a body, it would help.  My preference would be for Government administration to work internally in the first instance, but I suspect that there will always be a resort to litigation.  The important Urgenda case will be going through the Dutch courts in the next four weeks.  It will be a landmark decision for Europe on the basis of intergenerational equity for the young people who are pursuing the litigation.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's first question, I will add to what Ms Sharkey stated.  Based on my experience in Malawi, Zambia and other parts of central Africa, climate change issues are causing Ireland reputational damage there.  We must face up to the fact that, while this is a country that had a tremendous reputation in the developing world, we are now undoing it.  When a farmer asks what Ireland is doing about its emissions to help those countries and we say we are increasing them, it is unconscionable, given the emergency to which the UN Secretary General referred this week.  This is an important consideration for the committee.  Accountability to people elsewhere will become increasingly important for Ireland.  We cannot shirk it by saying we will, first and foremost, look after ourselves.  That would be a narrow, self-defined road to take.</p></speech>

Regarding the recommendation on communicating the need for climate action to the general public, does Professor Sweeney have a view on whether the national dialogue on climate action will be effective?  It appears to have got off to a great start, but I would like to hear his view.  Does Met &Eacute;ireann have a greater role to play in communicating climate change issues to the general public?  That is one of the goals of its current strategy.  Globally, other meteorological services are doing innovative work in this area.  Are Met &Eacute;ireann and RT&Eacute; realising their potential in that regard?</p></speech>

It suffered changes in its chairmanship early on and has only had two meetings, one of which was held in Athlone and successful in sensitising people.  It is important that the general public be involved in this issue as much as possible because we must bring it along in any of the decisions made at the end of the road.<br/><br/>Met &Eacute;ireann has a prescribed climate change function.  While it is true that it has not communicated as part and parcel of that function as publicly as other meteorological agencies, there are signs that this is changing.  There was an important article in <i>The Irish Times</i>a week or so ago in which some of the extreme events this summer were attributed to climate change.  We are seeing some changes taking place.  In Maynooth we work quite closely with Met &Eacute;ireann which is a professional and good body with which to work.</p><p>I would urge it to have a more public approach than it has to climate change.  I recognise that it has limitations.  Forecasters tend to work to shorter timescales than climatologists, which this has to be recognised.  Met &Eacute;ireann is involved in European projects that are dealing with climate change and I am hopeful that this will, over time, enable it to feel more confident about communicating the issues publicly.</p></speech>

My apologies for coming back in on this but we have been watching and engaging in the national dialogue from the outset.  The participatory development is something we believe in.  It is the approach we take in all of the countries where we work supporting people to engage in local decision making and planning.</p> <p>  In terms of climate change, for lots of reasons talking to people is incredibly important.  It gives them an opportunity to engage and shape decisions, especially if it is to be owned by people and to produce outcomes and actions that are fair and equitable.  What was clear from the Citizens' Assembly's first recommendation which the Deputy mentioned was the sense of frustration at the lack of action to date and the call for political leadership.  We think there needs to be an increase in public participation and an expansion and continuation of that dialogue but this needs to be met with a clear, consistent commitment from the Oireachtas around the role it will play.  In terms of concrete outcomes of this committee, we would like to see the report exemplify a clear message and the start of the clear persistent public communication, explicitly cross-party, that the Oireachtas is resolutely committed to ensuring we meet our targets going forward, and that each time the plans and budgets come up the debate will be had about the how and the what in this regard.  There must be a cross-party determined resolute commitment to ensuring we meet our targets and this must be a persistent public communications exercise.  This is needed if we are to win the hearts and minds and to ensure that everyone realises that this is the overwhelming public interest to enable us to pursue all of our social goals. </p></speech>

Is the renewable energy support scheme effective in this regard?  It would be marvellous if all public buildings, including school buildings, community halls and so on, could generate electricity for themselves and for sale into the national grid.  Does Mr. Coghlan believe this particular scheme will effect that type of change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.249" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018091200002#ZZZ00600"><p>I will start with this question and then return to the question on communication.  We welcomed the renewable energy scheme, RES.  It was a long time in the pipeline.  It is one of the most significant things this Government has done in the energy sector in terms of climate change.  It is a really positive development, particularly at community level but not at the scale the Deputy mentioned.  At the bigger scale it is good.  It is good in that as it is rolled out it will have a specific community pot for community led projects such as the Templederry community wind farm, which is the only community-owned wind farm in Ireland, which took ten years to complete.  Hopefully this type of scheme, solar or wind, will become easier in the future because there will be a specific pot for them.  On the issue raised by Mr. Stanley-Smith, as stated in the NESC report on wind and public acceptance of a few years ago, we need trusted intermediaries and support agencies to help communities gear up to do this.  As I said, the scheme is a really positive development.  Equally positive in the RES is the provision that up to 20% of the share equity of developer-led schemes must be offered for purchase by the local community to buy.  How much of that will be taken up and how much can be afforded by local communities is questionable but the offering changes the conversation because this means the renewable transition is not something being done to a community by large companies.</p><p>It is felt that it is something one is able to participate in either by leading something oneself or in partnership with a business.  The RES is really positive in that way.  What it lacks is measures at what we would call micro-generation level, which is more what I was talking about and being asked about.  They basically said they could not deal with that in this scheme.  They had to get on with the scheme and they would come back to micro-gen.  The first nod in that direction is the household-focused grant for solar PV but it is only for households.  While that is laudable and useful, as I said earlier the real opportunity for solar is on a community and small-business scale, that is, schools, sports clubs, community halls and farm buildings, which is on a smaller scale than RES.  We have seen how we may differ from an analysis with the agricultural lobby sector so far.  In this case I can say, and I do not think it will mind me saying it as I have said it already on a number of occasions, we are one and the same with the IFA.  We think there needs to be a payment for electricity that is spilled onto the grid from solar from community-owned micro-generation, whether that is schools, sports clubs or farm buildings.  That is what would really open up mass participation, not just of individual households but of that community spirit, but it is not yet provided for either by the RES or the solar grant.  It is a gap which the Minister has said he is keen to address but as yet there is no sign that is happening.  The European Renewable Energy Directive which was made this year says that ultimately, although it does not give a specific date, electricity that is spilled to the grid will have to be paid for.  We do not have to wait for that to roll out and we should start the process now of designing that scheme in a way that is fair for everyone.</p></speech>

Are they aware of anything in that regard?</p> <p>  Another question is on the growth of plants that have high levels of protein.  We were talking about having to move from a meat-based diet to a plant-based diet, and a mix of whatever.  I understand from the previous report that we did on the agriculture committee that we import a huge number of protein plants for animal feed.  Are the witnesses aware of the potential that may or may not be there?</p> <p>  The other question is on the generation of ethanol from the use of sugar beet.  As we know, we had a strong tradition of growing sugar beet in this country.  It now appears sugar beet is a good opportunity to generate ethanol.</p> <p>  On the task force to fund the transition for the midlands, I am from Offaly and energy generation is very much part of our DNA through ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na and the massive employment it provided for generations.  We experienced some emigration but certainly not anything like what was experienced in other counties over the years.  Practically, how would that be done?  One is looking at mostly men who are highly skilled in a particular area.  How will they be retrained to work in something new or whatever?  We need to do this but we are trying to figure out how we can do this in a way that makes the transition as smooth and pain-free as possible.  We do not want the message to go out that we want to close them all down and they will all be unemployed.  Nobody wants that.</p><p>It is for us to try to figure out how we can do this in a way that helps us to do what we want, which is to reduce our emissions, and ensure that, as previous speakers have said, we carefully manage rural people who are living and working in what I consider to be vibrant rural economies.</p></speech>

That is of great importance both for the committee and the wider world.  The BBC has accepted that climate change is real.  RT&Eacute; should consider implementing a similar policy.</p> <p>  On retrofitting, fitting solar panels or heat pumps is quite a technical job.  When my house was being renovated, there was a specific team to fit the solar panels and another to fit the heat pump.  The level of training required to fit a heat pump is equivalent to that which people such as those referred to by Deputy Corcoran Kennedy already have.  Obviously, they would have to be retrained but that is not a significant obstacle. There is a lot of work available in retrofits.  A point that has not been mentioned is that we need approximately 100,000 retrofits a year in order to be able to achieve what our target.  It is not currently being met and there is a huge opportunity for more people to get involved in doing retrofits and bring us to that target.</p></speech>

The issue of the current workers in fossil fuel plants is one matter and there is also the broader community development aspect.  In regard to the issue of the workers, which Ms Sharkey and I were just discussing, one must ask them their view rather than presume to know what they want.  I agree with Mr. Stanley-Smith that there is a lot of work available in retrofitting but one must engage with the workers rather than presume to know what they may want to do if their employment ceases in three or four years time.</p> <p>  Although it is not quite the same situation, an abrupt decision - at least from the point of view of the workers - was made to close the Littleton briquette factory last year.  Coincidentally, a conference on just transition involving the Minister, the head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others took place a few days after the announcement and facilitated an engagement between the Minister, the ICTU and local unions.  That led to a relatively productive and successful process, firstly between the company and the unions.  State agencies became involved and were able to offer the workers training opportunities and assistance to transition to other jobs.  That took place fewer than 18 months ago.</p> <p>  We must not take too long to reduce the usage of peat but we will have sufficient time if we start now.  I earlier drew an analogy involving US companies.  In the case of the Littleton briquette factory, it was somewhat easier to get worker engagement as someone else fired the starting gun, that is, a nasty, faceless chief executive in the US decided those jobs were going and then we all rallied around.  In the case of peat, someone here must fire the starting gun and state that this is going to happen, which is why no one is doing it.  Everyone is shying away from it.</p> <p>  The process must be somewhat openended.  We do not know exactly what the outcome will be in terms of the training opportunities, etc., but we should first have round-table talks involving the just transition commission, the company, unions, State agencies and local stakeholders such as Irish Rural Link and others because the broader question is it is not about those particular workers and plants or factories but, rather, the broader community development support that is needed to allow the community to envisage what a fossil-free future looks like.  That is what climate dialogue is about, in a way, and it has a very specific usefulness and resonance in a place such as the midlands in determining what our communities will look like in five or ten years if we no longer depend on fossil fuel jobs or fossil fuels to heat our homes, etc.</p><p>I mentioned Templederry earlier.  It is worth noting that that did not start with the idea of doing something about renewable energy.  It started as a community development project with an open-ended discussion about what can be done in the community to provide jobs and futures for families.  After a process of a number of years, they came up with the idea of a community-owned wind farm.  In the video my colleague made, John Fogarty, the chairman, stands in front of it and says that it is his child's college fund.</p><p> We need to engage with the workers and the communities and their representatives and work with them and support them to forge the future that they want and we all need.</p></speech>

Many years ago, when we were trying to get the split between tier 1 and tier 2 on the reporting of methane, we sent cattle with nosebags around the place to capture methane but it is not really feasible to try to capture methane for grass-fed cattle that are out in the open.  There may be some test cases of doing so in barns or in milking parlours, but I am not aware of any substantial efforts in this area.  I may be mistaken.</p> <p>  Ethanol is a great fuel if we can produce it commercially.  Brazil is the market leader in this area and powers a lot of its transport with ethanol from sugar cane.  I do not think we have the resources in Ireland to do that without using up valuable land which would otherwise be producing food.</p> <p>  Similarly there are bio-diesel plants in Hungary at the moment.  They are not in Ireland and I think the same issue exists as to what kind of feed stock we would use for them.  I cannot help the committee too much, I am afraid.</p></speech>

The re-generation of mixed birch and willow and all its woodlands has been a by-product of what Bord na M&oacute;na has been doing over the years.  NewERA was set up to look into a merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na but I believe it was looking at large-scale, industrial applications which is the wrong way to go.  We seem always to be thinking of huge scale, industrial processes.  I am afraid that, if Bord na M&oacute;na is left to its own devices, it will be encouraged to do clear-felling of these sites for pellets as greenwashing and a pretence of supplying green energy.  The way to go with that resource is to look at small-scale coppice management with trained local teams.  The value of that resource could then be kept in local communities.  It could provide alternative employment for people who were engaged in peat production.</p></speech>

Today, I will discuss our forthcoming report that carries out a gender impact assessment of the tax benefit policy in Ireland over the past ten years.  The work has been funded by the Parliamentary Budget Office and the motivation behind the work is the commitment in the programme for Government to being able to gender proof budgets.  We believe this is making a practical contribution in terms of being able to do that.</p> <p>  To give an overview of what I will talk about today, I will touch briefly on gender impact assessments and what the ESRI has done to carry one out.  I will present some results.  I know that we, in the ESRI, like to bring lots of numbers with us but I promise there will not be lots of numbers.  We can happily forward the members a copy of the report, but I will give them an overview of the results from the report and finish with some conclusions.</p> <p>  What is a gender impact assessment?  The European Commission would say it is the estimation of different effects of a policy, be they positive, negative or neutral, in terms of gender inequality.  I am aware the committee has been looking into the area of gender budgeting, so we see this as being part of that gender budgeting process.</p> <p>  The aim of carrying out a gender impact assessment is to provide evidence to policymakers.  It is to try to identify if there are potentially negative effects of policies and, in having that awareness, if something can be done to reduce those negative effects.  It is to try to help and improve decision-making and planning.</p> <p>  Internationally, we know that approximately half of OECD countries are doing some form of gender budgeting.</p><p>Looking at work the committee has done in the past, it is clear that there is quite a variation in what exactly is being done.  Our report uses the ESRI tax-benefit model, known as SWITCH, to carry out a gender impact assessment of tax-benefit policies.  Some members may be aware of the model which has existed for a number of decades in Ireland.  It takes a representative sample of the population and one can use it to determine the distributive impact of tax-benefit policy changes.  To date, members will probably have seen it in use around budget time.  It allows us to see what changes happened and who they impacted.  Generally, we look at deciles and whether poorer or richer people were impacted by tax-benefit policy changes.  Are different families affected differently?  Is it couples with one or two earners or single persons?  That is what it has been used for to date.  The addition we have made to the model now allows us to look at the impact of policy according to gender.</p><p> The model covers income tax, the universal social charge, PRSI, cash benefits and some non-cash benefits also.  There are two main advantages to having the model available and integrating gender impact assessment within it.  First, the model is already in use in government in five Departments.  As of this morning, a new version of the model was circulated which integrates gender impacts.  In doing this work, we have allowed for it to continue to be done in future within Government.  The second advantage of the model is that it allows one to look at changes before they are made.  If one is trying to gender proof a budget, one can carry out an analysis before any changes are made to determine what the impact of tax-benefit policy changes will be by gender.  That can help to inform one's decisions.</p><p> One might ask why tax-benefit policies would have any gender impact.  It is not as if there are different tax rates or benefits which men and women receive, with the exception of maternity or paternity benefit.  However, tax-benefit policy will have different impacts according to gender because men and women tend to occupy different roles in society.  For example, there are fewer women in employment and more of them are involved in caring roles than are men.  We saw in recent years in relation to pension coverage that because women may tend to spend more time out of the workplace and have fewer social insurance contributions, they may be entitled to a lower level or rate of benefits on foot of policy changes.  All of these differences between men and women lead to different incomes and entitlements to benefits and, therefore, to differing impacts from tax-benefit policy changes.  For example, 99% of one-parent family payment recipients are women and 75% of carer's allowance recipients are women.  Men are more likely to receive jobseeker's payments, in particular long-term payments, and are also more likely to be in receipt of disability allowance.  Those are some of the benefit differences we see, but we also see differences in income.  Men are more likely to be in employment and to work full-time than women and where women are in the workforce, it is more likely to be in part-time employment.  There are also gender pay gaps whereby women are twice as likely to receive the minimum wage.  All of those differences in income are going to lead to differences in tax liabilities.  With a progressive tax system, any changes on the tax side will have a stronger effect on men than on women.  It is not entirely the case that we are looking at negative effects on women.  There could be negative effects on both genders of different changes.</p><p> In carrying out this work, it is pretty straightforward to consider single men and women and to determine how tax-benefit policy impacts on them.  Where they are single, we do not have to worry about the fact that they may be living with partners.  As such, we focus on single persons and on couples separately.  When we look at couples, it is much more difficult to determine what the gender impact of a tax-benefit policy will be.  Where people live as a couple, it is difficult to say whether a policy impacts on both persons equally.  For that reason, we looked at two extreme examples.  We looked at what we call "full income sharing" where we assume couples share all of their income fully and then we look at the other extreme example whereby it is assumed that they do not share any income.  Members can think about this in the context of their own lives.  If one is living with one's partner, does one put all one's money into a joint bank account or keep some or all of it in a separate account?  Does one party pay the mortgage while the other person pays other bills with things being evenly balanced as a result?  We never know fully how couples share which is why we have modelled these two extreme examples.</p><p> A simple example in this context might involve a man earning &euro;30,000 who pays income tax and USC.  A policy change may change his income.  For example, if the standard rate of tax is increased by 1%, it will result in a reduction of approximately 1% in his take-home pay.  On the other hand, one might have a woman who is not working but is caring for an elderly relative and receiving carer's benefit of approximately &euro;11,000 a year.  If a policy change reduces carer's benefit by &euro;5, it will result in a reduction in her income of approximately 7%.</p><p>If that is applied to a couple, that averages out at around 3% between them, if we assume that they share all those losses in the same way.  That illustrates that changes can have more of an impact on one member of a couple than another.</p><p> What do we think is more realistic?  Previous ESRI research has tried to look into this and see exactly how couples share income.  We tend to find in the vast majority of cases that couples share a large proportion of their income - not all of it, but a good chunk of it.  That is probably a more realistic option.  Who gets what income can matter in terms of how it gets spent.  If one partner is without an independent income, that might have an impact on that partner weighing in on decisions about how the money is spent in the household.  If one person is not working and one person is working, maybe the person working has more of a say on how money gets spent.</p><p> There is research on this.  In the UK, for example, they changed the child benefit payment.  It used to be paid as a tax credit, so generally the man used to get it.  It was changed to a benefit that the mother would generally receive.  Looking at how money was spent when those changes happened, women were spending more money on children and also spending more money on themselves.  Who gets what can matter and that is why we have done these two extreme examples.</p><p> In terms of our results, we have focused in the report on how tax benefit policy has had an impact on the disposable income of men and women over the past ten years.  There is no real gender impact among single people.  There was not much of a difference in the impact of tax benefit policy between men and women who were single.  Singles with children lost out more so than singles without children.  That was largely driven by cuts to child benefit and other welfare cuts.  There was again no huge gender difference, but it is worth bearing in mind that single, lone parents tend mainly to be female rather than male.</p><p> Couples, assuming that they shared all their income, did not lose out much more sharply than singles.  In terms of the individual income within couples, however, there were differences.  In the case of couples without children who were not sharing their income at all, the impact on them of tax benefit policy was roughly equal.  In the case of couples with children, there was a gender impact.  Women were more affected.  Their individual incomes were cut more sharply due to tax benefit policy.  It is noticeable that those differences were driven by the lower part of the income distribution.  If we take those cases where women were losing out more than men, it was lower income women losing out more so relative to men.</p><p> That illustrates those differences between men and women and the different roles they occupy.  We looked at results by economic status to see whether there were differences if we compared working men with working women.  There was not much of a difference there.  The differences were being driven by women out of work compared with men out of work.  If we know that neither men nor women in work were losing out more due to tax benefit policy, but we know there are many more men in work than women, those different roles and those different employment rates of women can account for a lot of where these gaps are coming from.</p><p> A positive can be taken from that.  Female participation rates have been rising in recent years so that would suggest that any gap in the impact of tax benefit policy by gender might close as female participation rates rise.</p><p> I did not want to get too bogged down in the detail and results of this work because it is looking back over a time period.  This tool is now available.  It is a practical tool in how to implement gender budgeting and carry out gender impact assessments.  The advantage is that it can be used in advance of changes happening and before policy has been decided.  It is available to Departments so this could continue.  For example, it is in use in the social impact assessment.  The model is used to see if certain income groups have lost out by more or less due to policy.  It could be an addition there.</p><p> The ESRI focused on gender proofing of budgets and gender impact assessments.  The programme for Government discusses wider equality proofing and this method of separating people by gender could also be done on other grounds.  It could look at details by age, family status and disability status.  There is potential to expand it out even further.</p><p> If the committee has any questions, I would be happy to-----</p></speech>

It is a big difficulty for them.  Dr. Keane went through some of the items that are included in the income of somebody on social welfare.  Will she outline what is excluded under the SWITCH model?  The model can only take into account certain kinds of income where there are outgoings.</p> <p>  The illustration on carers was probably provided for simplicity.  However, depending on the household, a person in receipt of the weekly full-time carer's allowance payment of &euro;214 will usually also receive a fuel allowance, part of a child dependant allowance and what most people still call the respite payment, which is paid biannually if carers want to receive it that way.  Does the ESRI apply that to everything?  Are all pre-tax earnings of somebody who is working, which would include overtime, bonuses, etc., included?  In the model provided, that is the main payment.  However, there are significant other payments.  That may be a problem with the model.  It should be stated that not everything is included.</p></speech>

For example, unless the ESRI has changed the model, it is not possible to value a medical card whereas, as between a working family and a non-working family, a medical card in the lives of those on low income is a rather valuable benefit to have, even if it one cannot state, for example, that it is worth &euro;5 a week.</p></speech>

In terms of what is captured, the model is based on the survey of income and living conditions.  As the Deputy stated, an advantage of that is somebody can be in receipt of a benefit and other add-on benefits.  We capture the vast majority of those benefits, such as fuel allowance, housing assistance payments, and rent and mortgage supplement.  All of those are taken into consideration.  The really interesting point is that the CSO actually goes out and looks up the administrative data.  Even though it is a survey, the CSO has people's PPS numbers and its interviewers go out and find out what benefits people are getting.  That helps inform our model.  We can see people are getting carer's allowance plus, perhaps, as I stated, fuel allowance and housing assistance payments or other benefits.  We take those into account.</p> <p>  Some non-cash benefits up until now, as the Deputy said, would not have been included but as of this year, we have tried to place a value on medical cards for the reason the Deputy discussed.  If I have a medical card, I will lose it if I take up employment, which can be awful.  It is not a cash loss for me but it can be a large disincentive.  At present we are working on trying to value medical cards, not only based on how much they cost the Government, which pays an amount per medical card holder.  We are also building in information in the data.  There is a lot of information on how often people go to GPs, if they have been in hospital and how many prescriptions they are getting.  We are trying to put values on all of those, as people who are very ill and use the card a lot may place a much higher value on it than those who do not use it.</p></speech>

Is it correct that her analysis suggests that the budget cuts to benefits such as one-parent family payment and child benefit over the past ten years have disproportionately hit women?  Is it the view of the ESRI that women who are lone parents and couples with children are more likely to be affected by such cuts?</p><p>Dr. Keane alluded to tax increases or reductions being more likely to impact on a man.  What about indirect charges?  Have they been looked at?  A big and polarised debate for us as policymakers is whether public services should be paid for through progressive central taxation, as we would say, or by user charges such as those for water, bins and parking etc.  They have multiplied over recent years.  We have argued generally that user charges versus progressive taxation are regressive and disproportionately hit the less well off.  Is there any analysis as to the gender impact of one versus the other?  From what Dr. Keane is saying, I take it that if tax generally affects men more, then user type charges as a way to fund services would be regressive not just in respect of income inequality but also gender inequality.</p></speech>

The impact tends to be the same within couples because they are co-sharing a property.  From memory, we did not separate that out.  We did break down the results as to how much is due to different taxes versus benefit changes.  If there were massive disparities in property ownership among men and women, for example if all single women did not own their own property and single men did, then there would be differences.  We did not tend to see much of a difference of income tax and property tax hits among groups such as single people.  As I said, within couples we are assuming that it is divided between them.</p> <p>  It is really difficult to get at the information on user charges for other things, even if we think about indirect taxation.  Currently, we are expanding the model to take account of indirect taxes such as valued added taxes, VAT, and carbon taxes.  It is relatively easy to get our heads around how that impacts on income groups to see if those poorer or richer are paying more.  I cannot think of how that is possible by gender.  I do not know how we could divide out and assign by gender costs among people living in a household which pays for all of these things together.  I do not think that is practical.  We have tried to focus on something where we can provide a practical application and use by Government.  Wider gender budgeting would probably examine whether people are paying more or less for different services.  An example would be whether certain education training courses are mainly availed of by men or women and if there is a gender impact.  In a way this work feeds into wider budgeting so there would be additional work on top of this.  We are not saying that this is it.  We feel though that people's cash and disposable incomes are an awful lot of what influences their well-being, so that is why we focused on these cash and non-cash transfers where we can.  I am not sure that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

We can track who is getting what in respect of income.  We can follow what income men get.  Even in the example I gave we can see who is getting different earnings and benefits but what we cannot see is how exactly they are spending that.  Therefore, even if we have information on what the household is spending it is very difficult to break that down into who is actually paying for it.  Perhaps Mr. Roantree might want to comment.</p></speech>

The survey on income and living conditions, SILC, from where we take most of this information, will say how much the main respondent to the survey got and how much his or her partner got.  That allows us more scope on the income and expenditure side.  There is also the conceptual point of whether user charges or, in particular, indirect taxes are regressive.</p><p>It is not always clear that one wants to measure those as a percentage of income.  For example, when looking at increases in the main rate of VAT, rather than exemptions, there is a good case for taking changes in those taxes as a percentage of expenditure and looking at that also.  One would get some picture of the distributional impact of indirect taxes by looking at that against income but it is also important to take into account that some people, particularly at the bottom of the income distribution, may have very high expenditure as they have temporarily low incomes.  They seem to spend much without any income because they might be running down savings as they are temporarily out of work.  An important conceptual point in thinking about indirect taxes is the question as to what is the appropriate base from which to assess progressivity or regressivity.  It is something that may come up in the forthcoming budget if carbon taxes are to be increased, as is being suggested in some papers.  We will look at and go into more detail on that when the time comes and consider the appropriate way to think about whether it is progressive or regressive.</p><p> On a related point, it may be important to think about assessing the package of measures as a whole rather than each individual component.  For example, carbon taxes may be increased for some environmental elements but not every tax is necessarily progressive.  It may be more important to think about what the package as a whole looks like.  For example, one would consider whether the 2019 budget is progressive or regressive rather than picking out each individual measure.  It is better to take a look at the entire package taken together, which is something we will pull together some time after the budget in the quarterly economic commentary we produce.  It tends to come before this committee or another one.</p></speech>

It is interesting that three quarters of those receiving carer's allowance are women and that more women are in caring roles.  I presume the witnesses mean this is at home, childminding, nursing or teaching.  Are they "internal" carers?  What is the most prohibitive factor that stops women earning the same as men?  Is it education, the cost of child care or the cost of living?  Are there one or two areas that are prohibitive for women?  Recent studies indicate that if there are five criteria for a job, a man would apply if he met two or three of them, whereas a woman is likely to want to meet all five of them.  That is despite women multitasking.  Is there a particular area that could be pinpointed where it is prohibitive to women earning the same as men?</p></speech>

If men and women were working at the same rates - if the female participation rate was the same - we would not expect to see massive impacts because of gender.  There is a gender pay gap and women are more reliant on minimum wages than men but this goes from the gender impact to wider gender budgeting.  Wider gender budgeting would consider the fact that in Ireland there are lower female participation rates than for males and we are slightly below the OECD average, particularly for women with children, so it is about delving into who are the groups that are not participating.  We know women are now as educated or more educated than men, so we do not believe education is driving this.  Much focus has been put on childcare costs and we know that within the OECD we have some of the highest childcare costs, particularly for lone parents, so it is good that the affordable childcare scheme is being introduced.  We know that if childcare is subsidised, it should be done in a flexible manner and enough hours should be provided to have a knock-on effect on the labour supply of women.</p> <p>  We can also consider wider policy.  We all love to speak of Sweden as "Utopia", as I would call it, but it has sharing of parental leave and a "use it or lose it" policy.  There is a certain amount of parental leave and if the father does not use it, the mother loses out as well.  That has been shown to increase female participation rates and, perhaps, reduce discrimination.  If we feel that women will perhaps be discriminated against if they are of child-bearing age, or if men of child-bearing age are just as likely to be out of work as well, it will equalise the issue and improve access for women to the labour market.  It would perhaps reduce discrimination in the workforce as well.  The public sector is always seen as a sort of role model for the private sector in offering work-life balance initiatives.  It will become more important in an economic sense, as the labour market gets tighter, not to have women outside employment if they want to be in work.  There are barriers.</p> <p>  Along with childcare there is elder care.  If we know that many carers are caring for elderly relatives or parents, we should ensure there is access to home care packages to help women into employment as well.</p></speech>

These days very few people work 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. compared with ten years ago, with more flexible hours.  Do the witnesses have any ideas on that?</p></speech>

We can consider other research evidence regarding those policies, including internationally.  We have seen advancements in Ireland where we now have a few weeks of paternity leave.  In countries where it is offered to both genders, it should not be seen as a male-female thing: it is always a bit harsh to think men do not want to spend any time with their children and do not want to have those options open to them.  It is also partly a mindset.  The husband of a friend of mine decided to go on a four-day week to help out with their three young children.  It was almost a shock at the start in his company, but now more men are asking him how he did it and realise they can avail of parental leave.  It is mainly about changing mindsets and that is where legislation comes in.</p> <p>  Earlier I mentioned Sweden in the context of paternity leave.  Until it introduced a "use it or lose it" policy, where a certain amount of parental leave was ring-fenced for men, there was not much of an impact on expanding parental leave in terms of female participation and closing gaps.  The change happened when it became almost mandatory for the father to avail of parental leave as well.  It becomes normal and more part of society with both genders as likely to want to avail of those family friendly policies.</p></speech>

Again, we can observe the people who get family income supplement or working family payment, and we can assign that to them.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that lone parents have experienced a sharper loss in income.  We do have to bear in mind, as I am sure she is fully aware, that there are always trade-offs.  Yes, there has been a slightly sharper loss for lone parents in the last few budgets but the aim was to increase participation rates, particularly by female lone parents, and increase their employment.  We are seeing one side where tax benefit policy may have reduced their income but we have to bear in mind that the aim was to increase employment rates.  In the next year we would like to get our hands on administrative data on all lone parents in order to see whether the changes, which were fully rolled out by 2015, had a positive impact on the employment of lone parents.</p> <p>  It is important to realise that a lot of our gender budgeting work is not narrow and that we do not look at things in isolation.  While the income of those groups may have been cut, we look at whether there was a positive impact on employment income, which is something we hope to look at this year also.</p></speech>

Certainly in the budgets of 2014 and 2015, according to the ESRI's reports, lone parents were the highest recipients of benefits - Professor Tim Callan compiled those reports at that time - simply because of the rate increases and, particularly, the expansion of family income supplement.</p></speech>

There have been massive changes to that.  The age limit has been brought back to seven years of age.  While there are negative impacts to changing that system, in a way they may not be as large as we thought because working family payment and entitlement to the jobseeker's transition payment is stepping in to close that gap.  We will see the impact of tax benefit policy in reducing the income of lone parents.  This is one side of what we are looking at - the impact of tax benefit.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the take up is much less effective and more difficult, and not just for lone parents.  People on very low pay often have two or three jobs.  In a tax credit model a person has to keep changing the application to whoever is paying social welfare or to an employer.</p><p>In England and the North, it causes enormous distress at different times to different people, partly because the authorities are trying to make changes in real time whereas our system operates on an annual basis.</p></speech>

I wish to return to the issue we are here to examine.  If there was a budget presentation as we historically know it and then a budget presentation that was primarily gender-proofed, can our guests outline briefly how we would see the differences?  What would we be looking out for if a gender-proofed budget was introduced this year as distinct from the budgets we have seen in the past?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-12a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Claire Keane" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018091200002#BB01400"><p>The major advantage of this type of modelling is that it can be used before the changes happen, so it is not necessary to wait for a policy change in order to discover if it is going to impact upon men and women differently.  Departments have this and are using it for pre-budget analysis.  It is used by the Government in terms of budget secrecy as well so it can look at different changes.  It has been used in the past.  One can see in budget documents reports from this model in terms of distributional impact.<br/><br/>If one wishes to add a gender aspect to that, one can relatively simply use this model and propose five different changes and see which one might be preferable.  They are all going to generate the same amount of income or they are all going to cost the same but using this methodology one can compare the five and see which is causing the largest gaps.  It is not like I have an ideal gap where I can say that it is okay if women lose out by 2% more than men, it is about comparing the alternative budget options.  If there is one where it emerges that women are losing out by a lot and men are gaining by a lot or <i>vice versa</i>, at least that is helping to inform the decision.  This is given in percentage terms so, very simply, it will show the percentage impact on men's and women's incomes if one makes a change or suite of changes.<br/><br/>That is why we are saying it is quite practical.  It provides numbers for comparison.  One can say, &quot;If we bring in this budget package this will be the gender impact&quot; and one can compare it with the gender impact of a similar one of similar cost.  It is for the policymakers to decide what they feel is acceptable.  Of course, there will be competing objectives.  One could have one that is gender neutral but perhaps regressive or changes that are progressive and perhaps not so gender neutral.  Unfortunately, deciding is a balancing act for policymakers.  It is ultimately their decision as to which is the most acceptable.</p></speech>

Does it hope to be able to use its model and produce a report based on that?</p></speech>

That is generally done by income groups and on whether poorer or richer groups lost out.  We do a larger piece for the quarterly economic commentary in December.  Now that we have this incorporated into the model and if we decide there are some interesting findings, we could include some gender impact tables.</p><p>That piece will usually contain distribution analysis by income group, income decile or family type.  It would show whether it was couples with one earner, couples with two earners, single people or retired people who lost or gained the most.  It could be in addition to that.  </p><p> In fairness, this has only been given to Departments today so I cannot be too hard on them.  Officials are probably sitting somewhere giving out about me and saying "Give us a break" or "Give us a chance".  However it is available now and, now that it is there, a new version of the model will be given to users every year for budget analysis.  Ideally, we see this being used in the future and in next year's budget before changes actually happen.  As it is now, it could also be used on the gender side.</p></speech>

We appreciated the impact of the witnesses' work on the work of the committee, an impact which is important to recognise, and on the work of the Parliamentary Budget Office.  It has been a very worthwhile experience.  With that, I thank everyone for attending.  As there is no further business, we will conclude our proceedings.</p></speech>
