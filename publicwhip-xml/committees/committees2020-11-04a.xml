Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed. As previously agreed, the minutes will be published.</p> <p>  I now propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters before resuming in public session to deal with correspondence. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.7" nospeaker="true" time="16:30:00" ><p>The committee went into private session at 4.32 p.m. and resumed in public at 5.25 p.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110400002#F00100"><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members also are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The first group of correspondence for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee.  Nos. 151B and 171B, from the Ceann Comhairle, dated 12 and 20 October, respectively, concern the leaving certificate calculated grades system, which we discussed at our meeting on Wednesday, 7 October.  It is proposed to note it formally now.</p> <p>  On the basis of that correspondence we decided to write to the Committee on Procedure, and No. 171B is the response to our correspondence and concerns the wider issue of the committee&rsquo;s orders of reference.   In summary, the response does not accept this committee&rsquo;s request for an extension of its remit by way of amendment to Standing Order 218. The response points to Standing Order 218(10) as the path for the committee to request an extension to its remit.  Standing Order 218(10) provides for the Committee of Public Accounts to make a submission to the Committee on Procedure for an extension to its remit and to make the case that a specific examination does not have to take place in the context of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The letter of the 12 October stated that a decision will issue within one week from receipt of any such submission.  It is also proposed to note this item.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy has raised this item of correspondence.  I suggest that we put this to the test.  A situation has arisen with the national children's hospital where the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform expressed doubts yesterday about the timeline for its completion.  We are being told clearly that if we make a submission, it will be considered by the Committee on Procedure.  While we do not agree with having to go through this route, we are left in a position where a major issue is happening.  There is a public expectation that we can deal with it.  We are being told that there could be delays in the national children's hospital and there is no information on the timeline.  The Government and its representatives are expressing doubts that it can be delivered on time.  There was substantial engagement with the previous Committee of Public Accounts and it is important that we be able to deal with this.  The strictures being laid down to us might mean that we would have to deal with some minor or major matter from 2018 or 2019 but not the here and now where there is a major matter of public interest on the spending of public money which we need to be able to deal with.  I suggest the committee makes a request to the Committee on Procedure that we be able to bring in the HSE and the chairperson of the board of the national children's hospital under this Standing Order, and that we use this method to see whether we can achieve that.  I think it is very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110400002#F00200"><p>We had several hearings with different entities on the children's hospital.  I raised this last week with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>This change is fundamental.  Value for money cannot just be about the past.  If we are to learn, surely we have got to look at where there is a process failure.  One of the aspects we dealt with when we had hearings here was the double tender process and what a failure that was.  The idea that we cannot track this in real time is nonsensical.  Granted, we have the handcuffs on insofar as our having to look for an extension of our remit but it really highlights the difficulty this committee is going to have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110400002#G00200"><p>I agree 100% with that.  I propose we write to the Committee on Procedure and ask them to outline precisely the process for amending Standing Orders of the House.  When we get that answer, members of the committee can consider through our own parties and groups whether we seek to do that.  Like Deputy Catherine Murphy, I agree that the Kerins ruling has been applied overzealously to try to shut down this and indeed other committees.  This is proof of it now, where, as Deputy Catherine Murphy has said, we had the national children's hospital people in previously very specifically about current matters.  In fact, they advised us in writing at a later date that they would never be in a position to tell us how much it would cost.  Equally, I would say that when we ask them the question of when they will be finished, the next reply that will come will say: "We haven't a clue".  Therefore, either we seek to change this Standing Order through our own political groupings or we write to the Committee on Procedure asking that it consider renaming this committee to something like the committee for after the horse has bolted.  I also want to put on record that I understood I was being put on the Committee on Procedure but it seemed that changed once this matter emerged.  I am also aware that existing members of the Committee on Procedure who are members of this committee were advised to recuse themselves.  I think that is questionable, to be honest.  We are all Members of the Oireachtas and I do not at all like the level of prescription that is seeping into our work as Oireachtas Members.  It undermines the mandate each Member has received.  Certainly, from a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective, there are no internal party rules that dictate in this manner as to how we go about our work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110400002#G00300"><p>There is a clear case here that where a serious situation is rising again regarding the children's hospital and there are very few forums where this issue can be dealt with.  The one forum where it can be dealt with is here and if a body within the Oireachtas wants to hopefully approve that, if they want to deny that request, let us see what happens but we need to test this.  We cannot sit back here and allow the situation out at the children's hospital to continue to drift.  There are major issues there with what is being described as a double contract, a stage contract.  The cost overruns are enormous and then there is the speed at which it is being built.  There is no doubt it is needed but I am very concerned by the revelation yesterday that we do not even have a timeline for completion or delivery of that project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110400002#G00400"><p>We could bamboozle people with reference to the Committee on Procedures and standards and committees and all of this type of thing.  Essentially, the procedures and Standing Orders which are in place state the Committee of Public Accounts cannot discuss a pertinent, ongoing, current situation without the approval of Government.  That undermines exactly what the Committee of Public Accounts should be doing.  It should be independent of Government.  It should be apolitical in that sense.  We are of course all political elected representatives but the current situation is farcical and it undermines the purpose of a Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not aware of a single other parliamentary accounting oversight body in the world that is expected to operate under the procedure we have here to such an extent as we have been.  We had the Department of Education before us and we had to skirt around what was a pertinent current issue as if we were not aware of it, as if we were living on different planets.  We could conceivably have the Office of Public Works, OPW, in next week, for example, and there could be a front-page story about a very pertinent issue where we find out that the HSE has got itself into a melee that has cost taxpayers millions of euro and yet the OPW could refuse to answer and the Chairman would be expected to intervene.  That is just lunacy.</p> <p>  The Standing Orders need to be revisited.  To give the benefit of the doubt I am not sure if that was the intention of those people when they first started approaching it.  I am being generous in assuming this is an unintended consequence because it would be a very serious matter if this was the intention of the drafters.  The proposal in the first instance is fine and the children's hospital is absolutely something that is clearly in the public interest and clearly has an impact on the public accounts so therefore it would be interesting.  I am assuming nobody could argue against the Committee of Public Accounts but I hope the very fact we have to request that would enlighten the members of the Committee on Procedure and others of the farcical nature of the current situation.  As such, let us absolutely put in the request.  I agree with Deputy MacSharry.  It would be more of a game changer if his colleagues on the committee, as opposed to mine, came to a position where they were willing to agree to a commonsense approach to all of this.  That is not to say this committee has nothing to learn from previous issues and particularly from the Kerins judgment.  We all accept we do but this is very much a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater and undermining public accountability.</p></speech>

One can look at the accounts as audited for 2018 and 2019.  One can therefore be left standing at the station but the train has long gone through it.  That is the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110400002#G01200"><p>Is it not the argument that if I have entered into a contract, there is now a legally binding agreement there?  If I have an issue about how the process was dealt with, is that not what the Committee of Public Accounts is about?   Is it not about ensuring that proper procedures and proper mechanisms were used in arriving at a decision on awarding a contract?  Is the Chair now telling me I must wait until the audited accounts for that particular organisation or public body are published in 12 months' or two years' time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020110400002#G01300"><p>That is the problem with Standing Order 218, as it has been changed.  There are two proposals here.  One is we invite in the board of the national children's hospital and the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  The second is we write to the Committee on Procedure requesting information from it as to how Standing Order 218, or any other Standing Order, can be changed.  It has been pointed out that each of the groups here has people on that committee and it is up to each of us to do our homework to ensure they are enlightened about our request and where we are coming from with it.  There is a public expectation out there, and rightly so.  We are elected.  The point has been made about how the Committee of Public Accounts has always been a little bit too removed from Government to scrutinise Departments and I think everybody here would agree with that, and so it should be.  However, we now have a situation where not alone does it have to go through the Committee on Procedure but it also has to go before the D&aacute;il.</p><p>I am not being factional about it, but a majority in the D&aacute;il can stop it as well.  That is my understanding.  </p></speech>

They could say they were brought in to discuss the spend for 2018 and 2019 and could refuse to answer, according to the interpretation we are being given, which I do not accept.  It has been suggested that we make a request to the Committee on Procedure to have those representatives brought before this committee on here and now matters, before the horse has bolted, and await the outcome in that regard.</p> <p>  The other suggestion that has been made is that we request information from the Committee on Procedure in regard to the process for amending Standing Orders.  If that is agreeable, we can do that.  Are members happy for the committee to do that?</p></speech>

The Committee on Procedure needs to be mindful that if no forum is provided, it will move the issue back to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  There is a second matter which it should consider.  The Joint Oireachtas committees of the Houses have a direct relationship with officials in their line Departments and they are progressing policy.  The Committee of Public Accounts has no interaction with line Departments and there is no fear or favour in that regard.  The Committee on Procedure needs to consider that in regard to any failure to allow this committee to raise a matter.</p> <p>  I would like to make a final point in regard to an issue mentioned by Deputy Colm Burke.  My recollection of what the Secretary General of the Department of Education said on this matter is that he asked for direction from the Chairman as to whether he should answer the question as it relates to the current specific issue.  My recollection is not that he refused but that he asked for advice from the Chairman as to whether he should or should not answer.  </p></speech>

The difficulty in regard to the calculated grades is that there are court proceedings in train but I am not aware of any difficulty in regard to the children's hospital, unless there is an aspect of it that cannot be discussed with us because there may be a dispute resolution going on or something like that.  As far as I am concerned, in terms of all other aspects we are entitled to discuss them in the public domain.  This is taxpayers' money and therefore taxpayers are entitled to know what is happening.  The calculated grades issue is a little different in that there is ongoing litigation and there is a difficulty for the Department in that regard.</p></speech>

Is there a weekly meeting of committee chairpersons and, if so, could this matter be discussed at that forum as well?  I note from the Ceann Comhairle's correspondence to the committee that another issue has arisen, I presume, because of Standing Order 218.  It appears certain committees feel that the PAC should not be inviting in certain bodies that it is within their remit or purview to interview.  Have the committee chairpersons discussed this matter?  I accept the proposal regarding this committee making a suggestion about Standing Orders but perhaps a representative of this committee should present to the Committee on Procedure on the issue.  There seem to be a few unintended consequences arising in regard to the Standing Orders, which present serious issues for this committee going forward and we should try to tease out the matter a little more.  I am conscious that correspondence is going to take a long time.</p></speech>

Testing it in the way that has been suggested, such as writing out questions to it, may elicit a quick resolution of the issue.  While I accept Deputy Burke's point in regard to the Department of Education, if this committee were to take a collective approach on a given matter and ask different questions and challenge and test it we might get a very quick resolution of the matter.</p></speech>

Therefore, there should be no change in the relationship between the committee and witnesses appearing before it.  It has been standard for Accounting Officers and chief executives appearing to discuss ongoing programmes and projects, exactly as Deputy Burke suggested.  There would otherwise be no reason to bring in the paediatric hospital board in particular, given that its sole purpose is the delivery of the hospital project.  It would not make sense for it to appear and not be in a position to discuss the progress that is being made.  If it were the case that there was a difficulty around a commercial or litigation aspect, there is provision in the Standing Orders to brief the committee privately on that matter or to withhold information if a body judges that the appropriate course to take.</p><p> As I understand the matter, the new Standing Order, which I believe is 218(10) or 218(11), is intended to bring those who are in receipt of public moneys but not within my remit before the committee if a case can be made for doing so.  My understanding is that this was to be an exceptional circumstance rather than a procedure that the committee would go through regularly in respect of specific issues.  Obviously, I am open to correction on that, but it may be better to seek to bring the hospital board and the Department in and see whether they will answer the questions.  If they are using the provisions as a reason for not answering, the committee could then seek an extension.</p></speech>

I agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General that there is no change, but the additions prescribe every opportunity we would otherwise have had to discuss other issues.  The proof is in the pudding.  A substitute clerk was in attendance on the day, but he also happened to be the previous clerk to the committee.  Deputy Carthy alluded to something that happened at the meeting.  When I speculated about next year's leaving certificate, that being, something yet to happen, I thought the clerk was going to pass out from his enthusiasm to advise the Chairman that doing so was out of bounds.  The Secretary General was wondering whether he was allowed to test that.  I will not guard my language like others have kindly done by saying "unintended consequences".  These were intended consequences, meant to shut us down.  That is a fact.</p> <p>  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Munster may remember when the committee brought the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before us.  We specifically wanted the head of procurement in the Department to be present, but the Secretary General attended and said that he would decide who would appear because he should be the one to answer the questions.  We had a good reason for wanting the head of procurement, given that he had also been put on the board of the hospital.  We could have asked pertinent questions in the public interest.</p> <p>  All of these steps are being taken to shut that approach down.  The basic rule has not changed, but the practice has been substantially prescribed so as to exclude the kind of freedom and plenipotentiary status we had to use common sense in questioning.  When there was someone in the room and something was on the front page that day, we would ask the question.  The way I see it, Marc MacSharry and all of us in this room are here to represent the people.  I am not here to protect the system.  That is how I see this interference.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman.  I will not speak again.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Carroll MacNeill that it is worth testing the issue, but based on the Comptroller and Auditor General's response, are we laying down the beginnings of a precedent?  By seeking permission, are we laying a precedent that we must seek permission on all occasions?  Perhaps I am wrong, but the Comptroller and Auditor General seems to be suggesting that we should first seek to get the information and, if we fail at that point, we should seek permission.</p></speech>

We can write to the Committee on Procedure, which is the body that we are being told to go through, or we can directly invite bodies to attend, but by taking the second route and notwithstanding what has been stated by the Comptroller and Auditor General, others and me, we might be presented with a situation where an official appearing before us tells us that he or she will discuss last year and the year before but will not discuss the here and now.  However, it might be the here and now that we need to discuss.  That is the problem.</p> <p>  How we approach this matter is a decision for the committee.  One proposal, which I believe we accept, is that we write to the D&aacute;il reform committee and the Committee on Procedure about making a change in the Standing Orders.

My concern is the lack of clarity with regard to how the Courts Service captures the information.  I tabled a parliamentary question seeking information, which was disallowed on the basis that it would require the Minister to speculate on the legal situation.  The net issue was that, while we know it is an offence for a person to drive while disqualified, garda&iacute; who have been issued these handheld devices were told not to use a particular code.  There is doubt as to whether it is an offence to continue driving after disqualification.  That does not appear to be an offence.  It is very difficult.  When people are disqualified from driving, very few licences are surrendered on conviction in the courts.  The whole idea of disqualification is to make sure the roads are safe.  There is a process problem as to how it is dealt with in practice.  Other scenarios than that I have just outlined also arise.  There may be an absence of law in respect of one of the offences.  I am not at all happy that procedures are in place to capture information in a practical way.  I am not sure how the committee should proceed on this matter or whether it is the right committee to deal with it.</p></speech>

The Deputy has given further information.  The appendix to the letter sets out some figures, numbers and explanations.

If someone does not surrender his or her licence and goes to renew it, the endorsement then begins from the issue of that new licence.  There is a great disadvantage to not handing in one's licence.  Unless people can renew their licences in some other way, when they go for renewal the endorsement period will begin with the issue of the new licence, because there is a record.  I believe an endorsement lasts for five years.  If one's licence lapses after three years and one allows any period to pass before renewing it, the five years will start again from when it is renewed.  A great difficulty arises if one allows one's licence to lapse.  There are checks and balances in the system.</p></speech>

The Department spent something in the region of &euro;33,000 on media monitoring services.  I had submitted parliamentary questions on this matter to other Departments, as had Deputy Catherine Murphy.  Several Departments employ external media monitoring services.  Can the committee secure a report as to the overall cost of media monitoring services across Departments and whether there is scope for savings to be made?  As I read the responses I have received to my parliamentary questions, each Department individually contracts companies to carry out media monitoring.  Many contract the same company, but they do so on an individual basis.  The costs fluctuate greatly.  If I recall correctly, the Department of Justice pays the most, approximately &euro;50,000 per annum.  Other Departments pay much less and some carry out this monitoring internally.  Could a holistic evaluation be carried out?  Is that something the Comptroller and Auditor General could do for us?</p></speech>

Essentially, this is in regard to procurement.  We had asked for a briefing and they sent us a comprehensive response - comprehensive in that it is lengthy.  However, it essentially just repeats the information, and its core aspect is that it repeats the lack of appropriate ICT capacity and integration, saying again that this is the key constraint in terms of their ability to accurately and effectively track and mitigate procurement non-compliance.  One would imagine an organisation like the HSE that is dealing with hundreds of millions of euro of public money would do something about a key constraint.  I do not see in this briefing anything that sets out a clear indication as to what the HSE is going to do about it, although it sets out the problem.  I would like to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for comment as to whether he suggests there is anything the committee could do in this respect.</p></speech>

It is something we are constantly addressing with the HSE.  I have reported on it from time to time.  They are making progress, although it is slow.  I have not studied this document in detail but we will certainly be examining it.  If I feel there is a requirement for us to do further work in regard to it, I will certainly consider that.  Obviously, if they are in with the committee in the meantime, there may be further information drawn out on that occasion that I will take into account in my consideration of the matter.  It is frustratingly slow to get progress on this but we have to keep the pressure on.</p></speech>

This was flagged by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General ten years ago, so it is going to take 14 years to get to a proper procurement system.  We got commitments when they were before the committee in terms of trying to expedite this and move ahead with it.  Deputy Carthy is right that we need to keep on the case with this issue. When we have the HSE representatives in again, we will use that opportunity to raise it again to see what progress has been made.  In the meantime, the Comptroller and Auditor General can do further examination of it.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 176 B from Mr. Philip Nolan, President, National University of Ireland Maynooth, dated 23 October 2020, providing further information requested by the committee in relation to remuneration of staff.  It is proposed to note and publish it.  If Deputies wish to comment, they should feel free to come in.  Deputy Catherine Murphy had indicated. </p></speech>

It concerned the broader university sector, where many people are employed on a very precarious basis, with many working a small number of hours.  We are being told that the university also engages people on an occasional hourly basis.  Obviously, this deals with public holidays and holidays in general, but the point we were trying to get to was what is the ratio of people who are working on an occasional basis, whether that is a very dominant issue and whether it is replacing less precarious work, either in Maynooth or other universities.  This is very precarious work.  Universities will have a need for guest lectures and all of the rest, but there are also people who routinely provide teaching hours, often on a precarious basis.</p> <p>  We were looking at the ratio of that.  It might be worth digging out the original documentation from last year because there was quite a substantial reply from Maynooth in regard to the number.  That number jumped out at me because there are actually quite a large number of people employed on a very precarious basis.</p></speech>

I find the answer concerning.  It talks again about the difficulties with ICT and states that while the university is engaging with the vendors to develop a solution for this, it is not clear that a viable software solution will be found.  This is a university saying it cannot find a software system that allows people to get paid for their annual leave.  I do not think this is an acceptable response.  It is blas&eacute;.  We are talking about workers and their entitlements.  As Deputy Murphy said, in some instances these people are on short-term, temporary-type contracts and I do not think it should be up to them to chase their employer to get paid for the time that is owed.</p> <p>  I suggest that, at some point in the near future, we revert back to the university, while recognising that everybody is busy at the moment.  I do know if there is a mechanism for us to revert back to this correspondence in January and then perhaps make contact with the university again.</p><p>Is that a possibility?</p></speech>

This is precisely the kind of thing we meant when we discussed the national children's hospital earlier.  The 41 additional rail cars have been announced three or four times.  I do not know if they have been ordered or paid for or what the procurement process was.  Deputy Munster and I were members of the transport committee and we have been forward and backward on the purchase of 600 rail cars.  We should seek an accurate statement on whether these rail cars have been purchased.  The NTA states the new rail cars are in production and will be brought into service in quarter 1 of 2022.  I presume they have been purchased.  They were supposed to be brought into service this year and there could be reasons that did not happen.  There were supposed to be 600 rail cars for the whole system.</p></speech>

In its response, the HSE said it does not centrally retain details of the dependency levels of residents in either public or private nursing homes.  I imagine information of that nature should be available to the HSE.  Is there any particular reason for not retaining it?  It should be a matter of interest to the HSE given its role in the fair deal scheme and public nursing homes.  I suggest we ask the HSE if it could keep these records in a way that does not interfere with personal data.  It is the type of information that should be collected by the HSE.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions on community nursing units.  The HSE's 2016 plan refers to 90 centres across the State.  I propose that we write to the HSE and ask for more details on its case mix adjusted, CMU, figure.  I am aware the figure has increased significantly since 2016.  There is more to come as there are delays arising from Covid-19 this year.  This is described as public care but public private partnerships, PPPs, are named everywhere.  Alternative funding arrangements are also involved, as we are aware.  I propose that we ask how many of these units are public and how many are private.  When the HSE refers to upgrading, is it referring to public nursing homes that will be upgraded on the recommendation of HIQA?  Will the HSE fund them or will they be funded under public private partnerships?  Will they be run as public or private entities?</p></speech>

We will all need one at some stage so it is an investment to have public nursing homes.  The tax breaks and allowances under the fair deal scheme, the mandatory social programmes and everything else are a long-term expense.

The HSE is aware of the high-dependency rate in the public nursing homes.  The issue with private nursing homes is that the HSE tends to not want to know because the private nursing homes want remuneration under the fair deal scheme to increase where a patient is deemed to be high-dependency.  That issue has not been resolved and has been going on for some time.  That is one problem we have.  It is convenient for the HSE not to know the high-dependency numbers for private nursing homes.</p></speech>

The answer states that a person's eligibility for further schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the nursing home support schemes.  We know people are being charged.  We want to know if the HSE is going to continue to allow this?  If it wanted to find out the extent of the practice, all it has to do is invite public submissions.  Every other family will tell it that a parent or grandparent is being charged for simple things like wound dressing, creams, incontinence wear and so on which are covered by the medical card and ordinarily covered where a person is living in the community.  In my opinion, the HSE is deliberately turning a blind eye to this practice.</p><p>As we touched upon with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the way in which the contracts are framed is the same regardless of whether one is private or public.  However, on medical card items to which residents would normally be entitled, some private nursing homes are charging for items which, if the person was living at home with a family member, would be provided under the medical card scheme.  I want the committee to write back to the HSE to ask how it will ensure that this double charging - this is exactly what it is - stops, and what plans it has to prevent it happening.  If the HSE is interested in determining the extent of this practice, it could invite people to make submissions and to back it up with proof, for example, invoices charged to their family members, when their family members have a medical card.</p></speech>

We note the fact that it has been brought to our attention that there are cases where people are being charged for those items in private nursing homes, where if they were in the community, the items would ordinarily be available to them free of charge as medical card patients.  We will ask what steps are being taken to deal with this issue.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I believe a committee member wants to raise No. 179, or do they want to leave it until the next meeting?</p></speech>

On Wednesday, 11 November 2020 we will engage with the Office of Public Works, on Thursday, 12 November we have the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, on Thursday, 19 November we engage with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, and the week after that, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has confirmed its availability for 25 and 26 November 2020.</p> <p>  There is a significant amount of material from the 2019 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which is available to the committee to review.  There are four chapters and the Vote itself.  Given the amount of material we have to cover, and to avoid having to pick and choose between chapters, I suggest that we invite the Department to appear on Wednesday and Thursday of that week to give the committee two two-hour sessions, or four hours, to examine the matter.  I suggest that we cover two chapters in each session, with the Vote itself available for discussion on both days.  I also suggest that the committee has lead and second speakers on both days, with the opening statements being delivered on the first day.  In other words, there will be only one set of opening statements.  Are the members happy with that?  Yes.  It is to ensure that the material will be given a good airing in more than one session.  Is it agreed that the committee invites the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to engage with it on 25 and 26 November 2020?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Of the seven priority engagements agreed on 7 October, that leaves meetings with the HSE, Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service yet to be scheduled.  The committee will work with secretariat to organise the other priority engagements.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Do any members wish to raise any other issues?  No.  Our next meeting is tomorrow with the Department of Finance on its Vote, the audited financial statements of the Exchequer for 2019, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts of the public services 2019.  We will be looking at chapter 1, Exchequer financial outturn for 2019, and chapter 17, the Ireland Apple escrow fund.</p></speech>

The report was an expert examination of legal protection for workers with a particular focus on ensuring that limited liability and corporate restructuring are not used to avoid a company's obligations to its employees.  The examination looked specifically at situations where assets of significant value are separated from the operating entity, being the employer, and how the position of employees can be better protected in such situations.</p> <p>  To assist the committee in its consideration of this matter, I am pleased to welcome the authors of the Duffy Cahill report, Ms Nessa Cahill and Mr. Kevin Duffy.  Members can see them on the screens behind and in front of them.  They are joining us online and will have five minutes each for their introductory speeches.  I ask them to deal with their main points within five minutes if their speech is longer than that.</p> <p>  I will give an update on parliamentary privilege, especially the notices to witnesses.  There are limitations to parliamentary privilege in the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal prosecution or proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory, therefore, in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  Opening statements from Ms Cahill and Mr. Duffy have already been circulated to members to commence their consideration of this matter.  I invite Ms Cahill to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The report that the committee is considering was commissioned by the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the then Minister of State with responsibility for business and employment on 14 January 2016.  Detailed terms of reference were provided and we were required to deliver the report by 11 March 2016, which we duly did.</p> <p>  It is important to note the context and parameters of the terms of reference, which in turn set the context and parameters of the report.  First, the specific focus of the terms of reference is on a situation where companies separate assets from operations by moving assets into a separate legal entity.  While the terms of reference note that there may be sound business reasons for such actions, the problem identified is that, if the operating entity subsequently becomes insolvent and faces liquidation, the separation of assets from operations may have adverse consequences for employees of the operations entity, regardless of the priority to which they are entitled under the Companies Act 2014.  The specific scenario the report aims to address is the separation of assets and operations into two corporate entities with the operations company subsequently entering insolvent liquidation.</p> <p>  Second, the opening paragraph of the terms of reference refers to high-profile cases such as the liquidations of Clerys department store and Connolly shoes, but it is expressly not based on the specific facts of any particular liquidation.  This is an important aspect of the terms of reference of which we were at all times mindful in preparing the report. The report is not based on the facts of any individual company or liquidation.</p> <p>  Third, the terms of reference state that situations of insolvency highlight the complex interface between company law and employment rates.  It was for this reason that two persons with distinct areas of specialisation were asked to work on the report.</p> <p>  Fourth, it was a specific stipulation of the terms of reference that the report should not just consider new solutions, but better, more effective use of existing provisions.  This informed the approach taken to the report.</p> <p>  Against that background, the matters the report was asked to consider included whether and if so, how, employees' quantifiable pecuniary entitlements could be ring-fenced in the event of the separation of assets from operations; whether more effective use could be made of existing employment legislation; how employees could negotiate better terms and conditions in circumstances where the employer entity is separating an asset of significant net value from the operations entity; when any new measure to protect workers' interests may be triggered at the time of the transaction or at the time of the liquidation; and whether the assets transferred should be capable of being set aside.</p> <p>  Regarding the approach taken in the report, in accordance with the terms of reference each of the authors of the report examined the existing provisions of the legislation in our respective areas of specialisation and considered whether the existing provisions could be used to address the type of issues that gave rise to the report.  We also considered whether amendments were required and, if so, made provision for the general category of amendments that may be considered.  In this assessment, we did not and were not asked to take into account considerations of policy or cost.  Such matters were and are beyond our remit.  We confined ourselves to examining the legislation in our respective areas of specialisation with a view to identifying whether and if so, how, amendments could address the specific issues raised in the terms of reference.  </p> <p>  On the outline of the report, Part I sets out the existing provisions of employment legislation that may be most relevant to the issues raised by the terms of reference.  Part II sets out the most relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2014.</p><p>Part III considers proposals for reform and Part IV summarises the conclusions.  The proposals that are made are predominantly concerned with amendments to employment legislation.<br/><br/>With regard to employment law proposals on redundancy, as outlined earlier the terms of reference required us to consider, <i>inter alia</i>, how workers could be facilitated in negotiating enhanced redundancy terms in circumstances in which the employer entity is separating an asset of significant net value from the operations entity.  This question was addressed in a number of connected proposals for legislative change contained in the report.  They were directed towards providing a statutory mechanism by which compensation could be awarded for the loss of a contractual or quasi-contractual entitlement to enhanced redundancy terms in the type of circumstances referred to in the terms of reference.<br/><br/>The relevant background against which our proposals were formulated can be summarised as follows: section 9(1) of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 provides an obligation on employers to consult employees and their representatives where collective redundancies are in contemplation.  The purpose of this consultation is set out in section 9(2) of the Act.  It includes the possibility of avoiding some or all of the redundancies and of mitigating their consequences.  This can include such matters as offering redeployment, retraining or financial compensation.  Where an employer fails to respect its statutory duty to engage in the process of consultation required by the Act, employees are deprived of the opportunity to pursue all or any of these possibilities and to put forward their own proposals as to how they might be achieved.<br/><br/>Section 14(1) of the Act provides that collective redundancies cannot take effect for a period of 30 days after notification of the redundancies is given.  In ordinary circumstances, this 30-day consultation period is used by employees and their representatives to negotiate and agree the terms on which the redundancies will take effect.  In these negotiations the focus is generally on terms provided in a collective agreement between the parties or established by custom and practice within the employment concerned or in analogous employment.  Where agreement is not reached, the issues in dispute can be referred to the Labour Court for adjudication.  However, this 30-day prohibition on giving effect to collective redundancies does not apply in cases of insolvency.  Hence, in this category of redundancies workers can be deprived of the opportunity to bargain with their employer for enhanced redundancy terms that they might otherwise legitimately have expected.<br/><br/>The maximum redress that can be awarded to an employee for a failure to consult is capped at the equivalent of four weeks' pay.  Our proposals on collective redundancies, and the rationale upon which they were based, can be summarised as follows.  Proposal No. 1 suggested that the exemption from the requirement to consult in the case of collective redundancies caused by insolvency should be deleted.  The intention of this proposal was to place the same obligation to consult on a liquidator as that which applies to all employers, thus placing all employees in the same position, whether the redundancies arise from insolvency or otherwise.<br/><br/>Proposal No. 3 was to the effect that the redress available to an aggrieved employee for a failure to observe the statutory consultation period should be increased to the equivalent of two years' pay, in line with that available for a contravention of most employment rights enactments.<br/><br/>Proposal No. 6 suggested a mechanism by which it would be possible for an adjudication officer of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court on appeal, to take into account any prejudice suffered by employees in consequence of their employer&rsquo;s failure to comply with the Act.  This could include a failure to obtain enhanced redundancy payments on foot of an express or implied term incorporated in the employees' contracts of employment, whether through a pre-existing collective agreement or established by custom and practice.<br/><br/>We further proposed that any amount awarded would then be recoverable under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 in circumstances in which it cannot be discharged by the employer due to insolvency.  Through the mechanism suggested in proposal No. 4, the amounts paid out could be recoverable against any significant asset separated from the employing entity.</p></speech>

As Mr. Duffy outlined, I will address the company law aspects of our report.</p> <p>  The essential company law question presented by the terms of reference is whether, and, if so, how, the Companies Act 2014 may be amended to address the situation of employees of an insolvent company that has inadequate resources to discharge their accrued entitlements, in circumstances where valuable assets were transferred to another entity before the liquidation.  The report considers some of the potentially relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2014, with particular focus on three provisions, which appear to be of most direct relevance to the terms of reference:</p> <p>  Section 621 enshrines special protection of employees in the context of liquidations by ensuring that certain employee debts such as wages and salaries rank as preferential debts in a liquidation.  This is complemented by section 42 of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 as amended, which provides for priority for statutory redundancy payments.</p> <p>  Section 608 provides that when a company is in liquidation, the court, on the application of the liquidator or a creditor or contributory of the company, can order that a person who appears to have the use, control or possession of a property "of any kind whatsoever" or the proceeds of sale of that property, must deliver this property or pay this sum to the liquidator.  This is only possible if it can be shown to the court's satisfaction that the property in question was disposed of and the effect of the disposal was to perpetrate a fraud on the company, its creditors or its members.</p> <p>  Section 599 allows for an order to be made that a company related to the company in liquidation must pay to the liquidator the amount of the whole or part of all or any of the debts provable in that winding up.  This may only be done on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of a company, and only if the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so having regard to the matters stipulated in that provision.</p> <p>  The report concludes that, by contrast with the applicable employment legislation, the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 that are already available do not appear to be in need of amendment.  However, the report notes that many of the provisions of the Companies Act that may be of assistance are not frequently invoked such as section 608 or are not invoked at all such as section 599.  The reason for this appears to relate to the costs and risks associated with such applications rather than the formulation of the provisions themselves.</p> <p>  In response to this difficulty, proposal No. 4 in the report refers to the possibility of conferring a power on the Minister, as creditor of an insolvent employer, having paid the employee claims through the Social Insurance Fund, to delegate the taking of statutory applications to the liquidator and to provide funding to the liquidator for that purpose.  The report, accordingly, does not propose any amendments to the Companies Act 2014, but rather considers possible mechanisms to facilitate and extend the use of the existing provisions of the Companies Act in the protection of employees' interests.</p></speech>

I have five minutes and I have a couple of questions to ask.  I have to leave after this but I will watch proceedings from my office.</p> <p>  Do either or both of the witnesses have a preferred option?  Part of the difficulty that we have faced arising from the comprehensive report is that none of it has been implemented.  No one has made that decision.  Do they have a view on which option would be the simplest, the quickest or, indeed, their own preferred option for the resolution of the issue that they were set to examine?</p></speech>

The report was prepared for the Department and two Ministers.  We did what we were asked to do and thereafter it is a matter for the Ministers and the Department.  I certainly do not have a view as to what should be done on foot of the report.</p> <p>  With regard to a preferred option, I am not entirely clear what the Deputy had in mind.  The employment law proposals are all part of a package.  One cannot have one without the other while implementing one part of it and not implementing the other would either not make sense or would make it incapable of operation.</p> <p>  The fundamental proposal was that in situations where the employees are deprived of an opportunity to negotiate enhanced redundancy terms they had a legitimate expectation to, they would bring a claim under the Protection of Employment Act through the statutory mechanism of taking redress, which could be based on the loss of a contractual or quasi-contractual entitlement to enhanced redundancy payment and then there is a provision for the recovery of that award against the Social Insurance Fund if it could not be paid by the liquidator.</p></speech>

The proposals are more in the area of employment legislation and I would defer to Mr. Duffy regarding his views on how the proposals ought to be implemented.  The only ones that concern questions of company law are proposal No. 4, as I outlined, where we refer to the possibility of the Minister funding or stepping into the shoes of the liquidator to pursue certain statutory mechanisms, but that is somewhat discrete.  I would defer to Mr. Duffy on what the most appropriate means of implementing the employment law proposals are.</p></speech>

Their shop stewards and union have called for the implementation of the Duffy Cahill report and we have talked a great deal about it.  In many respects this is good because it means people are talking about employment law and workers' rights but it is bad because we are only talking about it and we are not doing much by way of implementation.</p> <p>  With regard to their proposals, would Mr. Duffy and Ms Cahill be satisfied that they could establish an expectation of entitlement by virtue of custom and practice and it would not necessarily have to be written down and lodged with the court or in some formal way?  With regard to retrospective application for any of the mechanisms, is that possible, would that be possible or would that simply be at the discretion of a Minister?</p></speech>

What we proposed was that where there would be a contractual or quasi-contractual entitlement that could be the basis for an award for a contravention of the Protection of Employment Acts.  What I say is not to be interpreted as giving the committee legal advice.  The committee is quite capable of getting that elsewhere from people perhaps with more competence than I have.  However, it is generally accepted that a term could become a contractual term in a contract of employment either expressly because it is written in or incorporation where there is a collective agreement and that is incorporated into the individual contract of employment or where there is a clear custom and practice.  If there have been several situations, say, of redundancy, and in every situation the employer paid whatever enhanced redundancy payments, and that was a consistent practice that could be pointed to, it can be reasonably inferred that had there been negotiations in this particular circumstance that would have been the outcome.  That is what we mean when we talk about established by custom and practice.  I am sure it is a concept that the Deputy will be familiar with given her former existence.</p></speech>

What needs to be proven in the courts to establish that a company has engaged in transactions that have fraudulently deprived workers or, presumably, other creditors?  What needs to be proved regarding the assets that were transferred or the transaction and what needs to be proved in terms of the fraud involved?</p> <p>  In respect of the points Mr. Duffy made, when he said the penalty increased from 4 weeks to 104 weeks for a company failing to consult, is there an issue that this might create an incentive for companies that were on the edge to effectively refuse to consult because it would then create a situation where the State, not the company involved in the various questionable transactions, etc., would be on the hook?  Presumably, the same applies where a collective agreement is negotiated in a very different atmosphere from the insolvency and suddenly the company has a way of shifting its obligations onto the State.  Did Mr. Duffy and Ms Cahill consider that aspect of the matter and how the State would be protected against companies that sought to aggressively shift their obligations to the taxpayer?</p></speech>

The first question, I believe, was about section 608 of the Companies Act, which is the provision that provides for assets to be recovered in the event that they were transferred before the liquidation with a fraudulent effect.  We deal with this in our report and note that it seems on its face to be a potentially very useful provision for dealing with the kind of situation our report addressed.</p> <p>  The threshold for fraudulent effect has been considered in a couple of judgments.  No very recent ones have drawn it out more clearly than the one addressed in our report, I believe.  In effect, what the jurisprudence seems to talk about is that the asset was transferred and that it had the effect of depriving the members of something to which they were entitled.  That seems like quite a general and not very exacting standard and that was applied in some earlier judgments.  There was a more recent judgment of the High Court that we addressed in the report where they talked about there being some requirement of an impropriety being shown, which is a somewhat vague term.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on what is insured, it is not entirely clear.  Some cases suggest that it is purely if the effect of the transfer is to deprive the company of something it is entitled to and that may be sufficient to show a fraudulent effect.</p><p>Others suggest that something more is required, some form of impropriety.  The term "fraud" when it is used and applied by the courts generally comes with a fairly high threshold of proof.  Fraud is not something lightly alleged in the courts.  That may be part of the reason for the reluctance with this provision.  That is where the interpretation of it rests at the moment.</p></speech>

I understand exactly the point he is making.  It was something we considered.</p> <p>  First of all, a simple way for the employer to address it is to engage in the consultation required.  If the employer does that, then it can argue the case.  If there is a claim for enhanced redundancy that the employer believes is not justified, the employer can contest it.  It may well end up in the Labour Court and an adjudication will be made.  However, it was circumstances in which the employer seeks to shift the responsibility onto the State that recommendation No. 4 in the report was intended to address.  The suggestion was that if an award is made under the Protection of Employment Act pursuant to the proposal or provision we suggested of increasing the maximum amount of compensation that can be awarded, then the Minister would effectively stand in the shoes of the employees and would be able to recover the amount paid out of the Social Insurance Fund against any assets the company had or may have transferred.  That was intended to ensure the Social Insurance Fund would only pick up the tab if there were genuinely no funds available to meet the contractual entitlements of the workers.</p></speech>

They talked about a statutory right for employees or their representatives to seek an injunction where a company was contemplating the removal of an asset of significant value.  They have acknowledged that an injunctive remedy already exists.  Can the witnesses elaborate on the benefits of a statutory injunction for workers?  They say the provisions of the Companies Act do not appear to need amendment but are more in need of use.  Can they explain what was meant by that, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nessa Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020110400002#E00400"><p>I will deal with the second question first.  The report did consider several provisions of the Companies Act that seemed potentially to be relevant to the terms of reference.  These were to do with the transfer of a specific asset in a way that left insufficient funds in the company to discharge the entitlements of the workers.  We identified in the report that there are some provisions of the Act that seem to be well tailored to deal with that situation.  Section 608 in particular, which I mentioned some time ago, would allow a liquidator, creditor or a contributor of a company to go in and seek to undo a transaction where a significant asset had been transferred out of the company with the effect of perpetrating a fraud.  We noted that provision has been used on some occasions but not many.  Some of the concerns referenced in the terms of reference could, at least, in principle, be addressed by using such a provision.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to section 599 of the Companies Act 2014.  This had been outlined in our terms of reference and it has been given much consideration in the context of our terms of reference.  The provision deals with the ability to pool assets.  Let us suppose there is a group of companies and one of them goes into liquidation.  If there is a basis to believe that another related company was involved in the management of the liquidated company and in some way contributed to its insolvency, then we should be able to look to that other company to pay the debts of the insolvent company.  We noted that provision seems never to have been invoked.  It is a novel provision although it is in existence on the New Zealand statute book.  That is where it came into the Irish Statute Book.  It does not seem to have been used in Ireland.  It is a provision that we thought could potentially be useful in the situation we were looking at.</p> <p>  That is what we mean by saying some of the provisions of the Companies Act are potentially useful but seem to be more in need of being used.  I am unsure if that answers the question from Deputy Stanton but that is what we meant when we said the provisions could be more in need of use rather than in need of amendment.</p></speech>

I am trying to get my head around some of the proposals to get an idea of where they might apply and where they might not apply.  Let us suppose we had a situation where we had a company that struck an agreement with its workers for enhanced redundancy and standard redundancy within that company.  Let us suppose there had actually been a redundancy situation in that company, perhaps some years before, and the terms of that agreement had been adhered to.  Then the company went into liquidation and became insolvent.  At the moment, the legal entitlement of the workers is to the statutory minimum.  They have no more than that as an entitlement.  As I understand it, the proposal from the report would make the workers, collectively, a preferential creditor.  It would increase their chances of drawing down enhanced redundancy from the pot.  Is that broadly where it is at?  Can the report authors comment on that?</p></speech>

The Companies Act already does that.  Section 621 of the Act enshrines the preferential treatment of employees.  We do not have a proposal in the report that intends to alter that.  We note that in the event that there are enhanced entitlements under statute to workers, they would then also be entitled to the priority given to workers under the Act, but we do not propose to alter the order of preferential treatment in the Act.</p></speech>

We would have to go into it in far more depth.  What we did intend in formulating the proposal was a situation where, as I said in response to Deputy O'Reilly, if it could be established that there was an entitlement to enhanced redundancies, established either by a collective agreement or by custom and practice - I think most people understand what custom and practice means - then a mechanism could be provided whereby effectively compensation equivalent to the amount of the enhanced redundancy could be obtained if the employees were deprived of the opportunity to enter into negotiations with their employer.  If the facts fit that type of situation, then the proposals, if implemented, would deal with it.  Of course, if an award is made under the Workplace Relations Act by virtue of section 49 of that Act, then it has priority.</p></speech>

That is a helpful answer.</p> <p>  My next question refers to a situation if a company were to have a section of the business, for example, an online section, which was valuable, perhaps valued in terms of tens of millions of euro in terms of what its profits would be on an annual basis.</p><p>Let us suppose it was registered in an Irish city, the company was to go into liquidation and over a period of three days, the online business transferred to having a headquarters in a UK city.  I realise that we cannot get into specifics and that our guests would need more information than that, but might that be the general ballpark where the point about the separation of assets would come into play and a light would need to be shone on that?</p></speech>

It is difficult to understand and is a different set of facts.  The impact of an online business being transferred to another jurisdiction is different from the impact of it being transferred out of the company.  That is not within the terms of reference we considered and it is not something on which I feel I can give an opinion, on the basis of those facts.</p></speech>

I support their conclusions and recommendations.  Coming from a business background, I am well aware of the challenges.  I strongly believe that the majority of businesses will always treat their employees fairly but it must also be acknowledged that there is a minority which, unfortunately, will not.  That minority will seek to exploit any legislative gaps.  It is likely that ensuring those gaps are closed off will remain ongoing work for all governments.  At the same time, this is an important piece of work.  I am stating the obvious when I say that, based on my experience, employees should always be given the opportunity to engage in consultation.  That should not be a minimum standard, by any means, and it is unfortunate that it needs to be legislated for but evidently it does.  The proposal in the report is welcome.</p> <p>  If all the recommendations in this report had been implemented in recent years, would that have prevented the current Debenhams situation that has been outlined by many members of the committee?  That dispute has gone on for more than 200 days.  It is close to my business in Galway city, where I grew up, and I see it on a daily basis.  I ask our guests for their professional opinion on my question and thank them for their work to date.</p></speech>

I do not know whether that would have been beneficial to the issue about which the Senator spoke.  All I can say is that if the facts of any particular liquidation were similar to those that we contemplated in the report, it would be of benefit but if the facts were different, it would not be of benefit.  I cannot go much further than that.  I really cannot give an opinion on a particular dispute about which I do not have all of the facts.  Even if I did have all of the facts, that is not the purpose of Ms Cahill and I appearing before the committee today.

I said I am not expressing any opinion, because I do not have one, on whether the report would have assisted workers in any particular set of circumstances.  If the circumstances were similar to those discussed in the report, it probably would be of some benefit but if those circumstances were different, it would probably be of less utility.  I do not know whether it would have benefited the people about whom the Senator is speaking.  Perhaps I did not make myself clear but I did not express an opinion that this report, if implemented, would have been of advantage to workers in any particular situation, would have prevented any particular situation from arising or would have had any utility for workers in any particular situation.

Many of us believe that the recommendations in the report should have been implemented a long time ago or since the report was published.  The report is all the more timely now given that we are, in most likelihood, facing an avalanche of redundancies over the coming months.  Never has it been more important to ensure that we have proper legislative infrastructure in place that ensures workers can get the best deal possible from the redundancy process.</p> <p>  If it is okay with the witnesses, I will ask all three of my questions together and then they can answer.  First, I appreciate they have stated they do not recommend specific amendments of the Companies Acts.  Are they satisfied that the recommendations of the report could be fully implemented within the sphere of employment law changes?  I am thinking in particular of proposal No. 4 on the recovery of assets.  </p> <p>  Second, recommendation No. 2 is on the operation of proposal No. 6 on enhanced redundancy payments and how that relates to proposal No. 4.  Earlier it was very helpful of Mr. Duffy to set out the implied and explicit terms of a contract and how that might be vindicated.  I want to understand the operation of ministerial power to delegate power to the liquidator to recover assets.  How does that relate to proposal No. 6?  Section 49 of the Workplace Relations Act was mentioned.  I would like to hear how the two proposals can be implemented.</p> <p>  My final question is for Ms Cahill.  I appreciate that the witnesses have stated in the report that they do not have a view on the re-ordering of ranking in a liquidation situation.  It would be helpful for this committee to understand the challenges associated with the re-ordering of preferential status for any one creditor because there has been a lot of commentary and proposals to re-order the preferential status of workers.  Particularly in terms of the enhanced redundancy payment, understanding the challenges in trying to re-order is an important first step.</p></speech>

The Senator also referred to proposal No. 4.  The idea behind our proposal No. 4 is to replicate what is in the Companies Act for situations where the employer is not a company.  A lot of what we deal with are formulations based on section 608 of the Act, which allows a liquidator or other person to recover an asset that was fraudulently transferred.  We are looking at ways to ensure that can be done even if the employer does not come within the Companies Act.  In fact, quite properly, it would belong more in an employment law statute because it is already in the Companies Act.  We think that this important provision should be available whatever the form the employer takes.  I think that probably is an appropriate one for the employment legislation amendment.</p> <p>  We also talked about, under the proposal as mentioned by the Senator, about the possibility of the Minister taking applications to court for the recovery of assets, and the possibility that he could delegate this role to a liquidator and, for that purpose, fund the liquidator.  That is an important aspect of our report.</p> <p>  We did mention areas where we did not consider the Act to be in need of amendment.  One of the Deputies mentioned that he considered the Act did not need more amendment but more use.  We raised, in our report, the possibility that this is to do with funding.  Part of what we are looking at under proposal No. 4 is the possibility of the Minister providing funding to liquidators to pursue assets and recover assets to swell the assets available to workers and other creditors in a liquidation.  Again, those are the types of measures that we think could properly be introduced under employment legislation because they concern the Minister's status as a creditor having paid workers under the Social Insurance Fund.  We think that that would more properly fit into employment legislation.</p> <p>  I will let Mr. Duffy respond to the second question but the Senator's third question was about re-ordering priorities in a liquidation.  She asked what the challenges were in trying to change the preferential status of particular creditors.  As I mentioned earlier, we do not propose an amendment to section 621 of the Companies Act, which does enshrine the preferential status of employees, for certain claims, in a liquidation.  We do think it is a long-standing principle and approach to liquidations in this jurisdiction, as well as others, that one has different categories of creditors and within those categories they are treated equally so that if there are inadequate resources to discharge their claims then all of their claims are abated in the same proportion.  That is a principle that has been part of our companies legislation for quite a long time and it would be a significant policy change to alter that.</p> <p>  We mentioned in our report a different policy question about whether an asset that is recovered, such as under proposal No. 4, could then be set aside for the benefit of the creditor who pursued it.  So, in that case, it would be the Minister who has funded the pursuit of the particular asset.  That is something we outlined as a policy question that could require further consideration, and that would be somewhat discrete from the re-ordering of priority under section 621 as such, but it is something we mentioned that could be looked at.  However, that would be a separate question about a particular asset being earmarked for the benefit of a certain category of creditors and perhaps those who have funded, either directly or indirectly, the legal proceedings for the recovery of that asset.  That is all I have to say in response to the third question.</p></speech>

Our proposal No. 6 seeks to have a mechanism by which workers who had an entitlement to enhanced redundancy payments that they could not pursue, because of a failure on the part of the employer to engage in consultation before the redundancies were given effect, could go to the Workplace Relations Commission in the first instance.  The Workplace Relations Commission, or the Labour Court on appeal, could take into account the prejudices that workers suffered, which could include the fact that they did not get the enhanced redundancy payments to which they had a legitimate expectation.  That would be an award made under the Protection of Employment Acts, not redundancy payments as such but compensation for the loss of something that workers would otherwise have been able to achieve had the employer complied with the obligations under the Act.  As an award of compensation it has priority anyway.  Section 49 of the Workplace Relations Act makes reference to section 621 of the Companies Act 2014 so the award has priority anyway.</p> <p>  The second part of our proposal deals with the type of situation to which Deputy Bruton rightly referred where there could be an abuse and the State could end up picking up the tab for moneys that properly should have been paid by the company.  Section 4 was to allow the Minister to stand in the shoes, as it were, of the employees, that the moneys paid out would be recoverable along with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act referred to by Ms Cahill and that if the funds were available, the Minister could recover the money paid out.  So the State would pay out if there were not sufficient funds in the employer company but the Minister could seek to recover that amount for the benefit of the State.  That is the rationale that was at play.</p></speech>

I have only two questions for them as they have already answered one or two of the questions I had intended to ask.</p> <p>  The witnesses have proposed a statutory right for employees or their representatives to seek an injunction where a company is contemplating the removal of an asset of a significant value and they have acknowledged that an injunctive remedy already exists.  I ask them to elaborate on the benefits of the statutory injunction for workers.  The witnesses also stated that there is a need to include workers in matters of company restructuring, which is right and proper and everyone agrees with that, but in circumstances where a company is insolvent, with no significant asset at its disposal, what is the real benefit of a consultation period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020110400002#H00300"><p>I will deal with the question on the value of a consultation period.  It is important to remember - this is noted in the report - that there is an obligation under EU law to engage in the process of consultation.  This applies to a liquidator.  What does not apply to the liquidator is the prohibition on giving effect to the collective redundancies within the 30-day period.  The purpose of the consultation may well be for people to advance arguments about how the effects of the redundancies can be mitigated and how retraining and redeployment opportunities might be available.  It is not just about money but in many situations it will be.  The purpose of the consultation would be to test whether there is an entitlement to enhanced redundancy.  That is separate from the question of who is going to pick up the tab at the end of the day and where the money is going to come from.  There can be a genuine and real argument about whether there is in fact an entitlement or a custom and practice.  That can be tested during the 30-day period.  As we observe in the report, if necessary, it can be adjudicated upon through the normal statutory dispute resolution processes.  I do not think it would be fair to say that if a liquidator states that a company is insolvent there is not a brass farthing.  That requires consultation.  It was with that in mind that we recommended that the obligation to refrain from giving effect to the dismissals for the consultation period should extend to a liquidator.  I will ask Ms Cahill to deal with the statutory injunction issue.</p></speech>

I am conscious it is a question raised earlier that I had not answered.  I thank Senator Ahearn for coming back to it.  The Senator asked what would be the benefit of a statutory injunction for workers because there is already in existence a common law jurisdiction for a court to order a Mareva injunction to prevent the dissipation of a company's assets.  The rationale behind proposal No. 5 is that it would put on a statutory footing the specific right of employees to make an application to court to prevent the dissipation of assets to protect their accrued entitlements.  We are seeking to put that on a statutory footing so that employees have a specific right to apply for that protection.  We also propose that consideration be given to allowing them to make such an application in the Circuit Court.  We are very conscious that one of the issues that arises on a regular basis is the excessive cost of going to the High Court for orders of this nature and we reference the possibility that a statutory provision could be put in place to allow this to be done in the Circuit Court.  That is the benefit that we saw arising from proposal No. 5 of our report.  It is to be read in conjunction with proposal No. 2, which is a very specific proposal dealing with a set of facts that are very much directed towards the terms of reference we were dealing with, that is, where there are collective redundancies that are anticipated to arise from the transfer of an asset.  This is probably of less general relevance to workers than proposal No. 5.  The benefit of proposal No. 5 is that there would be a statutory provision in place that workers could avail of.</p></speech>

I have a question on proposal No. 1.  The second last sentence of it states that it is also noted that employees could be disadvantaged as the employer may not be able to pay wages and employees may not be entitled to jobseeker's benefits as they are technically not unemployed.  That is glaringly worrying.  The witnesses have done a lot of research in this area and are very knowledgeable about it.  How do they foresee us proceeding?  It is a ridiculous situation and I would like to hear from the witnesses how it could be addressed.  If employees have no entitlement to payment from the State and at the same time they cannot get paid by the company, they are in limbo, which is unfair on any worker regardless of what is going on in a company that is in liquidation.  Does proposal No. 1, which recommends the removal of the insolvency exception from the prohibition on implementing collective redundancies, resolve that issue?</p></speech>

Proposal No. 1 references the removal of the insolvency exception from the prohibition on implementing collective redundancies during the consultation period.  The committee will undertake a job of work on the way forward in light of this meeting.  If that proposal was implemented, would it address the issue around employees being stuck in limbo in terms of their not being paid by their employer and at the same time not being entitled to jobseeker's benefits?</p></speech>

That could mean that the dismissals had no effect and so technically the people would continue to be employees of the company up to the expiry of the consultation period.  A situation could arise where there simply is no money to pay them and that would have to be taken into account.  In that situation their wages would be recoverable in any event under the employers insolvency legislation but it would take some time to do that and there may be issues arising around the provision of social welfare in those circumstances.  Insofar as there was a reference to that, it was simply pointing out something that could arise.  It would not necessarily arise because it may well be that the liquidator can continue to pay the employees for the consultation period.  That is the situation referenced in the report.  We were not getting into the question of the social welfare code or what benefits people might be entitled to or anything of that nature.  We were simply proposing that if there is a prohibition on giving effect to collective redundancies for 30 days then logically it could be argued that collective redundancies given effect in contravention of that provision could be regarded as a nullity.  In this regard, we refer to a similar provision under the Maternity Protection Act where, for example, if a woman is dismissed while on maternity leave, that is a nullity.  It had no legal effect and the woman continued as an employee.  That is what we had in mind in that proposal.  We were not, as I said, getting into the social welfare code or anything like that because it was not within our terms of reference or, I would suggest, our competence to do so.</p></speech>

If it is a 30-day consultation period, it would not become an enforceable deal.  I am not clear if Ms Cahill was implying that this arrangement would only apply where assets had been in some way hidden, as in the Clerys case, or would become a more general preference for collective agreements.  The issue that arises is that if a new general preference is created, do other creditors know what those collective agreements are?  I could understand if this was a registered employment agreement, which is a publicly available document, and a creditor dealing with a company can see what obligations they have but is this a rather open-ended new preferential arrangement for collective agreements?  I stated earlier that this could open up abuse with the State being left on the hook but, presumably, other creditors would get displaced as well as the State being ultimately on the hook.  How does that play out in both company law and that wider context?  Many of these collective agreements are not generally known compared to, say, a registered employment agreement that is recognised and is put on the record.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that if there is no contravention of the Acts, compensation cannot be awarded.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about the collective agreement but what we are really talking about here are contracts of employment.  As he knows, a collective agreement may be incorporated in the individual contract of employment or it can be an implied term that I talked about earlier.  Indeed, ordinary creditors would not know, no more than what they would know about collective agreements, what was provided for in individual contracts of employment.  It is not just a question of saying that the collective agreement would disturb the priority of other creditors.  I am not sure it could do that.  It would simply mean that people could have an entitlement to certain payments pursuant to their contract of employment and that those payments would attract priority.  Does Ms Cahill have anything more to say on that?</p></speech>

As I noted already, it would be covered by the general provisions on priority and treatment of employees and the Redundancy Payments Acts, which bring in the projection of redundancy payments.  It is only if they are captured by the rights of employees that they will then be given a priority under the Companies Acts.  We do not propose amending that.</p></speech>

In his introduction, Mr. Duffy referred to the specific scenario to address the separation of assets and operations of the two separate corporate entities with the operating company subsequently entering insolvent liquidation.  There seems to be a connection between the two in that moving the assets out of the company leads to insolvency.  That is the kind of scenario we are dealing with but is it not true that many companies move assets around all the time with no impact and no perceived or foreseen impact on employees or on the operational side of the company?</p> <p>  Ms Cahill said that section 608 of the Companies Act confers power on a court to order the return of assets that have been improperly transferred.  There is also reference to the transfer having the fraudulent effect of leaving inadequate resources to discharge the entitlements of the employees who are subsequently made redundant.  I come back to what I asked earlier about the use of courts in this process.  Someone has to adjudicate as to whether fraud was perpetrated and whether there was a cause and effect intended between the removal of assets and the subsequent insolvent liquidation of a company.  The report also notes that the defence of such an application could include a director's statement prepared at the time of the transaction to show that the employer was in a position to discharge all accrued employee entitlements after the transfer.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but we are talking here about an intention to defraud.  Is that the nub of the issue we are debating?  Do the courts have the powers and can they decide a lot of this?  </p> <p>  I was taken with what Ms Cahill said about the lack of use of the courts.  She mentioned twice the issue of the cost of the legal proceedings being a factor that must be taken into account.  She also said that the State could take over that particular role and perhaps cover the legal costs.  I ask her to comment on that scenario.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nessa Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2020110400002#J01000"><p>I am happy to do that.  The first issue the Deputy raised is the threshold for invoking section 608 of the Companies Act.  I hope I was not unclear earlier but that provision does not refer to fraudulent intent.  It does not hinge on the intent of the transaction at all.  What it refers to is the fraudulent effect of the transaction and there is a significant difference between the two.  The courts have emphasised strongly that it is not about looking at what the parties intended but the effect of the transaction.</p> <p>  It is important to note also that there is a carve-out to that provision in the Companies Acts, which requires the court to consider whether it is just and equitable to make such an order.  That includes considerations of whether the transaction was to a person who acquired the asset bona fide believing that it was a genuine transaction.  There are different elements to section 608 and they are important.  I hear fully what the Deputy said about the importance of companies being able to transfer assets freely without the risk of them being unwound.  There are a number of layers to section 608 but fraudulent intent is not one of them.  It is very important to be conscious of that.  The question is the deprivation of assets out of the company that has become insolvent.</p> <p>  The second question the Deputy raised has to do with cost.  He is correct that we say in the report that it appears to us, and anecdotally, to be likely that one of the reasons the Companies Acts provisions are not used is to do with cost.  The Company Law Review Group, which studied these matters in much more detail than myself and Mr. Duffy, also identified that as being anecdotally the reason some of the Companies Acts provisions, which are carefully crafted provisions, are not used.  It identified cost as also being the issue.</p> <p>  One of the solutions we flag in the report, and we do not purport to draft this or to show exactly how it would be put into practice and into legislation, is the possibility that the Minister, as a significant creditor, if there is a big shortfall in the payment of workers, could then step in and fund the liquidator to recover assets of this nature.  That is just one way we see as possibly enhancing the use of these provisions.  It would not be an answer or an option in every case.</p><p>Policy-wise, it may not even be an attractive option, but we have put it forward as a potential way of dealing with the issue of the cost associated with applications of this nature.  The Company Law Review Group talked about issues of potential third-party funding for litigation, but we do not address that in our report.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile telephones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  Television coverage and web streaming will also be adversely affected.</p><p> I invite Drs. Moore and O'Connell to make their opening statements. </p></speech>

NESC is a Government body that advises the Taoiseach on strategic policy issues.  The members are appointed by the Taoiseach and represent businesses, employers, trade unions, agricultural and farming organisations, community and voluntary organisations and environmental organisations.  As well as that, heads of Departments and independent experts sit on NESC.  Its composition means it plays an important and unique role in bringing different perspectives from civil society together with Government.  Dr. Jeanne Moore and I are secretariats to NESC and are attending today's meeting in that capacity.</p> <p>  The points we make today stem from a significant body of work that was produced by the council and the secretariat, primarily in 2019.  The report we published at the start of this year, No. 149, was called Addressing Employment Vulnerability as Part of a Just Transition in Ireland.  This work was a response to a direct request in the Future Jobs Ireland 2019 report and the climate action plan for NESC to identify steps that could be taken to address the vulnerability arising from the transition to both a low-carbon and more digital and automated future.  In that work, the council has recognised that the transitions to a low-carbon and more digital, automated Ireland are extremely complex and are interconnected.  There is, therefore, a significant degree of uncertainty involved.  According to our research, this includes uncertainty about where and how the greatest vulnerability will fall in terms of the impact on employment.  There are risks to employment from the transitions in agriculture and food, transport, and parts of industry.  Despite their inherent complexity and uncertainty, there are also economic and social benefits to adopting a proactive, managed approach.  There will be job losses in vulnerable sectors and within roles, but these are coupled with opportunities for new jobs and enterprises, which need to be planned for and managed.  That is central to the idea of the just transition approach.</p> <p>  That proactive, planned approach and response was also highlighted in earlier work we did on building community engagement and social support regarding wind energy.  In that work, which was done a number of years ago, we identified the importance in a very practical sense of an intentional, participatory and problem-solving State-led process to underpin transition.  I will hand over to my colleague Dr. Moore to walk the committee through some of the more detailed work we have done on just transition.</p></speech>

While there are different perspectives, we have approached just transition as something that seeks to ensure transitions are equitable and participative in both the process and outcome at national, regional and local levels.  A just transition approach explicitly names principles, goals and values and facilitates societal engagement, while also seeking to ensure that the costs and benefits of the transition are equitably shared.  That paper outlines that there is a growing consensus that such an approach has to be built into climate action to achieve both equitable solutions and public support.  Achieving a transformation of the scale necessary in a relatively short period is a considerable political challenge, requiring policies that share both the burden and the benefits and opportunities.  However, it is not yet clear which particular policies, regulatory and legal measures are most effective.  Nevertheless, without action on a just transition, it is important to reflect on the alternative.  We would have economic and technological progress, coupled with environmental protection and possibly restoration, but without social equity or consideration of rights and protections.  The social and political challenges that approach would create could make the transition unachievable or delay its progress.</p> <p>  While the debate on values and principles remains a live one, practical approaches to achieving a just transition are where policy debates are now shifting, as is the case currently in Ireland.  Aligning just transition policies with decarbonisation measures is necessary to ensure emissions are radically reduced in a way that is fair, inclusive and equitable.  However, there is no blueprint or fixed set of rules to achieve this.  Our work included international case study research as well as a review of key approaches to transition that have been applied regionally and nationally.  While many of these approaches are place-based and process-oriented and focus on skills development, social protection and the labour market by targeting and supporting jobs in key sectors, others focus on a purposeful, participative and multifaceted approach to transition governance.</p> <p>  There are five key areas for this.  The first is preparation.  For a just transition, purposive and proactive planning and governance is required at national, regional and local levels involving the Government and regional and local or community-based actors, combined with Government support.  The second area is process.  We need a participative, social dialogue based process as part of public governance that considers the sharing of costs and benefits and champions principles of fairness, justice, equality and social inclusion.  This can be a mechanism for fostering trust and adopting a problem-solving approach to transition.  The third area is people and focusing on decent and good jobs, pay and conditions, training and appropriate social protection for those at risk.  The fourth is place.  Place-based regeneration of local communities and infrastructure has the potential to enable transition, with bottom-up local action and networks of practice to complement any overarching national just transition framework.  The fifth and final area is outcomes.  We need fair, inclusive and equitable outcomes in which no-one is left behind.</p> <p>  Scotland provides a valuable case study in that it has taken a national focus rather than the more common regional one to examine just transition opportunities and challenges.  The interim report of the Scottish Just Transition Commission echoes the above points and outlines the need for the following: to plan ahead and develop clear transition plans; proactive and ongoing dialogue to help understand society&rsquo;s expectations relating to the transition; and to bring equity to the heart of climate change policies, including addressing existing inequalities in work, housing, and transport.  NESC's work points to the critical part a just transition plays in transition, but practices, policies and governance approaches are still unfolding and there are no off-the-shelf solutions.  Combining a focus on both fair and inclusive processes and outcomes will be key to Ireland&rsquo;s effective decarbonisation and societal transition.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Finegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020110400002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to the Department of the Taoiseach to contribute to its pre-legislative scrutiny of this important Bill.  I am head of the climate action unit, which was established in the Department last year.  The unit was established to facilitate the strengthened governance and oversight structures set out in the climate action plan 2019 and in recognition of the need to ensure a whole-of-government response to climate change.  I am joined today by my colleague, Ms Ciara Kennedy, who is assistant principal officer in the unit.</p> <p>  The climate action unit supports the Taoiseach and the Government in tackling climate change and ultimately the transition to a climate-neutral economy.  The unit plays an important role in ensuring whole-of-government coordination, which is essential in making sure that every Department and sector plays its part.  The work of the unit is broad and cross-cutting, supporting policy delivery and unlocking barriers in our transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient, resource efficient and environmentally sustainable economy and society.  Our functions include monitoring and driving the implementation of climate action plans and supporting the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change, associated senior officials group and the Climate Action Delivery Board.  The Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change is chaired by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of the Taoiseach continues to provide secretariat support to this committee.  The unit also supports the work of the board, which has been tasked with holding each Department and public body accountable for the delivery of actions set out in the climate action plan.  As committee members will be aware, the programme for Government commits to maintaining this model.  It is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and the Secretary General of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  The establishment of the Climate Action Delivery Board last year was part of a suite of measures set out in the plan that aimed to strengthen the climate action governance and oversight structures. </p> <p>  The monitoring of implementation and preparation of progress reports is a key aspect of that oversight.  This oversight model replicates the very successful model used for the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>As part of this process, the climate action unit monitors and reports on progress on a quarterly basis.</p><p> The climate action plan outlines 183 actions comprising over 600 individual measures.  Under the plan, a Department or agency is assigned lead responsibility in respect of each measure and a timeline for completion is provided.  As part of the monitoring process, the climate action unit engages with all Departments with responsibility for actions each quarter.  Detailed progress reports are prepared, which document each of the measures completed, as well as those that have been delayed and the reasons they have been delayed.  Crucially, any delayed measures are reported on in subsequent quarters to maintain focus and ensure measures are delivered.  Where significant challenges to implementation are faced, these are pursued through the Cabinet committee and climate action delivery board.</p><p> In conjunction with other Departments, the Department of the Taoiseach seeks to identify cross-cutting barriers to implementation and ways to unblock these challenges.  To date, four progress reports have been published covering periods quarters 2, 3 and 4 of 2019, and quarters 1 and 2 of 2020.  The quarter 3 of 2020 report is being finalised and will be published in the coming weeks.  At the end of quarter 2 of 2020, the overall implementation rate of measures due under the climate action plan stood at 77%.  A completion rate of 72% was achieved in quarter 4 of 2019, 44% in quarter 1 of 2020, and 46% in quarter 2 of 2020.</p><p> While some of the delays in delivery were because of the impact of Covid-19, as well as the lengthy process of forming a new Government post election, the reducing completion rates highlight the need to ensure that a focus remains on implementation of our climate policies and overcoming any challenges experienced that impede delivery.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020 commits to an annual update of climate action plan as one of its principal means of delivering necessary climate action on the ground.  The Department of the Taoiseach will continue to monitor and report on this to maintain accountability and transparency.</p><p> This Bill provides a strong legislative basis for placing action on climate at the very core of policy making.  The carbon budget process will set ceilings or limits on our total emissions and meaningful plans will be put in place to ensure these limits are not breached.  Putting these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future Governments to sustained climate action.  However, this legislation is only one part of the Government's comprehensive approach to climate action.  Work is ongoing on a wide range of practical commitments included in the programme for Government, covering transport, agriculture, housing, enterprise, renewable energy and many other areas.  This focus on implementation is critical.  We must overcome the barriers to implementation that have prevented meaningful climate action in the past.</p><p> The recent annual review and report of the Climate Change Advisory Council noted that Ireland will only meet its existing emissions reduction targets with a full and successful implementation of all measures in the climate action plan.  The need for action is urgent and governance measures like this Bill and the mechanisms put in place to drive implementation of the climate action plan are important.  This twin focus on implementation of the necessary policies, with a strengthened legislative framework to drive and deliver on increased ambition, will ensure that the State can break through the delivery barriers we have been unable to breach before. </p><p> I thank the committee for inviting me and I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I apologise for making a late submission of some written evidence early this morning because I had varying scheduling issues so was unaware that I would speak at this particular hearing.  Based on that I wish to emphasise that I am not an expert on Ireland.  Nevertheless, I have worked on mitigation for 30 years and spent a decade working in the petrochemical industry as a design engineer.<br/><br/>My submission is based on a very recent paper where my colleagues and I downscaled the Paris Agreement to the developed and developing countries, and then down to the UK and Sweden.  So this provided a framework for how to go from Paris down to national level.The analysis that we used in that paper and, indeed, I used in my submission today, took it at face value that Ireland is going to deliver on its temperature and equity commitments, as enshrined in the Paris Agreement.  I based my analysis on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, science.  I also, very importantly, used the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, equity framing around common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, CBDR-RC, which is a key issue that most countries are simply ignoring.<br/><br/>As an academic, I am not interested in political and economic sensibilities.  However, I recognise that politics and economics are important but the short-term sensibilities that we always skate around are one of the main obstacles to us delivering significant change.  If one sets that as a framework I argue, which I will try to demonstrate, that that imposes a mitigation agenda that is far more challenging than any one of us have yet been prepared to countenance.<br/><br/>I shall set the scene and remind ourselves that even the Paris Agreement's framing of climate change, holding to an increase of 1.5&deg;C to 2&deg;C, is not just.  Many people are already dying from climate change and with the 1.5&deg;C to 2&deg;C target, many more people will die.  They will be poor.  Typically, they will be people of colour, initially the burden will fall disproportionately on women and children, they will live in climate-vulnerable parts of the world and they will be low emitters.  Let me be clear.  We have, knowingly, in the wealthy parts of the world imposed that upon them by our choice to fail, thus far, to address climate change.  I say this regularly to all countries but today my focus is on Ireland. <br/><br/>Since 1990, Ireland's emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>have increased by between 18% and 20%.  It is probably 20% if one included aviation and shipping.  Therefore, since the first IPCC report, Ireland has presided over a rise of 20% in its carbon dioxide emissions.  Today, Ireland's emissions <i>per capita</i>are about 50% higher than that of an average Chinese person, twice the global mean and over eight times that of an average African person.  Given such framing for Ireland and almost all wealthy countries, I believe that holding to 2&deg;C is probably the best that we can achieve but, to be clear, that is not a safe threshold.<br/><br/>The analysis that underpins my submission and the paper itself is based on a carbon budget framework.  Long-term targets are deeply misleading.  It does not matter what we do in 2050, 2045 or even 2030.  What matters is the total amount of carbon dioxide that we emit into the atmosphere, which brings the policy agenda down to what we do this year, next year, in the next three to six years and out, perhaps, to 2030, because that is the most important time.  I make no allowance for future generations to deploy speculative technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  Similarly, I make no allowance for additional earth system feedbacks coming from the science at present that suggest carbon budgets may be smaller.  I base this on a very conservative reading of the analysis done by the IPCC.  It is on that basis we downscaled the Paris Agreement and the IPCC carbon budgets that align with the 1.5&deg;C to 2&deg;C targets down to the developed and the &quot;developed country parties&quot;, as they are called in the Paris Agreement.  We also took seriously the whole equity framing of the common but differentiated responsibilities.  We then further downscaled developed countries to the EU, and I have done that briefly for today in terms of what that means for Ireland.  We use a range of apportionment regimes, which members can ask me about.<br/><br/>By taking that approach, I can outline the headline recommendations for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020.  First, the national climate objective urgently needs to be revised to reflect Ireland's temperature and equity commitments that Ireland is obliged to deliver as a signatory of the Paris Agreement.  Ireland also needs to make it absolutely transparent and have a clear cogent downscaling of the global carbon budget that is deemed appropriate for the Paris Agreement, and we have outlined in our paper what we think that should be.  It is down to Ireland to explain the implications of that for the poorer parts of the world.  Typically, one sees that when this work was done by the UK, Scotland and other countries, it was deeply colonial.  When one plays it backwards, one will see the implications for poor parts of the world and the small amount of budget that they have left because the wealthy countries, as always, want more than they are obliged to.  <br/><br/>I argue that there should be no offsetting or accountancy ruses to avoid wealthy countries meeting their obligations.  There should be no reliance on negative emission technologies nor on carbon capture and storage.  Primarily, that is because carbon capture and storage on energy still have very high life cycle emissions that typically range from 100 g to 300 g per kilowatt hour.  <br/><br/>I do think it is important that Ireland and other wealthy countries fund a major research programme on negative emission technologies, carbon dioxide reduction techniques and so forth.  However, to assume that they will work in the future is a moral hazard <i>par excellence</i>.  On top of cuts in energy emissions, Ireland needs to deliver absolute cuts in its agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions.<br/><br/>In terms of headline conclusions, and to put some numbers on this, my provisional analysis for Ireland is that if Ireland is to make sure that its policies are Paris-compliant, then its total carbon budget from 2020 out to the end of the century and beyond, should not exceed something like 300 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is the upper end of the threshold.</p><p>That is about seven years, maybe slightly less, of current carbon dioxide emissions depending on whether one does or does not include international aviation and shipping, which I would argue one should include.  Seven years of current emissions should exceed the budget for a reasonable chance of 2&deg;C.  It needs to deliver annual reduction rates of more than 12% every single year, year on year, and it should have started at the beginning of this year.  That is across the full energy sector.  Given that it takes a while to deliver that, and it certainly has not so far, if that is played out and with some political inertia, it is about an 80% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030, compared with current emissions, or at least compared with the 2018 data I have.  It needs to reach full decarbonisation or its entire energy system by 2035 to 2040 at the very outside.  That will be about ten to 15 years later for the poorer parts of the world.  This means zero carbon across the full energy system of aeroplanes, trains, cars, ships, industry, heating, everything.  It also needs to cut its agriculture methane and nitrous oxide emissions by at least 3% every single year, starting now.  That is an absolute cut and not just an intention to cut.  It needs a programme of forestry management and reforestation.  If it does not succeed on that then the agriculture emissions reductions would need to be higher still.  This is hugely challenging and we should have started 30 years ago.  Our choice to fail has led us to where we are in 2020, and we are still deluding ourselves about the scale of the challenge we really face because we are more interested in political sensibilities than in delivering real change, thus far.  That is my experience outside of Ireland.</p><p> Our work also demonstrated that if there is a net zero framing that is not that similar to the Committee on Climate Change, and if the rest of the world failed at that sort of level then this is somewhere around 2.5&deg;C to 3&deg;C of warming, not 1.5&deg;C to 2&deg;C.  One must bear in mind that when we choose to fail on climate change then we have to face the implications of very severe impacts and adaptions if we cannot succeed on that in the future, and particularly for future generations.  That is a very depressing overview, I am sure, for many of the committee but unfortunately this is where we are in 2020.  I thank the members for listening.</p></speech>

It was very interesting.  On just transition, the Bill does not mention just transition at all.  There is no reference to it at all.  There is a reference to climate justice, however.  The representative from NESC said he believed that climate justice also took in the issue of just transition within its framework and remit.  Does the witness see the need for a specific reference to just transition within the Bill?</p> <p>  It seems there are a lot of questions over how we would meet a just transition.  The Department said it is not clear yet which policy, regulatory and legal measures are most effective.  I believe there is a need for parallel processes, once the Bill is enacted, to actually nut out and really look at what policies could be implemented effectively.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that there is a just transition commission in Scotland.  Would NESC see that as something that could be part of the solution for us to ensure we do have a just transition as we move away from our high carbon economy?</p> <p>  On the climate action unit, the Department witnesses repeatedly mention barriers to implementation and the need to tackle these, but there is no indication of what those barriers are.  Could they outline what those specific barriers are and how they can be overcome? </p></speech>

On the question of the just transition and climate justice, we see those as being obviously connected but separate terms.  It is interesting that the Deputy pointed to the example in Scotland.  In that case, both are specifically referenced.  That is the experience we have drawn in that context.</p> <p>  The Deputy's observation that some parallel process is needed to really figure out what is next on the institutional piece on just transition would resonate strongly with our own sense that we need to look at it in more detail.  There had been a focus in NESC on creating a just transition review group and we did do quite a bit of work on that.  We feel that lots of things have changed in terms of the work of the just transition commissioner and in the wider context of Covid now and how we think about just transition.  NESC believes that it would be very helpful to do something like that and we would absolutely agree that the experience in Scotland is very valuable.  We recently had a conference on just transition and people from the commission in Scotland spoke at it.  They have made a lot of progress on the details of their work and the engagement they do with communities around just transition.  It would be helpful to draw that experience in further.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Finegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020110400002#D00600"><p>Yes.  I thank Deputy Whitmore for the question.  There are a significant number of structural barriers to implementation that have been revealed through the centralised monitoring of the climate action plan.  This is one of the benefits of centralised monitoring.  In addition to a continued and sustained focus on driving implementation it also allows a perspective to be formed from the centre as to whether there are structural issues.  We have been detailing these in the updates we produce with each of the quarterly reports.  I will talk the committee through some of them if that is helpful.</p> <p>  The first is around issues of capacity, resourcing, expertise and ownership in Government Departments and agencies.  This has manifested itself in a few different ways such as insufficient human resources assigned to the delivery of action; insufficient financial resources assigned to the delivery of action; insufficient attention to climate action at a senior level in Departments; failure in the early assignment of actions to personnel; and the limited action of appropriate expertise within Departments.  This is probably to be expected given the scale of the challenge, but it is certainly has come to the fore.</p> <p>  The second piece would be the speed of the legislative process.  There have been some delays in some of the more complex and comprehensive legislation that will underpin the transition.  I include in this, for example, the offshore wind legislation that is in train.  This is very complex legislation.</p> <p>  The third aspect is the complexity of the work on the consultations that are required.  Undertaking climate action is rarely straightforward and often necessitates extensive consultation within and outside the policy system.  Perhaps further deployment of financial and human resources, qualitatively and quantitatively, might help with increasing what needs to be done in this area.  In some cases there has been a delay in undertaking the work as identified in the climate action plan because it has been deemed that further more comprehensive action would be more beneficial in order to drive the implementation of the action.  In these instances, measures are marked as delayed while more comprehensive work is undertaken.</p> <p>  Finally, some of the delays experienced have been due to EU negotiations.  They create problems for some discrete actions and particularly some of the ones around agriculture, the common agricultural policy and the work going on there.  This is often beyond the control of the respective Departments but it does result in recurring delays each quarter.</p> <p>  These are some of the systemic issues that we have identified.  None of the answers to those are easy solutions and will need to be thought through very carefully as we develop the next iteration of the climate action plan to try to overcome those barriers, and to see barriers to delivery as things that need to be worked through as part of the suite of measures to drive implementation.</p></speech>

I want to ask either of the speakers from NESC about the question of a just transition.  NESC's description is that a just transition must be equitable and participative in both the process and the outcome at national, regional and local levels.  I have two questions.  First, would NESC consider what just transition steps have been taken with Bord na M&oacute;na as fitting with that model NESC has outlined?  Second, NESC looked at a case study in Scotland which took a national focus rather than a regional one.  Has NESC looked at any case studies that do not focus on the national or regional level but on the industry-specific level?  This is related to the case of Bord na M&oacute;na again.  Has NESC looked, for example, at studies that examined the closure of the coal industry in Spain or in the Ruhr valley for a just transition model that might help us to apply it to the closure of the peat industry here?</p><p> I have a question for Professor Anderson as well.  If he can, I ask Professor Anderson to expand on his work on why carbon sequestration and storage is not a good model to work on in order to achieve emissions targets?  He has given us information on this in the previous committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Could Professor Anderson go into that briefly?  An important part of our Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is the reliance on carbon sequestration and storage going into the future.</p></speech>

There is no completed just transition anywhere but we have done international research which has looked at experiences in Germany, Scotland, Canada and Australia but mostly in Germany, which has a lengthy experience with this.  Sin&eacute;ad Mercier completed the research for us and it highlights the complexity of just transition, how long it takes and how many levels are involved.  The participation processes all the way through are as significant as the outcomes that are achieved.  The Scottish example is interesting because, as I said, it was a national example but also because just transition is embedded, not just in the work of the commission but also in the legislation and it is part of the articles of association for the new state investment bank.  Scotland has embedded just transition on multiple levels.</p> <p>  In terms of looking at the midlands, as we were doing our work, the midlands was an ongoing project and Kieran Mulvey was established as the just transition commissioner.  He has published a few reports and the implementation of those is continuing.  It is important to know that it is the context of sensitive regions that dictates the kind of localised, place-based response in a just transition.  It would be up to Kieran Mulvey to talk about the midlands, other than to say there are huge efforts to be consultative and to engage.  There is an &euro;11 million fund from the Government to be administered this year and there is a real response to trying to understand the community, enterprise and local government response there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Kevin Anderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020110400002#E00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  On carbon capture and storage, when it is applied to fossil fuel power stations, people typically talk about that nowadays more for gas than for coal.  It is key that it is considered in the full life cycle emissions.  That means from construction right through to things like getting the gas out of the ground and the leaks from the gas when that is done, through to the transport.  When one looks at the full life cycle emissions, it is typically about 100 g to 300 g of CO2 equivalent in the estimates for gas with carbon capture and storage.  To give some flavour of that, a good gas-fired power station without carbon capture and storage is probably about 400 g and a coal station is probably about 900 g.  If one looked at offshore or onshore wind power generation, it is probably somewhere nearer 5 g to 25 g.  When full life cycle carbon capture and storage is applied to fossil fuels in power generation, it is still far too high to bring emissions down in line with the Paris Agreement.  It may have been appropriate 20 years ago but in 2020 it is too little too late.  That is not to say that carbon capture and storage cannot be important for something like capturing the process emissions, that is the chemical emissions of CO2, from cement production, which is a significant proportion of global emissions or possibly from steel production as well.  It may have a role there but it is inappropriate to consider it for energy generation because we cannot get the life cycle emissions down low enough.</p> <p>  When we apply carbon capture and storage to the combustion of biomass, we often get bio-energy with carbon storage, BECS.  There, in theory at least, we will be removing the CO2 from the atmosphere because it is being absorbed through photosynthesis, the material is being burned and the CO2 is being captured and buried underground.  From an engineering point of view, this is incredibly inefficient but overall, the concern is that if this is scaled up there will be major ecological impacts because the various biomass crops have to be grown, harvested, chipped and burned before the CO2 is sequestered.  That process is incredibly inefficient and damaging from an ecological perspective, particularly if material is imported from other countries.  In the UK, for example, we import timber from the US to burn in our Drax power station.  That has a huge set of ecological implications.  Playing to the global models, it looks incredibly damaging from the ecological perspective.  That is not to say that some of these things may have a niche role here and there but we have to be careful about how they will be applied.  We also have to be cautious about some of the other techniques such as reforestation and so forth.  I am all for improved forestry management and some reforestation.  Planting trees seems like an easy option but when trees are planted, the soil is changed and depending on what happens to the soil, more CO2 might be mobilised from the soil than is captured in the trees themselves.  Afforestation can be problematic but forestry management may have a role to play.</p> <p>  My concern with all of these matters is they are used as substitutes for ongoing fossil fuel use.  In Sweden, for instance, they are expanding Stockholm Arlanda Airport with the claim they will plant some more trees in the north of Sweden.  That is completely inappropriate.  We will need some negative emission technologies or forms of sequestration to compensate for some of the ongoing emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture that we simply cannot remove from the system, even if we all went vegan and never ate rice, which does not sound like a wonderful diet.  Even if we did that, we would still have a lot of residual emissions from agriculture and therefore, we require some forms of negative emissions or CO2 removal to compensate for those emissions but we should not use it to compensate for emissions from energy, which need to be brought down to zero.</p></speech>

I have a general question for Dr. O'Connell and Dr. Moore.  I am speaking at a climate justice future generations seminar this evening so it is opportune that I have a chance to speak about this issue.  The topic in the webinar is whether everyone can afford to be green.  It is a great question, it is difficult to answer and I struggle with it myself.  Can everyone afford to be green, particularly at this time?</p> <p>  Considering the urgency with which we need to introduce measures to reduce emissions and mitigate increased temperatures globally, we need to act incredibly soon.  I have seen that in their opening statements, Dr. O'Connell and Dr. Moore are saying the best policy or legislative approach is not yet clear.  That means there are a lot of unanswered questions out there so I will throw that general question at Dr. O'Connell and Dr. Moore.  When we think about the impacts of carbon tax, we talk about hypothecation but a lot of that involves measures that will happen in the future.  Electric vehicles, EVs, have to reach a critical mass before we can get to a point where everyone can afford one.  That is definitely not the case and the infrastructure is not there.  There is also the question of job losses versus job opportunities.</p><p>I firmly believe that the potential job and training opportunities brought about by proper action in dealing with climate change are significant.  That is my question, I am sorry it is somewhat general but can everyone afford to go green?  The question is for Dr. O'Connell and Dr. Moore.</p><p> Professor Anderson provided a shot of realism that those of us on the committee needed.  We often think of ourselves as the green isle and we think surely we cannot be contributors to climate change.  Professor Anderson has reiterated and underlined some of the stark facts about the role we have played in our consumption and our contribution to climate action.  I have no question for him but I think he has outlined the position well.</p></speech>

I found myself asking whether the question should be reframed as whether we can afford not to be green, having listened to Professor Anderson.  I suppose much of the work the National Economic and Social Council has done on climate in general has looked at how we can figure this out.  The question is can we afford not to be green.  Much of the work we have done in NESC has tried to focus on the question of what is economically viable for people.  There is a sense that we have to grapple with that and figure out how exactly we can bring down costs and arrive at viable solutions that protect people's livelihoods and find good futures for them.  That is what we have looked at.</p> <p>  We have concerns about agriculture.  The way we are going to figure this out is to engage with people in agriculture or engage with workers in Bord na M&oacute;na to figure out what types of other activities they can do that are viable for them.  It comes down to trying to engage with the people.  In general, our experience has been that people on the front line, including farmers, for example, are interested in trying to figure out viable opportunities.  How do we ensure that they do not believe transition is imposed on them?  How do we ensure they are seen to be involved in co-producing a viable way forward?  Rather than a sense of asking people to do things that are uneconomic, the question is how to engage people to figure out opportunities that are viable for them.  Our experience of the best source of that is to engage with the people who are working in these areas.</p> <p>  Dr. Moore might want to say something more.  I know it is a general answer to the question from Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan.  It is a really good question and we probably need more time to think about it but that is my general response.</p></speech>

It cuts to the heart of a just transition and why it is so important.  As we emphasised in our statement, the process of a just transition is sometimes overlooked by thinking about outcomes, which are crucial as well.  As Dr. O'Connell has outlined, the process of engagement is important in particular sectors, locations and regions around what the opportunities are, as well as the benefits from availing of some of the new low-carbon renewable energy projects.  It is about ensuring that people get a share of those new opportunities.  Our work on wind energy highlighted that.</p> <p>  We also need to try to think about those who are experiencing the greatest impact.  We need to discuss with them in a fair and inclusive way how that could be alleviated.  In a sense, there will be winners and losers in a transition.  A transition is a long-run thing that we have to undergo.  We are facing multiple transitions at the moment.  An emphasis on process and outcome is important.</p> <p>  The other overarching question is how we meet the net zero target in a way that contributes to delivering the sustainable development goals.  That is a longer perspective.  There are urgent questions about costs now but we need to have our eye on the multitude of transitions that we are facing and how we can bring those two factors into alignment.  That is another way of thinking about it.</p></speech>

Some really interesting work has gone on over several years.  It was done initially by Chancel and Piketty and later by Carter and Julia Steinberger.  It looks at who the emitters are.  We have to remind ourselves that many people in Ireland, perhaps even the majority of people in Ireland, are relatively low emitters.  Most emissions come from a relatively small suite of our societies.  At a global level, 50% of emissions come from 10% of the emitters and 70% of emissions come from 20% of emitters.  In highly unequal societies like the UK, USA and, to some degree, Ireland the emissions will be greatly skewed to a small proportion of the population.  For many people in Ireland it is not about having significant change imposed upon them.  It is about having those changes imposed upon the high emitters.  These are people like myself, the mobile elite, who like to think we are green and clean.  However, when we need to look at our carbon footprint and ask where we live, how big our houses are, whether we have a second home, whether we drive and fly much and whether we eat more exotic foods and more packaged food.  Do we have large fridges and freezers?  We consume far more because our incomes are far higher.  The science has made clear that this is the group where the majority of the emissions derive from.  Seeing all Irish people in the same light misunderstands where or who we must tailor the policies towards.<br/><br/>That plays back into the just transition.  If we are genuinely trying to deliver on Paris, then we are talking about a Franklin D. Roosevelt, FDR,-type scenario or something like the Marshall plan.  It is a new deal or Marshall plan framework.  That is the way we need to look at this.  Such a future is awash with jobs, from retrofitting to changing the transport infrastructure and a significant roll-out of renewable energy.  There are vast numbers of jobs in these areas.  At the moment we are looking at piecemeal <i>ad hoc</i>bolt-ons to business as usual.  That will not resolve the climate change challenge.  It is an equity issue about the asymmetric distribution of emissions among the population.  We need to recognise that what we are talking about is a new deal.  It involves an FDR framing of the scale of the challenge.</p></speech>

The Scottish Act has sought to set out some principles.  Is that what Dr. Moore would advocate for us?</p> <p>  My next question is on the submission from Sharon Finegan.  The question I would ask about the present Bill is whether the reliance on one Minister, namely, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, to develop the sectoral divide-up is suitable.  Is that realistic?  It contrasts with the portfolio approach or a whole-of-government approach that she seems to be indicating in her evaluation of the difficulty that has been there to date.  Would a portfolio approach be more effective?  In an allied question, what leverage does the Department of the Taoiseach ultimately have?  One of the main concerns of the committee is that there will be backsliding.  Should we institutionalise some degree of oversight from the centre?</p> <p>  My next question is to Professor Anderson.  We are hearing two very different views, in a way.  The issue of consultation and just transition participation involves a slow process.  In contrast, Professor Anderson is saying we need sweep aside the short-term sensibilities of politics and get this done.  This is a real dilemma for implementation.  I am interested in hearing from Professor Anderson on what legal framework he believes is optimal and would be consistent with democratic politics.  We are not going to turn into some despotic regime.  What would the legal framework look like?</p></speech>

I am not an expert on whether that should be enshrined in law.  For me, the key issue is the Government setting the direction of travel.</p><p>Obviously, if it was embedded in the legislation by the way of the principles, it would at least be a very clear direction of travel that it was decarbonisation with these principles in mind.</p><p> Second, as Dr. O'Connell mentioned, there is a gap between principles and action and one needs really to consider the kinds of institutional mechanisms to deliver just transition.  The legislation in Scotland was not the only piece in their remit.  They also developed this just transition commission, the job of which was to advise Scottish ministers on how to apply the just transition principles to Scotland.  They recognised that the principles was the starting point, and how they are then framed in the context of that particular country is still being discussed.  The legislation carries it so far.  There is a piece of work here to flesh out, beyond the principles, what it means in terms of action.</p></speech>

Ms Finegan, on that second question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sharon Finegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2020110400002#G00300"><p>I thank Deputy Bruton for the question.  The first question was on reliance on one Minister to develop the sectoral divide-up.  Head 6 of the proposed Bill outlines the roles of Ministers, Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas in developing and adopting carbon budgets, including requirements on the Minister for climate action to consult colleagues on the development of both the carbon budgets and the sectoral decarbonisation targets.</p> <p>  My reading of it is that there are specific instances in the proposed Bill which require the Minister at the time to engage with this Cabinet colleagues.  I might just mention them as I see it.  The first relates to the response to the council's budget.  Once the carbon and climate change advisory council has proposed the carbon budget, the Minister prepares a recommendation for Government, including justifying variances from the council proposal, if any, and consulting fellow Ministers and the Oireachtas.  As the committee no doubt will be aware, the Oireachtas may submit the council's proposal to a committee which may within four months provide the Oireachtas with a report.  Therefore, that first engagement with Government is crucial.</p> <p>  The second is when the Government approves the carbon budgets or approves its subsequent modifications.  Assuming that the budgets are accepted by the Oireachtas, they are then deemed to have effect.  Those are two crucial moments when there is a full engagement of all the ministerial colleagues.</p> <p>  Where it becomes a more complex undertaking, perhaps, is down to the sectoral decarbonisation targets.  That is the third real instance in the Bill where there is that wider engagement with the Cabinet colleagues around the table.  What the Minister is required to do then is to prepare sectoral decarbonisation target ranges within that ceiling, which is approved by the Oireachtas, for Government approval following consultation with other Ministers.  That level of consultation with fellow Ministers is very much stitched into the Bill.  Finally, the Minister, under certain conditions outlined in the legislation and considering the advice of the council, can recommend for Government of a revised carbon budget.</p> <p>  Taken together, this model provides a robust cross-government consultation and co-operation in respect of the carbon budgetary process.  It is likely that the Cabinet committee on the environment will be involved in each of these stages and, as such, the Department of the Taoiseach will continue to play a role in ensuring that whole-of-government co-ordination while ensuring that every Department plays its part.</p> <p>  On Deputy Bruton's second question, which was what leverage the Department has and whether we should be institutionalising some level of oversight, I would make two points.  The oversight, in terms of meeting the targets or meeting the carbon budgets, is very clearly drawn out in head 13, which amends the current annual transition statement.  It provides that the Minister with responsibility for climate action be accountable annually to the Oireachtas for outlining how the State has pursued the national 2050 climate objective, and then other Ministers with primary responsibility for relevant sectors will be accountable to the committee annually for outlining their sectors' performance in pursuing the national 2050 climate objectives.  This connection with the Oireachtas is a powerful part of the Bill.  We have seen, through the work of the Citizens' Assembly when it first came to the predecessor to this committee, that that cross-party engagement on, and ultimately support for, the Citizens' Assembly recommendations was a powerful driver.  I would see this provision in the proposed Bill as being something similar.</p> <p>  On oversight of the plan, I think the Deputy's question was whether that should be legislated for.  Typically, what the Department of the Taoiseach does is focus on key issues of importance and provide resources to ensure that there is a driving of and focus on those issues.  It has been clear since the establishment of the climate action unit, which is a well-resourced unit with excellent expertise at our disposal, that climate is taken very seriously at the centre and I would envisage that would continue to be the case.  I suppose it is a policy question as to whether something like that would be legislated for.  I would have thought conceptually what we are looking for is a situation where climate action would become something which is made mainstream across Departments and that focus on governance from the centre in an ideal world would be no longer required because it would be hoped we would get to a point where the system is so seized by climate as an overarching policy objective that that would no longer be required.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

First, it is important to stand back and think that from the viewpoint of poorer communities in more vulnerable parts of the world or indeed, from our own children's future or that of future generations, given the overwhelming scientific evidence we have had for two to three decades now, they may look at our regime and say that we are despotic.  We have to reflect on this from different stances than necessarily our own.</p> <p>  More parochially, the legal framework is that we need to have a carbon budget framing.  Personally, we have to get at it at some point in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, process.  At a national level, we need to be setting these up, as I laid out previously.  As to what that would look like for Ireland, Ireland could look at what its budget should be to make its contribution to the Paris Agreement.  I would argue it is something in the region of 300 million tonnes.  Then the argument is how that is divided out within Ireland.  I am familiar with this from within the UK because we have done some of this work already where we have said that the concept of subsidiarity here might be really important.  We have looked at producing carbon budgets for regions.  We have done the same in Sweden as well, for regional governments and for local governments, saying that this is what their carbon budget would look like and looking at what areas of powers they have to influence emissions.  They are much more attuned to the local requirements of their societies than, for example, in the UK, Westminster would be.  There is some merit in downscaling from a national carbon budget to a regional carbon budget, recognising there are big boundary issues when one tries to do that.</p> <p>  Another way to think about this is that a carbon budget, whatever language we might like to use to avoid this, is a rationing issue.  We have to live within a certain carbon budget if we are to avoid certain temperatures and, therefore, we have to ration out that carbon budget.  Once we are prepared to acknowledge that and not shy away from the concept of rationing, that helps us much more in thinking about what that legal framework might look like.  Could there be fee and dividend, whereby there is a very high carbon tax but, in fact, the money from that carbon tax is distributed back to the society evenly?  Therefore, the high emitters, such as me, would pay a huge amount of carbon tax, but that would be distributed evenly, for instance, across people in Ireland.  Could there be personal carbon allowances for domestic use of energy and for transport energy, for instance?  Should there be frequent flyer levies that really impact people who fly very regularly?  In fact, it would simply stop people flying very regularly, but it would not stop people flying once a year on holiday perhaps.  We have to tailor those policies on the understanding that this is a rationing issue.</p> <p>  I am involved in the Scottish citizens' assembly, which starts this weekend.  I am one of the evidence leads for that.  It is important to recognise that most of the people in our society are not the real high emitters.  They are not the problem.  Probably, many of their emissions can be dealt with structurally and through technologies, etc.  It is the high emitters among us who will have to change our behaviours significantly and the legislation, ultimately, will have to impose changes on us.  The problem is, of course, we are the legislators, the academics, the journalists and the barristers.  We are the people who make the policy framework and we require the foxes to guard the chicken coop.</p></speech>

I will try to be brief to provide time for responses, particularly for Professor Anderson to tease out a little further the issue around biogenic methane.</p><p>We had officials from the Department before the committee earlier in this process and they highlighted the specific nature of biogenic methane, that it has a shorter lifespan but that its warming effect is 28 times higher.  Professor Anderson might wish to elaborate on that.  That is over a 100-year horizon whereas our objective is 2050.  In reality, within that timeframe, methane has an 86 times warming effect.   Can he elaborate on that for the benefit of members of the committee and the public and on why a reduction is essential in methane, and an absolute reduction as opposed to a reliance on carbon sinks?</p><p> I have a second question.  I wish to tease out the issue of sinks, nature-based solutions and other ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere.  I welcome his view on the reliability of predictions on the value of sinks and nature-based solutions and also the trade-off that would be required between achieving the sustainable development goals and addressing the biodiversity crisis and having that wide scale roll-out of BECCS.  He referred to the issues with biomass and the importation of timber.  We have had that problem here where the ESB was refused planning applications because of the importation of biomass from outside the country.</p><p> I have a brief question for Ms Finegan.  She outlined to Deputy Bruton where she sees the accountability, but I believe it shows that there are many layering processes.  Where is the accountability for making corrections and for the reporting of whether the targets are being met and to correct if they are not being met?  The way she outlined it with the whole-of-government approach and accountability to the committee blurs the line.  Where does the buck stop in terms of meeting emissions reductions?</p><p> I have a brief question on just transition.  Sharan Burrow of the International Trade Union Confederation criticised the Bill for not including just transition.  We know in the context of the Bord na M&oacute;na workers, and also if we are to have an absolute reduction in methane, the importance of just transition principles and that they should be fair and equitable.  Perhaps any of the speakers who spoke on just transition will comment on how New Zealand has done this, given that it has separated biogenic methane and embarked on a process with the agricultural community.</p></speech>

The biogenic methane is a very important issue.  Again, it is one of the issues that has been deliberately underplayed by some.  Methane is a relatively short-lived gas but it has a huge warming impact, particularly in the nearer term.  As the Senator said, if one integrates its impact over 100 years, it looks like 28 times more impact per molecule than CO2, but if one integrates the impact over a shorter period, it looks much higher at 80, 90 or 100 depending on the timeframe.  One of the things to bear in mind here is that if we are seeking to just try to stay below 1.5&deg;C , that is going to occur very soon.  We are at 1&deg;C warming already.  There will be very few years before we head towards 1.5&deg;C.  In the timeframe in which we have to deliver 1.5&deg;C, the methane we emit today and in the next two to four years will have a big impact.  We have to get the methane out of the system - the biogenic methane and the methane from use of fossil fuels.  It is a massively important part of the near-term story, and that near-term story is key if we try to deliver the 1.5&deg;C framing.  As I say, it is very challenging, but we should try everything we can.</p> <p>  It is also worth bearing in mind that what we are seeing at global level in the atmosphere are rapid rises in methane emissions.  We think there are three principal reasons for this.  One is the increased use of natural gas, particularly shale gas.  That is one contributing factor.  Another is a reduction of the hydroxyl molecule in the atmosphere, which basically cleans up the methane.  If there is less of that, the methane lasts a little longer and it appears that more is being emitted.  The third one is biogenic activity at global level.  As we have warmed up the planet, particularly in the Tropics, we are seeing far more activity, which means we are seeing more methane from those parts of the world.  We cannot stop that.  Once we have that warming, that is happening.  We have to stop the biogenic methane we have control over, and that is principally through agriculture.  Biogenic methane is a very important issue.  If we are serious about our Paris commitments and if we recognise the atmospheric constraints on methane going up partly because of biogenic methane that we cannot control in some parts of the world because of the warming, then we have to ensure we reduce it from the areas on which we have some purchase - the fossil fuel industry and agriculture.</p> <p>  Regarding some of the negative emissions technologies, the biomass energy with carbon capture and storage, BECCS, is probably one of the worst.  Virtually all the models assume biomass energy with carbon capture and storage.  They are not looking at some of the more exotic techniques.  They are primarily using this type of grunt technology.  If one looks at most of the models, it is assumed one plants an area somewhere between the size and three times the size of India, with huge sets of SDG sustainability issues across the board.  They could range from water to land rights, indigenous people's rights and the effects on soil.  On every level these are problematic at the scale that is assumed in the models.  Who is relying on these?  It is the wealthy parts of the world relying upon growing this stuff often in poor parts of the world to compensate for our ongoing high emissions from the relatively few people who are producing them in our countries.  That is a really problematic approach.  It is another sticking plaster for a problem that is much more systemic.  While I favour us doing research on some of the negative emissions technologies, and particularly some of the other nature-based solutions, to use those to allow us to carry on our high-carbon lifestyles is utterly inappropriate.  The reliance on BECCS is dangerous across an entire set of the SDG commitments.</p></speech>

In some ways her question gets to the heart of matters.  It was about how we correct if we are not meeting our targets.  The targets will be outlined through the carbon budgetary process.  The is an overarching target out to 2050 in the Bill but the carbon budgetary process ensures that we have markers in the sand up to a 15-year time horizon as to how we are going to get there.  Beneath that is the climate action plan process.  The requirement in the Bill to make that happen annually places an almost relentless focus on implementation.  Developing and devising climate action plans annually that focus on delivering the Government's objective of the 7% reduction is a significant undertaking.  That coupled with the commitment in the programme for Government to have the monitoring and reporting of progress on a quarterly basis is where the accountability lies.  Transparency on those measures which have been deemed to be the key and core measures to deliver the reduction as provided for in the carbon budgets is the crux of accountability as I see it under the Bill, in terms of delivering on the targets.  Ultimately, head 13 of the Bill provides for that type of accountability through the Oireachtas, which is extremely important from a governance and structural point of view.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

We have looked it more widely in terms of the work it is doing on using well-being and indicators.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point, and it connects back to Deputy Bruton's question.  We are very sensitive about framing the challenge as being, on the one hand, a slow process of engagement with people and, on the other, sweeping urgent changes.  If we refer back to agriculture, what one must grapple with is the complexity.  Nobody disputes the overall scale and urgency of the challenge.  Carbon budgets move us on and help to quantify the challenge, but we are still left with the complexity of exactly how we do it.  That is where one needs to engage with the people on the urgency.  I do not believe that engagement with people should be characterised as slow.  It must be enthused with ambition.  However, it is absolutely necessary.  Otherwise, at some point the top-down idea of even a carbon budget does not deliver because it does not engage with the actual complexities of the problem.</p> <p>  It was interesting when Ms Finegan spoke about the Taoiseach's Department's point of view.</p><p>The crux of the issue is often the fact that we must look at implementation, really grapple with these complexities and not assume they can be glossed over.  This is where we really must make progress.  That kind of framing needs to be front and centre.  It is about the complexities and the ambition to deal with them rather than an either-or scenario.  This is really important, particularly in agriculture.  </p></speech>

It relates to a question raised earlier by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan about the question of uncertainty and the level of uncertainty around responses to climate.  An excellent report on climate governance by NESC in 2019 contained some very useful and important insights into the complexity of these issues.  If there are no objections, I will read a very useful extract from that concerning this response to uncertainty.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The necessary response to this uncertainty cannot be inaction and speculative deliberation about the  correct, ideal or even most cost-effective course of  action.  Instead, it must be practical action on many fronts, intensive monitoring and review, learning and ratcheting emissions reduction.  </blockquote> <p>That captures succinctly captures the issue discussed by Dr. O'Connell and the problem more generally.  That relentless focus on implementation and identifying individual measures that will be taken to address the problem is crucial.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of deep thinking and conversation.  From what Professor Anderson said, it is really clear that we should have taken action many years ago and that we are in dangerous waters, are unlikely to hit the 1.5&deg;C target, many people are already dying around the world and this country has imposed a lot of that on poorer countries.  What is also clear from the opening statements is that there is no mention of intergenerational justice or justice for other parts of the world.  This is not to say that I believe the witnesses do not think this is important.  It does, however, outline why for us this question of just transition is so difficult to pin down.  The witnesses spoke about the inherent complexity around the sharing of burdens and opportunities but we have had many of the opportunities and placed burdens on other countries under the current model, which has got us where we are.  If we look at the current workforce in Ireland, we are not really taking the opportunities for future generations into account when it comes to the actions we are taking.  From a legislative point of view, we do not want to be tied up in court cases about job losses - we want to ensure they do not happen - and, therefore, cannot take action.  Neither future generations nor people in other countries can take those court cases on the basis of what is happening now.  How from a very practical point of view can we ensure that we define just transition in a way that will not allow us to get out of some difficult decisions that must be taken?  I take on board a lot of what Professor Anderson said about Thomas Piketty, the owners of capital and how there needs to a greater emphasis on them but how do we put this all into legislation that will not tie us up forever and get us out of meeting these very real challenges?</p></speech>

It has been outlined in the opening statement, that when it comes to just transition, people do not necessarily talk about intergenerational issues all of the time.  They talk about current job losses.  How do we frame that in a legislative way that will ensure there is not more emphasis on current job losses rather than on other obligations?</p></speech>

As I said, I am not expert on this but Wales has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act, has considered this very strongly with regard to its policies and practices and has found that a very useful way of commenting on current developments.  In terms of just transition, it is rooted in the here and now in terms of fairness and process.  Involving young people in the framing of just transition is really important and that is why the process piece is so critical.  Regarding focusing on principles, again, I am not a legal expert but enshrining that in the direction of travel and the ambition is not restricting action on a policy front.  The just transition perspective is inherently vague in many cases.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly is right.  It needs to be pinned down, which is why further work needs to be done to flesh out how it would apply to particular sectors and subgroups of society and generations.  However, as Ms Finegan has pointed out, this does not shy away from getting on with it and acting first so long as the process of engaging with those key groups and sectors is clear.</p></speech>

Literally the next day, they were convening a two or one-and-a-half day event with young people on this question.  Dr. Moore is right.  Beyond the legislation, one creates a process that is really committed to seeking those views.  At our conference, there was a very interesting video compiled by some young people who live in the midlands.  It was a very impassioned plea to the people running the conference and the policymakers not to forget about their futures and how they wanted to live in the midlands.  It is really important that we create a process where we can hear those voices and engage with young people.</p></speech>

Some fairly significant steps forward have been made.  There are a relatively small number of actions on this in the climate action plan.  There are things around seeking to double the percentage of overseas development aid spending on climate finance by 2030.  We are well on track to do that.  Other actions include placing climate action, particularly for least developed countries and small island developing states, at the heart of development co-operation and policy partnerships and engaging in multilateral processes.  There are real opportunities in the next iteration of the plan to look more carefully at this and think carefully about it.<br/><br/>Regarding the intergenerational point, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to look at the climate dialogue process.  Bringing in young people as part of that will be hugely important.  My Department recently did some work to make our online presence a little more accessible.  There is a new section on climate action on <i>gov.ie</i>where we have been trying to make information as accessible as possible.  One of the things we have done is engage with Comhairle na n&Oacute;g to get its assistance in making some of our material more accessible and developing a jargon buster.  A lot of the time, the information policymakers use to talk about climate is very inaccessible so we are trying to draw them into the conversation.  We are at an advanced stage of that work.  Comhairle na n&Oacute;g has been really engaged on that and we have been assisted on that by our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, so work is ongoing.</p><p>Considerable further work is required.  We feel confident that the new dialogue process will seek to address some of those challenges. </p></speech>

There is considerable overlap in the contributions and questions.  I can see weakness in the Bill reflected in many of the comments, including the lack of emphasis on just transition.  We are left with the conundrum of how we should include it in the legislation.  What is the appropriate way to do it?  Are there international comparisons?  Scotland was mentioned.  I would like to hear the witnesses' perspectives on that.  To what extent should we seek to include just transition?  Should it be running through the document or should a specific section capture it?  For example, should it be referenced in the make-up of the climate council?  Participation is a point that has come up repeatedly.  What work needs to be done to include that participatory element with specific reference to just transition?  Those are questions for the witnesses from NESC.</p> <p>  I ask Professor Anderson to speak about Ireland's global responsibility and his point about global carbon budgets.  Obviously, just transition has a particular context for workers in the sector and people in fuel poverty, but we sit in a global context.</p></speech>

I welcome the focus on the participatory element.  I will get to that in a moment.  I believe the Scottish example is the only one that has relevance for Ireland.  I am not a legal expert, but I am very aware of how Scotland has tried to frame its recent legislation in just transition.  Its climate change Act commits its government to consider matters relating to fairness when preparing new climate change plans.  It also refers to principles, but then it draws into that level of commitment to use those principles in preparing plans.</p> <p>  In addition to principles we might want to consider how that is turned into action.  Clearly the climate change unit and the measures developed by Government will counter some of the anxieties on just transition.  There is a commitment to a just transition plan.  The programme for Government has a just transition commission statutory office.  Mechanisms are being considered to try to flesh out the policies for the delivery of just transition.  It is worth looking at the Scottish legislation.  Beyond stating its broad importance and its direction, for me the real focus is on how to bring that into effect.  How can we ensure that plans developed at a local level and at a statutory level really consider just transition?</p> <p>  Bringing that on to process, the participatory element is very important.  The Scottish Act refers to a commitment to public engagement through a citizens' assembly.  While Ireland has had an excellent Citizens' Assembly, it is important this process of engagement should be ongoing and not just a one-off.  Reflecting on a climate dialogue is really important.  I welcome the science that will be developed further.  There is a plethora of social dialogue mechanisms through NESC.  Institutionalised processes can be developed through the dialogue.  There are networks, for example the all-Ireland climate biodiversity research network.  There are civil society participatory networks.  All these could be supported and galvanised to engage on a just transition process.</p> <p>  The committee's recognition of the participatory element of just transition is welcome and is as important as the outcomes.  I am happy to direct people to the Scottish cases.  The just transition commission over there recognises in its two-year body of work the fundamental need to engage with different sectors, industries, bodies and regions in Scotland to try to flesh out how to bring about a just transition.  I recognise that it is frustrating in that it takes this kind of time and depth.   However, bringing everybody on board in that process is very important.</p></speech>

People in some of the smaller countries I work with, such as Norway, Sweden and even Scotland often ask how they matter given that they are just a small part of the picture when compared with other parts.  Nevertheless, it is interesting that these small countries can often punch well above their weight.  What we require most importantly are examples at home.  If Ireland can put in place a carbon budget that is aligned with the Paris Agreement, has a very clear transparent framing of how it comes to the conclusions it has reached on its carbon budget and demonstrates that leadership at home, it becomes a very important international example of what we should be doing.  It also needs to talk vociferously and honestly about the difficulties, benefits, challenges, successes and so forth.</p> <p>  Thankfully Ireland is still part of the EU; that is a separate issue.  Ireland has scope to push hard within the EU which obviously has even greater international clout.  The EU is considering carbon budget framing.  Based on my discussions with President von der Leyen's adviser on this, I believe it will still be incredibly weak.  We do not have time for more weak policies and delusion.  We need carbon budgets that are in line with the science of 1.5&deg;C to 2&deg;C.  If Ireland is doing that at home, it should be able to push that much harder in the EU.  Some of the Swedish MEPs are also keen to do that.  Ireland should find those comrade voices to come together on these issues.</p> <p>  We also need to consider things like foreign policy.  I do not know Ireland's situation.  I know more about the UK, whose foreign policy is littered with examples of doing things completely counter to the issues of climate change.  For example, it is funding Mozambique in liquid natural gas, LNG, terminals and so forth.  I do not know what that is like in Ireland, but its foreign policy needs to have climate change woven throughout it.  If it does not meet the broad framing of climate change aligned with the Paris Agreement, it needs to rethink its foreign policy.  Ireland should try to demonstrate leadership at home and find other smaller nations that it can come together with to try to increase the power of its voice as a relatively small nation.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank Professor Anderson for focusing on the climate justice issue which I think is important.  Two separate questions have come across all these hearings.  There is the question of how the level of emissions that need to be cut is calculated - the targets and budgets.  That needs to be based on science and not negotiated.  Professor Anderson mentioned that we should not use external offsetting and that while we may invest in negative emissions technology or CCS, we should not base our targets or our budgets on speculation on carbon capture or negative emissions technology.  That covers the science.</p> <p>  Linked to that and the targets is the principle in the Paris Agreement of the common but differentiated responsibility.  I ask Professor Anderson to underscore the importance of naming that and ensuring it is reflected in this Bill.  Besides that core issue, does he have wider comments on how we reflect climate justice?  He mentioned how useful support for not acting counter to the sustainable development goals both nationally and internationally might be a useful tool for us in both climate justice and just transition.</p> <p>  Just transition is in the space of how things are achieved through policy or possibly sectoral plans.</p><p>Will the NESC representatives comment on the importance of social dialogue?  It has been used in Scotland and Spain quite successfully.  Within that social dialogue, how important is it that the frame of the dialogue be wide enough to allow workers and communities to give opinions on corporate and state policy?  Rather than responding to a crisis in a specific factory or business, how important is it that those just transition dialogues are wide enough to prepare for that kind of Green New Deal, FDR Marshall Plan thinking that we may need?  Dovetailing with that, will they comment on the importance of accelerating just transition dialogue and consideration so they are part of our Covid-19 and Brexit recovery strategies?</p><p> I would also like Ms Finegan to comment on that.  How does she see our climate response and Covid-19 and Brexit responses working together?  It is concerning that we have gone to a less than half compliance rate this year during the Covid response when many would say Covid-19 is a reminder that we need to accelerate achievement of climate targets?  How can that be achieved?  When there is a failure in achieving a budget or target, where does responsibility sit?  Is it with the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications or another Minister who has failed to achieve a specific target?  Where does the accountability land?</p><p> In terms of response, we know 1% of unfulfilled targets can be carried over to the next period.  What about the other 99% of unfulfilled target or budget?  When the budget has been exceeded, what sanctions would be appropriate for achieving that?  Ms Finegan mentions that Ireland will only meet its existing emission reduction targets with full implementation of all measures in the climate action plan.  Those targets are much lower than those we are discussing now, be it 50% 60% 70% or 80%, as suggested by Professor Anderson.  In that context, where are the new measures to come from and might some of them be the kind of targeted measures towards high emitters suggested by him?  I thank the speakers again.  I have more questions but I do not have time. </p></speech>

I will pick up on the important statement that science does not negotiate.  That is key.  I always argue that physics trumps economics at the end of the day but it is worth bearing in mind that often the science is unhelpfully flavoured with lots of assumptions about things such as negative emission technology.  That also needs to be unpicked and revealed.  That is not science, but politics masquerading as science so we should be cautious of that.</p> <p>  Common but differentiated responsibility is a key concept that has been developed over several decades.  Until this point, it has only been paid lip service by the wealthy parts of the world.  Countries such as the UK and Scotland are using net-zero language.  Many countries and some companies seem to be adopting that sort of approach.  If one unpicks what is behind it, one finds that large negative emissions are assumed, as are ongoing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use after 2050.  When you play that out, that is a deeply colonial approach.  First, they are assuming a larger part of the carbon budget for the richer countries, which means a smaller part for the poorer countries.  I always make the slightly flippant comment that we stole their slaves and their minerals and now we are stealing their carbon budget.  These are good people like us.  Nice liberal-minded people that are carrying on this sort of activity and not reflecting to ourselves about what we are doing.  The other thing it is doing is stealing the opportunity for prosperity and a good quality of life from our own children and future generations and from people in poorer parts of the world today.  We are relying on negative emissions technologies so we are buck-passing on two levels.  We are buck-passing to poorer parts of the world and to future generations.  The problem is that once that buck-passing is stopped, the implications for us high emitters are so significant that we are not prepared to countenance them.  Until we are  prepared to do that and have some internal integrity, we will fail on climate change. </p> <p>  The sustainable development goals, SDGs, are important and there will be conflict here.  Climate change is one of the SDGs and there are some conflicts in some of those things.  When we try to deal with climate change in the near term, it might have a temporarily negative impact on some of the other SDGs.  We have to think about those things in advance.  I have big issues with the one on economic growth.  That is not an appropriate way to measure the prosperity of wealthy countries.  That may still be appropriate for poorer countries but for wealthier countries we need to find different metrics for assessing quality of life and the Welsh have shown examples of that.  The SDGs are a useful backdrop against which we must test our climate change policies but recognise that sometimes there will be conflicts between them.  Wherever we can, we should find synergy between the SDGs and their responses to climate change.</p></speech>

One of the issues in Bord na M&oacute;na, at that stage, was that it had largely become an industrial relations issue.  It was about trying to sort out job losses and so on.  I will not comment on that process but, in general, if it is going to be a just transition, engagement has to be earlier.  It has to be a proactive dialogue and the framing is about good, decent jobs and how to create those in a specific region.</p> <p>  On the engagement with workers, what we need to do in a just transition is look at early identification of the precise skills workers have in a particular sector or area, what opportunities they see which they might like to pursue, how they can be supported to do so, how we can create enterprises that are more viable in those areas or regions that are impacted and how we ensure finance is brought to bear to support that.  The NESC work in this area for the past year was about trying to create social dialogue and to look at what processes would be needed but our key lesson was that it needs to be an early engagement and that will allow workers and enterprise in the area to have a constructive discussion and we can all agree that the objective is to create decent jobs that will secure people's future in the midlands.  That is our framing and our thought about it.  Going back to the points that Dr. Moore made, the question is how we create the institutions that are able to do that.  Our work in the Midlands suggests that, while there are some interesting institutions already in place, we can do more to enable information to flow from local county development companies into regional structures and nationally where blockages can be unlocked.  That is what we need to see to support dialogue at local level.  I am not sure if that fully answered the Senator's question but we will be happy to come back to her on it.</p></speech>

The council is producing a statement on the importance of grounding a recovery in sustainable development.  It is an important reflection on some of the key issues that Senator Higgins has raised around the need to align the sustainable development with the recovery and climate is embedded in that.  It is something to consider and that document will help inform some of that thinking.</p></speech>

The first question related to just transition as part of the response to Covid-19.</p><p>One of the commitments in the programme for Government is around the development of a new national economic plan and work is ongoing on that with my colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Future-proofing the economy and society is a key element of the work that needs to be done in considering how best to frame that.  Just transition is crucial in that respect and my colleagues, in developing the plan, will be mindful of the commitments in the programme for Government around establishing the just transition commissioner as a statutory office, publishing the just transition plan and publishing a detailed all-of-Government implementation plan consistent with the recommendations of the just transition commissioner's first report.<br/><br/>There are a number of commitments in the programme for Government that are important in this space and will ensure that the response to Covid-19 will consider just transition an important part of where we go next.  We saw signs of that in the July stimulus package and the outline of budget 2021.  These were key considerations in some of the expenditure that was committed to for budget 2021 in the area of climate.  That is what I say about that.<br/><br/>In response to the question about failure and where responsibility lands, the important thing about identifying failures where targets have not been met is around transparency and making sure there is a clearer understanding when policies that we intend to deliver are not implemented.  The climate action plan process and the publication of detailed implementation reports show, in a detailed way, what has been done, what has not been done, why it has not been done and what progress has been made.  This is crucial.  We have taken a very transparent approach to all of the work on the climate action plan.  I encourage people to have a look at those reports because they are very detailed and provide real insights into what has happened to date.<br/><br/>When we talk about failure, we are talking about whether our greenhouse gas emissions will reduce.  One of the key problems in terms of conceptually bringing people along, or allowing them to understand what is happening on climate action, is that people can feel a disconnect between knowing whether greenhouse gas emissions are reducing and how the fulfilment of Government policy delivers on their actions.  Deputy Bruton was alive to that when he was the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  He was keen to develop a climate action dashboard so that we are not relying solely on the annual inventories from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to show us if we are making progress.  Those inventories come out annually and are a lagging indicator so one never quite knows whether one is making progress.  As part of the work we have been doing, we have developed a climate action dashboard that is available at <i>gov.ie/climateaction</i>.  It shows our progress against the key targets in the climate action plan.  I envisage that we will continue to do that under the new climate action plan.  That makes it more understandable for a lay reader.  If there is a target of 500,000 retrofits over a particular period of time, the dashboard can show how well we are doing on that and how likely we are to succeed.  That makes it more understandable for the public, increases transparency and makes it more obvious to people how policies make a difference, which is hugely important.<br/><br/>On the question of where the measures will come from, the Deputy is right in saying that the current climate action plan will, if fully implemented, deliver a 3.5% reduction in emissions whereas the commitment in the programme for Government is for a 7% reduction, which is a significant step up.  Answering the question as to where those measures come from is going to be the subject of intense work by Government Departments over the coming period in order to be able to produce a plan that lays out policies to deliver that 7%.  It is a challenging target, no doubt, but that ambition is crucial because that is where we need to go.  Professor Anderson has clearly outlined the scientific evidence which supports the need for greater action more quickly.  That work is under way or beginning in Departments for the next iteration of the climate action plan, which will seek to provide a whole suite of new measures to bring us to that 7%.</p></speech>

We have had a large discussion about just transition.  In his opening remarks, Dr. O'Connell made reference to a NESC report, Addressing Employment Vulnerability as Part of a Just Transition in Ireland.  He went on to say that a request in the climate action plan asked NESC to identify steps that could be taken to address the vulnerability arising from the transition to low carbon and a more digital or automated future.  Given that, is NESC willing or able to make a recommendation around just transition for this committee?  Dr. O'Connell went on to refer to the interim report of the just transition commission and he might send to the committee a link to that report because it would be helpful.  In terms of his engagement and his advisory role, would it be possible to consider making a recommendation on that to this committee?  I heard what he said about his belief about referencing just transition in the Bill and that will be considered by the committee in a short while.</p><p>It is wonderful to have Ms Finegan here and to hear from the climate action unit within the Department of the Taoiseach.  My questions relate to climate action plans and the role of the climate action delivery board.  I think there were 183 actions referenced in the climate plan.  How are we progressing on those actions?  That will give us an indication as to how we are going to proceed and achieve, going forward, with the new Bill.  If and when the new Bill is passed, what role would Ms Finegan see for her unit?  Would its role expand?  All the various Government Departments need to be stitched together.</p><p>I welcome Ms Finegan's remarks about the involvement of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, particularly in relation to the jargon on the climate change section of <i>gov.ie</i>.  I have suggested that Comhairle na n&Oacute;g might be considered for the Climate Change Advisory Council because we need to have a future's voice on climate change.</p><p>There was a lot of food for thought in Professor Anderson's remarks, particularly around our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  What oversight or monitoring system would he recommend, post the implementation and adoption of this Bill?</p></speech>

NESC has done work in this area and has clearly come out in support of just transition.  If the Deputy's question is whether NESC will now make a recommendation, that is not in my gift.  I am secretary to a council rather than being able to do that.  We can be clear in saying that NESC, in arriving at a strong view about the importance of just transition, looked carefully at Scotland.  As I said earlier, there is an explicit reference to just transition in the Scottish legislation.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked for a link to the work to be sent on and we will certainly do that.</p></speech>

The board was established in July 2019 at the time of the publication of the climate action plan.  The board is jointly chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p><p>The establishment remit of the board was focused on overseeing the implementation of the climate action plan and the submission of the of the quarterly reports to Cabinet for publication.  It also encompassed a commitment to identifying barriers, challenges, and key lessons in the climate plan implementation.  The issues that I outlined earlier in my response to Deputy Whitmore are among those that the board has been made aware of through those structures and has discussed.  </p><p> In terms of the role of our own unit, as I mentioned previously, the establishment of a unit within the Department of the Taoiseach looking specifically at climate has been a significant new departure.  There are five of us in total working, and there is a very keen and clear focus from the centre on the need to drive implementation in relation to climate action.  I see that in this Bill, the commitment to continue having a climate action plan produced on an annual basis will mean that so long as it remains Government policy, the Department of the Taoiseach will continue to have responsibility for driving implementation of the plan and that is how I see our role.  I welcome the comments on Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  Certainly-----</p></speech>

Is it true that the current format of the annual plans allow for backloading so, according to the current draft of the Bill, to reach the average 7% reduction, the plans could delay action and leave it to the next Government?</p></speech>

It is extremely ambitious and as it is outlined, and as that staging and process works, I do not necessarily see that there will be an opportunity for the backloading of ambition.  It is clear that the delivery of the carbon budgetary process is to be aligned with Government policy, which is a 7% reduction per annum, and that is a steep, challenging and highly ambitious target, and rightly so.</p></speech>

He will provide us with an update on the Covid-19 response and the health provisions of budget 2021 and related matters.  The Minister is joined by Mr. Gerry O&rsquo;Brien, director, Department of Health.  I am told the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Butler, will join us shortly.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for public health, well-being and national drugs strategy, Deputy Feighan, is joining via video link as is Mr. Paul Bolger, director, Department of Health.</p> <p>  Before we hear the Minister's opening statement I must point out to the witnesses presenting remotely that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege will apply to witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the precincts of Leinster House.  This includes Ministers of State.  If witnesses are directed, therefore, by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Before we get the Minister's opening statement, which some of us have just received, as this is the first meeting we have had with him I wish to say we look forward to meeting with him and his Minsters of State.  We want to work with him and not against him.  However, last week we had witnesses before us who deal with tracking and tracing and the issue of key staff seconded to that area was discussed.  I think we would all agree that the use of trained professional occupational therapists, OTs, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists is less than ideal.  It is impacting on other services and is not sustainable in the long term.  I think we would all agree that our health service has to be about more than just responding to Covid and while it is a priority, we cannot ignore or disregard other life-changing and life-saving elements of the service.</p><p>To put today's meeting in context, the general secretary of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, was before the committee two weeks ago.  She gave evidence that across the State, 15 nurses a week are contracting Covid-19.  This is probably a failure from the point of view of occupational health and safety, but what can we do to reduce the number to as close to zero as possible?  Perhaps we can support front-line workers who are living with the long-term fallout of Covid-19 and that was one of the points Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha made.  </p><p> Student nurses were also mentioned and they have been working above and beyond the call of duty during this crisis.  There was a scheme in place earlier and I do not know if the Minister will address this point in his statement but we would be keen for some sort of scheme to be introduced for them.  Do the Minister and the Department have any plans to work with training colleges and hospital groups to bring in a standardised, liveable payment scheme for student nurses?</p><p> The issue of medical cards for the terminally ill is a topical issue which I raised last year with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  I believe that will be discussed today.  It came as a surprise to many of us that it was not included in budget 2021.  There was support from members of all parties and none in the Oireachtas.  If the Minister does not have time today, he might come back to us on that point at some stage.</p><p> The committee looks forward to the Minister's introductory remarks.</p></speech>

I also thank the committee members; I am delighted to be here today.  It is my first time to attend a meeting of the new health committee and I wish all its members well in their work.  I look forward to engaging with them to that end on a regular basis.</p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, the Minister of State with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy, Deputy Feighan, and Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Butler.</p> <p>  The committee invited me to give an update on the implementation of the resilience and recovery plan for living with Covid-19 and the timeframe for delivery of budget 2021 measures.  As I believe has been communicated to the committee, the implementation of the budget is being developed with the HSE and the implementation plan will be available as part of the national service plan that will be published in December.  I am happy to return to the committee and discuss that plan when the detail is finalised.</p> <p>  I am going to focus on Covid for now, if that is okay.  As we all know, it has been a difficult year for everyone in Ireland and across the world.  Tens of thousands of people here have contracted Covid-19.  Many have made a full recovery but some have been left with serious long-term health issues.  We all know that, as of today, 1,922 women and men in Ireland have lost their lives to this virus.  We all mourn this tragic loss of life.</p> <p>  The decision to move to level 5 two weeks ago was made due to evidence showing the rapid increase in case numbers and the need to get the virus down to much lower levels.  I am glad to share with my colleagues that there have been positive signs in recent days.  As of yesterday, the 14-day incidence rate was 228 cases per 100,000.  There were 278 per 100,000 in the previous 14-day period.  The rate is falling in 23 of the 26 counties.  I am happy to share new information that the R-nought, which was at 1 last week, has been recalculated as of this morning to between 0.7 and 0.9.  Critically, the average number of close contacts has fallen from approximately six to three and the testing positivity rate is also falling and now stands at 4.7%.  By moving early and comprehensively, Ireland is currently bucking the trend that is being seen in many parts of Europe.  The 14-day rate in France, for example, is 830 per 100,000.  In Spain, it is 567 and in the UK, it is 469.</p> <p>  While our figures are hopeful, the number of positive cases remains of serious concern and it is worth reflecting on the fact that almost 11,000 new cases have been reported in the past two weeks.  We must continually and actively suppress this virus to the greatest extent possible.  Part of this response comes from our testing and tracing system.  Our testing rates are high by international standards and we continue to run serial testing in nursing homes and food production facilities.  As committee members will be aware, the HSE initially put in place capacity to meet the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to be able to do up to 100,000 tests per week.  I met with representatives of the HSE some time ago and asked if they would look to increase that capacity.  Testing capacity was recently increased from 100,000 tests per week to 120,000 tests per week.  I am delighted to be able to share for the first time that the HSE has now confirmed that it can do up to 140,000 tests per week.  I want to give the men and women working in the HSE great credit for that.  They are working night and day and to go from 100,000 tests, which was already favourable by international standards, to 140,000 is fantastic work.  I thank them for it.</p> <p>  In parallel, it is important that demand for testing has gone down by at least 40% in the past week.  That is obviously in line with the number of infections coming down.  At the same time, the HSE continues to recruit contract tracers and community swabbers.  It is important to say that testing and tracing alone is not going to suppress this pandemic here or anywhere else.  We must work together to protect our health services for both Covid-19 and non-Covid care, ensure our education and childcare facilities remain open, protect jobs and move the country to lower levels on the framework.  With that in mind, I recognise the work of every member of this committee, on all sides, in fighting against this pandemic.  I thank every member for everything they have done in the past eight months to support the country during what has been a very difficult time.  I have no doubt that the members of the committee will continue with that work in the months to come.</p></speech>

I will touch on a few issues.  I know that the Minister may not have all the answers to the questions I ask but he might provide some written replies.</p> <p>  I had a call this morning from someone whose daughter had been in contact with somebody who had been identified as positive for the virus.  When that person rang their GP, they were advised that the GP could not refer them for testing but instead they had to wait to be contacted by the HSE.  It was a further five days before there was contact.  From start to finish, there was a gap of 12 days.  In a case where someone knows they were in contact with a person who is positive for the virus and that person has not been contacted by the HSE, surely we should have a mechanism whereby a GP can refer the person for testing.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  My second question is about elective hospitals and I have raised the issue for the past two years.  We do not appear to have made any further progress on that issue compared with this time last year.  We have not identified sites, the size of the hospitals, or when we are going to start going through the planning process.  Where are we in relation to the three elective hospitals that are in the 2040 plan?  Have sites been identified?  When will that be progressed?  When will we take decisive action on this matter?</p> <p>  The third issue I raise relates to employment in the HSE and is a particular bone of contention.  We have taken on more than 20,000 additional staff in the HSE over the past four years.  We have gone from 103,000 to 123,000 staff.  We talk about developing community healthcare but, in that period of time, there has been an average 17% increase in all areas except public health nurses.  Staff numbers have only gone up by 3.5% in that sector.  Will that issue be dealt with?</p> <p>  It is fine to talk about increasing the number of acute beds but do we have the ability to increase capacity for doing testing, whether X-rays, MRI scans or any of the other tests that patients require?</p><p>Opening an additional 1,200 beds is fine, but will we at the same time increase capacity for testing and ensure that  those beds are used efficiently, rather than it just being a case of people being in beds and waiting for access to the various scans and tests they require?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#C00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy on the tracing issue.  There is a balance to be struck.  The public health teams identify close contacts.  If someone is designated to be a close contact, he or she will be referred for testing and be subject to a two-week period of self-restricted movement.  It is inevitable that some people will know they are close contacts.  Speed matters on this, as does people being tested and restricting their movements.  The HSE is examining the issue.  The example the Deputy gave should not be happening and I will take it up with the HSE.</p> <p>  There is a balance to be struck.  In school settings, for example, the public health teams have been working closely with teachers and principals.  I have seen a number of cases where people believed themselves to be close contacts but when the experts took a look, the close-contact number is dramatically reduced.  There is a balance to be struck between speed and obvious cases where people know they are close contacts.  We need to facilitate them being able to self-refer to a GP.  As part of that balance, we do not want a large number of people deemed not to be a risk, at least by an expert analysis, to be included.  I will certainly take up the Deputy's point.</p> <p>  On the question about public health nurses, the short answer is that it is being expanded.  Several steps are being taken with the public health departments at the same time, one of which involves creating consultant contracts for public health doctors.  There is ongoing dialogue between the public health doctors, their representative body and my Department about the process.  It is essential, and the doctors have been waiting a long time for it.  I intend to put it in place as quickly as possible.  At the same time, we are doubling the public health workforce.  There are currently 71 public health doctors and a total workforce of approximately 250, a good portion of which comprises public health nurses.  In doubling the public health workforce from 250 to approximately 500, work is ongoing between my Department and the HSE to determine the best configuration of that.  In line with the Deputy's point, it will examine what are the best numbers of nurses, scientists, doctors, support staff and so forth.  A bunch of them will work at the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, while others will work in the various public health departments.</p> <p>  The question about acute beds was a good one.  There is no point in us spending a great deal of money and effort putting in place acute beds, ICU beds, doctors, nurses and safe staffing levels while leaving a bottleneck at diagnostics.  There are now serious bottlenecks in many parts of the country for various diagnostics.  We are, therefore, approaching this in two ways.  There is a long waiting list of people who need to be seen.  I have created an access to care fund of several hundred million euro and a large body of work will start soon with the HSE, my Department, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and other stakeholders to decide how we will deal with these long waiting lists, including for diagnostics.  Up to now, the NTPF has not been able to fund diagnostics, but we will change that and get access as quickly as possible for people who have been waiting a long time.  The second step we are taking relates directly to the Deputy's question.  As we scale up acute beds, community beds and staffing, we are scaling up diagnostics too and there is funding in the budget for that.</p> <p>  Turning to the Deputy's final point on the three elective hospitals, I acknowledge that he has raised this many times and is continuing to advocate hard on it.  The elective hospital we have discussed previously is that in Cork.  The elective hospitals oversight group, chaired by Professor Frank Keane, is developing the high-level facilities spatial brief and the order of magnitude costs, which detail the clustering of the appropriate elective activities for each of the three facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  This will also include an output and facility specification based on efficient and effective service delivery.  The spatial brief will be important in determining what size each elective hospital will be and the numbers of operating theatres, rooms for patients, outpatient units and staff who need to be employed.  This information will be contained in a preliminary business case, in line with the public spending code, and I am happy to report it is due to be completed before the end of the year.</p></speech>

Is the Minister satisfied that something will happen and that decisions will be taken?  We have yet to identify sites and then we will have to go through a planning process.  It will be three years down the road before even a sod is turned on any of these hospitals.  That is why the issue is now a priority.  Can we bring forward the decision-making process on this?</p></speech>

Based on the outcome of the strategic assessment report, the business cases will be prepared.  It is now November.  The information I have suggests the hospitals will be ready by the end of the year, which is a small number of weeks away.  When they are in place, we can carry out the project design, planning and procurement, and put the final business case together.  Critically, at the same time that we are identifying, procuring and buying or building the facility, we will plan in a detailed way the services that will go in there, as well as the staff, the equipment and so forth.</p></speech>

A simple example concerns cataract operations.  The main problem at the moment is people trying to get appointments even to be assessed before they get on the list.  If they get on the list, they can avail of the NTPF, but the problem is getting on the list.  Can we do anything to expedite the issue in order that people will be assessed on the list for surgery and then, if necessary, the service can be farmed out under the NTPF?</p></speech>

I ask that he reply to my questions with succinct responses.  If I intervene, it will be only because I feel the questions are not being answered.  My first question relates to the statutory instrument the Minister signed a couple of days ago to extend medical card access to certain categories of people, namely, the over-70s and six- to eight-year-olds.  I assume there have to be negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, in respect of some aspects of this.  Have they commenced, and if not, when will they do so?</p></speech>

It was important to me that Mr. John Wall saw the report first.  He was briefed on the report last week.  I am going to talk to him later today and I want to make sure that he has had time to read the full report.  If that is the case, then I will immediately ask the Department to release the report.  I want to have exactly the conversation that the Deputy wants to have, but could I suggest that the committee gets the report, reviews it, and then maybe we talk it through, if that is okay?  The recommendations and the views of the clinical advisory group are very important for the conversation.</p></speech>

We can see that in so many areas.  People need to get this done, and it needs to be brought over the line.  Indeed, the Minister campaigned for it himself.  I want to see it delivered and I hope the Minister wants to see it delivered.  All I am saying is that we as a committee will work with the Minister to make it happen and we want to see the report.</p></speech>

I agree, and I will say that we can get into the detail on another day, but I am looking at short-term and more comprehensive longer-term actions, as well, in response to the point the Deputy just made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#D02500"><p>I wish to raise a separate issue with the Minister, and it is one close to my own heart, to pardon the pun, in Waterford, namely, the cardiac care issue.  I have not had the chance to raise the issue with the Minister as a member of the committee, but I have done so on two occasions on the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  When I looked at this issue, it struck me that the plan to add a second cath lab was signed off on in 2018, and we are now in late 2020.  It is a case study of how long it takes for a capital project from conception to delivery, and for the lab to be opened.  We are now being told that it will be 2012, if not 2022, before it is open and operational.  There was a private hospital in Waterford, which, from conception to delivery, built a cath lab in six months, and we are still waiting for the public one.  That is because of the procurement process and the very complicated stages that a project has to go through.  In my view, it is very similar to the delivery of housing projects, where there is a four-stage process which complicates delivery.  I ask the Minister to have a look at that process.  Second, the primary issue and the bigger issue for the people of Waterford is not just that second cath lab, but 24-7 emergency cardiac care.  Is that something to which the Minister is still committed, and how is that going to be delivered?  We are up against time restrictions, so I will ask my final question to give the Minister time to respond.  It is on the issue of beds.  I think there was a bit of spin in the Minister's budget when when he stated that 1,145 additional beds would be provided.  That figure relates to the 2019 baseline and not that of 2020.</p></speech>

A very small allocation of capital funding is being made available - &euro;45 million, as the Minister said in his opening statement.  I have spoken to many hospital managers, including those in my own constituency and elsewhere, who do not have the space to open new beds.  A lot of the wards are old nightingale wards, so when these managers hear about thousands of additional beds, they wonder where the staff are coming from, and they do not have the physical space.  Is the Minister looking at rapid build modular units in some of those hospitals?  If he is, why was there not a greater capital allocation made?  I am concerned that figures are being thrown out in relation to the opening of additional beds.  If the capital funding is not made available to match the funding required to recruit the staff, hospitals simply will not have the space to open them.  I have that concern myself and I have had the same concern directly communicated to me by hospital managers.  I ask the Minister to respond.</p></speech>

The 1,100+ beds figure is one that relates to a commitment to have, by the end of next year, additional acute beds, over and above the fully-funded beds for this year.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy has raised a very fair question on whether capital is being provided.  There is over &euro;1 billion in the capital in the budget for next year.  It is &euro;1,35,000,000.  There is &euro;900 million for construction and equipping, &euro;120 million for ICT and e-health, and another &euro;15 million for agencies, so the capital is there.  It is fair to say that what we are doing is that we are being very ambitious in terms of what we can do for patients, in respect of beds in the acute areas and the community, and in terms of hiring.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are seeking to hire an additional 16,000 people.  I believe that we have pushed it right to the edge of what is possible to do in one year.  We have been very ambitious, and the focus now has to be on implementation.</p></speech>

I have around eight or nine questions, and I ask the Minister to be mindful of the clock.  Some of the answers might be appropriate to make in writing, and I have no issue with that being done.</p> <p>  First I ask the Minister to convey my thanks, as a public representative, to his officials and those in the HSE for the continued Trojan work they are doing on the front line in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic and keeping people safe.  It is also important to acknowledge some of the Minister's achievements since he has assumed office.  Testing has broken through the 100,00 barrier, which it was nowhere near what it was when he became Minister for Health.  The Minister introduced localised testing, which had not really previously existed, particularly in the context of the lockdown in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, and he moved very quickly on adapting school testing to the needs and concerns of teachers and parents, particularly those that have been raised in the last few weeks.  The Minister, his Department and officials, and the HSE have shown a high degree of agility in that.  I also welcome the funding in the budget for dementia, disability and the winter plan.  That should all go on the record.  The Minister has delivered all of that with a calmness, which often goes unacknowledged.</p> <p>  I refer to my own constituency, and the figures available for local electoral areas.</p><p>I have four electoral areas.  Positive cases are in excess of the national average in one of them.  It is a disadvantaged area.  This pattern is replicated nationally.  What strategies are in place, given that is a consistent figure, to address this in some shape or form or to address the underlying causes of why positive cases may be more prominent in disadvantaged areas?  That is a question.</p></speech>

I am taking note of the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#E00300"><p>I will ask another question while the Minister is scribbling.  I read at the weekend that Slovakia is antigen testing half of the population, some 2.5 million people.  What is the view of the Minister and NPHET on this?  Some 25,000 people tested positive.  The regime of tracing and isolation and so on has followed that.  Is it a useful exercise?  What is the view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#E00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words.  I agree with him wholeheartedly about the Department of Health, the HSE, HIQA and the other State agencies regarding the volume of work that the various organisations have to do and the fact that Covid probably doubles the work.  The staff have not doubled.  This has meant that in the Department, HSE, HIQA, HPSC, HPRA and across the board the same people are working incredibly long hours.  They are working at weekends.  I have talked to people within the system, including public health doctors, who have gone weeks without seeing their children.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to disadvantaged areas and high positivity rates.  It is a good question.  One of the measures the HSE is taking is to bring in mobile testing and try to create high visibility.  There is considerable engagement with schools but more needs to be done.</p> <p>  I am unsure whether it is part of the same issue but I am conscious that two districts in Dublin are bucking the trend.  Dublin is not reducing its case numbers as much as we would like.  In the recent period the figures have gone down in these areas by 13%.  That is significantly lower than the reductions we are seeing in other parts.  This applies in two areas, Dublin North and Dublin South-West.  One is stable.  Dublin South-West is not seeing any reduction, but in Dublin North the figures are going back up again.</p> <p>  It is a pertinent question.  Mobile testing is being deployed so that there is more visibility.  There are supports for nursing homes and so forth, but I am open to other suggestions on what else needs to be done.</p></speech>

Can the Minister, the HSE or NPHET communicate on whether they have established any underlying causes?  Aside from the obvious reasons, why do areas of economic and social disadvantage find it more challenging?  Can they elucidate the reasons in writing for us?  Can the Minister comment on the Slovakian antigen exercise?</p></speech>

We are going to see where it goes.  Other European countries are looking at scaling up rapid testing, be it molecular or antibody testing, quickly.  What Slovakia is doing is interesting.  The latest figures I have from public health officials suggest such tests, if they are done right and if the testing is good and the sensitivity and the specificity are right, will capture up to 80% of true positives.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are watching it closely.  Right now, I am pushing for us to get an answer on which of these molecular or antibody tests we can use, because I believe they could be a game-changer.  For example, PCR testing costs approximately &euro;200 from end to end and takes time.  The antigen tests can cost &euro;10 and are done on-site.  In fact, I was given one the other day to take a look at.  I am told it took five minutes to do.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minster could follow up on that.</p> <p>  My final question may require a written answer.  It comes down to essential and non-essential business.  We cannot repeat what we have done previously when it comes to the next surge.  There will be another surge, so I urge the Minister to keep the tracing numbers up and consistent.  We should not make the mistake that was made over the summer of letting tracers go.</p> <p>  We must have data at this stage on how many cases arose in the large multiples and retails stores, including Super Valu and Tesco.  What was the rate?  What was the rate in non-essential stores?  What about barbers, beauticians, hairdressers, hardware stores and furniture shops, etc.?  Does NPHET have data on those?  How do these figures feed in?  We are going to have to be agile and flexible in terms of opening hours for barbers and hairdressers if we reach level 3 again.  Perhaps barbers can open between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. if we want to reduce mobility or have people moving at different times.  There must be data.  There must also be data on the effectiveness of mask wearing.  Is the Minister in a position to furnish the committee with any information on that?</p></speech>

At the moment NPHET is conducting a review.  I have spoken with the CMO about visors.  The unambiguous answer is to stop using them.  They do not work.  We have to use face coverings.  More needs to be done, at a minimum on communications, in terms of how to wear face coverings.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the percentages per workplace.  The answer is that this information exists and I will get it to the committee.  The one addendum that the public health teams always give me when I ask them these exact questions is that the systems can trace a person's profession and where they have it, but the virus could be in a person's system for two weeks before he or she tests positive.  It can take time to build up.</p></speech>

There are several areas throughout the country where people would like to keep farmers' markets open.  Some guidance on that would be useful.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for attending.  I presume several Deputies have, like myself, written to him about the constraints on partners who would like to attend antenatal scans and appointments with their pregnant partners.</p><p>We have received an answer from the Minister on that.  There are guidelines, we all want to keep staff safe and there are constraints in terms of the size of our hospitals.  However, I would like to know whether any further work is being done on that and whether the Minister's colleague has information - perhaps this relates to the budget - on funding and support for perinatal mental health. </p></speech>

For some people it is frustrating that mums, dads and partners cannot get in for scans.  We have also been made aware, as I am sure the Deputy has, of really traumatic situations where things have gone wrong during birth and the partners cannot get in then either, at a time when the women really need the support.  It is very difficult.  On the back of representations that were made by the Deputy and others, we asked the clinical leads to take a look and come up with national guidelines.  They are doing that.  We have asked that, within the context of clinical safety, anything that can be done is done, particularly in the most heartbreaking and serious of cases.  There is a balance to be struck whereby, whatever local calls are made by maternity services, I need to back them up.  If one looks at the infection rates in the maternity services relative to some other parts, they are very low.  They have taken a hard-core attitude but in terms of keeping mothers and babies safe, they appear to have done a very good job.  However, we have to try to find a balance on compassionate grounds as well.</p></speech>

We will have another session on the budget but I am interested in that issue of funding for perinatal mental health in the next session.</p> <p>  I have two questions on disability services.  There is a recent report of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, reporting a residential centre for people with disabilities due to concerns around the quality of the care being offered.  Are we managing during the Covid crisis to carry out the same level of inspections as we would expect?  Second, there is a suspension regarding primary medical certificates.  I understand this is a complex legal and policy issue on the back of a Supreme Court judgment.  Could the Minister set out a timeline for resumption of those assessments?  A number of people will have become disabled during the Covid period and now cannot access the support they want because they cannot be assessed for a primary medical certificate.  </p></speech>

I have raised it with the Department and I am looking for a report on it.  I will revert back to the Deputy with detail because, as she says, there are complex legalities to it but it has to be sorted out very quickly.  On HIQA inspections in disability services, I will ask HIQA to come back to me with the details on those numbers.</p> <p>  On perinatal mental health, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, might want to contribute.  </p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State.  The issue around primary medical certificates is an urgent one.

There was a recent report around HSE staff being sent to nursing homes, including a number sent to private nursing homes, although a smaller number than the overall total.  We are all aware that nursing homes are at the front line of the Covid-19 battle and are experiencing some of the greatest number of losses.  That level of staff shortage seems to be due to staff contracting Covid-19 or being in self-isolation and trying to do the right thing.  How are we dealing with HSE staff being seconded to nursing homes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#F00900"><p>I ask the Minister, Deputy Butler, to come in on that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#F01000"><p>It is a valid question.  A huge amount of work has been done in relation to supporting nursing homes since the earlier outbreak.  The pandemic bore down hardest on older people in nursing homes.  A huge amount of support has been put in place in respect of personal protective equipment, PPE, routine testing every two weeks for staff and the temporary assistance payment, which supports nursing homes financially.  The Deputy is right to say that one of the issues that has arisen is a lack of agency staff, especially for rural nursing homes.  There are 51 nursing homes with outbreaks at the moment.  We are working with a nursing home in County Kerry where 19 staff have contracted Covid, including the manager and the person in charge.  It is a really difficult issue.  The Covid support teams in the community, the HSE and HIQA are on site and we are working at the moment to come up with a plan.  The issue at the moment is it is difficult to have enough agency staff nurses and if someone works in one nursing home today, he or she cannot work in a different nursing home the same day or the next because we are trying to prevent cross-contamination.  We have dealt with a huge number of issues related to nursing homes and as the Deputy correctly noted, the one we are facing now is having enough staff to go in.  We are conscious of that and I have a meeting scheduled this week with the HSE and the Department on that issue.</p></speech>

I will concentrate on a number of issues.  The first concerns the Minister's submission on budget 2021 and ICU beds.  The Minister committed to 321 ICU beds by the end of next year.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association says we need 579 beds right now.  There is a shortfall of nearly 260.  Is the Minister confident he can deliver those beds?  More importantly, as we heard from representatives from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, a couple of weeks ago, there is a serious shortage of ICU nurses and staff.  Are the Minister, the HSE and the Department of Health confident they can meet the demand for these specialised nurses and ICU beds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#F01200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The point he is making essentially concerns whether we are going to get to enough ICU beds by the end of next year.  No, we are not.  It has to be a multi-year program.  We have worked closely with the HSE to determine what is possible.  For example, the HSE had planned to introduce some beds in quarter 1 of 2022.  We worked with them to say, "No, we will get them in in the coming year.  Let us fund them.  Let us push it."  For the very reasons the Deputy has outlined, we have to do it over several years.  If it were just a question of getting the beds and buying the kit and facilities around it, that would not be a problem.  However, each bed needs six full-time staff and they are highly specialised.  The HSE, during the outbreak, trained about 1,400 nurses with ICU skills but it is an important point that we miss sometimes that they are not designated ICU specialists.  They have additional training so they can step in but we need full specialist training for the nurses in ICU to be completed.  What we have in the budget for next year and what we are working through in the service plan is what we think is at the outer edge of what is possible.  I want to do the same thing the following year and the following year again because I think we came into this year with 252 beds or thereabouts and it is acknowledged across the system that this is a serious deficit.  We have an ambitious programme in place for the next few years to deal with that.</p></speech>

There is also the legacy of thousands of beds that were taken out of the health system over the past 25 years.  We are coming from a low base and that has exposed the public health system.</p></speech>

That is 260 more than we will have at the end of next year.</p></speech>

In terms of the figures I have been talking to people about, it is about how we can get up to about 500 ICU beds.  I guess it depends on time.  I could look at the detail of the ICU situation.  I am confident that we are putting in as many next year as the system feels it is capable of facilitating for all the reasons the Deputy has laid out.  We have got to do the same thing the following year and the year after that.  If we do so, in the next three years we would be adding somewhere between 180 and north of 200 beds.  That would almost double our ICU capacity in just three years.  It would be a major task but we have to be very ambitious on this because there is a bottleneck.  I have had, as I am sure has every member of this committee, many representations over the years from people who were waiting for urgent, often complex surgery.  They were good to go.  They were brought in the night before and prepped.  The doctors and the operating theatre were ready to go and a the last minute a major trauma case came through the emergency department doors and they were told, "Sorry, we have to postpone the operation again because there is not an ICU bed available."  It has to be guaranteed and ready for the person, and that is something we have to address.</p></speech>

The additional personal assistant, PA, hours and additional funding for disability services are welcome.  The decongregation of services for those who are living with a disability in a community setting is very welcome.</p> <p>  On a different issue, I raised the medical cannabis access programme with the Minister a while ago.  The response I have been getting from the Department is very frustrating.  Many people and families who campaigned last year were hopeful that the change in the law last year would mean they would get access and that the access programme would be up and running.  However, the Minister got a memorandum during the summer which stated that there was no specific budgetary allocations for the programme, which meant that the programme would not be up and running.  This programme has been flagged for the past three and a half years.  If we think about it, it makes sense.  Fifty people in the State have licences for access to medical cannabis but there is no joined-up thinking in terms of how those children are doing and how people are getting funding for this drug.  It is extremely frustrating.  Can the Minister make a commitment on when the medical cannabis access programme will progress and start?</p></speech>

The scientific review has been completed and it advises that we should put the controlled access programme in place for patients with one of the three conditions of which the Deputy will be aware.  The expert reference group then developed clinical guidelines for the programme.  The impact of an amendment to Schedule 1 of the misuse of drugs regulation 2019 is what is being looked at.  The regulation set out the legal provisions for the operation of the medical cannabis access programme, MCAP, and the legal obligations for healthcare professionals and commercial operators.  Products listed in Schedule 1 are considered by the HPRA as suitable for inclusion in the programme.  Manufacturers then apply to the HPRA for products included in Schedule 1.  This is how we are driving it through.  There are currently three products in the Schedule and I am glad to share with the Deputy that a fourth will be added shortly.</p> <p>  On the question the Deputy has been raising, progress is being made.  I know it can seem very frustrating and I hear him on that.  The question for us is how we can continue to overcome the barriers that I accept, and the Deputy knows very well, exist.  The HSE is in pricing and supply negotiations with suppliers of the approved products, which is critical, and agreement has to be reached before the programme can commence.  What we are trying to do is get this programme up and running.</p> <p>  A recommendation of the review is that initially the programme would be run on a five-year pilot basis, which I believe is good.  The commencement of the programme is dependent on pricing and supply issues being agreed by the HSE and the manufacturers.  Critically, we had the expert review.  We had the reference group.  Three products are included in the Schedule now.  A fourth is being added.  The HSE is in discussions with the manufacturers and suppliers.  We are going to run a five-year pilot, which is a good lengthy time for this, and when the pricing and supply issues have been agreed with the HSE and the manufacturers, we can commence the programme.</p></speech>

In February 2017, the new emergency department, ED, was confirmed for University Hospital Galway, UHG.  Funding was confirmed for the design phase of a new ED at this time.  It was to be prioritised in the mid-term review of the capital plan.  It was included in Project Ireland 2040.  In September 2018, when the then Minister, Deputy Harris, visited Galway, we were told that the ED planning application was to be lodged before Christmas of that year.  It was then delayed due to this options appraisal in regard to the best use of UHG and Merlin Park lands.  It was then announced that the planning permission would proceed prior to the options appraisal.  That did not happen.  We were then told the project team were requested to include the design of maternity and paediatric services, which is welcome, but the situation is continuing and an application for planning permission has not been lodged.</p><p>I am concerned that there are some in the Saolta group who want to delay the commencement of the ED because they want to move all services from UHG out to Merlin Park, which would be a &euro;3 billion project.  They say the earliest that could start would be in ten years' time and that it will take ten years to build.  We would be talking about the end of 2040.  My concern is that the emergency department is being delayed.  In the meantime, staff and patients have to endure very difficult conditions in the emergency department in Galway.  I ask the Minister to indicate when the design for an emergency department will be complete and when an application for planning permission will be lodged?</p><p>I will ask my second question and then give the Minister time to answer both.  This day one year ago, 4 November 2019, I attended a public meeting attended by Professor Paul Donnellan on oncology services, again in UHG.  I will take about a minute to read the testimony of a cancer patient who, thankfully, is a cancer survivor.  This is from a few years ago:</p> <blockquote> 	I was diagnosed with colon cancer (Stage 3+) and had surgery in Galway.  I had felt unwell for a couple of months and was diagnosed by colonoscopy and following the surgery I was referred to a consultant oncologist who works both in GUH and the Galway Clinic.<br /><br />My first meeting with my Oncologist was scheduled for GUH, 3 weeks post-surgery.  I arrived at the hospital with my wife where we were directed to a waiting room which was completely overcrowded with 60 people.  There was no seats available and I took my place along the wall with many other patients and their family members.  From listening to accounts and conversations these patients had come from all over the west and north west.  Many were elderly and obviously quite ill.<br /><br />Over the next 90 minutes some were called and others arrived, so I eventually got a seat.  The conditions were awful with so many vulnerable, ill people packed into a completely inadequate space in a dreary, poorly maintained building.  It would be depressing on any day but following what I had endured it was almost unbearable.  Worse was to follow.<br /><br />I was eventually called and went upstairs to yet another waiting room which was so small and so overcrowded I couldn&rsquo;t even enter.  My wife and I and other patients stood in the narrow corridor, leaning against the wall for another 40 minutes until I was called.  I met with my Oncologist on that day for the first time and following my 2&frac12; hour wait &ndash; most of it standing up &ndash; he went through my diagnosis and prognosis.  We decided on a programme of chemotherapy which he said I could receive in GUH or the Galway Clinic.  I told him that I never wanted to see GUH again and it was a disgrace what patients have to put up with.  Following chemotherapy, I have made a full recovery for which I&rsquo;m very grateful but the day in GUH was, without doubt the worst of my cancer experience. </blockquote> <p>There has been no progress in the last year and the staff on the day care ward in the medical oncology department feel that this has not been prioritised within University Hospital Galway, UHG, management or the Saolta Hospital Group.</p><p>Can I have an update on plans for the medical oncology and the radiation services?  Building is progressing on this project.  I also ask about the emergency department, which is critical, and which was described by the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, a great many years ago at this stage, as not being fit for purpose.  Planning permission has still not being granted, never mind a sod turned or a block laid.</p></speech>

The experience as outlined by his constituent is just not satisfactory at all.  Nobody should have to go through that.  If I run out of time, I will provide a more detailed written answer.</p> <p>  As to the emergency department and the maternity unit, the project design team has requested an assessment of the feasibility, as the Senator said, of the inclusion of a women and children's element to the block, which is positive.  This would result in the completion of a full development as opposed to a "shell and core fit-out" of the women and children&rsquo;s upper floors.  The feasibility study has been completed and considered at this point by the HSE at national level.  Supplementary information in response to queries is being prepared locally for submission to the HSE nationally.  The project is of significant scale, which is right and proper, and has to go through all of the stages outlined in the public spending code.  A planning application has not been submitted yet but will be submitted once the design has progressed to the appropriate point.  This answer is not satisfactory for the Senator and I am, therefore, going to ask for an additional note on an indicative timeline as to when this will be done, as this is the question he asked, and it needs to be answered.</p> <p>  I will get a note for him on medical oncology services because I do not have one with me but I can give him an update on radiation oncology now.  This is better news.  Construction of the new radiation oncology unit at UHG was delayed by Covid-19, as we know.  A contract was awarded in August and construction commenced in September, which is great.  Construction will take approximately 24 months with a 12 month fit-out because it is highly specialised equipment at an estimated overall cost of &euro;62 million, which is significant and important for the entire region,</p></speech>

I will discuss just one issue particularly close to my heart, which is student nurses.  This issue has been raised at this committee previously, it was raised with the Minister last night and it has been raised in both Houses.  I wrote to the Minister about this a couple weeks ago and I am still awaiting a reply.  What would he say to a student nurse who is working for nothing in the health service to defeat the pandemic and struggling to afford her rent?  What would he say to a student nurse as she is trying to make ends meet by working for free, who is beating back the pandemic, is exposing herself and her loved ones to infection and where her landlord is threatening to evict her because she cannot afford her sky-high rent?  Would he tell her that she is being treated fairly?  I note the Fianna F&aacute;il tagline of an Ireland for all creating a more equal island.  We can all agree that this is very unequal treatment.</p> <p>   We have an apprentice system in the country where trainee carpenters, plumbers, electricians and other tradespeople are paid more incrementally as they progress through their training.  Can the Minister explain why he believes it is fair that trainee nurses are asked to work long hours in dangerous circumstances in the middle of the pandemic where health workers are the most likely profession to catch the virus for zero pay?  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, have said that due to the pressure on the system, student nurses are taking on an enormous burden and are really holding up our healthcare system at the moment.</p> <p>  How much would it cost to put in place a system for trainee nurses akin to that which exists for apprentices and what would that cost be as an overall fraction of the health budget?  I am not asking for a figure now but when replying to my letter, I ask that the Minister might include those figures in it?</p> <p>  Two weeks ago, we had representatives from the INMO before us and they said that they hoped they would hear from him by the end of the week.  It has been two weeks now.  Has anything happened and has he engaged with the INMO?  Where does that stand now?</p> <p>  Can the Minister explain why this Government is standing over a system of double standards, where apprentice tradespeople, which is a male-dominated sector, get paid for their work while trainee nurses, which is a female-dominated sector, are not paid at all?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#H00500"><p>I thank the Senator very much for her question.  I will start by recognising the work that student nurses are doing.  They are on educational placements as part of their degree programmes, are working damn hard and are doing it in a healthcare system where everyone is working damn hard.  The system is under enormous pressure.  In the first wave of the pandemic, when there was real fear and we shut down elective care, not only did the student nurses step up, as did everybody else such as all of our qualified nurses, they went in as healthcare assistance, HCAs, not on placement, and they just worked.  Their education was essentially put aside for a while.  That is a sacrifice that they made at a time they were needed and I want to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  The comparison with trades is not applicable.  There was no degree programme for nursing prior to 2004 and most of it was on-the-job training.   The nursing degree was set up in 2004 and there was a very conscious move to educational placements.  Some people referred to what happened earlier in the year but there was a significant wave of Covid-19 then with many people dying and we were in the middle of a crisis.  The student nurses worked as HCAs within the hospital system and, rightly, they were paid for that across the healthcare system.  We are not in the middle of a crisis now.  We have moved early to avoid a crisis in healthcare.  Elective care as well as all of our hospitals are still open.  As of this morning, there are fewer than 300 Covid-19 patients in our hospitals against the base of approximately 12,000 beds.  It is a fundamentally different situation.</p> <p>  This is an issue that the Chief Nursing Officer, CNO, and I discuss on a very regular and ongoing basis.  The strong view of myself, the Department&rsquo;s, and that of the CNO is that we must protect the education of nurses.  As the Senator will be aware, trainee nurses are paid in fourth year and there is a slight difference between psychiatric nurses and all other nursing grades, but it is in and around an annualised salary of &euro;22,000 for their placement.  The strong view which I support is that these are educational placements for first, second and third-year trainee nurses.  Of all of the clinical students right across the system, be they doctors, allied health professionals, and everybody else, only one group receives a stipend, which is a low and modest one.  This group is nurses and the stipend is &euro;50.79.  </p> <p>  I am very aware of the hardship being incurred at the moment.  For example, many student nurses work in nursing homes at the weekend to make money that they badly need, be it to pay the bills, rent or just to buy food.  That is not available to them at the moment and they are trying to do their education placements in a very different environment.  There is ongoing engagement with the INMO and the Department and we are seeking significant short-term changes to the educational placement stipend to recognise that the situation that they are working is very different from a non-Covid-19 world.</p></speech>

I apologise if they have been asked and I missed them.<br/><br/>I will step back from Covid and all the other issues in the health service at the moment and turn to the reform programme, and Sl&aacute;intecare in particular.  One of the key measures recommended in Sl&aacute;intecare was the need to restructure the HSE and to move away from having seven hospital groups, nine community healthcare organisations, various other mental health teams and so on, which has resulted in a completely disjointed and non-accountable organisation.  It is a big black hole.  All the money goes in and we do not know where it goes.  There is no legal responsibility for the provision of services or for budgets.<br/><br/>This was the issue that arose most often at meetings of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, raised both by all the members and by all the witnesses who appeared before it.  They said it was crazy and that there could not be integrated healthcare if different elements and sectors were all doing their own thing with no single budget.  The idea of the restructuring that was agreed to at the committee was that there would be a regional structure, a single budget and a single management structure within each region, which would mean there would be accountability for the provision of services and the spending of money.  That is essential.<br/><br/>This was also a significant element of the famous agreement with the IMO that we have all been talking about in recent days.  The IMO signed up to the idea, which was a huge step forward, while across the board, in the main it has been accepted as something we absolutely have to do.  This was announced at the end of last year or early this year and there was a commitment at a political level to getting it done.  The then Minister, Deputy Harris, was very strong on it, yet it now seems to have been parked and put on hold.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, if he is serious about reform, to put that back on the table and to begin the discussions and the planning and so on.  I appreciate that everything was difficult, and still is, but this needs to happen and there will not be reform unless it does.<br/><br/>In recent days, there has been much discussion of the article in <i>Village</i>magazine, and I will not get into that at this point.  There was another article in the same edition about a concerning interaction between public officials within the health service and the HSE, and the private sector.  That needs to be examined and to receive some response.  It relates particularly to a proposal mooted in recent years for a private hospital in the Airside area of Swords.  It was being promoted heavily with posters and so on by a Fine Gael candidate during the general election campaign earlier this year.  I am just raising alarm bells about that.  There were also various photographs with very senior people, including the then Taoiseach, at the launch of plans for the hospital, and that needs to be examined.  There are big question marks over this.  As long as this kind of stuff is going on in the background, with profit being a motive for many people and potentially within the public health service, we will never get serious reform.  That is the kind of area that definitely needs to be reformed.  It is why we as a country are an outlier in European terms.  We are the only country in Europe where half the population have to pay every time they want to access healthcare.  The Minister knows that access is the key and that money is a driving force for people.  That needs to be removed.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister to consider that.  I asked him some questions about it previously.  If what is in the article I mentioned is true, it is a matter of serious concern.  It will also work to stop any kind of serious reform taking place.</p></speech>

I hope she will have seen in the budget a serious commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare.  There are many different factors, one of which is capacity.  We just need more of everything and there is a big commitment in that regard.  The second is configuration, so there will be a large investment in community, home care and so forth.  The third goes to the heart of the Deputy's question and relates to organisation.  Critically for me, it is about joining up the budgets and centring everything around the patient, so that it is not a matter of community or acute, or of whether someone is in one CHO but a different hospital group or a different public health group.  Those groups have their own targets too.</p> <p>  A great deal of progress is being made across the board.  Specifically on the organisational aspect, it is a question of timing.  In a previous life, I was involved in some large reorganisations.  The international evidence shows that complex reorganisations fail most of the time and the majority of them destroy value, for a bunch of reasons.  They are really complicated and tend to be done in peacetime.  Something I observed in that previous life is that when someone says a large reorganisation will commence, everyone starts focusing on the reorganisation because they are thinking about their jobs and what will happen to them.  I do not know if I am correct, but my view is that while we need to do the planning for it, the middle of Covid is not the right time to press the trigger on it.  We need to keep the system focused on Covid and the resumption of services.  Laura McGahey and I have discussed it at some length, and as the Deputy will be aware, she is a very strong advocate for this.  If it is the right step to take and a call is made to pause formal reorganisation for now and to let everyone focus just on the healthcare system, can we in the meantime start rewiring budgetary lines and start doing the technical joining-up while telling everyone not to worry about what it might look like in a month's or a year's time?  We should tell them to do their jobs and to get great healthcare results for patients, but let us start doing some of the joining-up of budgets and so on in the background.  That is my thinking on the matter at the moment.</p></speech>

Hopefully, it will not be but it may well be.  We need to move on with the reform programme.  Everything we say we are aiming for, such as local services being accessible to people, accountability and value for money, cannot be achieved with the present structures.  They simply cannot be.  If the aim is to move activity out of hospitals into the community, that will not happen as long as there are two separate budgets.</p></speech>

The HSE is a command and control organisation.  I have stated in the context of Covid that there should be a separate agency for testing and tracing.  It is so centralised.  The idea of Mr. Paul Reid being called on to answer to problems in west County Kerry or north County Donegal just does not make any sense and leads to dysfunction.  There has to be devolved management to the regions where the many well-paid managers within the HSE will have a legal responsibility for the provision of services and to achieve those services at the best value for money.   That will not be done if the budgets and the management structure are separate.  We need to make progress on that.  I accept that many different things are going on but we cannot lose sight of that.  There is also the implementation office, which we should give the go-ahead.  We should get Mr. Reid to pull back on what he announced earlier in the year in regard to the delay.</p></speech>

I imagine it is a busy and difficult time, dealing with this awful pandemic.</p><p>I am also delighted to see the Ministers of State, Deputies Mary Butler and Frankie Feighan.  The issue I am going to bring up today will involve all three Departments, and that is the issue of mental health.  While I know it is not the Minister's specific remit, I would love to see the three Departments working together because there is no doubt the mental health issues associated with this pandemic are going to surpass anything we have previously experienced.  We are facing a mental health crisis, of that there is no doubt.  It is vital we get ready for the additional mental health issues that will arise from Covid and work on recommendations on how to prepare for a significant increase in mental health service demand.</p><p> Because of Covid, secondary care mental health services are facing a huge escalation in need.  I believe it is going to peak in a few months time and will last for many years, and now is the time to flatten that curve.  Unless we anticipate, plan and invest in all of our secondary care mental health services as a priority, they will be overwhelmed, with awful consequences for mental health and the economic recovery of our country.  It is paramount we start to strategise ways to implement greater Government action to respond to the impending mental health crisis and to strategise a recovery plan for mental health during and in the aftermath of Covid-19.  That is why it is very important that the Minister prioritises this, even though I know it is the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.</p><p> The three Departments need to work together on this.  We all know the evidence that mental health has a huge impact on physical health.  It can start off with mental health and then turn into a physical issue for people.  We need to look at an interventionist way of working together in this area.  I am delighted this committee will be </p><p>setting up a sub-committee on mental health and I would love to work with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and her Department on that, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly. </p><p> In order to adequately resource mental health services, it is essential that the Government monitors and reports the mental health impact of Covid-19 nationwide among particular groups of people, including people with pre-existing mental health difficulties.  What are the existing plans or are there existing plans to do this?  How does the the Minister propose that the capacity of counselling in primary care can be increased and made available to people in an affordable way during the Covid-19 crisis? </p><p> I want to stress the impact of Covid-19.  As a therapist, I am working on the front line with this.  The organisation I am heading is inundated with people coming to us at this point and we have had to take on more therapists on a one-to-one basis.  There is a crisis and it has to be made a priority.  I would love to see the three Departments working together.</p></speech>

The first point to make is that it is not three Departments, it is one Department.  It is the Department of Health and we have mental health, Healthy Ireland, disability, homelessness and addiction and many other areas.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Feighan, Rabbitte and Butler, and I work together and there is joined-up thinking.  For example, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and I, with the Taoiseach, last week launched a really cool Healthy Ireland initiative in regard to wellness, with Sl&aacute;intecare funding, but part of that was Your Mental Health, so the dots are being joined.  There is a brilliant initiative, of which I am sure the Senator is aware, in terms of protecting people in homelessness and addiction from Covid.  Again, people are being brought in and they then have medical and mental health supports wrapped around them.  I could not agree with the Senator more.  Where the joined-up thinking happens, the results for the citizen are great.  I will pass over to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.</p></speech>

I also want to thank her for all the work she does in regard to mental health.  I acknowledge how important it is to recognise that mental health matters and I acknowledge all the work Senator Black has done previously.  I look forward to being part of our liaison with the sub-committee on mental health and I will co-operate in any way I can.</p> <p>  I will first answer the Senator&rsquo;s second question in regard to capacity for counselling.  As she will know, because of Covid-19, the HSE and the Department of Health reached out very quickly to many of the different NGOs with help and support.  It is very good the relationship between the NGOs has been strengthened and put on a more secure basis over the past seven or eight months.  Some 85% to 90% of all mental health supports were retained during Covid, which is very positive. </p> <p>  Specifically in regard to the counselling, MyMind, a group the Senator is aware of, is currently providing 3,000 online counselling sessions per month in 15 different languages, which is very important in the modern Ireland we are living in.  The organisation has assured us it has capacity for 5,000 appointments per month.  It expected to reach 4,000 appointments by the end of October, which was the end of last week, with 5,000 appointments per month up to Christmas. </p> <p>  The Senator is correct that traffic to the HSE mental health website was up 490%, with more than 800,000 visits between March and July.  I understand the Senator&rsquo;s point that we are going to see a huge increase in mental health presentations in the next six months.</p> <p>  On the Senator&rsquo;s other question in regard to the mental health impact, I agree with her that data are very important.  Last week, for example, I visited the CAMHS unit in Galway, which currently has 650 children, youths and adolescents on its books.  The point made to me was that it had 18 referrals in the previous week alone, double the normal rate, and very few people are leaving the services at the moment, so this will add to waiting lists.  We will be working very hard to collate the data because it is hugely important. </p></speech>

To give one example, we had a client who came to us recently who was suicidal.  She was moved from Billy to Jack and from Jack to Billy, and she just could not find any services.  She was suicidal, she was on the verge, really and truly, and it was only that one of our counsellors worked with her through this that, as she says herself, it prevented her from actually doing the act.  There were no joined-up services available for her to really get the help she needed.  I need to say that today.  I would love to work with the Minister of State on that at some point, if that is okay.</p></speech>

What concerned me was that two thirds of those people who took their own lives were not availing of any mental health supports.  It is very important that we try to get the message out that the people who really need help can ask for help.  While I know the case raised by the Senator was different, it is very important that people know help is out there.</p></speech>

I wish to put several questions and I will put the first to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  In Clare and the wider mid-west, encompassing Limerick, we have Shannon Doc, an out-of-hours GP service operating out of five centres.  It is a vital service and all the more vital during the Covid pandemic, as the Minister will appreciate.  To use Shannon Doc's own language, it has moved to a &ldquo;consolidated model&rdquo; during Covid and there is a lot of very nice terminology, but what it really means is that, on the ground, there has effectively been a diminution of service.  People have to go further afield to get to a clinic or they have to phone up the triage nurse and wait a long time for a call back, not because of anyone&rsquo;s fault but because the service is overwhelmed with phone calls.  People are not as inclined to go to acute hospitals because there is fear, some of which is grounded and some of which is illogical.  However, while Shannon Doc has never been busier, there seems to have been a diminution of service.  I would like to know how the Department can support out-of-hours GP services over the coming months and in the longer term as this is crucial.</p> <p>  I am fortunate to live in south Clare where, if anything were to happen in my home, we are probably a 15-minute drive or less to University Hospital Limerick.  However, for people in the northern and western extremities of the county, it is a long drive and could be up to an hour and a half for them to get to accident and emergency or critical care.</p><p>They rely on having an out-of-hours GP service that they can contact at midnight or 1 a.m. to properly advise them on a health issue in their home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#L00200"><p>It is a really important question.  It cuts to the heart of the matter because it is not just about the out-of-hours service.  It is about general practice and making sure general practice is fully supported, funded, invested in and configured properly right across the country, including in the Shannon area and, obviously, in Clare.  There are a few things we are doing in terms of Covid.  I keep hearing from the HSE and the Department that GPs deserve huge credit for what has happened since Covid arrived here.  I hear from all over the country that time and again they have stepped up.  They reconfigured their practices, moved online and are doing all the Covid calls.  A strong view of the clinical community in Ireland is that they have really stepped up, interestingly to the point where some hospital consultants, with whom I have spoken, would have been slightly wary of the investment in and move to community-based care because they believed it would have the impact of a diminution of acute care.  As GPs have stepped up and taken on more of that, the hospital consultants are saying this is working out pretty well.  There are a few things we can do.  One is the ongoing funding for GP Covid calls and the subsequent visits and care, where necessary.  GPs have done a phenomenal job to that end.</p> <p>  Another big initiative is e-health.  It is one of the silver linings that has come out of Covid.  It was well flagged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and by numerous people but not much had happened.  Over a very short period there has been a massive increase in telemedicine, e-health and so on.  In accordance with public health guidelines, general practice has shifted substantially away from the in-person consultations to predominantly telephone consultations.  During the emergency patients have shown an overall reluctance to contact their GP about non-Covid issues, which is worrying.  It is understood to have changed gradually in more recent months, as people's concerns about Covid have abated somewhat.  The area of e-health has benefited from this and significant progress has been made under the objectives of the 2019 GP contract.  Much good work is taking place.</p></speech>

I want to fit in another question.  Some members of the volunteer support group, SOUND, for people who have developed narcolepsy and cataplexy, which they claim occurred as a result of being given the Pandemrix vaccine some years ago, are following these proceedings.  The Minister's Department is quite familiar with the issue, and his predecessors, including the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the former Minister, James Reilly, would have led investigations or inquiries into this vaccine.  The case went to the State Claims Agency.  The group has a number of asks which the Department of Health and Government might consider.  I will articulate some of those.  They want, in time. that there would be a full assessment of the needs of each sufferer looking at their educational needs - primary, secondary and third level; the lifelong living supports to provide for what each sufferer endures; and portable supports when sufferers are travelling or working abroad.  There is a range of items and I will ask the members of the group to communicate again directly with the Department.  To be honest, it is an issue about which I knew very little until I spoke to some people this week who explained how challenging and difficult it is to have a child or teenager suffering from both narcolepsy, where one falls a asleep all the time, and cataplexy, where one&rsquo;s muscles go in a total state of relaxation, almost a state of paralysis for a while.  They want some redress or future for their children and teenagers to which they can look forward.  It is probably a bit of a curveball for the Minister to answer that issue today.  I will ask the members of the group to communicate with the Minister but I ask that his Department might again engage with them as they have been in contact over the years.  They need to bring this issue forward once and for all.</p></speech>

If he would convey to the group that if they, either directly to me or through him, want to engage and would like an update on progress made, we will certainly facilitate that.</p></speech>

As a former school teacher up to February, I believe this suggestion would be really worthwhile.  We do not want to overburden teachers and they are burdened at the moment.  It is quite difficult for them.  It would be no harm between now and Christmas for each teacher in each classroom in the country to conduct a lesson geared around the mental health of children or teenagers in their classroom.  It would be worthwhile to collate that work.  Some schools already do this on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  Schools should not be compelled to do it but it should be encouraged.  I ask the Minister of State to engage with the Minister, Deputy Foley, on the carrying out of a little health check on the children and teenagers of our country to see how they are faring.  I am quite concerned for many of them.  Some children carry anxiety at the best of times and Covid certainly has augmented that for far too many of them.</p></speech>

I advise him that a promotional leaflet providing information on a number of trialled and youth mental health supports is currently being delivered to 4,000 schools across the country  to raise awareness of the services that are available.  I worked in collaboration with the Minister to get those out to the schools this week in paper form.  A quarter of a million leaflets were issued.  The leaflet is also available online.  I will take on board the Deputy's point because teachers in many cases are the first point of contact and they can see an awful lot of the warnings signs.</p></speech>

The three Departments are working very closely together to address the issues of mental health and well-being.  My Department received funding of &euro;20 million for the Healthy Ireland budget.  We are working with the Departments maintaining physical and mental well-being among everybody.  The three Ministers of State and the senior Minister are working together.  We had the first meeting in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to try to address the issues of people who are homeless and have addiction issues.  Much good work is being done through all the various Departments.  I thank Senator Black for raising the mental health issue.  It is a very important, especially during this pandemic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020110400002#L01200"><p>A number of issues are of major importance and full of challenges at this time.  There is the ongoing challenge of bringing back the standard of services to what they should be before Covid invaded people&rsquo;s environment and to be able to do so and develop and grow those services in line with requirements.  There are challenges between the elective services, the mental health services and the well-being of people who have been stressed by fears relating to Covid.  There is also the question of child mental health services which face serious problems and there are countless issues involved, of which the Minister will be well aware, which have been and will be raised again in the House.  There is a serious urgency about getting those services back to a level that is acceptable and on which people can depend.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response on that point.</p> <p>  An equally challenging question is how we will deal with the current lockdown or semi-lockdown with level 5 Covid restrictions and whether it can be used to build up the services or whether we have learned anything from the past in order to be able to contain the virus.  What happened is that people, in good faith, decided that it was beaten.  It is not beaten and it will not be beaten in the short or medium term but it can be contained.  To what degree does the Minister believe strict observance of social distancing, hand hygiene, mask wearing and so on can contain the onward march of Covid?  If people can practise that guidance on a voluntary basis, will it be possible to avoid having another extension of current level 5 restrictions?  We now must make decisions on whether these things can be achieved without the massive sacrifice of slowing the whole economy down.  To my mind, they can be achieved.  As I said previously, there is serious evidence to suggest quite a number of people felt they could disregard the restrictions but it is now essential we put in place whatever is required to deal with the situation that arises when we get to the end of the current restrictions.  Essentially, I have asked two questions.</p></speech>

I do have a concern about child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The waiting list is currently about 2,200 children.  As the Deputy will know, working with the Minister, I managed to secure an extra &euro;50 million in funding in the recent budget of which &euro;38 million are new moneys for new supports.  Of the money that has been secured for 2021, there will be 20 new wholetime-equivalent staff hired for CAMHS hubs and teams to try to reduce these waiting lists.  As I said earlier, I travelled to County Galway last week to see the fantastic set-up they have in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  They have community teams, an inpatient unit in Merlin Park University Hospital and they also have a day hospital.  They run it very well with very few on the waiting list.  I stayed there for half a day to try to get my head around how well the system is running.  The committee can be assured that it is a huge priority for me and the Minister.  We have discussed it at length.  I am hopeful that these 29 extra staff will have a huge impact on the waiting list.  As we all know, early intervention is key and all parents want is for their children to be assessed as soon as possible and to get the right wraparound supports they need.</p></speech>

It includes resumption of services and expansion of services according to Sl&aacute;intecare and universal healthcare, areas such as mental health, disability, CAMHS, Covid, etc., that need particular attention and are getting great leadership from the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler, Feighan and Rabbitte.  </p> <p>  I refer to the effectiveness of the basics.  I am not a public health doctor but what they are telling me is that the single most important aspect of this is the basics.  There are no amount of measures that any Government can bring in, and no amount of technology that can be deployed, that will ever work in the absence of people following the basics.  The Deputy is asking almost the other side of that question which is whether they are enough in and of themselves.  The CMO would be better placed to answer that question so I will give Deputy Durkan my observations.  I would say that the short answer right now is probably "No".  The reason I say that is that at level 2 a lot of people were following the basics and the virus grew.  We then moved to level 3.  It worked really well in Kildare, Laois and Offaly.  We moved to level 3 in Dublin.  It worked initially and then it flatlined and we got no further benefit out of it.  We moved to level 3 in the Border counties and then to level 4 there.  It worked very well and is working.  On the matter of what we shall call enhanced level 3, where there were no household visits, the very significant good news we are seeing now is largely down to enhanced level 3 and indeed level 4 in the Border counties.  The public health doctors say it takes a week to two weeks for measures to come through.  Consequently the current thinking is that levels 4 and 5 are needed to push the virus back down to very low levels.  That is the effort we are in at the moment and it would appear that level 3 holds the virus.  It held it at a higher level in Dublin but ultimately, it did not bring it down quickly which is why we still saw exponential growth even though the country was at level 3.</p></speech>

There were widespread abuses related to congregation that are well documented.  Whatever it did, it did not contain that.  There was not the feeling of responsibility as to what would happen due to people ignoring the regulations.  That is where the challenge arises.  I do not want to delay the meeting but my own belief is that there must be huge emphasis put on the voluntary recognition of the need to hold the line and to carry to its ultimate the restrictions that have been set out.  That, in lieu of a restriction, is a no-brainer.</p></speech>

What we want to try to find post level 5 is a situation where people are all following the basics, as the Deputy said, and then we want to find whatever the minimum additional restrictions required are to keep the virus down.  To the Deputy's point, there is very strong anecdotal evidence, with data now emerging to back it up, that a mixture of congregation and alcohol in various parts of the country, some of it post-sport celebrations, some of it house parties and different things is, sadly, is the opportunity the virus takes to spread.  A lot of the time there may have been people involved in that who followed advice to the letter for seven months and then one night said: "For the love of God, I just need to let loose once."  Unfortunately the virus exploits those very small transgressions.</p></speech>

The Minister's aunt would fill him in.  I was following proceedings online all the way up.</p> <p>  With reference to a question Deputy Hourigan asked, the Minister was providing a briefing note on the primary certificates.  That is important and the Minister might circulate that to us all.</p> <p>  I refer to an issue in the mid-west about the 60-bed modular accident and emergency unit.  In a response to me in the Seanad on the Minister's behalf, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, confirmed that the unit was going to be operational on 9 November which is next Monday.  Will the Minister confirm that that is still the case and that patients will be accepted in the new 60-bed modular unit from next Monday onward?</p> <p>  We had the track and trace people in here last week.  As of last Wednesday when they were before us, they confirmed to us that they were not asking the full suite of questions that they had been prior to the hiccup that happened three or four weeks ago.  The Minister might confirm if they are now asking the full suite of questions and if they are totally back on track with that.</p> <p>  I welcome what the Minister said today about the 140,000 capability and the 40% reduction in testing.  It is extremely welcome.</p> <p>  Section 39 companies that are funded by the HSE is an issue I raised when Sl&aacute;intecare representatives were in.  I am curious as to whether the Minister is doing a root and branch review of the funding of section 39 companies because from my observations there is huge inequity there.  Some such companies are funded up to 90% of their costs whereas others providing a similar level of service are only getting 70% of their costs funded.  That is a job of work that does need to be done because we are talking about billions of euro which the Minister negotiates for his Department which needs to be reviewed.</p></speech>

The HSE informs me it now has capability in place to contact trace up to 1,500 new cases per day within a 24-hour period.  On the basis that yesterday we had just north of 300 new cases - and hopefully the current measures will continue to have an effect - right now the HSE has the capacity it needs.  What I want to focus on though, is not just the volume and the speed but the depth of that contact tracing.  The HSE is focused on that as well.  The experts call it forward contact tracing and backward contact tracing and it involves getting to close contacts and close contacts of those close contacts.</p><p>The HSE now has very significant capacity in place and is still scaling up.  It has gone from 231 contact tracers in mid-September and is scaling up to 800.  New IT systems are being brought on board.  At the same time, the seconded staff, many of whom were allied health professionals, are being redeployed to their roles as well so,= a lot of good things are happening.  </p><p> In my view, the focus has got to be, as we come out of level 5, to have the most responsive comprehensive contact tracing system that can move really quickly but go in depth and, essentially, isolate the new cases as well as possible when they arise.</p></speech>

There are two areas in particular.  The south west is flatlining but obviously it should be falling given that we are at level 5 and, as the Deputy has said, the northside is actually on the increase.It was discussed earlier on.  The HSE will look at deploying more mobile testing units.  We need to go further because we need to really  understand what is driving this and why level 5 is not working.  If the Deputy has ideas I, genuinely, would be very happy to meet her or receive an email from her as to what we need to do.  The new restrictions should be working but they are not so we must move and quickly.</p></speech>

I also remind them of the importance of sanitising their desk area and seat when leaving the committee room.</p> <p>  We now turn to the main item on the agenda, which is the final report of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that was published recently and that has been circulated to members.  The special committee was established by order of the D&aacute;il on 6 May 2020 to consider and take evidence on the State's response to Covid-19.  I take this opportunity to put on record at this committee our gratitude to the members of the special committee and its Chair, Deputy Michael McNamara, for their diligent work throughout the summer months and for the production of this very important report, which will be so beneficial to us in our work programme going forward.</p> <p>  This report is in a form that enables each of the Oireachtas sectoral committees to continue consideration of the Covid-19 response.  As per the Government request, this report and its recommendations will form a priority item for the committee in our work programme for the remainder of 2020 and for 2021.  The special committee's recommendations and the issues it deems pertinent to this committee and the Departments of Social Protection and Community and Rural Development have also been circulated to members.  A briefing document from both Departments has been circulated.</p> <p>  I propose that at this meeting we consider those recommendations with a view to identifying the key areas we wish to scrutinise and examine over the coming months and to reporting back to the Minister with responsibility for both Departments when we have concluded our hearings.  With regard to future hearings, and bearing in mind we are currently still at the highest level of restrictions, level 5, I am requesting that we limit the number of witnesses invited to attend Leinster House and we should encourage submissions in a written form, which we can then consider when received.</p> <p>  Members of the committee and of the Houses have absolute privilege in respect of statements made in either House of the Oireachtas or before a committee.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now open the floor for contributions on the final report of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020110400002#B00300"><p>Five separate issues jump out at me from the contents of the report.  The first is the issue of post office payments.  As the Covid response has meant a move to fortnightly payments, this has had a big impact on the post offices, which we know are very often the linchpin of services in communities and rural places, in that it has significantly reduced the number of transactions happening in them.  It is also having an impact on people who are dependent on social protection payments in that they now have to budget on a fortnightly rather than a weekly basis.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has raised concerns that people in those income groups are finding it more difficult to budget on a fortnightly basis.  It is an issue the committee should examine.</p> <p>  Second, I welcome the fact there is an inflection on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, to include an earnings disregard.  This is particularly significant for people in the performing arts sector and supporting industries such as set design, lighting and costume design as well as for the small public service vehicle industry.  They will now be allowed to have some earnings and still be entitled to the PUP, which is welcome.  People in those industries believe it will be a long time before they are functioning and back on their feet, so this will allow some sort of pathway for people to continue.  Many people in the performing arts industry are dying to get back to practice so they can begin performing again, and this provides some sort of pathway for that.</p> <p>  I want to raise an issue that might be more properly considered by the transport committee, namely, the impact on rural communities, in particular, of the shutdown of private coach operators.  While other facets of the Covid response were quick and timely, there is no doubt there was a significant time lag in engaging with private coach operators.  Like most public representatives, I could point to several places in my constituency where people did not have access to a public transport option and, if they did not have their own car, might not have had other options available to them.  Perhaps this is something we need to look at going forward. </p> <p>  With regard to Gaeilge and the islands, I would be interested to know whether there are infection rate figures specific to the islands, given they are obviously a case where it would be possible to pursue a zero-Covid strategy.  We are aware the population demographics on the islands mean more people are susceptible to the worst effects of this virus but, on the other hand, we have to balance that against the reliance of the economy of the islands on tourism.  A balancing act will be involved, therefore, in deciding whether the islands can be reopened at level 2 or level 1, depending on their specific infection rates, and whether that is going to be practical in terms of the impact on the economy of the islands.</p> <p>  I have a minor point to make on language.  Not all of the Covid information was released in Irish and English at the same time.  While that is probably more for the coiste Gaeilge to discuss, particularly with the Acht teanga coming down the tracks, this is something the State needs to get better at.  It should be a matter of course that any State material that is published in English is also simultaneously published as Gaeilge.  Those are the five points that jumped out at me from the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020110400002#B00400"><p>With regard to the PUP, I welcome the earnings disregard announced in the budget of &euro;480.  It would be interesting to find out how the figure was arrived at.  I am aware this is going to cause difficulties for people in the arts sector who may get additional payments, and &euro;120 a week is not really a lot.  This is also going to also be an issue for taxi drivers.  According to the report, 23% of taxi drivers are aged 66 or over, so they could not access the payment and the only option available to them was to perhaps seek an increase in their State pension.  Given the level of disquiet among taxi drivers and their representatives, there are issues in this regard.  We need to keep a close eye on the payment, particularly given the cut that is due in January.  It would be interesting to find out how the figure of &euro;480 announced in the budget was arrived at.</p> <p>  There have been major difficulties for the self-employed when it comes to the PUP and this issue could be considered later.</p><p>There is also a current issue and I have been over and back with the Secretary General on this.  Approximately 4,000 applications for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, last week were refused because the Department did not have a PRSI record for the applicant.  I have been inundated with representations from people in that situation.  The Department did not have a PRSI record yet these people had sent in payslips. </p><p> One constituent sent in a letter from their employer.  This person was at work and got the PUP the last time.  I am waiting for full figures but I am aware that approximately 4,000 people were affected last week.  Whether it is a breakdown of communication between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners I do not know but it has been a messy situation.  One person who applied in early October has now qualified and received their payment.  They have, however, only received one weeks' worth of payment of &euro;200 whereas this person applied earlier in October.  We know from a recent reply I got to a parliamentary question that the system is not even ready for arrears.  It is not set up for it yet.  While the Department said it will be paid by the end of the year I know from speaking to others it will be next year.  To get an update on the arrears with regard to the PUP will be important as well, as people are owed quite a bit of money because of delays.</p><p> The islands and the water services are something we really need to look at.  I am aware restrictions were in place that came in May in Inis O&iacute;rr which turned off the water at 5 p.m. It was off until 10 a.m. the next morning.  The last boat came in at approximately 7 p.m. There was, therefore, a situation where people were consistently being told to wash their hands yet on Inis M&oacute;r, Inis Me&aacute;in and Inis O&iacute;rr there were water restrictions because of the constant drought every summer that is never dealt with.  People could not actually wash their hands.  We have a huge issue there and that needs to be looked at.</p><p> Finally, with regard to the islands and services, I am aware there is mention of services provided to the island communities during the pandemic.  I am not sure there were any.  What is of concern, however, when it comes to the services is GPs because, obviously, in a pandemic that is the most important service.  On Inis Me&aacute;in, one nurse and one GP come to the island three times per week in the morning for two and a half hours.  On Inis M&oacute;r, there is one GP.  The island has a nursing home and there was one false positive case.  I do not think there was any positive case at all but I believe with that nursing home there was real concern.  GP services on the island, therefore, are something we could also look at.</p></speech>

We have seen during the summer where the Government takes a decision in the evening and implements it that night by 12 o'clock.  The likes of that has serious consequences for hotels, restaurants, bars, the staff who work in those premises and for the whole area where one takes, for instance, a hotel or restaurant with foodstuff in store for particular functions that may be planned in advance of a decision taken by the Government to close everything down.  All that food is wasted.  It is vulnerable food.  The Government must be cognisant and take into account how these businesses will be affected if a decision is taken today that will be implemented tonight.  I do not see anything in the report with regard to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020110400002#C00300"><p>First, it was a mistake not to make the bi-weekly payment optional.  In most post offices it would not create an issue if people needed to get the payment bi-weekly.  It can happen and there can be all sorts of reasons.  It is much safer.  I am not very happy personally about giving the lump sum of the fuel allowance rather than paying it bi-weekly.  There are temptations in giving lump sums to a small minority but we know people are vulnerable; if they get the money in a lump they will spend it.  I am not sure it was necessary because let us be straight about it, more people are migrating to direct payments instead of bank accounts all the time.  The numbers going to the post office are reducing anyway.  Many people would have opted for the bi-weekly payment.  I am not sure, however, that was the best idea and it needs to be thought out carefully again.  The other thing we know is any change upsets people, particularly those who are more vulnerable.  Those people get upset by change and we must be sensitive to that.</p> <p>  Those of us who live in rural Ireland also realise again and again that the big demand is not post offices, it is broadband.  Let us call it the way it is.  It is 10:1 that broadband is the issue one receives the calls about.  I believe I received two calls about the post office.  I got endless demands for broadband.  Mobile and broadband are the two big issues.  There seems to be reluctance in some quarters here to recognise we are modern in the rural areas and that we use broadband.  People of 70 and 80 years, and every age, use Facebook and all the rest and watch it every day.  There is this kind of myth that it is only young people.  Facebook is, in fact, an older person's platform.  Broadband remains an issue.  I am aware of the work the Chairman has done on it and I compliment it but we need to hurry that up.  From the beginning I have said whatever resource it takes just get on with the broadband plan and see if we can cut that from seven years to five or less years.  I must also say I am worried and we have debated before that the most isolated areas, the areas in the hills where there are often no mobile signals, will be last on the list.  We must take that issue up as a committee.</p> <p>  I hear what is being said about the entertainment and events industries and that is a huge issue.  There was, however, an equally huge issue in the beginning that was not dealt with.  When the original pandemic payments came out they were based on what a person earned in January and February of this year.  The problem was that many of the rural and coastal economies, particularly in the tourist spots, operate from March or Easter until the end of September or October and, thankfully, in more recent years up to Hallowe'en and in some cases until Christmas.  The months one will find the people involved in the tourist industry on their holidays are January, February and March.  It was a pity the Department did not recognise this issue and say that a person could prove he or she works seasonally and earns all of his or her living in nine months of the year because there are no tours in January, February and March up until St. Patrick's Day.  I believe that was a major hit for these areas. There were certain sectors of society.  The arts is one big one and events is another.  Then we have all the other issues of people in transport.  Again, anybody involved in tourism transport will have had the slackest period in January and February and, again, they were caught.  Even to this day it is fair to say that people who have got "mobile" fixed assets are not being treated as well as those with "fixed" fixed assets and this has a big impact on the rural areas.  People who have buses or limousines or whatever servicing the rural areas and the tourism offering there had the double whammy of the seasonal issue in the beginning and now the fact that, in many cases, they do not have fixed premises and are working from home.  They are, however, valuable assets.</p> <p>  An issue I came across which I do not know if anyone else did is with regard to PRSI records.  Even with the new schemes, a person must have last year's self-assessment tax not only submitted but the credits credited to him or her.  In the beginning of October there was no obligation to have them in.  Some people had to scramble to get the tax return in so they could prove they were self-employed last year.  That can be a little bit of an issue.</p> <p>  I am glad people have mentioned the islands.  In the beginning, the islanders were the first to want to close down the islands ahead of the general population.</p><p>At all times, islanders could come and go and all services could come and go.  That was vital.  We could not make prisoners of the islanders on the islands.  The islands did not pursue a zero movement strategy.  It was not possible.  Workers were coming in to provide all of the services necessary on the island and people on the islands had to go to the mainland.  There was movement but certainly the islands remained fairly Covid free.</p><p> The issue of health on the islands has been mentioned.  One of the big risks, unfortunately, and perhaps it is an issue we should look at in a wider context, is that a lot of the staff of &Aacute;ras Ron&aacute;in on Inis M&oacute;r come from the mainland.  There was a false case, which turned out to be negative, on the island related to this, as far as I understand.  Thankfully, it was not a Covid case.  It involved somebody who had come to the island.  This is always a risk when going into a vulnerable situation such as a nursing home.  To my knowledge, there was no case in the nursing home.  It seems a strange change in society, when 40 or 50 years ago we could provide medics and nurses who lived in rural areas.  This is one of the big changes, as now we seem to be importing people all the time to provide basic services.  We should look at whether there is a way to encourage people to return to the islands, or live permanently on them, and provide these services.  It would create extra jobs.</p><p> When we introduced the ferry services I started them from the island to the mainland in the morning.  This meant the boat was on the island overnight and the staff were employed from the island.  There was no point in bringing staff over in the morning on an empty boat.  One of the reasons was that it was convenient for the islanders because I wanted to give them the first run on the boat.  Another reason very much on my mind was that it would create good permanent steady employment on the island by being island based and, therefore, create a bigger population with more families, which is absolutely vital.  We do not want the islands as museum pieces.  We want real working communities there.</p><p> Inis M&oacute;r has a very hard-working GP who has done tremendous work.  Inis O&iacute;rr has a GP who also works on Inis Me&aacute;in.  In the old days there was one GP between the three islands.  Inis M&oacute;r has a doctor but all of the other islands are dependent on resident nurses.  It is very important to keep these health services on the islands and, in particular, keep the resident nurses on the island.  The islands are relatively well served for emergencies, although I heard that some suspected cases were taken off the islands on the regular boats.  I have tabled a parliamentary question, to which I am awaiting a reply, on why suspected Covid cases were taken on the regular ferry services.  I got the usual response that the matter had been referred to the HSE.  I have asked what steps were taken to isolate those people on the boats.  The boats are fairly big and it is probably possible to do this but it is important to find out what precautions were taken.  I have heard concerns about it.</p><p> We need to look at the islands in their own right, inasmuch as there is some manufacturing on the islands.  Allowing manufacturing to continue seems to be a reasonable proposition given the islands were Covid free.  It is not like allowing it to continue where people are coming from throughout the country.  These are islanders working in a factory and producing goods.  The whole trick was to keep it off the islands as much as physically possible.  We need to have fine-tuned policies.</p><p> I compliment the Department with responsibility for the islands because it undertook to keep all of the ferry services going, effectively with empty boats, in other words, discouraging passengers from the get-go.  It was the same with the air service.  These were lifeline services.  Very few people were travelling compared to normal and it is important that we note all of the lifeline services were kept going.</p><p> The issue of water is very interesting.  It is the most basic service.  Most of the islands have good water services on them.  Inishbofin has its own lake.  Gabhla off Donegal is interesting because many years ago when we put in the electricity Donegal County Council suggested to me that it would run in the water pipe from the mainland at the same time.  It put in the water pipe and the electricity.  This is important because the islands with the perennial problems of water are Inis Me&aacute;in, Inis M&oacute;r and Inis O&iacute;rr.  No matter what has been done on the islands there is a problem getting enough water because they are limestone, particularly because of the large tourist industries there.  This year, they had to bring in water.  They have been at this for a long time.  They bring in water by boat every year.  It is enormously expensive.  This needs a permanent solution.</p><p> I have put forward a solution but the State needs to get involved, including the Department with responsibility for the islands, in the same way as the State was involved in providing the money for electricity on the islands.  It is brought in on a cable, apart from Tory Island.  There used to be generators.  My suggestion is quite simple.  There is an electric cable to  Inis Me&aacute;in, Inis M&oacute;r and Inis O&iacute;rr and all of the other islands.  I have suggested examining the feasibility of putting in a second electric cable.  If renewables are to be produced on the islands, we will need a lot more resilience in our electric cables to take out the electricity from the islands.  They are ideally placed in the teeth of the wind.  This would do three things at the same time and the Government would fund it through the Department coffers.  An extra electric cable would be run to export electricity and provide resilience in case one cable breaks.  If the cable breaks at present, that is it, and that has happened.  At the same time, a fibre-optic cable and a water pipe would be run to the three islands.  Unless the Government makes it a clear policy to do a feasibility study on this, and provide Exchequer funding to do it as a stand-alone project, it will not happen.  However, it is the answer to the problem.  The amount of water the islands need in the greater scheme is small but compared with the water resource on the islands, it is huge.  This would solve the problem once and for all.</p><p> No matter how expensive capital projects look in the short term, they last 50 or 100 years and they are very cheap in the long term.  We are telling people to wash their hands every minute but there is no water on an island, even in a quiet tourism season.  Something we should take out of this is that the State, in the form of the Department with responsibility for the islands, should look at commissioning a study to bring in all of these cables in one go as a package to be funded directly through the Department with responsibility for the islands, and then contract out the work to the ESB, telecoms companies and Irish Water to get the job done in unity.  A working group should also be established.  It was done in Donegal many years ago and it is a working model.</p><p> With regard to what Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh said, how that language was treated was an utter disgrace, nothing more and nothing less.  It was the usual thing.  The leaflet was sent around and it cost a huge amount of money to send a second leaflet.  The law states quite clearly it should all be done bilingually.  Signage could have been put up throughout the country.  Children are going to Gaelscoileanna throughout the country and we are spending a lot of money on the Irish language on the one hand but we are making a joke of it on the other hand.  How can we tell a child this is a real language when they only see it in school?  The minute the children walk out the door of the Gaelscoileanna the world they see outside is totally different.  I noticed the signs around the Houses are bilingual.  Once one sign is being translated, they should all be translated.  The old r&iacute;omhaire nowadays will keep producing them for us no bother.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020110400002#D00200"><p>I agree with what the Chairman said about the special committee and thanking its members for the terrific work they did.  They kept us informed when we were looking in with regard to what was actually going on.  The questions they asked were very important.</p><p> I will start with something close to the Chairman's heart, namely, broadband.  It is, for rural Ireland, the number one topic.  We can talk about post offices, which are so important as well - and we need to ensure we open and keep open as many of them as possible - but rural broadband is the number one issue.  Thankfully, so many firms are now allowing their employees to work from home but, unfortunately, they cannot anymore and they have to look at what broadband is available to them.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right that it comes down to phone services.  I know many people in Kildare, which is not a million miles away from the capital here, who cannot get phone coverage, which is totally unacceptable in this day and age.  It is a huge challenge for us all to ensure that we roll out broadband as quickly as possible, as the Chairman tried to do during his time as Minister.  We also need to consider something that was mentioned recently at one of our committee meetings, namely, rural hubs and hot desks, as they are referred to, in our rural towns.  We need to give people options such that they do not have to travel or commute but that they have a standard of living and a quality of life and that they can go to their nearest point.  This has shown up as an issue during this pandemic.</p><p> One of the big issues that has arisen is rural isolation.  We have had terrific support from local authorities and local community groups but they have been amazed, judging by the conversations I have had with them, going around the communities to see the extent of isolation in rural areas and people living by themselves who do not see another human being or neighbour for days or weeks.  We need to tackle this and ensure that it does not happen again.  Thankfully, such groups have been able to provide hot meals, etc., with the support of local authorities and the Government, but we need to look at this as a society.  Rural isolation cannot be left like it was before.  I have spoken to so many people involved in these groups who when they knocked on doors were amazed at the people they found behind those doors, who were living in isolation for days and weeks on end.  This is something the pandemic has shown up and something we cannot let happen again.</p><p> I agree with what other members said about the fortnightly payments.  Older people in particular find change hard to deal with.  Communication is key in this regard.  They had been used to getting their payments weekly.  They knew how much of their payments was going on solid fuel and whatever other charges they had each week.  To manage that fortnightly was very difficult for many people, so we need to look at that and to inform them very early in the day so they can change their habits.  As we all know, habits form part of every older person's life.  I heard weekly, even daily, "When will my next payment come through so I can manage my payments?"  As a committee, we need to look at payments, particularly for older people.</p><p> As for the PUP, one issue is those who were under 18 years of age and who were working.  A large cohort of 17-year-olds did not qualify for the PUP, as I understand it.  They were paying full tax and PRSI each week but did not qualify.  We need to look at that.  It was highlighted recently on a local radio programme to which I listened.  A 17-year-old who had been working for the past year and, as I said, paying tax, etc., did not qualify for the PUP.  That is not acceptable.  If one is paying full PRSI, one should qualify for the PUP.  Surely we should look at that.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh referred to private operators and transport, which is another major problem.  It took too long for us to get them back up and running.  When I talked to representatives of the NTA, I was told that a sum of money was promised but that the money was not getting back to the private operators or did not get back quickly enough.  We cannot allow this to continue because transport, particularly in rural areas and rural towns, is vital for people to connect with their work.</p><p> The PUP is still a massive issue for students.  They want to know where they stand on it.  As we are aware, most students, thankfully, are now back at college and so on, but many of them had the PUP and they all want to know what about repayments and such.  A huge issue for many people is the repayments and any tax liabilities that may be coming up in respect of the PUP.</p><p> Other members mentioned the arts and musicians and taxi drivers, who are all directly affected by what has gone on during the pandemic.  We really need consider in future the self-employed and how a pandemic has affected them to the degree it has done.  I agree with what other members have said in that regard.</p><p> Finally, I am actively involved with Text Alert locally.  This initiative has shown its worth and how it can work in ensuring, going back to rural isolation, that we do not leave behind those who need us most.  That is one thing this pandemic has shown.  There is a cohort of people who need protection, and I hope we can ensure that those people are protected in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1476" speakername="Paul Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2020110400002#E00200"><p>A couple of issues have been identified.  One is community supports.  I know Senator Wall is coming at this from a rural perspective, as are many other Members.  I am coming from an urban perspective.  Urban isolation is as serious as rural isolation.  One could be surrounded by 5,000 people but still be as lonely as the person who lives in the middle of the countryside.  That is a really important thing we have to get across.  I talked recently to the management in my local post office and they were chatting about the payments that started to be paid fortnightly.  They said some people then did not come for their payments while others collected them on their behalf.  The manager was really worried and concerned because that was their outlet.  They went to the shop and to the post office and engaged with people and that was the only connection they had.  Our local darts club organised meals on Sundays for vulnerable people.  The payments only land from Monday to Friday, so we took on the Sunday aspect.  I regularly did the Sunday afternoon run for perhaps eight or ten weeks for about ten or 12 vulnerable people on their own.  The first day it took me about an hour to do, the second or third week it took two hours, and then it took three hours because they had nobody to talk to.  We have to be really cognisant of that when we talk about isolation.  It does not matter where the person lives.  One can live in a massive estate and still be as isolated as a person in a rural area.</p> <p>  As for the community supports, when the chips are down we in Ireland always come together and support one another.  I saw the incredible generosity of people who volunteered to pick up stuff from the pharmacy, do the shopping, cut grass, clean windows - whatever it was people were asked to do, they did it.  We have to pull that together in some way.  The opportunity now, as we come out of level 5, will be how we capture that again and ensure that that sense of community is not lost.  I think that at times during the past ten or 15 years of the recession, the Celtic tiger and so on, people were just so stressed and so busy that in some ways that connection was lost.  I think we have an opportunity now as legislators to figure out how we do this, how we support the local authorities, the local community groups, the local community centres, the resource centres and all those people who are there to help and to give us guidance and how we ensure that connection stays.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a few other connected issues.  PUP payments for the under-18s were a missed opportunity.  We talk about young people going to work or to college or taking on apprenticeships.  There is a massive push in respect of apprenticeships.  There are people on apprenticeships who are 17 years of age and who got nothing, and that was a shame.  On the one hand, we are telling them that they are valued and that their skill set will be really valuable to our country in the next generation and, on the other, that they are not really that valued because they are not entitled to the PUP.  We really have to work on that.</p> <p>  The final issue I wish to raise relates to the arts and music.  We all like to go out and listen to music, go to concerts and plays and so on.  I see a real issue coming down the line for some of the artists and musicians I know.</p><p>The past seven or eight months have been horrendous for them because they have lost everything.  Their business fell off a cliff overnight and it does not look as though it will come back anytime soon.  Many of them say that they got the PUP payments but they also have van insurance, equipment and all the overheads that still continued on which they were trying to keep up the payments.  Now they are getting to the stage where they are looking for alternatives.  They are saying that they cannot continue like this with the uncertainty of not knowing when they will work in the music industry or the arts industry again and they are leaving.  I fear that they may not come back to that.  Something we must consider is the supports.  When the industry starts to reopen, we will need supports for them and they will need supports to ensure that they can get back into the industry.  Individuals operating on a smaller scale who have their own equipment may come out of it a little quicker but there are bigger businesses that have warehouses of equipment and which now face the prospect of being unable to afford their rates and the repayments on their loans to buy equipment, some of which needs to be changed on a regular basis.  It is something we need to consider in terms of the community.  I see all of this in terms of the community.  It is what we do; it is about the society that we build and what type of society we want to see coming out of this.</p></speech>

I refer to the abolition in 2014 of the mortgage interest supplement.  At present, if one is renting, one can get the rent supplement which basically pays one's rent if one loses one's income.  However, lots of people are paying mortgages.  Right up to 2014, for up to two years after losing one's employment the interest on the mortgage was paid.  That was a considerable safety net.  What we hope is that if this pandemic ends, most people will go back to work.  This will have been short lived.  If one goes into a bank to tell it that one can pay all the interest and only needs a capital freeze, the bank normally will give one that.  Anyway, one could make it a condition of getting a mortgage supplement that the bank would provide a freeze on the capital.  This has brought forward the absolute requirement and this committee should recommend that the mortgage supplement be reintroduced.</p><p>I do not believe all this.  Because of the structures we created with the Central Bank being more interested in fiduciary issues than it is in the good of the citizens, at times it is more worried about keeping the banks solvent.  I can understand that to a point, after 2010 and 2011.  That is all very fine but the individual citizens, who had no hand, act or part in bringing in the pandemic, have to be kept solvent too.  It seems we have tackling this at the wrong end, on our knees begging banks to give maithi&uacute;nas, breaks and all the rest, instead of doing the obvious thing.  Let us be straight about it.  If one had no other care in the world and did not have any overheads, the &euro;350 was a real big lift.  If one has a family and a mortgage, even if one is getting the child dependant allowance or whatever, those who cannot pay the mortgage and the interest on the mortgage are taking a mega-whammy.  This is one way of separating the people with high legitimate overheads, as we do with the rent, from those who do not have those overheads because they are living at home and targeting the money where it is needed to keep people in their <i>status quo</i>.  That is all we are trying to do in such a situation.  Even in ordinary unemployment, 60% or more of people who become unemployed are re-employed within the year.  In the vast majority of cases, if this was a short-term safety net and if people got back into employment, they would not have an overhang of debt from the unemployed period.  I am sorry for going on at length about it.  Even within my own party, I have tried to raise this issue repeatedly since 2014.  I cannot understand how we let that safety net disappear.</p></speech>

The person, who had been working without problem, obviously has had to stop working.  The person went to look for a mortgage supplement or something to help with the mortgage and there is nothing.  In those circumstances, with that safety net that we used to have which was called rent supplement-----</p></speech>

That is needed, particularly for somebody in such circumstances of life-changing diagnosis.

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is correct about mortgage supplement.  As practising politicians, all of us have dealt with and used that scheme successfully in the past where families have ended up in desperate situations.  In fact, an issue I raised only last night is the issue of the central banks and the burden of interest on families.  Even if there is a freeze put on the capital, having that burden of interest is a compounding problem that is left for people.  It is a way to overcome the particular problem where the regulatory arms of the State say that we cannot continue to have a freeze but most of the banks would be quite flexible if the issue of interest could be addressed.  It is something that we need to take up quickly and not only with the Minister for Social Protection.  This has implications in terms of housing and is probably a Department of Finance issue.  It is something we should probably act on quickly.  There is much good feedback from members here this morning.</p> <p>  In looking through the report, there are quite an array of issues in terms of the pandemic unemployment payment.  One of the recommendations that has been made by the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response is to also review the statutory instruments that have been issued by the relevant Department.  In terms of our committee, 18 statutory instruments related to Covid-19 have been issued over the past seven months.  We will have primary legislation being dealt with here on Committee Stage within the next few weeks.  In terms of the operation of the pandemic unemployment payment, there are changes coming.  A body of work also has been completed by the ESRI in that regard.  I firmly believe that the vast majority of people should have been left on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and a wage subsidy scheme rather than being transitioned onto the pandemic unemployment payment in the first place and it would be far more cost-effective for the State, even if it was paying 90% or 100% of that, than the pandemic unemployment payment.  For a cohort of people, I acknowledge the only solution is the pandemic unemployment payment.  If it is something we are to look at, we need to do it quickly because it is pointless to make recommendations after this legislation is enacted.  I suggest that we seek submissions on a tight timeline from both Members of the Oireachtas, who themselves know some of the existing anomalies, and from the public where they have come across anomalies.</p> <p>  Deputy Kerrane mentioned the issue of the over-66s.</p><p>Several members, including Senator Wall and Deputy Paul Donnelly, mentioned the under-18s and the anomalies regarding apprenticeships.  We could have feedback on these very quickly and put together a short, snappy set of recommendations that would feed into the work of the Minister before we deal with Committee Stage of the legislation.  This would be important because there are many complex issues.  Some of the changes proposed will benefit people while others will not.  Regarding the arts and entertainment sector, in particular, we should be considering this matter seriously because of the complexities that exist.  Deputy Paul Donnelly made the point that it is not just a question of income because it is also a matter of paying for equipment and bands and so forth.  There was a scheme that took those types of costs into account, namely, the farm assist scheme.  Is it possible to design a scheme for the entertainment sector, and maybe for the bus operators and taxi drivers, that is somewhat akin to the farm assist scheme, which allows for income and takes into account the costs but still provides a supplementary income so people have a basic income?  It is important that we get the entertainment industry up and running quickly.  Not only would it create employment, it would also have an impact on the tourism and hospitality sectors.  Probably more important, it would have an impact on the mental health of every citizen in the State.  If we could have socially distanced entertainment or any type of arts activity, even through a remote mechanism, it would have a major psychological impact.</p><p> I return to the issue of isolation.  It is not just a rural issue.  It is easy to see isolation in rural areas because people are physically isolated in addition to being socially isolated, but isolation is also an issue in urban areas.  I would like to see us move on this quickly and get feedback from our colleagues and the public, with a quick turnaround.  This would tie in with the review of the statutory instruments, which we are obliged to review based on the recommendation of the Covid-19 committee.</p><p> Senator Paddy Burke made an important point on communication.  One of the recommendations of the Covid-19 committee is that the communications strategies of the Departments that are accountable to us be reviewed.  Perhaps we should ask the two parent Departments for a report on communications in terms of the various avenues they used.  Having done so, we can make an assessment.  The ESRI's report shows that about 40% of the population who lost their jobs ended up worse off because of their being in the temporary wage subsidy scheme or on the pandemic unemployment payment.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is quite right that the main difficulty of many of those concerned was having to service a mortgage.  They could have managed if the mortgage issue did not exist.</p><p> An anomaly that colleagues came across in respect of the pandemic unemployment payment concerned the Department's enterprise support grant for the small businesses - the man or woman with the van.  There was a subsidy of up to &euro;1,000 for restart costs.  Some 5,600 businesses claimed this but the actual cost was &euro;5.8 million.  Therefore, a scheme with a cap of &euro;1,000 per applicant has actually paid out &euro;1,035 per applicant.  I cannot understand how that could have happened.  It needs to be clarified by the Department.  In the short term, that should be our immediate focus.</p><p> Broader issues arise regarding the islands, not just in regard to Covid-19.  There is a lot of merit in what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  It would be useful if we got feedback from the island communities on what worked and what did not, and the challenges that exist as a result of Covid-19.  This is an area we need to examine.  I recall being a member of the old Western Health Board and dealing with the issue of public health nurses on the various islands.  It was asked whether a premium should be provided to people to work in such locations.  This relates to a broader issue that many of us deal with, that is, the challenges in attracting doctors to rural communities.  If we accept the challenge on the islands, why can we not accept them in other rural communities?</p><p> Part 1 of the Covid committee's report refers to the care of the elderly, going into a lot of detail.  It states, "The Committee is of the strong view that future moves to support the older people at home must have, as a priority, a publicly funded and publicly provided model of care that is underpinned by community intervention teams from the HSE."  This feeds in very well with our own work programme, which identifies the issues of carers, a carer strategy and the type of long-term solution that is required.  It is also related to the issue of isolation.  One of the systemic issues highlighted in the report is "The failure to prioritise empowering older persons to remain at home and develop models including smaller domestic-style units integrated into towns and city community areas."  That could also apply to villages, where we should be making provision for older people living in isolated rural areas, perhaps in big houses, so they may have access to smaller units of accommodation close to services.  This would be far more fruitful for them.</p><p> Broadband was raised by several speakers.  It is an issue close to my heart.  Let us identify what this committee can do practically.  There is a lot that we could do.  I suggest to members that, as a starting point, we seek a submission from Telecommunications Industry Ireland, the telecommunications infrastructure federation of IBEC, and ask it to identify the key challenges for it in rolling out infrastructure and ramping it up, be it through mobile broadband, wireless broadband, fixed-line broadband or fibre services.  We should seek a report from the task force in the Department that examined this issue, and perhaps we could invite the relevant officials in to discuss it.</p><p> Senator Wall raised an important issue, that is, the fall-off in the quality of mobile voice services since the outbreak of Covid-19.  There was a clear fall-off.  Decisions were taken that led to a reduction in the quality of voice services.  We need to examine this because an increasing number of people rely on voice services, particularly beyond their domestic circumstances.  There are many practical steps we can take in the short term in addition to feeding into our overall work programme.  I suggest that we focus first on the social welfare payments and the pandemic unemployment payment, particularly when we are going to be dealing with legislation in this regard in the next couple of weeks.</p></speech>

If someone on jobseeker's allowance did a part-time course, he or she could retain it, but a full-time course would remove that eligibility.  People in receipt of the PUP and who are in certain industries and want to do something useful during the year should not be disqualified from the PUP if they do a one-year course.  I am not referring to people doing three- or four-year degrees.  Hopefully, things will be back to normal long before that but people who want to do a one-year course should be allowed to do so because there is no good to be gained from forcing them to sit at home when they could be doing a full-time course online.

The professional artists scheme allows professional artists to claim jobseeker's allowance for 12 months while setting up their businesses.  The numbers involved are small, with only 100 participants.  As such, its cost is small.  I hope that the Department is considering disregarding the past 12 months for people on that scheme and rolling that disregard over for them, given that they have not had an opportunity to gain an income in recent months.  Small changes can have a big impact and make a real difference for a small cohort of people.  I believe the committee's view is that it should be a short-term focus.</p> <p>  Another issue has been raised by a number of people and is one about which I am also concerned, namely, lump sum payments.  Many people do not have the skills to manage them.  Regarding fortnightly payments, we have thankfully returned to weekly payments in post offices and I do not believe the issue should arise again.  Practical measures can be put in place.  We should get feedback from the Department about its contingency in this regard.  It would also be worthwhile to get the input of the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post.  An Post is doing a great deal of work in financial services.  Perhaps we could also get the perspective of the Irish credit union movement.</p></speech>

This situation has posed difficulties.  I am on the board of a community drugs team and the issue of payments was raised by support workers, particularly in respect of those at the vulnerable end of addictions and who were getting fortnightly payments.  Unfortunately, that money was gone by the end of week 1.  There were major difficulties in week 2 and people had to wait for another payment.  We could spread our net.  There is considerable expertise among the cohort of people who support these vulnerable families and individuals and it could usefully feed into our work.</p></speech>

In terms of aviation, Ireland West Airport Knock plays a major role in people's weekly commute to the UK and Germany for work.  They travel out on a Monday morning and return on Friday.  All of those families live in the west.  That matter could fall under our remit, but it could also be covered by the transport committee.  The issue of testing and the revitalisation of the aviation sector could be debated.  Currently, it is like the main highway has been blocked off.  If the main thoroughfare from the south, east or west of Ireland to Dublin was cut off, there would be an outcry.  The situation at Ireland West Airport Knock is not dissimilar to that.  I am sure the same can be said for Shannon Airport and its region.  Our airports are vital to the survival of our regions.  Even though we will not debate the aviation element, we should ask the transport committee to examine the impact that the closing of these airports is having on rural Ireland, in particular the west.</p> <p>  The second element-----</p></speech>

Indeed, we can all be members of any committee.  As such, we can attend the transport committee's hearings on this matter.  Each committee has been directed to have a specific public meeting to go through the recommendations relating to its sector and to progress them.  My suggestion is for the Senator to contribute to that hearing and ensure that his points be reflected.  I fully agree with him, as I know quite a number of the members present at this meeting do, but it can only be adequately and appropriately addressed at the transport committee.</p></speech>

That responsibility would have been our predecessor committee's, but responsibility has been transferred to the T&aacute;naiste's Department.</p> <p>  Are we happy enough to proceed along these lines?  To address Deputy Paul Donnelly's points, because we are now in a level 5 lockdown, we should not restrict our request for submissions regarding any topic to any group.  While we will actively seek submissions on broadband and mobile phones from the Department's task force and Telecommunications Industry Ireland, we should also put a notice on our website and have a specific press release issued stating that we are seeking submissions from the public in respect of all of these issues.  Regarding fortnightly payments, we can seek specific submissions from groups but we should not exclude anyone.  There are many people, including retirees, who have time on their hands and may have constructive inputs to make.  They could be at the coalface.  As I stated at our initial meeting, we have a responsibility to get the views of people who are directly impacted by decisions and let them feed into them.</p><p>There may be members of the public who have very strong views on these fortnightly payments.  It would be useful to hear their perspective on this also.  We will actively seek submissions from various organisations.  All requests that we make for submissions should be published on the committee's webpage and a public notice should be issued to enable members of the public to make submissions on any such submissions, unless the committee decides otherwise with regard to some particular submission we are seeking in the future.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p> As there are no other matters arising, I thank members for their positive contributions.  The secretariat will take note of the useful suggestions made today and I will liaise directly with the clerk to the committee to ensure those suggestions are incorporated in our work programme going forward.</p><p> The select committee is scheduled to meet this day week, Wednesday, 11 November, to consider the Revised Estimate for the Department of Social Protection.  I understand it will be referred to us this afternoon.  I hope we will receive a briefing from the Department before the weekend so that members can consider it over the weekend.</p></speech>

As we have already had the budget with its social welfare changes, can we ask that the Minister give the committee a briefing on what will be in the social welfare Bill which will come before us?  To a certain extent, this is going to be an historical exercise.  We need to consider the Revised Estimate in the context of 2021, even though it is a 2020 Estimate.  The position is farcical.  It is bad enough when the Revised Estimates come to us in June but to come in November is unprecedented.  It would be useful if the Department did not confine its briefing to telling members what is in the 2020 Revised Estimate given that we have already had the budget.  Presumably, much of the discussion will be on 2021 and the forthcoming social welfare Bill.  We should specifically ask that the brief include this.</p></speech>

I must lay down the caveat that we will only have two hours to discuss the Revised Estimate.  I will not guillotine any debate on an Estimate as I do not believe we should do so.  This may mean that we may have to revisit the issue.  We must have a break of at least 24 hours between meetings to consider Estimates because of the Covid-19 restrictions.  I will be far more rigid in managing times than I was when we considered the community and rural affairs Estimate earlier.  I agree that we should certainly get a briefing from the Minister on her future plans for the legislation, as suggested by Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv.</p> <p>  As I said, the select committee is due to meet next Wednesday.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to come back to speak further about the impact of Covid-19 on Irish aviation.  I know the committee has dedicated a lot of its time and energy in the past month to raise and examine the key issues for aviation, with a focus on what needs to be done.  I am very glad to receive its further conclusions and recommendations from this work.</p> <p>  I have no doubt we all share a desire to reach a point where international air travel can resume and where the industry can begin to plan and build towards a stable and sustainable recovery.  We all agree that aviation is an important sector because of the significant number of jobs involved but it is also a critical enabler of the rest of the economy, and we will need it back to help us recover any lost ground from the past eight or nine months.</p> <p>  There is no question that the impact on the aviation industry, on the travel industry and on the domestic tourism industry in Ireland and across Europe and the world for that matter has been catastrophic and unprecedented.  I know the committee has heard from the airlines, the airports and those who contributed to the aviation task force, as well as the European Commission and many others.  I am sure this will have given the committee a good sense of the myriad problems and the scale of the challenges.</p> <p>  I have also engaged regularly with all of these key stakeholders since my appointment in the summer.  We all want the same thing.  We want to have fewer restrictions on international travel, safe travel, and notwithstanding the very serious upturn on Covid-19 cases across Europe in recent weeks, we need to be preparing the ground now for when that improves and for a time when it makes sense to have people moving around more freely again.</p> <p>  I am very concerned about the loss of strategic connectivity.  The suspension of services at Shannon and Cork during November is in direct response to a collapse in forward bookings on the routes concerned, primarily due to ongoing uncertainty concerning the spread of Covid-19 across Europe and the necessary restrictions being imposed in several jurisdictions.  In that respect it is understandable, even if very regrettable, that the airlines, operating on a commercial basis, have to judge how best to manage service provision and reduce costs.  The coronavirus has led to a sharp reduction in air travel, not just in Ireland but across Europe and globally.</p> <p>  Since I spoke with members in early October, the Government has agreed to develop a framework around the EU traffic light system, which was adopted at EU level on 13 October.  As a start, changes for green regions have already been made, which means that people arriving into Ireland from EU green regions do not have to restrict their movement for 14 days.  All other passengers must continue to restrict their movements for 14 days unless they are exempted essential workers.  The Government will also align with the updated list of exempted categories of traveller with essential function or need within the EU recommendation.</p> <p>  The Government has also agreed that from midnight on 8 November, the requirement for those arriving from orange locations to restrict their movements can be waived if they have a negative Covid-19 PCR test result up to three days before arrival.  The current requirement to restrict movement for 14 days following arrival from a red region remains but the Government agrees that, as soon as practicable, this can be waived following a negative result from an approved PCR Covid-19 test taken five days after arrival, with travellers restricting movements until then.  Children under 6 are to be exempt from testing requirements.   All arrivals must abide by provisions of the living with Covid plan, currently at level 5.</p> <p>  A senior cross-departmental technical working group will report to the Government on 10 November with a plan to establish approved Covid-19 tests for international arrivals, taking into consideration testing options, standards, and operational implementation.  Any such tests should not interfere with HSE testing capacity.</p> <p>  The Government has already made a significant level of Exchequer support available for the aviation sector.  Many companies continue to benefit from the economy-wide support measures that the Government put in place right from the very beginning of the pandemic.  Airlines and airports are availing of wage subsidies, waivers of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.</p> <p>  In budget 2021, the Government made provision for &euro;10 million for Cork and Shannon airports while confirming a commitment of &euro;21 million to the continuation of the regional airports programme to support Knock, Kerry and Donegal airports.  In the context of the forthcoming national economic plan, the Government will consider further measures to support the industry to ensure that the core capability of the industry is preserved so that it can recover quickly to support the wider economic recovery when circumstances allow.</p> <p>  I know there is frustration at industry level felt by workers and management and a perception among the airlines and airports that more needs to be done to help them. I agree that more can be done and more is being done.  I am happy to engage on that with this committee and see if we can find common ground on a way forward.</p></speech>

I am sure he has followed them and is quite aware of the challenges for the aviation sector.</p> <p>  The Minister outlined testing criteria.  When will that testing be introduced?  He mentioned the requirements on travellers coming from red countries so will he reiterate them?  What testing capacity exists for people to avail of this?  I know there is private testing capacity but it is not all PCR.  Some of it is loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, molecular testing.  Where can people avail of those approved PCR tests?</p></speech>

This area will continue to change and evolve as the virus is continuing to evolve, along with the impact and responses to it with respect to testing and regulations.  We will have to continue to be flexible and look at how arrangements change while following best international practice as best we can.  It is about listening to the health advice.  Health and safety comes first but we must retain our connectivity as an island and we must ensure the economic strength coming from connectivity is retained.  How we match the two needs of protecting lives and livelihoods continues to evolve.</p> <p>  I watched with interest the contributions of Dr. Tony Holohan, Dr. Cillian de Gascun and the principal officer from the Department of Health in yesterday's committee deliberations.  I agree with much of the information they shared with the committee, and they have already shared that with the Government on an ongoing basis.  The Government has made a decision that follows the earlier decision to put no restrictions on passengers coming from green list countries and from this Sunday night, 8 November, we will have a provision whereby a person coming from an amber list country - there are two or three regions in the EU - will have other requirements relating to the person getting a test of his or her own volition in the region.</p> <p>  As Dr. Holohan stated yesterday, there is a range of new testing technologies being developed, including antigen and LAMP testing, but the World Health Organization advice for the moment on international air travel is to use PCR testing as the most appropriate.  Other countries have done this but methods continue to change.</p><p>As I stated, Germany employed a similar method until recently.  A test prior to departure was acceptable to exempt travellers from the need to restrict their movements.  The further application of such a testing regime in this country requires first that we can be certain that there is testing capacity such that the regime would not infringe on the ability of the HSE to use PCR testing in its management of the disease.  I am confident that will be done quite quickly.  The Dublin Airport Authority in particular has done a significant amount of work in that regard.  It indicated to me that it has approached up to 20 providers that may be able to deliver those services.  I expect the private sector to provide that service.  It may be provided by a variety of sources, including, potentially, in airports.  If such tests are available from the private market, it may be beneficial to have them carried out at locations other than airports in order that people do not have to make an extra journey.  All of this is being done in an effort to make travel safer and improve public health outcomes.  People are currently coming into the country without any such testing being in place.  If it enhances our public health screening effectively, that will be one of the benefits.  If it leads to a reduction in or waiving of the restrictions that come with such travel, that may see a return to travel for essential work in a way that benefits the economy as well as protecting public health.</p></speech>

When did the Government make that decision?  On the red countries, the Minister is basically stating that the requirement on travellers to restrict their movements for 14 days could be waived if they isolate for five days on arrival and then have a negative result.  He stated that the cross-departmental group will report by 10 November with a plan in respect of testing.  In that context, and following on from the comments of Dr. Holohan to the committee yesterday, does the Minister expect people to be able to fly home to Ireland at Christmas?</p></speech>

It is far too early to be making statements in that regard.  We are into the second week of level 5 restrictions.  As Dr. Holohan stated, we are moving in quite a hopeful direction in terms of the level of incidence, but we will have to wait and see how that progresses.  We must also wait and see what happens in other jurisdictions.  A similar reduction in numbers has not occurred in the main destinations from which, historically, passengers travel to Ireland, such as the US, the UK and countries in mainland Europe.  I agree with Dr. Holohan that it is a matter for further review later on this month.  Any attempt to second guess that in advance would not be appropriate.</p></speech>

He stated that the current requirement to restrict movement for 14 days following arrival from a red region remains, but the Government agrees that as soon as practicable, that can be waived following a negative result from an approved Covid-19 test taken five days after arrival.  He further stated that the cross-departmental technical group has to come back with a plan to implement a testing system by 10 November.  When does the Minister anticipate that the testing system will be in place for red countries?</p></speech>

The system we will operate will be very similar to what the German and UK Governments are seeking to introduce.  The health authorities indicated to me that if we are to introduce a testing system, such an approach would involve passengers being tested five days after arrival.  My understanding of the health advice is that passengers would restrict their movements for those five days.  The chance of persons being asymptomatic in the early stages would be reduced by the five-day delay.  Although testing at that point does not provide 100% certainty, as Dr. Holohan stated yesterday, it offers a significantly improved------</p></speech>

If there is a Covid testing system in place for passengers coming from orange or red countries, is the Minister stating that it will be voluntary for a person coming in from an orange country to provide a negative test from three days prior to departure?

How will it reduce the risk relating to people coming into Ireland?</p></speech>

When I last appeared before the committee, approximately 15,000 people a day were coming into or leaving the country.  The most recent figures show that this number has halved, approximately, as a result of the level 5 restrictions and what is happening internationally.  There are a significant number of essential workers who must travel.  The majority of them are coming in by aeroplane but significant numbers are still coming in by ferry.  There is a significant number of essential workers.  I refer to the trucks that must enter or leave the country to deliver goods, as well as other essential workers who are travelling and will continue to travel.  We wish to continue that connectivity.  We cannot cut ourselves off as an island.  We expect and ask passengers currently coming in to restrict their movements for two weeks.  The new scheme, which is similar to other schemes and based on the European Union practice, will mean that people who must undertake essential travel will have the option of not having to restrict their movements for two weeks.  They would have to pay for the test.  The State will not cover the cost of the test.  In doing that-----</p></speech>

The Chairman should remember that, as Dr. Holohan and the civil servants from the Department of Health stated yesterday, our system is based on public support for compliance.  A friend of mine told me about the travel restrictions in China, New Zealand and other countries that have a forced quarantine system whereby one is put in a hotel on arrival and is obliged to remain there for two weeks and get tested on a regular basis.  We do not have that system in place.  It would be very difficult to implement such a system on this island because, obviously, there is the Border with Northern Ireland and we will not restrict movement through that sort of border control.  Our system is based on compliance.  We are seeking to increase the level of screening.  Effectively, there is no such screening in place for travellers.  We are seeking to make travel safer and to give people structures within which they can check whether they can avail of those tests which would give them some reassurance and improve the public health outcome.</p></speech>

The best-case predictions for a recovery in air passenger activity seem to suggest that it will take until 2023 or 2024 to get back to 2019 levels.  If that is borne out, I would have very serious concerns regarding the future viability of airports such as Shannon.  The Minister indicated that the Government can and will do more.  I ask him to expand on that and give some understanding of the kind of intervention measures that would give confidence not just to the airport management and the people who work there, but also to the wider region that depends so much on connectivity into the west and mid-west of Ireland for the survival of businesses, particularly those in the tourism and hospitality sector.</p></speech>

None of us knows how this virus will progress or the effect it will have on the wider economy and on international travel.  I do, however, know for certain that Shannon Airport is of critical importance for the people working in the industry.  Moreover, surrounding industries, nearby industrial estates, the wider Limerick region and, indeed, the region as a whole depend on and benefit from international connectivity.  The tourism industry is exactly the kind of employer we want.  The industry is rich in jobs right across the country and particularly in rural Ireland.  From the experience of my own working life, I know that Shannon Airport is very important for the tourism industry in the west, south west and mid-west.  That is why it is critical that we retain our capability and connectivity as a country with regard to international connections.</p> <p>  We introduced further interim measures in the budget.  Shannon Airport was in receipt of funding earlier in the year and has been in receipt of ongoing funding through the employment wage subsidy scheme and other supports but we provided additional capital funding in the budget and signalled that, in all likelihood, we would have to provide additional supports.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, said that the Covid fund which was, in a sense, held back in the budget to allow for the provision of any additional supports that may be required as a result of the pandemic-----</p></speech>

Has consideration been given to funding airlines to service key routes to important destinations which might otherwise not be profitable to recognise their importance to the region, although demand is low?  I refer particularly to direct access to London Heathrow and the east coast of the United States, principally New York and Boston.  The Minister will know that there is a considerable amount of foreign investment from American companies in the mid-west.  It is really important that their executives have access to the area.</p></speech>

As I have said, this whole area keeps changing.  The application of such an approach will depend, to a certain extent, on European rules on state aid.  We are looking at that.  We are also looking at whether operating expenditure arrangements in airports could be supported and whether further capital supports could be provided.  We are also looking at whether, in supporting airports, they could in turn support and help the airlines that use them.  The Government has not made a final decision in that regard.  We are looking at all options.  I will not rule out any.  We will work with the airlines and airports to achieve the best balance we can.</p> <p>  In my discussions with the airlines, what they have sought more than anything else is a public understanding that they have good safety protocols in place, which they do.  We also have the sort of mechanisms I have discussed here, so provision will still be made for essential workers and people who have to travel in a safe way and while minimising risk.  That is the best way to retain services.  At the moment, in the midst of level 5 restrictions and at the height of the second wave in Europe, the numbers are right down, as I have said.  I very much take on board what Dr. Holohan and others said yesterday, which is that we will have to be careful as we come out of level 5 restrictions if contagion levels are still high in other countries.  We also have to start planning for the short to medium term, in which there will a return to some sort of normality and flying will be allowed because we need that connectivity.  In my discussions with the airlines, more than anything else, this is what they see as critical for the retention of services and the planning of future services.  That is why it is important to get the other elements right.</p></speech>

I assume this will be put into some straightforward communication setting in order that it can be widely distributed to all relevant stakeholders.  We have all seen the difficulty.  It looks like the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, are putting together a testing framework.  Have we had a discussion with those bodies on our proposals?  Will they be in keeping with such a framework?  We are looking at this with a view to the private sector delivering.  It is a matter of people coming here, so I assume it is their responsibility on some level.  I imagine we have spoken to airlines about delivering this.  Have we looked at anything as regards what we would operate for people leaving here, while accepting that we are in a bad situation and that non-essential travel does not make great sense at this point?</p></speech>

Aer Lingus is, for example, part of IAG and has, as I understand it, has been doing a lot of work with its partners on transatlantic routes with regard to passport and other arrangements.  It has also looking at the different testing arrangements that might be put in place.  The Dublin Airport Authority has been doing significant work here in supporting the introduction of passenger forms and call centres and in negotiating with potential providers of polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing capability.  It has been proactive in that regard.  That makes sense because, if we are to introduce testing facilities at airports - which remains an "if" because there are other locations where it could be carried out given the structures being put in place - they will use the airports' facilities rather than those of the airlines.  We listen to what the ECDC and the World Health Organization are saying.  One of the reasons we went with the common European approach, which is common in the sense that it describes and sets out protocols for the green, amber and red classifications, is that it is left to national jurisdictions to decide what testing system to use.</p></speech>

I would like to think our proposals are in keeping with that.  Are we introducing anything else as part of the suite of measures?  We have already said that there are difficulties with the passenger locator forms at times.  The compliance rate among people coming into the country was, at one point, 18%.  When we are in a different place, we will need a better tracing operation.</p></speech>

It includes a mechanism to remind those coming from green countries of the basic health protocols here and to allow for people to be texted or otherwise contacted to see whether people are at the location they have said they would be.  It is not part of the Department of Foreign Affairs contact tracing arrangement, which is similar to the HSE system.</p></speech>

The economic plan that will be published in the coming weeks presents an opportunity to underpin those strategic routes, particularly the Heathrow, Boston and New York services.  Those three services are operated by Aer Lingus and the Minister must step in and underpin them because we must have that global connectivity which is vital for Shannon airport and for business and tourism in the region.  The Minister must make provision in the economic plan to provide that vital support.  A new chairperson of the board must be appointed and there must be a change in aviation policy such that there is a recognition of Shannon Airport as a driver of economic activity in the region.  I ask the Minister to respond to those specific points.</p></speech>

I have some figures here to demonstrate what I meant earlier when I spoke about additional support.  Up to 30 September, the value of the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, or the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the deferred VAT payments and commercial rates waiver to Shannon Airport was &euro;4.9 million.  Earlier in June, &euro;6.1 million was provided as an emergency grant measure to the airport to complete essential safety and security projects.  A number of Deputies on this committee were instrumental in getting the Government to support Shannon Heritage to keep Bunratty Castle and Folk Park and King John's Castle open.

I understand that the process is well advanced and I presume nominees will be presented to Government soon and I will make a decision very quickly.  Whoever takes over as chairman is facing a real challenge, particularly if Senator Dooley is correct and the virus continues to have an impact for the next two to three years.  That will create a very difficult environment but the airport is strategically vital for the region and the Government understands that.  We will have to consider how we manage aviation policy.  I do not think anybody has a rule book at the moment or a clear vision because we do not know what the virus is going to do.

The first issue I wish to discuss is Cork Airport.  Obviously Covid-19 has had a very negative impact on the whole Cork region, with very few passengers coming in through the airport.  In that context, there is an opportunity cost for the Department in not investing in capital infrastructure in Cork Airport, particularly in the runway which needs investment.  The current runway is in need of replacement.  The airport is worth over &euro;1 billion to the Munster economy and is essential for thousands of jobs in the region.  As we are going through this pandemic and airline traffic levels are so low, we have a chance to make a once in a generation investment in repairing and upgrading the runway.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.584" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110400002#D01200"><p>Colleagues have made similar points.  The last time there was investment in the runway in Cork was thirty-odd years ago.  Obviously we must continue to invest in infrastructure to make sure that it is up to date and safe.  To go back to what I said earlier, it is my expectation that we will decide on these matters relatively quickly.  That sort of project is one which would fit into an NDP review.  It would not provide immediate support in the context of the crisis in aviation but is more of a long-term, strategic issue for the airport.  That sort of project would fit into an NDP review rather than the more immediate issue of providing support for the airport.  I met representatives of some of the trade unions at Cork Airport on Friday last and they made the very clear case that Cork Airport is in real difficulty.  Traffic is down by 76% compared with the same period last year and passenger numbers are down from approximately 2.6 million in 2019 to an anticipated 600,000 this year.  My understanding is that only KLM and Aer Lingus are currently flying in and out of the airport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.585" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110400002#D01300"><p>Yes.  I apologise for interrupting but my time is limited.  Everything the Minister has said is correct.  It is quite clear that we have a chance to secure the future of the airport, increase its worth to the local economy and replace the jobs that have been lost.  The Minister must take rapid action in that regard.</p> <p>  My final point is that we need to see more being done at a European level with regard to investigating the use of antigen testing.  The Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Holohan, and Dr. Cillian De Gascun appeared before an Oireachtas committee yesterday and said that the research into antigen testing was not conclusive enough to allow organisations like NPHET or the WHO to support or endorse its use in airports.  I ask the Minister to raise this at the next meeting of EU transport ministers.  I am not sure when the next meeting is scheduled but I am aware that there was an informal meeting in October.  We need to see a multilateral approach to this issue because Ireland cannot do this on its own.  Everyone at this meeting agrees that we need to investigate this but unless there is a multilateral, Europe-wide approach to antigen testing, it will not be possible to implement it.  As far as I am aware, there has been very little discussion of this issue among European transport ministers.  Given the importance of the aviation sector to our economy, I urge the Minister to seize the opportunity to raise this matter with his European counterparts.</p></speech>

It is important that our health officials are fully confident that the use of antigen testing does not pose a risk to public health.  The advice for the moment is that it is not safe but that advice is subject to change.  Indeed, we should be flexible and open to change when evidence allows.  As I understand it, antigen testing was introduced in Italy for internal flights and the current advice from international health organisations and from NPHET is that it is not appropriate for international air travel.  However, we may see it used for screening at-risk groups in nursing homes, meat factories and so on.  If at any stage it is deemed appropriate for international air travel screening, I would love to see it introduced but we cannot do that against health advice.</p></speech>

I understand that Marseille airport is considering introducing it and it could be introduced in Charles de Gaulle Airport for non-internal flights as well.  Some countries' airports might move ahead of everywhere else and things might get a little confused.  I am taking the positives from the Minister's statement today in that we appear to be moving towards some form of testing regime, with all the caveats we have discussed.  That is a positive message that should emerge from this committee and from what the Minister said.  It would provide some light at the end of the tunnel for getting the aviation industry back on its feet.</p> <p>  However, I wish to speak on the DAA, and it is not to be parochial about it.  Dalton Philips appeared before the committee and he said he had an off-the-shelf system that the DAA had worked out that was almost ready to go.  Has the Minister discussed this with the DAA?  I am not referring to the testing and which test is used, but the practical parts of introducing this at the airport.  Planning permission will have to be sought and staff would have to be either hired or redeployed.  Has the Minister discussed this with Dalton Philips in terms of allowing the DAA to begin preliminary work on that, given that the Minister said that we cannot waste this level 5 period and must make use of the time as best we can?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110400002#E00400"><p>I have had discussions with Mr. Philips.  The DAA has done a very good job by being proactive here.  On the issue of whether the airport might need planning permission if we were to introduce testing facilities there, to be honest it only came to my desk in the past week.  I understand that we have to consider with Fingal County Council whether the council needs to make an adjustment or whether we require an emergency measure in planning regulations.  If we do, we will do it.  The Government is looking at every option and will assist the DAA in whatever way it needs assistance, but it must be a system that is also approved by the health authorities.</p> <p>  The worst thing that could happen for the aviation sector is if people have a sense that international air travel is not safe or that we are taking risks.  Whatever we do should be done in tandem with good health advice and the ECDC system.  The reason we are trying to introduce the type of system on red is that it is in line with what the UK, Germany and other large European countries are doing.  That mechanism allows us to see what their experience is, to look at what best practice is and what other countries are doing.  We will be very supportive of the DAA in implementing similar measures here as soon as it is clear that they are safe and that they are not going to be something that three or four weeks later we will think we have lost some public confidence because of them.</p></speech>

It jarred with what we discussed here with the airlines that day, so it is good to see the Minister move this forward in what he said.  That is where we want it to go.  That is where the aviation industry wants to go.  The airlines bemoaned a lack of communication from the Minister and his Department on that.  Hopefully, from what the Minister said last week and what he is saying today, the communication with the airlines, the DAA, Shannon Group, Cork Airport and all the other airports can increase and some positive momentum can build.  On the public health issue, there will always be a risk that some person with Covid-19 could come into the country by some means, through whatever testing regime or no testing regime and through a port or an airport, and spread the virus.  All we can do is reduce the risk.  That is what the committee has been saying.  We want to support any measures that will reduce the risk to as low as possible.  I believe I can speak for other members of the committee in saying that a testing regime is vital for that.  I thank the Minister for his work on this.</p></speech>

The Minister acknowledged the necessity for connectivity for Ireland.  He also acknowledged the decimation of the aviation industry.  We have heard from a number of witnesses across the aviation sector of the difficulties and problems, the loss of activity, loss of jobs, fears for the future and the frustration that it has taken so long to get something moving in terms of rapid testing.  I have always been of the view that we will not get the aviation sector up and running again unless we create confidence with the public.  That confidence will come from a rapid testing regime, where people feel safe and feel that they have a testing system that is effective, reliable, swift and in which they get early results.</p> <p>  We were a little slow to sign up to the European Union green directive.  The Minister in his statement outlined advances that have been made.  Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer put a damper on that and said we were working on the framework.  I got the distinct impression that he was going to determine what the framework would be and the steps that would have to be taken.  From the Minister's perspective as Minister for Transport and from the perspective of the Government, what are the procedural steps?  What is the liaison?  Who makes the decision on this?  The airport authorities and the airlines have told us what they need.  We have a fair idea of what is required to get the airports active again.  However, in terms of the decision making process, is this a case of the Minister having to await the advice of the Chief Medical Officer?  What are the steps to be taken before we get to a stage where we have a confirmed framework?</p></speech>

We will have a framework for the amber system by Sunday evening, 8 November.  Within a short number of weeks after that, I expect we will have a framework for the red list countries.  There was a Government decision to take this approach.  We listen to the advice of the health authorities, obviously.  I was listening to Dr. Holohan yesterday.  He was very clear when he was asked by the Chairman and others to say whether he would stop or restrict.  He clearly and correctly made the point that NPHET's job is to advise and it is the Government's job to decide what regulations or systems are put in place.  We are working with the health authorities because they are operating the regulatory system, the contact and capacity forms and so forth.  They are a critical part of this system.  We must put public health first, but the Government must balance how it can protect public health and at the same time maintain connectivity.  That is why the Government must decide in the end.  It is a balancing question sometimes, and that is the Government's job and role.</p></speech>

It was devastating for everyone in the mid-west and the west to hear just a week ago that Aer Lingus and Ryanair were scaling back and pulling some of their winter flights from Shannon and in the case of Aer Lingus, not resuming flights there until the summer schedule begins at the start of April, which is of serious concern.  They would claim it is a commercial decision.  If people are not booking and not flying, they see no point in putting aeroplanes in the sky.  They would also attribute much of it to procrastination in fully implementing the traffic light system.</p> <p>  I have heard what the Minister already told the committee.  Given that Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports have clearly indicated they have the capacity and just need ministerial approval to set up their testing at airports, why have we had the procrastination?  Why was it suggested last week that this might not be in place until Christmas?</p></speech>

The European decision was only made on 13 October and the following week we went to Cabinet with a decision and set the deadline of 8 November because we recognised it would take time to change the passenger form and ensure the other arrangements were in place.  It will take slightly longer to make arrangements for the red list which is there.  We are looking to ensure there is some testing capability here that does not interfere with the HSE.  In truth, that exists already.  If someone in this room was looking to travel to another country and wanted to get a PCR test in advance of flying, they can do it at the moment.  It is quite expensive.  It depends on location and the timelines.  I do not expect the immediate numbers to be very large because the numbers of passengers at the moment are low.</p></speech>

It is in dire straits and is losing a hell of a lot of money every week.  There is a gross imbalance in aviation with 155,000 passengers passing through Dublin Airport in the second quarter of this year and fewer than 100 passengers coming through Shannon at the same time.  That imbalance needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  The aviation task force also recommended the State should provide airports with what is referred to as a common fixed sum per passenger.  This is particularly needed in Shannon and Cork airports so that they are financially viable and can compete in attracting airlines.  I ask the Minister to comment on some of those points.  There is a significant imbalance in Ireland.  If this were a boat it would be capsizing right now, but it is not, and we have a chance to put the policy right.  How will the Minister implement some of those recommendations?</p></speech>

The fixed-sum-per-passenger mechanism might apply.  We might have a waiver on landing charges or some other mechanism.  It could be done through an operational expenditure support directly to the airport or further capital support.  It is something on which the Government has not yet made a decision, but we will very shortly.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that airlines make commercial decisions because the bookings are not there.  The decision not to fly is made on an individual basis with hundreds of thousands of individuals deciding they should not fly at this moment in time.  I do not believe it is coming from a Government restriction or from any Government messaging.  It is coming from the wider environment that the public are aware of.</p></speech>

I am conscious the Minister mentioned PCR testing.  Some people will be leaving countries where the testing will not be PCR testing.  Does it need to be PCR testing?  The Minister said we already have the additional capacity.  A company in my constituency is looking to take on 200 extra staff as reported in the media this week.  Why do we not move immediately with both the orange and red list criteria?  Will the regimes be in place before Christmas?</p></speech>

There is no international regulation stating what is certified and what exactly a PCR test is - although there is clear differentiation between antigen, LAMP and PCR tests.  Because it is changing and because the virus has come at a certain pace and so on, it is not an area in which there is absolute off-the-shelf regulatory systems.  The Department of Health and the HSE have a clear role first and foremost.  We need to ensure that in the provision of any testing here it does not infringe on their testing regime.  I believe that can be done.  They have oversight.  They need to be confident and clear that it is appropriate testing which does not interfere with their system.  They have the key role in that.</p></speech>

That is similar to what my colleague was asking about what exactly an acceptable PCR test is.  We also need to be absolutely clear about the specifics of the three-days-beforehand timeline.  There should be no room for manoeuvre to ensure everybody is doing the right thing.  I would like to see movement as quickly as possible on our red list framework.</p></speech>

One of the benefits of my being here today is to set that out.  There is considerable confusion and uncertainty on this.  We did not want to add to that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who has responsibility for the aviation sector spoke in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad - I cannot remember.  As soon as the Government made a decision, we went out with the broad proposal.  It is only now that the finer details are in place.</p></speech>

Dr. Holohan told the committee yesterday that we will be implementing restrictions and lifting them for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccination is found.  That vaccination might not necessarily be implemented successfully with the vast majority of the population here until the end of 2021, which is of concern.</p> <p>  I reiterate how critical it is for European transport ministers to actively discuss investing in research for antigen testing and for that subsequently to be brought to the Heads of Government and State.  We need more research and investment in antigen testing.  It is the only solution for airports.</p></speech>

The best scientific advice suggests it takes ten days or two weeks before we start to see the impact of a particular measure.  While we need to keep adjusting to this, that gives me some hope - if no more than hope - that as a country we have shown ourselves capable of stopping this virus in its tracks and that we were able to do that under level 3 restrictions.  Based on what we are learning in this process and what the Irish people have shown themselves good at doing, there is no reason we should not look further in level 2 and other restrictions even in advance of a vaccine to give us the capability to control this virus.  We cannot in my mind yo-yo in and out of very difficult restrictions all the time.</p></speech>

When before Christmas does the Minister expect to have a proper outline framework on both orange and red whereby the public will see the guidelines and the rules by which they must abide if they are advised to quarantine?

This is one of the main reasons I took responsibility for transport communications and postal services as part of my ministerial portfolio.  Providing strong and sustainable networks is key to both long-term economic and social well-being in the current environment and post Covid-19.  Our response to the Covid pandemic has shown the importance of networks in allowing society and the economy to continue to function.  Our broadband and mobile phone networks facilitated an overnight transition to remote working for many people.  The postal and parcels networks have experienced an exponential increase in traffic in response to online ordering.  The post office network has facilitated outreach to the isolated and vulnerable and provided a valuable community service.</p> <p>  Programme A covers the communications function.  Overall, &euro;157.8 million was allocated to this programme in 2020, consisting of &euro;14.4 million for current expenditure, and &euro;143.4 million for capital.  This includes &euro;27.3 million capital carried over from 2019.  The focus of the programme is to support economic growth, jobs, competitiveness and social inclusion through a range of policies and regulation designed to facilitate a more digitally connected economy and society.  It provides for investment in the national broadband plan, promotion of the use of digital technologies by citizens and businesses and support for digital entrepreneurship.</p> <p>  The biggest item of investment within this programme is the national broadband scheme at &euro;104.6 million, including capital carryover of &euro;27.3 million.</p><p>The Covid-19 crisis has made definitive the essential importance of high-speed broadband.  High-speed broadband has the capability to transform completely how people live and work as well as where they live and work.  It will have a significant impact on the design and provision of future services, from transport to location of housing and the nature of office work.  The national broadband plan contract is the largest infrastructural project in rural Ireland since rural electrification, spanning 96% of Ireland's land mass.  It will deliver fast, reliable broadband to people living and working in nearly 540,000 premises in the intervention area.  It will involve the laying of 140,000 km of fibre cable, utilising over 1.5 million poles and over 15,000 km of underground duct networks.  The network will offer a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset.  The current deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first two years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high-speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p> With the advent of Covid-19, many small and micro-businesses have found themselves with the challenge of having to shut their physical presence and adapt their business model, with many trading online for the first time.  As part of the Government's Covid-19 business supports package for small businesses, the terms of the trading online voucher scheme have been amended and its budget significantly increased from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;32.6 million.</p><p> The 2020 Estimates include &euro;1.5 million for Eircode.  Eircode postcode usage continues to grow and the postcodes are widely used among the public, businesses and the public sector.  In March of this year, the daily look-up limit on the free Eircode postcode finder website was increased from 15 to 50 in response to the Covid crisis for members of the public and businesses locating addresses.  As a result, and since then, over 15 million look-ups have been made by members of the public and businesses locating addresses, an average increase of 41% on the same period last year.</p><p> The 2020 Estimates for the communications programme support growth and innovation in digital entrepreneurship through the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre.  The Estimates also include &euro;1.7 million operational funding for the National Cyber Security Centre, which plays a key role in securing Government and critical national infrastructure and will continue to be strengthened.</p><p> I am more than happy to answer any questions about the 2020 Estimate of expenditure and investment for the services provided by my Department on this programme.</p></speech>

What works have been done recently to establish, by dealing with National Broadband Ireland, whether there is any chance of accelerating the process by which we might get proper infrastructure out to areas in rural Ireland?  In fairness, some of these areas are not that remote.  I am talking about parts of County Louth which are literally a couple of miles outside of Dundalk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.646" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2020110400002#B00400"><p>I was very pleased to launch the first of the 300 broadband connection points which are the first phase of the scheme's delivery.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that the launch was not as far away as County Louth but was up in the Glenasmole valley, County Dublin, which is as isolated as one finds.  There is a local community centre there where the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I were pleased to introduce these connection points.  We are very keen to see an acceleration, wherever possible, of the national broadband scheme but it cannot compromise the delivery of quality or value for money.  I think this is possible, primarily because one of the risks or uncertainties in the roll-out of the national broadband plan is the potential uptake.  Covid and the acceleration of the digital revolution, with remote working and the use of Zoom and other technologies, give the national broadband company every incentive to try to accelerate its works.  Covid did cause delays and create some difficulties.  There were difficulties in one of the key contractors coming in from the UK, with the restrictions in place on travel, but that has by and large been caught up with.  A lot of the work done to date has been rather detailed survey work, such as assessing which exact poles might be used, whether Eir poles, ESB poles or other systems, to get the fibre out to houses.  We will start before the end of this year with fibre passing not just the broadband connection points, which are focused at community centres and other hubs, but also in Carrigaline, as I understand it, and Cavan.  First will be the passing of houses and then it is hoped we will see what the level of uptake there is.  It is up to the householder to avail of the services.  There will be difficulties without doubt.  One cannot engage in projects of this scale and complexity without difficulties.  We are, as I said, literally covering the entire country and having to map out and plot out the exact route to get this fibre or a fast wireless connection into each house.  It is to be hoped this can be accelerated.</p></speech>

Taking into account Covid, what has been his interaction with National Broadband Ireland on these two areas?<br/><br/>There was a report in the <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>at the weekend that there are two state aid complaints lodged against the national broadband plan with the European Commission.  What impact does the Minister think that will have?  Is he aware of these complaints and their financial impact on the national broadband plan?  What has been his interaction with the European Commission on these two complaints?</p></speech>

I have to be careful as a Minister of a national government not to pre-empt the outcome in that regard.  However, having seen this project go through so much detailed planning and preparation work over the years, I am very confident it meets state aid requirements.  There was in my mind a clear market gap and a real difficulty in that certain areas of the country were not getting effective, fast, fibre-speed broadband.  The market was never really going to deliver it.  The need for it is also clear.  It is central to social as well as economic development.  People are entitled to take whatever cases they want to the European Commission, but I do not see that stopping us in any way progressing this.  We have the necessary approvals and consensus Government decision-making, so I do not see that any such case will decelerate or divert us, unless, as I said, down the line the European Union makes a decision or ruling in that regard.  I do not expect one, however, and it is to be hoped this will not affect the roll-out of the plan.</p> <p>  The impact of Covid on the national broadband plan really brings home the absolute urgency of us having universal high-speed broadband coverage.  There is huge potential in this country for us to change our whole working patterns.</p><p>I hope we will not stay at level 5 restrictions.  There will be a return to work and I think it is important that we try to accelerate that as quickly as we can.  There are real benefits to be gained from people being in offices working with colleagues.</p></speech>

It is likely that there will be further delay for those very distant locations where it takes extra work.  It is the Government's desire to try to accelerate it as fast as we can, while not putting additional financial burden on the State or taking risks around-----</p></speech>

One of the real advantages of what is happening is that we have the potential within four or five years of having the vast majority of houses connected in that way to a significantly improved service.  It is not just the national broadband plan, while it is an important part of the mix, but there are other significant private sector investments by Eir, for example, which is rolling out its network to provide similar speed connectivity, the Liberty Global investment in our cable network, the investment by the likes of SIRO in conjunction with Vodafone, and the investment of other companies.  What we want is a competitive market where there is a variety of companies and operators competing to deliver the fastest possible service at the lowest price.  Where there is not a market case for it, that is where the national broadband plan steps in.  In my recent meetings with various industrial companies and people considering investing in the country-----</p></speech>

I said the same, but I recognise that we should not give any false hope on it.  We have not really started laying out the fibre to houses.  As that starts to happen, we will have to see if the timelines are working and if we can accelerate them.</p></speech>

The Minister is correct to say the need for high-quality Internet has never been greater with many people now working from home, and third-level students having to study from home as well.  As I see it, there are a number of problems.  First, there is a problem with physically running cables underground or carrying them overground as the case may be.  Another problem that has come to light in my constituency in Clare concerns Eircode postcodes.  All broadband installers are required to have an Eircode in order to make a transaction on the phone, to book a person in for a connection and to get them live and online.</p><p>I will refer to the experience of a constituent whose case has been replicated throughout the country.  A person contacted An Post in August, two months before moving into a brand new home, to get an Eircode generated in the quickest possible time as the couple would both be working from home and they wanted live broadband in their house.  They were told by An Post that their details had been captured and that they would be fed into a process but, crucially, they were told that Eircode postcodes are only generated every three or four months so they would be waiting for the next intake of postcodes.  They phoned every broadband provider possible because there is broadband in front of their property, but one cannot get it unless one has an Eircode.  They have since contacted An Post just to see where everything is at and they were told the Eircode data are not shared between Eircode to An Post until about two days before they are generated.  So the person who initially tried to get an Eircode in August, hoping to have broadband in the property in September or October may now have to wait until either late November or possibly even up until February if there was a delay in the details being captured.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</p><p>The second issue I wish to raise concerns the go-to website, <i>fibrerollout.ie</i>, which we all check to find out where broadband is available in an area and when it is coming to specific localities.  It lacks full clarity.  When people search for Eircode postcodes it does not tell us enough.  We need to know more about broadband roll-out at county level.  I would like the Minister to respond to those two queries.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties in the past is that people were saying Eircode postcodes would not be used.  It is frustrating to hear that postcodes are not being provided where people do want to use them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2020110400002#C01200"><p>If we could move beyond the quarterly generation of postcodes to an automatic system of generation, that would be more efficient.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2020110400002#C01300"><p>I will certainly follow that up because given the digital systems we are engaged with here, I would be interested to see whether An Post can assist, in particular given that it is connected to the ability to get other services.  I was just looking at some of the figures and it is interesting to see that it is working in the sense that Am&aacute;rach carried out research about three years ago which showed that 84% of respondents were able to supply a validated Eircode for their address.  The increasing usage of Eircode postcodes is very pronounced in recent years.</p></speech>

People want to know when it is coming to their village or when it is going beyond the crossroads up to their road.  That is the level of detail we would love to see.  We know it is happening but we only know it is happening when we pass an installation crew going down a road in trucks.  There is no sharing of information.  It is big blocks of colour on a map.  I think we need to provide more detail to us as politicians who often field these queries but more importantly for the general public.</p></speech>

We must be careful as there was an issue around privacy when Eircode postcodes were first considered in terms of being able to get right down to an individual area.  The Data Protection Commissioner set certain restrictions in terms of what granular level of data would be available on properties.  Having said that, <i>fibrerollout.ie</i>is an Eir website.  What the Department is responsible for is the national broadband plan, NBP, website, <i>nbi.ie</i>, where details of the NBP roll-out are shared and where people can register for details.  Is the Deputy's constituent in a national broadband area?</p></speech>

That is replicated right through County Clare.  It is coming, but when is it coming?  If there were approximate timeframes that would help to a great extent.  People are planning futures around this and how they work from home.  A lot of people are potentially facing perhaps another 12 or 18 months of working from home but they do not know if it is sustainable.</p></speech>

It has been delayed somewhat by Covid in terms of the inability to get workers and have working around the country.  I am going on memory but I think one of the next counties to be served is Limerick.  I cannot remember the status of the roll-out in Clare but I will try to get the Department to provide Deputy Crowe with a background assessment, to the best of our ability, of the timeline and the projected approach for counties.</p></speech>

Given that postcodes come under his remit, would the Minister undertake to look at the provision of new Eircode addresses to link in with applications for broadband?</p></speech>

I just got some figures which show that the percentage of requests for an Eircode for existing addresses is answered within five days.</p><p>I am told that for 2020 the output target is 99% and that we are on target in that regard.  The percentage of new addresses allocated an Eircode within five weeks is also 99% and, again, we are on target.  The quarterly experience referenced by Deputy Cathal Crowe is unusual.  It is the one in 100 unfortunate example.  In 99% of cases an Eircode is provided within five weeks.</p></speech>

They are checking in daily if an Eircode has been generated but it has not.

The Irish Postmasters Union and the Grant Thornton report state there is a requirement for a public service obligation, PSO, of around &euro;17 million.  Combined with that is post office access to government and financial services, which fits with the banks ending their front-facing services.  We all know of the difficulties in rural Ireland.  We need to keep as much capacity as possible.  The post office is a major part of that.  What are the Government's plans to ensure we have a viable service that is fit for purpose?</p></speech>

It is an essential part of an modern economy and it has a key role.  There will be an ongoing decrease in the broader sense in An Post in letter-type post, but we expect the parcel business to increase significantly.  This will strengthen the network and post offices as part of that network will be important.  What we have seen with An Post is the broadening of the business beyond that and a recognition that in financial services and the provision of government services there is a way to replace some of the lost revenues, including in areas such as social welfare provision and other areas as they decline.  The town centres first project is examining how we can use post offices in this way as a local hub for public services.  Deputy Michael Moynihan's proposed development in north-west Cork of a community enterprise hub around a post office network is a case in point.  We need that scale of ambition in regard to post offices.</p></speech>

Over the years, he has come to the Oireachtas a number of times to present and outline the challenges faced by the post office sector, particularly rural post offices facing closure.  He and others have come forward with a range of solutions up to and including adopting a model akin to the Kiwi post banking system that operates in New Zealand.  An independent report has been produced by Grant Thornton and motions were passed in the previous D&aacute;il in regard to supporting post offices.  I would like to hear from the Minister if there are plans to implement any of those proposals and how he proposes to save rural post offices from closure.  As he will appreciate, beyond the pub, shop, school and post office, there is little else going on in most rural villages.  The post office is a key service.  A recent Red C poll backs up the position that people want and demand a rural post office network.  I would welcome a response from the Minister in regard to how he proposes to take on and support some of the initiatives brought forward by Tom O'Callaghan and others who have been campaigning to save post offices.</p></speech>

That was interesting work because An Post was similarly looking at the possibility of expanding its branch of banking services and it is now doing that work.  It has done that work over the years in conjunction with companies such as AIB and others, for which they provide a front-of-house service.  It is a valid service.  It has been particularly important as some of the commercial banks have withdrawn some of their branch networks.  It is important that we still have the capability to get counter services.  An Post does a lot of good work in that regard.  Banking and financial services is changing.  We are seeing more mobile banking applications coming on stream and this is likely to continue.  I am not sure if anybody here has a Revolut card or knows somebody who has one.  It is one of a range of new services that has come on stream.  I expect and believe that An Post and, in particular, the post office network can continue to have a significant role through their expansion to new services in the financial services area, including the provision of credit cards.  Recently, An Post introduced a new product for people looking to retrofit their homes, in respect of which it is working on conjunction with Scottish and Southern Energy, SSE, an energy expert company.</p><p>SSE, through another company it is working with, is providing finance for this together with packaging and marketing it.  It is those sorts of financial services products that An Post should, and will, go into.  It will be difficult.  When I was in this role previously, An Post went into the banking area and then had to withdraw during the financial crisis.  There are risks involved in entering that market.  It is necessary to be good at lending and to build up lending skills and expertise, and that is not easy to do.  It is critical how that will be done, and we should proceed slowly to ensure we do not have a repeat of what happened in 2010.</p><p> I point out to Mr. O'Callaghan and others that one of the real advantages the An Post network has is that it is trusted.  Post offices are often run by families who have been there for generations.  They are seen as centres of the community and people have a real respect for them.  In the area of financial services, that is, and always will be, an important consideration.  That is one of the ways in which the network could be a centre for financial services.</p></speech>

Turning to broadband and the ongoing roll-out of the national broadband contract, I welcome the progress made to date.  There is an information deficit, however.  It would be useful if people yearning for broadband had information on what is happening.  That is particularly the case now when so many people are working from home.  Those people need to know when they will be enabled.  It would be useful if the Minister could inform the counties in the intervention areas about when they will be enabled with broadband and break down that information into detail about different counties.  That would allow those counties to plan in advance.</p> <p>  I receive many representations every day from people in different parts of County Clare asking when they will receive broadband.  I would like to hear the Minister's response on that question.  We need to look ahead and plan.  The contract has been awarded and the roll-out is under way, but people need to know when they will get broadband in their areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-04a.702" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2020110400002#E00400"><p>I agree with the Deputy that this is a critical issue, and that is why the State is investing in this area.  I will give a broad outline of what this year's priorities were because these Estimates concern those processes.  The contract was signed just less than a year ago.  It involves 140,000 km of fibre cable.  The primary work done to date has involved surveying.  That has involved going to several hundred thousand houses and mapping out how it will be possible to get broadband to them.  That process takes a good deal of time.</p><p>In the meantime, as was also agreed in the contract, work has also been ongoing regarding the broadband connection points.  There are approximately 300 of them and they are often in a community centre, a school, a post office or other similar location.  Those are now starting to be delivered and are broadly on time.  The first houses will begin to be connected in counties Cork and Cavan at the end of this year and the roll-out will continue in Limerick next year.</p><p>NBI and the local authorities are going to send out details to residents.  They can only do so, however, 18 months in advance.  For people to find out where they will be in 18 months, it is necessary for them to register on for updates, as I mentioned.  That is the way in which people can find out the information.  I do not have the indicative roll-out plan with me.  I told Deputy Crowe earlier that I would try to get the Department to provide details for County Clare.</p></speech>

It is very welcome, but there is a lack of information.  That information exists and the contract has been broken down into different sections across the country, as I understand it.  County Clare is in that plan.  The plan is there, and we need to outline the details and tell people when they will be getting broadband.  There are some outrageous cases.  In one case in Ogonneloe, County Clare where all the houses, except three in the middle, have broadband.  The neighbours of those people on the left and right have broadband.  That is just one example.  We need to know the details and these people need to know when there will be broadband.</p></speech>

The information I have regarding County Clare is that the surveys I mentioned earlier are under way in Cratloe, Ballycannon, Ballyglass, Cloghera, and Kilcasheen is due to start by the end of the year.  Turning to the broadband connection points, those are located in Caherconnell, Cree community centre, Loop Head and the Michael Cusack Visitor Centre.  Kilmurry McMahon, Shragh, Ennistymon and Stonehall national schools are all to be connected with high-speed broadband as part of the initiative.  I will forward on whatever details I can share to the Deputy.</p></speech>

We need to get that information to the public because they need to know where they stand.

I refer to that information being made readily available where people can look it up and know for certain that they are going to get broadband.</p></speech>

I agree that we should provide whatever information we can.  We must be conscious, however, to not to give false promises.  We have not yet started rolling out broadband to houses.  We must see how delivery is working and get a better idea of the timing in respect of this project.  I understand that negotiations are still ongoing, for example, regarding the use of ESB or Eir poles in certain locations.  Much of the work done to date is surveying, and that was done with a view to establishing how it will be best to manage the rest of the project.  One of the reasons, therefore, that the information is not yet available is because those decisions have not been made.  Significant survey work was required to map out each individual connectivity situation.</p></speech>

The second phase is critically important for the University of Limerick, UL, Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, and the city of Limerick in respect of the movement of traffic.  It is important for the region, in fact.  A strategic development zone is planned for the UL campus.  Companies in the foreign direct investment, FDI, sector have been screaming at me, as have members of IBEC, with all of them seeking freer movement of traffic throughout Limerick city.
