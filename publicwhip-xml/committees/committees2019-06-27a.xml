He is joined today by Ms Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  The first item is the minutes of the meetings of 30 May 2019 and 13 June 2019.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  We will hold over last week's minutes until next week, when we will have had an opportunity to review them.</p> <p>  As there are no items arising that are not on our agenda, we will proceed to No. 3, which is correspondence received since the last meeting.  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first category is A, briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Correspondence Nos. 2273A and 2276A from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, are the briefing documents and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Nos. 2272A, and 2275A from Mr. Paul Reid, director general of the HSE, are the briefing documents and opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.</p> <p>  The next category is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to meetings of the committee and other items for publishing.  Some items have been held over from previous occasions.  No. 2161B is from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May.  We have held this over three times so far, on 30 May, 13 June and 20 June.  It is in regard to the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities which was undertaken by Mazars.  We have already noted and published this.  Deputy Kelly indicated he might have some observations.  I suggest we note and publish this and move on.  If the Deputy wants to raise it again-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062700002#B00500"><p>We will hold it over for next week.  Also held over from last week's meetings is No. 2231B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, dated 7 June, and providing an update to an inquiry the committee made in regard to a protected disclosure regarding St. Munchin's community centre, Limerick.  We had received anonymous correspondence in regard to this matter.  Mr. McKeon advises that an investigation of the issues raised was undertaken by the Department under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The alleged issues related to funding provided by the Department under the job initiative scheme.</p><p>The Department concluded its examination of the issues raised and a number of areas for minor improvement were identified, including governance, purchasing control and attendance records.  This was accepted by the management of St. Munchin's.  The Department has liaised with and met those involved in the job initiative scheme to discuss these issues.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/>The next item is No. 2244B<b>, </b>correspondence, dated 11 June 2019, received<b></b>from Mr. Cr&oacute;nan Goodman, private secretary to the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, in response to an inquiry from the secretariat about the Irish Prison Service.  The information was requested to feed into our periodic report and has to do with a procurement issue.  It is being considered as part of our consideration of the periodic report.  Is it agreed that we note and publish the correspondence?  Agreed.<br/><br/><b></b>The next item is No. 2246B correspondence, dated 11 June 2019, from the Department of Justice and Equality  in response to an inquiry made by the committee about the operation of CCTV systems by local authorities.  We had previously received responses from the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department is now forwarding a response from the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  The Department advised in December 2018 that 28 of the 31 local authorities had undertaken the role of data controller for specific community schemes.  The CCMA's response highlights an important distinction between local authority CCTV systems which are utilised for the purpose of exercising law enforcement powers and community-based CCTV schemes that typically are operated for the purpose of securing public order and safety in public places.  Essentially, there are three items of correspondence, the first of which contains subsections (1) to (4), inclusive.  The second is the actual response from the CCMA in October submitted to the Department which it has made available to us.  I ask those with an interest in this matter to note that we are putting this correspondence on our website.  Is it agreed that it be noted and published?  Agreed.  I highlight that of all the local authorities, only one - Laois County Council - operated a CCTV system for the purpose of exercising law enforcement power or a community-based CCTV system for the purpose of securing public safety without Pobal CCTV grant funding or grant funding under the Department scheme. <br/><br/>The next item is No. 2254B, correspondence, dated 17 June 2019, received from Mr. Peter Wood of the Irish Prison Service, providing further details requested by the secretariat of the breakdown for non-compliant procurement in the 2017 appropriation account of the Irish Prison Service.  We will note and publish this correspondence and incorporate it into our next periodic report as being relevant.  We will ask for specific details of non-compliant procurement.  In the case of many of the reasons given, those supplying the particular service were the only ones in a position to do so.  The equipment was installed and in the interests of consistency people wanted to deal with the same supplier.  It was a significant issue.  In other cases, people were awaiting finalisation of a centralised tender arrangement with the Office of Government Procurement, but in the meantime they proceeded with contracts at local level.  <br/><br/><b></b>The next item is No. 2262B, correspondence, dated 20 June 2019, received from the Secretary General&rsquo;s office in the Department of Finance, advising that the Department is working on its responses to the 16 items on which information was requested by the committee following its meeting on 30 May.  It is expected that we will receive a full reply in the first week of July.  We will note the correspondence and await the full response.<br/><br/>The next item is No. 2265B, correspondence, dated 20 June 2019, received from Ms Mary Donohoe, Office of the Director General, Environmental Protection Agency, providing further information requested by the committee on the availability of data for water testing.  The EPA advises that Irish drinking water is at low risk of containing illicit and legal drugs because the majority of wastewater discharges in Ireland occur in estuaries which discharge into the sea and are, therefore, downstream of drinking water abstraction points.  This environmental issue will be of concern to many.  I want to read one or two sentences from Ms Donohoe's letter.  The issue was raised by Deputy O'Connell.  The response deals only with drinking water.  Ms Donohoe states: &quot;Irish Water has a comprehensive annual drinking water monitoring programme...&quot;  Essentially, if there is a problem, it has to notify the EPA.  She further states:</p><blockquote>The associated annual monitoring reports can be accessed on the EPA&rsquo;s website ... Irish drinking water is at low risk of containing Illicit and/or legal drugs because the majority of wastewater discharges ... occur in the estuarine ... and are therefore downstream of drinking water abstractions and, hence, are not included in the routine drinking water monitoring programme.  Therefore, EPA does not hold any data in relation to specific illicit and/or legal drugs in Irish water supplies.</blockquote><p>We will ask for the issue to be clarified in respect of bathing water because if illicit and/or legal drugs are discharged into estuaries which dischargin into the sea, it may have implications for the quality of bathing water.  We accept that the EPA is stating it may not affect drinking water, but we would like the matter to be clarified.  If it is not checking for it in bathing water, we will suggest it consider doing so.  We will ask for a response on the monitoring programme for bathing water.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/><b></b>The next item is No. 2266B, correspondence, dated 20 June 2019, received from Ms Dee Forbes, director general of RT&Eacute;, enclosing further information on the ongoing review of contracts.  RT&Eacute; states it will continue the review into the second half of 2019 in a sequenced manner.  I know that Deputy Cullinane will want to speak about this item.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-27a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062700002#C00200"><p>Yes.  It is welcome that there is a process in place to meet staff members on individual contracts.  There seems to be some movement in that regard.  I have spoken to some staff members who may have their contracts reviewed and be put on normal contracts.  That shows that there was a problem.  Even the response from Ms Forbes in which she states it is a complex matter is a massive step forward from where we were when it was said there was no issue.  There is an issue and I understand it is complex to deal with it.  Ms Forbes is right that everybody's circumstances are different.  She states the process of discussing individual contracts will continue into the second half of the year.  Can we note the correspondence to which we might come back after the summer recess?  Having regard to a number of other issues, including a couple of unintended programmes or coverage of events that led to greater losses for RT&Eacute;, we should keep an eye on the matter.  We could consider inviting RT&Eacute; representatives to come back before the committee at the latter end of the year.  I ask that we include it in our work programme for discussion.  I know that they do not have to come before us, but they could do so voluntarily.  On the issue of individual contracts, we need to keep an eye on the matter.  Given that RT&Eacute; has stated it will continue the review over the summer months, we might write to it when we come back after the summer recess.</p></speech>

We will put it down to be dealt with in correspondence at that stage.</p><p><b><font color="#004080">  </font></b>The next category is correspondence the Committee of Public Accounts has issued to organisations subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General asking them to submit their draft accounts for audit within three months of year end.  There were 18 bodies on our list and at our previous meeting we noted 13 replies.  A further four have been received as follows.  No. 2267B is correspondence, dated 17 June 2019, received from the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  No. 2268B is correspondence, dated 13 June 2019, received from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, on the environment fund.  No. 2269B is correspondence, dated 17 June 2019, received from Mr. Gabriel Cooney, chairperson, The Discovery Programme.  No. 2270B is correspondence, dated 18 June 2019, received from Mr. Aidan Farrell, CEO, State Examinations Commission.  Can we agree to note and publish these items of correspondence?  Agreed.</p><p>At the previous meeting, we asked the Comptroller and Auditor General for an update on the submission accounts.</p></speech>

I refer to the letter from the Secretary General, when he said the Department and officials from the Comptroller and Auditor General agreed bilaterally that the fund account would be submitted by 30 June each year.  We accepted that the Department would present it only by 30 June.  The previous year, we received the fund account in September.  We asked for it in March together with the appropriation account but it said it was not able to do that.  While we have accepted receipt by 30 June, we have not agreed that is appropriate.  It should be presented earlier.</p></speech>

In fairness to the Department, in the year it was submitted late, in September, it was at the point when the function was being transferred from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  A certain leeway can be given in the first year but it should have been bedded down by now and I would have expected to get it earlier.</p></speech>

For University College Cork, we still await the 2017-2018 account for audit.  St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and Church of Ireland College of Education are being wound down.  In one case, there is a cessation account, while in the other, there is a residual liabilities account.  There was an accounting difficulty with the previous year but that will be resolved.  Very few transactions are involved in either account.</p> <p>  For the health bodies, we still await draft financial statements from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.

It is not appropriate, therefore, for us to comment on it and he is correct that he is not in a position to do so either.  We noted that his previous correspondence contained a mistake that everyone accepts was inadvertent because he was not given prior notice of the issue and may not have been apprised of the details.  It was helpful of him, therefore, to write to the committee.</p> <p>  He seems to express some concern about our discussion that followed.  Perhaps he does not know how the committee works but if we receive an item of correspondence, it has to be noted and can be discussed.  The only reason it was discussed was it was a correction of something that had been said.  Further information was sought and the clerk to the committee has followed up in that regard.  One such piece of information was the exit surveys that are done if somebody leaves the Garda.  We wondered whether there had emerged among Garda stations a pattern of reasons for leaving.  In one station, anecdotally at least, there seemed to be a suggestion of bullying and similar issues.  While we cannot say that was the case, we asked for a flavour of what was coming up in the exit surveys.  We do not want individuals' names or other details.  The Garda indicated that it does that type of work in any event.  I think Mr. Nugent responded to us on the matter.  We should follow up and keep an eye on it, and I hope we will receive a response in due course.</p></speech>

A number of freedom of information requests on the matter have been processed by the Department.  Mr. Watt indicates that the information will be shared with the committee.</p><p>He said the officials are happy to share the records from the documents released under freedom of information.  We will ask that that be submitted as soon as possible.  I take it other freedom of information requests are in the system, and some have been dealt with.  We will ask for those immediately, as they should be on the public record, and that we receive the new ones as they become available.  We note and publish that and will keep an eye that we be given new ones in due course.</p><p> No. 2278B is from Mr. Gerard Dollard, CEO, Irish Greyhound Board, dated 25 June 2019 enclosing an organisational restructuring report and a note in relation to the "Prime Time" programme that was broadcast last night.  This was referred to at last week's meeting on Bord na gCon and the grants which it receives from the Exchequer every year.  Deputy MacSharry mentioned that a report had been produced by Preferred Results Ltd., dated 29 September 2017.  We undertook to seek a copy of that report.  The Greyhound Board was aware that it had been mentioned and forwarded it to us.  I have not had an opportunity to read it.  It is 60 or 70 pages.  We will not discuss last night's programme but the report is there arising from the grant the Exchequer pays to Bord na gCon.</p></speech>

It fits into last night's programme, and the Chairman is right that we will not go into it.  On page 3, the last paragraph reads "While for the most part the findings of the analysis raise serious issues, on the other hand, nothing was identified which could not be fixed and there is every reason to believe that IGB could, within a short number of years, become a financially viable entity, drugs free and with an impeccable record on animal welfare."  That suggests that at present it is not financially viable, it is not drugs free and it does not have an impeccable record in animal welfare.  These are all issues that were raised in the programme on the slaughter of puppies, loss leading where they were being sold for 50% less than their value, and there being no checks on animal welfare.  When is its appropriation accounts due?</p></speech>

By implication, as the Deputy said, it is not there yet, which was the essence of last night's programme.</p> <p>  We now move to correspondence with private individuals, category C.  No. 2243C is from an individual dated 9 June 2019 in relation to the wards of court issue.  The correspondent previously made a number of inquiries regarding this matter and a D&aacute;il debate is awaited in relation to a report by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on the matter.  While the individual would like to see the Committee of Public Accounts' terms of reference amended to allow it to look at the matter, amending the terms of reference is a matter for the Oireachtas.  The Committee of Public Accounts cannot unilaterally do it.  This is a matter which has been looked at by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I have spoken to the Ceann Comhairle.  The matter is listed, but I do not have a date.  A report was produced by our colleagues on the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality specifically on the wards of court issue.  I encourage members of this committee to participate in that debate in the D&aacute;il when it takes place and during which they can make the relevant points.  The D&aacute;il debate on the justice committee's report is the next step.</p></speech>

He said that it is in the lottery, but there are only two weeks left and there are many other things in the system.  It may or may not be, but I have asked.  I can say no more than that.  We note that.</p> <p>  No. 2245C received from an individual dated 11 June 2019 provides his comments and views in relation to the recent Supreme Court judgment regarding the Kerins case.  We will note this item, but we will not discuss it.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas and others.</p> <p>  No. 2250C is from an individual dated 14 June 2019 who has previously corresponded with the committee in relation to Government policy regarding climate change.  I propose with the individual&rsquo;s permission that we forward the matter to the appropriate sectoral committee for any action it deems appropriate.  It relates to climate change policy which arose at our meeting on the cost of the State purchasing carbon credits from other countries.  However, this is a policy issue and we will pass it on to the relevant committee.</p> <p>  No. 2251C from Deputy Kate O'Connell, dated 14 June 2019, was also held over from the last meeting.  The Deputy requests further details regarding information provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in relation to Tusla at the meeting on 13 June.  The secretariat has included this request in the follow-up information requested from the Department.  We note the Deputy's request and look forward to receiving the information.</p> <p>  No. 2252C is from Wind Aware Ireland, WAI, dated 14 June 2019 regarding renewable energy and emissions targets.  While I made some comments recently on information provided to the committee regarding costs related to carbon emissions, this is ultimately a policy matter.  The letter raises more queries than that.  WAI has contacted the committee before.  It produced a document some time ago on the cost of wind energy in Ireland report.  We received a copy of it and decided that it was not a matter for the committee but more for the respective sectoral committee.  WAI has now come back expressing confusion as to why the Committee of Public Accounts was debating the issue having indicated on 7 February 2018 that it had no oversight in the area.  It asks that if we are examining the issue of the cost of meeting EU targets that WAI be included in our discussion.  The reason it arose the last day was that officials from the Department were before the committee and we were dealing with the cost of purchase credits.  It is not our policy area but we are looking at the financial aspects.  I can understand WAI's point as we said we would not discuss it but that cost issue arose as part of the departmental vote.  The letter stated that we may have confused the issue in relation to emission targets and that they are a good idea but that renewable targets are useless unless they are linked to emission reductions.  We will note that correspondence.  It is an issue that will be debated further, and I believe a special committee will be established on climate change.  When that happens it will be in its direct remit.  Financial matters in relation to all these issues will continue to arise at this committee, but not policy issues.</p> <p>  No. 2260C from an individual dated 18 June 2019 is further correspondence in relation to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This relates to the use of test cases where there are a number of similar cases in the appeals office and where there are a number of workers engaged with the same employer who have individually submitted an appeal.  They often look to make a sample decision on a number of cases, probably to see if there a systematic issue involved.</p><p>Perhaps it is a way for them to build up their knowledge so they can deal with the cases more straightforwardly and on an individual basis.  This continually contests the appeals office's right to do that.</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy to submit it today and we can deal with it next week.  The individual has raised a complicated issue.</p><p>No. 2261C from IBEC dated 20 June 2019 encloses a position paper on the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 which includes some of IBEC&rsquo;s key recommendations regarding the oversight of the commercial rates system.  This will be of interest to members but the recommendations are ultimately policy matters.  While the committee will forward this directly to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for any action it may deem appropriate, we note that IBEC's correspondence states:</p><blockquote>The collection of commercial rates must be improved [IBEC has included charts showing the collection rate] ... The revaluation process must be scrutinised including timelines and costs, with a view to expediting the process.  The work of the Valuation Office and the Valuation Tribunal must be examined.  Finally, we are calling for a full review of local government finance, including examination of replacing the commercial and domestic property taxes with a site or land value tax.</blockquote> <p>This is clearly a Government policy issue.  The committee will, however, follow up on one aspect.  The Valuation Office has been before the committee previously and it was included in our periodic report.  We were very unhappy with the office's slow progress in doing its first valuation and even at this point, which is 15 years after the legislation was passed, it has not even got to some counties.  The committee will write to the Valuation Office to ask for a full update on its work programme and which counties have been revalued.  We will also ask for a summary of the outcome with regard to the percentages of rate payers who have experienced an increase or decrease or no significant change.  The Valuation Office has those figures and has been quoting them extensively.  We would like to see those figures on a county by county basis.  We particularly want to find out if some counties have been revalued a second time while some counties have not been revalued a first time.  The committee will want a detailed explanation and a detailed timetable.  That issue was covered in an earlier periodic report and it is now incumbent on the committee to follow up our own previous periodic report.  We shall not, however, get into the policy of the matter.  Deputy Cassells might have an interest in this topic.</p></speech>

The Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 was before the select committee yesterday.  The Minister brought forward a series of amendments.  The Chairman has touched on the Valuation Office.  We have had the Valuation Office in before this committee.  Some of the particular points we raised covered the tardiness in fulfilling that process and the impact this has on businesses.  I put this point to senior officials yesterday.  The assistant secretary pointed out that in the last number of years we have gone from a situation where there were perhaps a couple of hundred cases on appeal with the Valuation Office to a situation where there are now more than 1,000 businesses appealing valuations.  I have asked officials what is the cumulative figure.  I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General knows the figure - or if it is the Tax Appeals Commission - on what is the cumulative figure, with regard to net worth, for more than 1,000 businesses that have appeals currently with the Valuation Office.  Obviously there is a serious issue with the Valuation Office in conducting the business in the first place and now the fact that there are more than 1,000 cases on appeal.</p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward proposals at the select committee providing for an inability to pay clause for the Bill, which will be on Report and Final Stages next Wednesday, 3 July.  This is in the context of the revaluation process whereby - due to the Valuation Office's tardiness - a business might get hit with a significant increase in one fell swoop.  A person could be hit with that cost in the following year.  Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal sought to stagger that cost over a course of payments.  Both of those amendments were rejected on Committee Stage yesterday and I want this on the record.  IBEC has put forward its position paper on the rates to this committee this morning.  We are in a situation - as the committee has dealt with previously - where &euro;1.5 billion was raised off commercial rates.  This has increased by 14% over the past decade and is the main contributor to the funding of local government, yet the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018, which will go on to Report Stage next Wednesday will not deal with the significant issues of businesses facing an inability to pay outside of the greater Dublin area.  This is a serious issue.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General has this figure.  I have asked the senior officials in the Department about this also.  The Valuation Office has in excess of 1,000 appeals on its books.  The Valuation Office could not give me a timeline for how quickly the cases would be taken off the books or for how long on average the businesses are waiting for a valuation on appeal to be dealt with.  This is a serious issue also for this committee because the Valuation Office was before the committee for a whole day.  It did not deal with the valuations, and as a result of yesterday's meeting we can see that it is not dealing with the appeals in a timely fashion either.</p></speech>

The Valuation Office was before the committee.  It is meant to be doing the revaluations.  The Valuation Office is not there yet in completing revaluations across the country.

We will ask for information on the revaluation programme and separately we will seek - not financial statements - an up to date information note on the position of the Valuation Office and how it is progressing.  As part of the Vote this request is within this committee's remit.  We will request they answer the questions on that basis.  The sectoral committee will continue to deal with the legislation aspect of the query but any information the committee can obtain may be helpful in that regard.</p> <p>  No. 1630, dated 18 October 2018, was correspondence from NAMA on a full breakdown the committee had requested some time ago on the number of properties offered to each of the local authorities for housing and so on.  The committee received detailed information.  It was raised at the last committee meeting and we have it on file.  I will ask the committee secretariat to email this to members, if it has not already been done.  I have a copy and perhaps members already have it.  That issue has been raised.  Having had a fresh look at that schedule, if members want to raise it at a subsequent meeting, then they should feel free to do so.</p> <p>  I shall now turn to statement of accounts received since the last meeting.  There are four items. The Marine Institute is a clear audit opinion.  The National University of Ireland, Maynooth is a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn by the Comptroller and Auditor General to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset, standard for universities, which is a provision of &euro;750,000 in the university statement of comprehensive income and expenditure on impairment of a loan to a loss-making subsidiary company set up to commercialise intellectual property and to provide consultancy and training services.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on this shortly.  Fishery Harbour Centres accounts present a clear audited opinion.   The Credit Union Fund accounts are in with a clear audit opinion.  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment.</p></speech>

Today, we have the HSE and the Department of Health, and next week we have the NTMA financial statements.  I want to get the agreement of the committee on the scheduling of the meeting next week.  A big aspect of NTMA activity is the State Claims Agency.  I ask the secretariat to arrange the timing for the meeting.  I propose we deal with the other part of the NTMA business, that is, the national debt, the National Development Finance Agency, prize bonds accounts and those types of issues, in the first half of the meeting, and keep the issue of the State Claims Agency until the second half of the meeting.  It will still be the one meeting but I do not want to have one question on the prize bonds, the next on the State Claims Agency and the next on the national debt.  We will hold the State Claims Agency questions until the latter half of the meeting.  The chief executive of the NTMA will be here throughout.  It is just to make the meeting run a bit more logically.  We will run the meeting in two halves and we will keep the State Claims Agency issue separate.</p> <p>  On 11 July, we will deal with the appropriation accounts for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will then deal with matters in regard to the IBRC liquidation.  With regard to outstanding matters in the work programme, we can take the Irish Prison Service off that as we have dealt with it and we will also deal with it in our periodic report.  We have also dealt with the issue of the OPW meeting with a former valuer.  We will see next week how complete we are in terms of our work programme.</p></speech>

Our committee intends to issue its next periodic report on Tuesday, 9 July.  A document has been provided to some members of the media which has been quoted from and referred to as a draft periodic report.  The document that has been issued is not a draft of our periodic report, due to be published in two weeks, and it is not an accurate version of what will be published.  The document which was quoted from is a document prepared solely by the secretariat with no input from any member of the committee.  It was written to assist the committee in its consideration of the matters covered at various meetings over the previous months.  The conclusions and recommendations in that document have no status.  The document that was circulated had never been considered, discussed or approved by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was a document prepared by the secretariat.  The document has no standing with regard to the committee.  It is not a draft of a periodic report, just an internal document prepared by the secretariat.  We will not circulate any draft versions of our work until we formally launch our report on 9 July.</p></speech>

The audit of the 2018 appropriation account is ongoing.  The Department's gross expenditure for that year was approximately &euro;14.8 billion.  The majority of that, &euro;14.6 billion, was paid to the HSE, spread across 17 subheads in the appropriation account.  Supplementary spending provisions were made during 2017 in respect of seven of the HSE subheads, totalling &euro;195 million.  Receipts to the Vote in 2017 totalled &euro;459 million, almost the same as in 2016.  Those receipts comprised mainly &euro;278 million received from the UK under a bilateral agreement on reimbursement for treatment provided under EU regulations, and receipts of just over &euro;167 million from the proceeds of excise duties on tobacco products.  The surplus liable for surrender to the Exchequer at end 2017 was just under &euro;2.4 million.</p> <p>  I turn to the HSE financial statements, which relate to the calendar year 2018.  They are prepared on an accruals basis.  Unusually, they include both a revenue or recurrent income and expenditure account, and a separate capital income and expenditure account.  The law provides for the Minister for Health to specify the accounting standards and framework to be applied by the HSE in the preparation of its financial statements.  The basis for the framework applied is financial reporting standard, FRS, 102, but the Minister has formally directed that a number of exceptions to that standard should be applied.  Such directions have been duly applied since the HSE was established in 2005, and those applying in 2018 are listed in note 1 to the financial statements.</p> <p>  I have drawn attention in my audit report to a new direction of the Minister for the 2018 financial statements, in relation to accounting for a liability arising from a legal settlement with medical consultants agreed during 2018.  At the end of 2018, the liability is estimated to be around &euro;198 million.  In accordance with the accounting standards specified by the Minister, the HSE has not recognised this liability in its financial statements.  Because the HSE had made a provision in 2008 of &euro;68 million in expectation of a pay-out on foot of the consultants' claim, that had to be reversed in the 2018 financial statements.</p> <p>  My audit opinion was not modified in respect of this matter because the financial statements conform to the standards statutorily specified.  However, I have drawn attention to the ministerial direction, because it represents a substantial change in the HSE's accounting practice that might not otherwise be readily identified by users of the financial statements, in particular for the period 2018 to 2020, during which the settlement payments will be made.</p> <p>  The HSE's recurrent income in 2018 was just over &euro;16 billion, which is an increase of approximately &euro;932 million, or 6.2% on 2017.  The majority of that, &euro;15.2 billion, is Exchequer funding from the Department of Health's vote.  The remaining income comprises retained superannuation and pension levy deductions from staff salaries, totalling just under &euro;420 million, and patient fee income of approximately &euro;406 million.  Recurrent expenditure by the HSE in 2018 was &euro;16.1 billion, representing an increase of approximately &euro;877 million, or 5.8% on 2017.  As shown in figure 1, which is now on the screen, the majority of this spend was across four main areas in 2018.</p> <p>  At the end of 2018, the HSE reported a net operating deficit of just over &euro;85 million.  In accordance with the Health Act 2004, the deficit has been carried forward and will be met from the funding provided from the Department of Health's vote for 2019.</p> <p>  My report on the audit also draws attention to a continuing material level of HSE non-compliance with procurement rules.  I have repeatedly reported on, and drawn attention to, the matter.  While the HSE acknowledges the problem, it is still not in a position to quantify the value of its expenditure on goods and services where public procurement procedures were not complied with.</p> <p>  Each year, we examine samples of procurements at a number of HSE locations to test whether there has been an appropriate competitive process.  For the past five years, the estimated percentage of non-compliant procurement found in the sample has fluctuated between 14% and 49% by value.  Because there is not a single procurement database in the HSE, the results are specific to procurement practice at the sampled locations, and cannot be extrapolated to the HSE as a whole.  I need here to make a correction to the record.  In my audit report for the 2018 financial statements, I refer to the audit sample testing at five locations indicating a level of procurement non-compliance of 30% by value.  In preparing for this meeting, my team discovered a calculation error.  The correct non-compliance rate for the 2018 sample was, in fact, 23% by value.  However, I am satisfied that this does not alter the conclusion I drew in my report.  I regret that a figure that was materially incorrect was given in the report.  Our long-standing policy in such circumstances is always to correct the record of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at the earliest available opportunity.</p> <p>  I will turn now to chapter 16.  As Members will be aware, public hospitals treat both public and private patients.  Although the bulk of the HSE's income is from voted funds, it depends on receiving significant fee income related to treatment of private patients.  On the other hand, to ensure equitable access by individuals to hospital services, the HSE seeks to limit private treatment activity in acute public hospitals to 20%.  Medical consultants' contracts provide for them to carry out varying levels of private activity.</p> <p>  Chapter 16 considers how the HSE controls the level of private activity in public hospitals, and assesses how the HSE measures performance in that regard at the national level, in individual hospitals and for medical consultants.  Measurement of public and private activity in acute hospitals is based on the hospital inpatient enquiry, HIPE, system, which monitors inpatient and day case activity only.  Emergency department and outpatient attendances are not within the scope of the measurement.  As a result, the measure is not well defined.  In addition, many public acute hospitals and individual consultants may have limited control over their private activity levels.  For example, the majority of patients admitted as inpatients to many hospitals enter from the emergency department, or are maternity admissions, and elective admissions must be treated in order of clinical priority.</p> <p>  The percentage of public inpatient activity carried out varies significantly from hospital to hospital, as indicated in figures 16.4 and 16.5 in the chapter.  However, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from that, since public and private activity targets have not been set at an individual hospital level.</p><p>Varying rates of health insurance among catchment populations may be a significant factor in that regard.  There are significant variations in the conditions of employment applying to medical consultants in respect of the private activity they undertake.  Contracts allows for rates from zero to 30%.  However, the HSE was unable to provide outturn data in this regard because it does not monitor or collate information about private treatment levels at an individual consultant level.</p><p> The overall conclusion of the chapter is that there are significant weaknesses in the performance measures used by the HSE to monitor public private activity levels within the acute hospitals system.</p></speech>

As Accounting Officer for the Department of Health's Vote 38, I am pleased to be here to deal with the 2017 annual report and appropriations accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The other item on today's agenda, the 2018  financial statements of the HSE, will be addressed in the first instance by Mr. Reid, as the accountable person for those accounts.  Since 2015, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, funding of the HSE is provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health, that is, Vote 38.  Accordingly, in 2017, the Department was responsible for a budget of &euro;14.341 billion for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to the HSE and to a range of other research, consultative, regulatory and advisory bodies.  The budget includes the additional &euro;195 million provided by Government in 2017 to the health Vote by way of a Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2017 Vote 38 accounts.  Funding is allocated to the Department in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to a range of bodies under the aegis of the Department, including the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  The Department's role is to support the Minister in providing strategic leadership for the health service and to ensure Government policies are translated into actions and implemented effectively.  We support the Minister and Ministers of State in their implementation of Government policy and in discharging their governmental, parliamentary and departmental duties.</p> <p>  Much of the public debate tends to be on weaknesses in our health services.  Identifying measures to address those issues, in association with our colleagues in the HSE, undoubtedly demands continuing work on the part of the staff of the Department.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy defines this reform agenda, which is ambitious in scope and intended progressively to improve the accessibility and quality of services over a ten-year period.  The Department has established a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office and is working closely with the HSE, other Departments and a range of stakeholders to implement reforms.</p> <p>  More generally, the Department seeks to frame policies and legislation to promote health.  Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, we work cross-sectorally to achieve this objective.  Life expectancy in Ireland in 2017 was 82.2 years, which was 1.3 years above the EU 28 average.  It has increased by 3.2 years between 2005 and 2017.  We also work internationally with EU colleagues and the World Health Organization, WHO, on health issues.  Currently, considerable work is under way with the EU and the United Kingdom to address the health challenges caused by Brexit and to ensure that North-South and east-west co-operation on health matters is maintained.  In addition, we support the Minister and Ministers of State in their work, including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability.  For example, in 2018, the Department processed almost 11,500 parliamentary questions, representing 23% of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across government.</p> <p>  The 2017 gross provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was &euro;14.801 billion.  The 2017 outturn was almost &euro;14.798 billion and there was an overall surplus of &euro;2.3 million.  This was after accounting for a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;195 million.  Of the 2017 gross provision for current expenditure, &euro;204 million was provided to the Department-related subheads in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to agencies under the aegis of the Department, other than the HSE.  The 2017 outturn for these subheads was &euro;189 million, giving an underspend of &euro;15 million.  There was &euro;14.040 billion of the 2017 gross provision for current expenditure provided to HSE-related subheads.  The 2017 outturn for these subheads was &euro;14.052 billion, giving an overspend of &euro;12 million.  The overspend primarily related to funding the existing level of service in both acute and community services and pension costs.  This overspend was met from savings elsewhere in the Vote.  The 2017 provision for capital expenditure was &euro;557 million and the 2017 outturn was &euro;557 million.  The 2017 appropriations-in-aid to the health Vote was &euro;1 million short of profile, at &euro;459 million.  The end-year net outturn for current and capital spending was &euro;14.339 billion, against a net provision of &euro;14.341 billion, resulting in a saving to the Exchequer of the aforementioned &euro;2.3 million.</p> <p>  While I am here in the context of the appropriation accounts for 2017, I am conscious that the committee has expressed concerns in respect of the accounting treatment of the consultant pay arrears in the HSE's annual financial statements for 2018.  I assure members that there is nothing untoward about this, and there were very good reasons that the Department considered it to be the most appropriate course of action.  This was a purely technical solution to address the specific characteristics of the consultant settlement.  As the committee will be aware, consultants took a High Court case regarding their dispute on the non-implementation of pay increases under the 2008 consultant contract.  Those increases were not implemented over the intervening period due to the financial emergency.  Had the State lost that court case, the reinstatement of increases with full retrospection would have required an immediate payout running to hundreds of millions of euro.  Instead, the State negotiated a settlement in June 2018 that capped the historic element at less than 55% and achieved an agreement to pay this out over two subsequent years, in 2019 and 2020.  This involves additional once-off payments, which were estimated at &euro;73 million in 2019 and &euro;109 million in 2020, in respect of the historic element of the settlement.  Payment of the increases due from the date of settlement to the end of December 2018 was also deferred to 2019.  The ongoing cost of the settlement was estimated at &euro;62 million on an annual basis.  Agreement for payment over the two years, 2019 and 2020, represented a very substantive benefit to the State of the settlement agreement as, in the event of a court award, the State could have been faced with a requirement for immediate payment of higher salaries and pensions and very significant arrears.</p> <p>  Under section 36 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with standards specified by the Minister.  These, for the most part, reflect financial reporting standards.  However, several exceptions have been made through specific policy directions, including in respect of future pension liabilities, liabilities under the clinical indemnity scheme, depreciation and capital grants.  In light of the specific characteristics associated with the consultant settlement, it was decided to direct the HSE to apply a "receipts and payments" convention so that recognition of the expenditure arising from the agreement would be appropriately matched with future funding from the Department of Health Vote.  The reason for this approach was to acknowledge the special and unique characteristics of the settlement which, from a State budgetary perspective, was successfully spread over a subsequent two-year period.</p> <p>  The substance of the agreement upon which the cases were settled informed the approach taken.  Had the full liability been recorded in the HSE's 2018 accounts, regardless of the fact that payment was not due until 2019 and 2020, the deficit arising would, under health legislation, have been required to be offset against 2019 funding.  This would have reduced the funding available for the delivery of health services in 2019 since, under the settlement, some &euro;109 million in once-off payments do not fall due for payment until 2020 and the funding for them will not be provided until then.  This additional direction for 2018, in respect of the non-recognition of that liability, is time bound and will only apply until 2020.  Different options were considered by the Department and the HSE to address the issue on a transparent basis.  The direction that issued to the HSE was incorporated in the finalised annual financial statements approved by the HSE directorate.</p> <p>  I am happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-27a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062700002#K00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the HSE's annual report and financial statements for 2018 and chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017.  As the Chairman stated, I took up post six weeks ago.  As this is my first meeting with the committee in this role, I take the opportunity to state that I look forward to working with members and providing assistance to the committee in its important work.  The senior management colleagues joining me today are Ms Anne O'Connor, deputy director general of operations; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of national services; and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.</p><p>We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of this meeting and I will therefore confine my opening remarks to the following issues.<br/><br/>The first is the financial outturn for 2018.  The HSE's annual financial statements record a final audited revenue income and expenditure deficit of &euro;85.1 million.  Further detail is set out in the finance briefing paper provided to the committee in advance of this meeting, including around the movement in provisions and how this figure can be related to the final HSE published quarterly performance report for 2018.  The 2018 final position is arrived at after dealing with the &euro;140 million first charge for 2017 and after receipt of a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;625 million, the application of which has also been detailed.  The annual financial statement also records a &euro;16 million surplus on the capital account, which will be available to progress capital projects in 2019.<br/><br/>The most significant areas of financial pressure reflected in the year-end position relate to the pensions and demand-led areas, including the primary care reimbursement service.  Costs in these areas are generally driven by policy, legislative entitlements and demographic factors and, as such, they are not amenable to normal financial management controls.  Separately, our operational service areas experienced significant difficulty in reducing costs to meet savings targets, controlling staffing levels and responding to demand within budget.  Disability services were the area of greatest financial pressure within community services.  This pressure largely related to the costs of providing residential care to people with an intellectual disability, with the evolving needs of existing clients as they age and the demand for new places exceeding our funded capacity.  We also experienced similar pressures within our acute hospital services where activity was ahead of planned and funded levels, with a very high proportion of total activity arriving via our accident and emergency departments.<br/><br/>With respect to financial management for 2019, the HSE's first priority for implementing its 2019 national service plan, NSP, is to maximise the safety of the services it can deliver within the available budget.  Thereafter the priority, consistent with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme, is to deliver on the activity, access, improvement and other targets set out in the NSP, albeit this must be done within the affordable staffing level and without exceeding the overall budget.  Delivering these priorities will require a significantly enhanced focus on financial management.  This includes better controls on the management of agency, overtime and overall staffing levels and pay costs.  Senior managers will be supported and held to account in this regard.  The HSE&rsquo;s financial position for the year to date until March 2019 shows a revenue deficit of &euro;82.7 million, which represents 2.2% of the available budget.  Of this, &euro;44.8 million is in respect of greater than expected expenditure on operational service areas, which includes &euro;17.6 million on community services, mostly in respect of services for people with a disability, and &euro;28.4 million in respect of acute hospital services.<br/><br/>In cases where deficits appear in operational service areas, the relevant national director, community healthcare organisation chief officer or hospital group chief executive has been directed to identify and put in place additional measures to enable delivery of an overall financial break-even by year end.  This has been supported by a series of additional interim controls around agency, overtime and staffing, although all 2018 and 2019 developments approved and funded by the Department of Health are proceeding.<br/><br/>There is also a deficit of &euro;38 million in pensions and demand-led areas.  Options to limit deficits in these areas are being explored, albeit they are primarily driven by legislation, policy and demographic factors and, as mentioned, are therefore not generally amenable to normal management control efforts.  It is noted that if the effect of the 2018 first charge were to be reflected in the March results above, it would increase the overall March year to date variance by &euro;20.5 million to &euro;103.2 million, the change being predominantly within the pensions and demand-led areas.  The overall 2018 annual financial statement process came to an end on 13 May and the full first charge will be reflected in the monthly accounts from May onwards.  The necessary focus on delivering financial break-even reflects the HSE's legal obligation.  It will also benefit service users, patients and their families as it is consistent with the need to build trust and confidence in the organisation.  This is necessary so that additional investment in our public health and social care services over and above the cost of standing still can be secured over the next five to ten years.  This will facilitate the vision set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report to be realised.<br/><br/>The next matter is procurement.  The scale and complexity of the HSE's overall procurement activity are such that it will take a sustained effort and continuing investment over a number of years in order to ensure high levels of compliance and this is a key focus for the HSE.  The HSE incurs procurable expenditure in excess of &euro;2.2 billion annually.  The HSE continues to progress a transformational programme of reform of its procurement function to improve compliance with public procurement regulations and increase the usage of contracts awarded by the HSE and the Office of Government Procurement.  It has been highlighted and acknowledged at previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.  Health business services, HBS, procurement has been engaged in a major transformational change programme and the HBS strategy for 2017 to 2019 continues this strategic and operational transformation of health sector procurement.  With regard to procurement reform and, in particular, non-health procurable expenditure, the HBS function works closely with the Office of Government Procurement.  This collaborative effort with the OGP is achieving value for money and contributing to an increase in overall procurement compliance and the development of the overall procurement reform program.<br/><br/>With regard to chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Report for 2017, the HSE is undertaking extensive work in embedding the consultant contract compliance framework.  The framework seeks to support improved reporting, monitoring and overall consultant contract compliance.  The elements of compliance with public-private mix will be reported on a monthly basis and compliance with work plan and off-site practice will be reported on an annual basis.  In line with the performance and accountability framework, monthly performance meetings are held within existing structures and a key element includes improving consultant contract compliance.  Actions to address the areas of individual consultant non-compliance in terms of hours worked, off-site practice and public-private mix are progressed at local level.  A programme of internal audit has commenced and a number of hospitals are being scheduled, with Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital being the first, followed by Tallaght University Hospital and Naas General Hospital.  Further sites will be scheduled for audit in the coming weeks.  Overall summary rates of compliance for public-private mix are below the limit of 20% for private practice.  The percentage for acute hospitals inpatients is 12.5% and it is 14.5% for day cases.<br/><br/>With regard to outsourcing home support services, voluntary organisations have been engaged with and contributed significantly to the provision and ongoing development of the health and social care services in Ireland over many generations.  The term &quot;voluntary&quot; is often used when referring to section 38 and section 39 agencies.  Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 legally underpin the provision of services by non-statutory providers on behalf of the HSE - section 38 - and the provision of services similar or ancillary to a service that the HSE may provide - section 39.  The HSE has a continuing reliance on voluntary agencies to deliver services across the domains of acute care, social care, mental health and primary care supports and services.  The HSE funds approximately 2,279 organisations, including 16 large voluntary hospitals via a contract or service arrangement process that is legally binding.  This also includes funding for many smaller organisations such as local meals on wheels groups, which provide services through unpaid volunteers.<br/><br/>The HSE acknowledges that voluntary organisations largely funded by the State need to operate within defined policy and regulatory frameworks, including HIQA, charities regulation and company law, as well as public pay policy.  We also have a responsibility to optimise value for money and to ensure that health resources are maximised to benefit the citizen.  In line with Sl&aacute;intecare, health service reform also includes voluntary organisations funded by the HSE.  Voluntary agencies that provide home support services have made significant progress in reforming their services.<font color="#004080"> </font>These organisations are significant partners in the provision of home support, particularly in the greater Dublin area and the mid west.  These voluntary agencies have transitioned from a position where they were supported by the HSE through block grant arrangements to the current tender model of service provision.  This reform has improved the quality of home support, providing a model of service delivery that is more responsive to demand and more consistent across community healthcare organisations.  Streamlining of home support services has resulted in a single application and assessment process.  There is also clearer financial and activity reporting, which provides for greater accountability and transparency.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be familiar with some of the issues that have emerged with the national children&rsquo;s hospital and the required extra funding of &euro;100 million, which we have had to work through over the past several weeks.  This had direct implications for the capital plan where initially a &euro;25 million contribution was sought.  There was also some concern about what the capital funding demand would be for the following years.  We have been working through a process over the past few weeks with the Department in terms of the overall capital envelope available to the State and its implications for the capital plan.</p> <p>  This process is beginning to give us a bit of clarity about the implications for ourselves which will support the publication of it.  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s summer economic statement from a couple of days ago.  It set out some reserve for the national children&rsquo;s hospital and national broadband plan.  We are working through that process with our colleagues in the Department of Health.  We are moving towards the publication of the plan, which I expect to emerge in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Then cuts had to be implemented as the HSE was asked to find savings.  We are now in June &ndash; six months into the year &ndash; and we still have not seen the plan.  Why has it taken from February to June to deal with the issues that have arisen?  There is a bit of confusion.  Only last Thursday in the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Finance said there would be no cuts or projects delayed in any Department due to the issues with the national broadband plan or the overrun with the national children&rsquo;s hospital costs.  He stated:</p><blockquote>...as a result of the decisions made on broadband, and in dealing with the national children's hospital, I will not change other projects.  The other projects have associated needs, within communities and the country.  I want to make sure they move ahead.  Projects do not go ahead every year for reasons that have nothing to do with budgetary policy...</blockquote> <p>The Minister said there is no issue and the overrun is not a factor.  Why are we still discussing it if it is not a factor according to the Minister?</p></speech>

That was our stated position in early May and it would have been a big factor.  Regarding the overall capital envelope available to the HSE, if one looks at the major national strategic infrastructural projects, particularly in health, they are the right projects and have a high-capital demand.  The flexibility within our budget beyond the big major construction projects is tight anyway.  Our express concerns at that point in time were related to having to fund extra which would reduce the limited flexibility we have.</p> <p>  I believe we have made progress in the past few weeks and it was right to work it through with my colleague, Mr. Jim Breslin, in the Department.  In terms of achieving the envelope we had set out in the draft, I would be more confident in what has been set out in the economic statement.

In 2019, that broke down as &euro;75 million additional Exchequer and &euro;25 million health funding.  This year is fine.  The issue is, however, that if one kicks off a project at the end of 2019, it will need to be paid for in 2020.  That required a reflection on what those allocations would be.  That required an overall fiscal look at it by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He has done that and has put a reserve in for the children&rsquo;s hospital and broadband for &euro;200 million.  The children&rsquo;s hospital is a large project.  If it was to go quickly or slowly, the pace could have a distorting effect on all of the other health projects.  The reserve removes the risk and makes it much easier for us to conclude this process.</p></speech>

To go back to the Deputy's point, I restate that we have not stopped any project that we planned to do for 2019.  As my colleague said, the implication would be into 2020 and 2021.  The indications that emerged in terms of the summer economic statement would help us to put full clarity on that for next year.  My concern particularly would be not in relation to 2019 into 2020 and 2021, and that is a process we will work through in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The first is that the impact of the increased costs of the national children's hospital on capital funding for 2020 and beyond is still to be resolved.  With that uncertainty, there was a fear on the part of the HSE that it would have to carry all the increased costs of the children's hospital in 2020.  The fact that the summer economic statement on Tuesday put an additional reserve in place of &euro;200 million for that and for broadband takes that off the table.  That concern is now gone.</p></speech>

We saw reports last week that 13 consultants have resigned or retired from CUH in the past three years, ten of whom were delivering cancer services.  There is a huge concern in the region, given the fact the hospital is a national cancer centre, that we do not have enough consultants to treat the number of patients awaiting treatment.  What progress, if any, are we making on filling those posts?</p></speech>

The overall recruitment of consultants is a real factor and a very real issue for us.  Attracting consultants for posts that are advertised has been a real issue for us over the past couple of years in particular and remains one.  I will come back to the Deputy with the exact number shortly but we have had a reasonable recruitment of consultants over the past year in last year's numbers.  The issue in attracting consultants is one of concern for ourselves.  Just in terms of Cork, they will reallocate consultancy skills within and across the group and that has taken place.  On gaps in the number of consultants and on the number of consultants we need and want to have in the service, it is a real issue that we are dealing with right now.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid might confirm that.  Also, one medical oncology post remains vacant.  We have 25,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment for oncology in CUH.  Can we give any reassurance to those 25,000 people that the posts can be filled in the very near future?  Can we start to make a real dent in that particular waiting list of 25,000 people waiting for outpatient appointments for oncology?</p></speech>

Certainly, where we have gaps in consultants, we have been engaged with the NTPF to relieve the overall waiting lists and provide extra capacity in the system and that has been working for certain activities.  However, our waiting lists remain a very real issue and a very real concern for us.  We have over 550,000 nationally.  However, there is a specific project and programme within each hospital and hospital group.</p></speech>

Obviously, the challenge for us in the HSE overall is to look at how we can get more predictable in terms of our outturn towards the year end.  It is a very real challenge, as I mentioned at the start.  There are significant pressures on our acutes and, equally, on our communities.  I have been around the country in the past number of weeks in a lot of hospitals and community organisations and have seen at first hand the great and very inspiring work done by our teams and staff at front-line level.  It is highly respected by me, to state the obvious.  I am very aware of the acute pressures they are under and of the pressures on our community overall.  What we are setting out to do is look at the budgets allocated across each area to ensure any available funds we have are focused on patients and patient services.  A process is ongoing where the chief financial officer and I are meeting with all the group CEOs of the acutes, all the chief community officers and all the national directors.  We have been doing that over the past five weeks or so.  It is looking out at the spend to date, where the pressures on each of the services are, the forecasted outturn if we continue in a certain run rate and the level of controls we can put on areas within our control.  For example-----</p></speech>

There are no cuts planned in terms of budget and delivery this year.  We plan to deliver the actual services set out in the national services plan and to outturn with the budget we have been allocated.  I feel the need to say that because I know there is a perception.  No cuts are planned.  It is setting out to deliver against the budget we have been allocated.  In doing that, we want to ensure this is the right approach from a patient perspective and for those who use our services whereby we are directing our funds to where they are needed.  That is an approach we have been going on.  On the Deputy's specific question on the monthly profiles and accounts, it is nothing hugely new in terms of what we are setting out to do.  However, we are breaking down the budget by each hospital group and hospital manager, by each community organisation, etc., and setting out the profile for the year end so that everyone has clear oversight.  It is so that we can be more predictable about the outturn and, equally, from a patient perspective that we are injecting the funds and directing them into patient-focused areas.  I will look at other areas of budget that are not patient focused where we can make savings and direct those to where we have the big pressure points.  My perspective on controls is that it is good financial management on this one.  It is right for the public and for the patients who use our services.  They will benefit from it.  It will give us a level of predictability and it will give me a case, as Director General of the HSE, to make to Government on where we want to invest for the future as set out in Sl&aacute;intecare.  I want us to strengthen financial predictability in the HSE, determine the forecasted future investment needed and to ensure future investment when we succeed in getting it is directed into a new way of delivering services.  That involves the monthly controls and the focus we are putting in.</p><p>I have to say again for the record that I have had great engagement with all the hospital groups and managers.  Everyone wants us to get to a position where we have predictability.  Everyone wants us to be in a position to demonstrate we can do that.  We have great support.</p></speech>

I do not want the perception to go out that if savings have to be made during the year, they will come from cuts to services.  If Mr. Reid is saying that is not the case, that is fine.  The reality is the cuts to services come when the budget is allocated initially at the start of the year when the service plan is being drafted.  The HSE has to cut several areas to meet the budget allocation given.  Mr. Reid may say there will be no cuts to services throughout the year based on the budget the HSE has been given.  However, I would challenge anyone who would claim that the budget the HSE gets to deliver adequate services to the community is not hampered by the budget given by the Department.  It is clear services are being cut right across the board.</p></speech>

Extra investment is going in.  One area that got considerable focus was the area of home help and home support services.  This area got a significantly enhanced budget in the service plan this year versus last year.</p></speech>

We set out in the budget forecasting process what we believe the likely demand will be.  There is an allocation based on what can be sustained by the Government.  That rightly leads to the construction of the national service plan, which is up in every service area, especially front-line service areas, compared with last year.  My focus is to ensure that we continue to put in place the right investments in front-line service areas.</p> <p>  For the past five years, I have been in the local government sector, a sector with which Deputy O'Brien is familiar.  That sector has been under extraordinary pressure for housing and housing delivery and the issue of homelessness.  I have just come from that sector.  I have no mandate to spend above the allocation that I get.</p></speech>

I know the pressures on the sector.  I know the pressures on front-line staff and managers.  My role will be to support them.  We must direct every cent into front-line services.  As part of this process, we will have to evaluate non-value adding activities that we may be carrying out as part of the HSE overall structure and organisation.  I intend to do that over the coming phase by looking at what activities we are doing that are drawing cash.  If an activity is not adding value in terms of public service and patient service delivery, it is destroying value.  We are going to have to look at all our overheads and costs as well.</p></speech>

What is the up-to-date position on home care packages?  How many people are in acute hospital settings because they cannot get services at home?</p></speech>

A total of 125 consultants were recruited over the course of last year.  That is not the number we want.  We want to recruit more.  That is a process - I wish to acknowledge that upfront.</p> <p>  I will make a broader comment on home care packages and then specifically on the question of people in hospital waiting to exit so they can receive home care packages.  Our total allocation of hours this year is 17.9 million.  The budget is &euro;450 million or thereabouts.  That provides home supports to over 53,000 people.  There are significant demand and pressure points throughout the country, in particular in some areas around age profiles, etc.  We continue to commit to deliver the 17.9 million hours budgeted.  We got an extra budget for that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about people waiting in hospitals.  There are approximately 6,500 people overall in our community looking for some of those extra home help services.  A significant proportion of these are people who want extra demands on services or extra hours.  Some are seeking new services.  I will clarify the number in hospitals.  I understand 149 people are now in hospital care but looking for step-down services.  There are various challenges or issues with some step-down services.</p></speech>

There was a report in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, which described a letter from the interim chief executive officer, Ms Anne O'Connor, to the Department describing that the capital situation, along with having to deal with cost overruns in the children's hospital in the years 2020 to 2022, &quot;has made what was a very difficult situation now impossible&quot;.  Was she right?</p></speech>

Could she expand on that letter she sent to the Department of Health?  She stated this "has made what was a very difficult situation now almost impossible".  I  suppose she qualify this with the word "almost".  Does she envisage substantial cuts to capital projects to facilitate a lack of funding in her own experience, as she hinted in that letter?</p></speech>

It has possibly been covered already but the concern was the phasing of the funding.  The potential for the health service to provide &euro;25 million this year and more next year was a concern at that time.  As the director general just said, we are now in a process with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform to look at that because it was a concern.  The purpose of the letter was to flag that but things have moved on in the past number of weeks in the engagements that have taken place.</p></speech>

In that letter, I referenced the fact that the overall capital envelope, while we would always like to have more, was not the prime concern; the prime concern was the phasing of the funding available in 2019 and 2020 given the commitments we might have.  As I said earlier, the concern for 2019 is that if we were to commence capital projects towards the end of this year, there would be a substantial cost in 2020.  The purpose of the letter was to flag that concern but we have covered that there is a process in place now to look at the overall funding available.</p></speech>

The Minister has been saying that X number of hours have been funded but the experience on the ground is that output is not meeting demand.  While I acknowledge it is important to stay within budget, when it comes to the most vulnerable in society, none of us would oppose a supplementary budget for a demand-led service.  That needs to be care-led and not budget-led.</p><p>What is going on in the CHO 4 area?  Why are we out of money?  When I raised this matter in the D&aacute;il on 14 May, the Taoiseach answered by saying loads more money had been given to this area.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the additional moneys were hoovered up in meeting labour relations commitments and obligations in providing care, travel subsistence payments or whatever else.  Things are bad if in June we cannot fund any more home help services and depend on people either getting better or passing on before more packages can be made available.  What is the real position and what is being done about it?</p></speech>

Let me outline the message.  We have the Minister trumpeting budget increases, but in real terms there has not been an increase in the level of care provided because we have reached the summer and vulnerable persons in certain CHO areas - I know that this is the experience nationwide from talking to colleagues across parties - are being refused home care packages.</p></speech>

Certainly, there is pressure and demand.  Pressure is being put on the guys to look at rosters and arrangements in the context of what has been set out in the contractual agreements.  There is a challenge to put new rosters in place.</p></speech>

There is demand.  There are 83 year olds waiting who cannot care for themselves.  They are being discharged because there is a need to free up beds, but they do not have anybody to advocate for them because they are a widow or a widower.  I am thinking of a specific case, but everyone here has come across similar cases.  If whoever is in charge in the various CHO areas needs more money, can it not be provided for them?</p></speech>

I asked the question because Mr. Reid mentioned his background.  Let us focus on health.  I thank him for all of the documents supplied.  One could easily be overwhelmed by them, but they are very useful to us.  In his opening statement he talked about the budget and breaking even, which I can understand to a certain extent.  He went on to say it would benefit "users, patients and their families."  I shall put the matter in perspective.  The message I have taken from Mr. Breslin and Mr. Reid is that there is a limited budget within which they try to work and that anything after that is collateral damage.  They are my words, not theirs.  I know that I am straying into a policy area for the Joint Committee on Health, but there are financial consequences generated for both organisations in pursuing this model and Government policy.  The witnesses have mentioned that the number of home help hours is 18 million.  In Galway there are 208 people awaiting home support, of whom 176 have been waiting more than 12 months.  Of the overall figure, as many as 80 are awaiting an increase in the number of hours.  That begs the following question.  For how long have they been waiting in reality?  A budget has to be implemented.  Will I tell the people in question that they are simply collateral damage and that they have to bide their time?</p></speech>

If we want to provide a health service as a right and do not want to see 208 people being on a waiting list, of whom the vast majority have been waiting for over 12 months, we need a different model.  Have the witnesses fed this view back to the Government, or is it simply about managing the budget and that people who are waiting for support are collateral damage?</p></speech>

It is clear that we need an effective public health service.  I will come back later to the consultants who are using public facilities, but we need a public health system that is efficient and effective.  Within it, home care is the easiest example to pick.  It is cheaper and more efficient to fund that service than to keep people in hospital or nursing homes where a number of them do not want to be.  My question which I have asked three times is whether that is an efficient use of public funds.</p></speech>

I would like to bring another matter home to Mr. Reid in Galway city.  The committee has received correspondence from a consultant.  It is unusual for consultants to go out on a limb, but this consultant has done so repeatedly.  I will outline some figures which show that in the end the cost to the Exchequer is greater.  The aforementioned consultant states there is a "catastrophic" - his word, not mine -  waiting list of 2,000 patients which has been accumulating since the shortfall in infrastructure and that the situation is becoming unbearable for the patients who are on the waiting list and clinically worsening.  I will not read the entirety of what he had to say, but Mr. Reid can have a copy of the letter, if he so wishes.  </p> <p>  The hospital serves a region of almost 1 million people.  Why do I mention that?  Mr. Breslin spoke about answering parliamentary questions, which he does very efficiently, but some of them are redirected to various groups on the ground, including Saolta.  I cannot make head nor tail of what they are telling me on this issue.  Briefly, two operating theatres have ceased to exist.  While the Government is talking about a rainy day fund, as a result of rain pouring in on two theatres in Galway, they were closed in 2017.  We are now in 2019 and no modular theatres have been put in place.  This is about infrastructure, decision making and accountability in the Department of Health.  The Minister responded on 5 March that he understood the position of Saolta, but the reality was different.  In a nutshell, it involved the procurement of two modular theatres.  The procurement process was stopped when it was discovered very late in the process that planning permission was needed.  That led to the aforementioned letter.  Where is the oversight of the project by the Department?</p></speech>

As I understand it, it is not simply a planning issue.  The preferred tenderer was selected, but it was not possible to conclude a contact with it.  We have put questions to the HSE about how that came about, particularly to ensure the next award will be completed as rapidly as possible.  It will be done in parallel with planning.</p></speech>

What is an issue is oversight of a decision-making process that is faulty.

I ask Mr. Breslin to reflect on it in terms of achieving value for money.  What I take from this  is that the HSE is saving money.</p><p>On the <i>ex gratia </i>payment, it is stated expenditure of &euro;336,000 was incurred in 2018.

Leaving aside that there are a number of contracts, we have public hospitals funded from the public purse, private consultants on different types of contract doing private work and a system of monitoring that is not fit for purpose.  I think "inadequate" is the word used in the chapter to describe how the system is monitored.  I think we all agree that it is inadequate.  The 2013 Act deals with private practice and bed designation.  Presumably, consultants were allowed to avail of the use of a number of beds.  What was the logic for that provision and why was it removed?</p></speech>

On the reason for its removal in 2013, the Comptroller and Auditor General had compiled a pervious report and the Department had carried out a value for money review which found that lots of private patients were coming into public hospitals for whom the consultants were getting a fee.  However, the public hospitals were getting no fee because the patients were not in designated private beds.</p><p>The consultant gets a fee but the hospital gets no fee because they are not in a privately designated bed.  That was removed so that public hospitals could get a fee for private patients, regardless of where they were.</p></speech>

We put in a compliance framework ahead of the work done by the Comptroller and Auditor General to make sure that it is monitored at hospital and hospital group level and that any breaches at an individual level are addressed by management with individual consultants.</p></speech>

That is not really what the chapter said.  My interpretation is that it said that the hospital inpatient inquiry system was not adequate for its purpose of clearly identifying which consultants were carrying our private practice and to what extent, and whether or not they were complying with their contract.  The hospital inpatient inquiry system was inadequate to do that.  Has it been changed as a result of this chapter?</p></speech>

First, it was not getting significant management focus.  Second, the hospital inpatient inquiry looks at inpatient activity and not the full range of activity, but it is a good starting point.  It does not answer every question but it is enough for a manager or clinical director to sit down with a consultant to discuss, say, that the hospital inpatient inquiry shows that there are 30% to 35% private patient admissions as part of their practice.  They can then go through that with the consultant to see whether that is wrong.  The consultant might be able to come up with satisfactory reasons, including accuracy.  After the chapter, we now have the situation where the HSE is required through the management system to put in place a monitoring framework and to follow up on breaches.  Deputy Connolly is right that there are policy questions involved in private practice in public hospitals.  For as long as it exists, it needs to be managed and monitored.</p></speech>

I have listened to what Mr. Reid has said over the past hour in responding to questions from members.  To paraphrase what he said about spending, whether current or capital, the HSE gets a pot of money and that money then has to be managed.  He and I might have a view on the size of the pot, but the pot is the pot and it needs to be managed.  We called for taxpayers' money to be managed and so I have no difficulty with that.</p> <p>  The problem is this.  A letter was sent by Mr. Reid to each hospital manager and each hospital group outlining concerns about historic overspend and the new hands-on approach he would take to make sure that each hospital comes in on budget.  He asked them to identify whether there was potential for overspend and, if there was, to put in place "cost-containment plans"; those are not his words, but the words of hospital managers in their responses.  Those plans will then be overseen by hospital groups.  If hospital managers do not come in on budget, they will be held responsible.  That is my understanding of the letter and of what Mr. Reid said earlier.  Is that a fair assessment of the position?</p></speech>

There is no greater need than that of the patients who we serve and the people who use our services.  My commitment in this job is to make it better for those people; that is why I am here.</p> <p>  I have met all managers and we will meet monthly for the rest of the year.  Their engagement and support has been well received.  The process is not cost containment; it is delivering across all strands the services committed to in our plan and delivering to budget.  I am absolutely aware-----</p></speech>

If it is not cost containment, is it the position that, if a hospital manager believes that they have to spend more than they have been given to meet demand, they are not obliged to come in on budget?  I can give examples in Waterford, where hospital managers have showed me a draft of a document that talks about cost containment.  Is cost containment not a priority for hospital managers?  Do these plans have to be put in place?</p></speech>

In Waterford, for example, the cost-containment plan looks at limiting surgical theatre space over a number of months during the summer, where savings can be made in cleaning contracts, agency spend and overtime.</p><p>There is a whole range of other areas.  They are all designed to make sure they come in on budget under a heading termed "cost containment".  I am stating that there is an element of cost containment.  As I put to Mr. Reid at the start of my contribution, that essentially means the HSE ensuring that they come in on budget.  He might not want to call it cost containment but that it what they call it.  Is that what is happening in hospitals across the State?</p></speech>

I am engaged in a process with the hospitals to look at the existing budgets they have to deliver all those services.  Regarding University Hospital Waterford, that hospital has been doing a number of things to best utilise its resources, particularly during the summer.  That also involves theatre usage and the best use of resources during that period.  The hospital is undertaking some operational changes that make sense for it.  I am not setting out the plan for each individual hospital or each group.  They are working through this themselves regarding their overall budgets.</p></speech>

Five patients were affected.  I am sure that Mr. Reid is aware that being booked in for some kind of cancer treatment is life-altering.  There is a psychological aspect involved in a person building himself or herself up physically and mentally for this type of treatment.  The person goes to the hospital and is ready to get the surgery but is then told to go home.  The hospital management stated that was purely due to capacity issues with surgical theatre space.  Despite that, however, that cost containment plan will kick in over the next weeks and months and will that there will be a reduction in surgical theatre availability.  That is the outworking of it.  First of all, was Mr. Reid aware that patients were sent home?</p></speech>

I have no problem whatsoever with Mr. Reid and the HSE ensuring that health spending is contained.  That is one of Mr. Reid's and the HSE's core functions and it should be.  I have no problem, therefore, with that.  I certainly accept that he has come into this job to ensure that he plays his part in making sure that patients get the best healthcare.  I again have no difficulty with that.  However, I tabled a parliamentary question to seek information on the outpatient waiting times across all specialties over five years.  That was to get a sense of where the pressure points are in University Hospital Waterford and to see if solutions were being put in place to reduce the waiting times.  In fact, the waiting times have all gone up where the pressure points are.</p> <p>  I will give some examples.  In dermatology, almost 5,000 patients were waiting to see a consultant.  Of those, 1,576 were waiting for one to two years and 665 for two to three years.  Turning to orthopaedics, which has been a problem for many years, 1,267 patients were waiting for one to two years and 959 between two and three years.  There was a major problem as well with the ear, nose and throat department waiting lists, where 2,805 patients were waiting between one and two years and 1,500 between two and three years.  Urology and dermatology similarly have problems and have done so consistently for the last five or six years.  </p> <p>  One of my functions as an Oireachtas Member, along with other local Oireachtas Members, is meeting regularly with the hospital group hospital managers.  We have a good relationship with them.  They point out to us where the pressure points are and unless capacity is increased in these areas the wait times are not going to go down.  Mr. Reid has just written to all hospital managers to state, essentially, that they should come in on budget.  Is there flexibility with that demand?  I refer to a situation where extra funding is needed to reduce waiting times in areas where there are obvious pressures and where large numbers of people have been waiting for two, three or even four years.  Is there flexibility in that case for the HSE to accept that is fair enough and allow the extra resources to be committed?</p></speech>

He mentioned that there has been an extra budget allocation for the past five or six years and the situation with waiting times has not got much better.  I do not disagree with the Deputy but that is factual.  The issue of waiting times is a priority for me in working with the system.  Directing extra funds at the problem has not actually addressed the issue.  I think that is a challenge for all of us.  I know Deputy Cullinane was involved in the development of Sl&aacute;intecare, as was the whole Oireachtas.  The challenge for all of us is that extra money has been put in for the last five or six years but that has not worked.  We have to do something different and I am committed to doing that.  I want us to look at the health system, where we fund it and how we address the service needs of the patients we are serving in a much better and different way.  Sl&aacute;intecare does set out a road map for doing that.  However, we have to start utilising our budgets in a different way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-27a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062700002#T00900"><p>There also has to be an examination of where the money goes.  I always look at things logically.  There will be different situations in different hospitals.  They will all have different needs, different geography, different capacity and different levels of expertise in different specialties.  They all have their unique characteristics.  One thing that we can logically do regarding waiting times, in Waterford and other hospitals, is to look at where the pressure points have been over a number of years.  It will then be possible to identify where the problems lie.  Solutions then have to be found and, in some of these cases, there are.</p> <p>  That brings me to the capital plan.  I think Mr. Reid had discussions on this earlier with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  A number of business cases have been made by the hospitals groups to go the hospital management to solve some of the problems.  I am trying to explore how that process works from conception to completion when a business case is made.  I have had some discussions with Mr. Breslin and Mr. Reid's predecessor in the past on, for example, a second cath lab in Waterford and a new mortuary.  The mortuary was in the capital schedule since 2013.  The money was only freed up and made available this year.  </p> <p>  Sometimes the hospitals and the hospital groups do their jobs, identify the business cases and go to the HSE.  Then we have to wait for years.  In the meantime, the waiting times go up.  I talked about ophthalmology.  There is also a business case for a new eye clinic in University Hospital Waterford.  I also spoke about orthopaedics and there is a business case for a new centre of excellence for orthopaedics which will involve moving some of the services from Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny into University Hospital Waterford.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien talked about cancer care earlier.  Six of the eight hospitals have robotic technologies that can be more precise in surgeries and as a result deliver better outcomes while cutting waiting times.  University Hospital Waterford is not one of those hospitals.  It is a cancer centre but it does not have that robotic technology.  The consultants there have sought it and they have developed business cases.</p> <p>  My question concerns how this process works.  That is the frustrating part for us as public representatives and that is where we come under pressure.  I refer to situations where business cases are developed to address obvious needs but they go through a long complicated process that sometimes takes years before change is delivered.  The mortuary in Waterford is a case in point.  Will Mr. Reid talk me through how that process regarding capital funding works from conception to delivery?</p></speech>

I apologise for not addressing it.  He asked me whether there was a mandate for managers, hospital groups and clinicians that see a need to spend extra funds for particular demands to go ahead and do it.  The answer is "No".  We work with a budget.  We are putting a monthly process in place, however, where we will be working closely with all the hospital managers groups and community.  That will allow us to be able to predict where there are extra demands and where we might be able to find some capacity.  I think that is good practice and we may be able to reallocate some funds for particular items.  I think that will be welcomed when we are talking closely.</p> <p>  Turning to the second issue, the Deputy addressed pressure points in the system where people have some good ideas.  I have been in University Hospital Waterford, University Hospital Galway, Mullingar Regional Hospital, St. Luke's General Hospital Kilkenny, Beaumont Hospital and many others.  I have seen some really good ideas and innovation at a local level.  There is some good innovation in emergency departments and in interactions between acute hospitals and community organisations.  There is also some good innovation and engagement involving general practitioners, GPs, and accident and emergency departments.  There are, therefore, many good local initiatives under way.  For me, this is not about waiting for a big bang initiative from Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need to implement these bottom-up initiatives and support them.  That is happening.  I wanted to address those remarks in respect of Deputy Cullinane's point.</p></speech>

My specific question, however, was on capital projects and the perception that they can take a lifetime from conception to delivery.  It is almost like turning a big oil tanker around.  There is a long wait for people to see delivery.  We table parliamentary questions and the responses refer to a capital project being in a queue and that there is a business case at this stage or that stage.  People get very frustrated because these are the ideas that Mr. Reid has just spoken about.  All this is, obviously, dependent on funding as well.  What I am trying to understand-----</p></speech>

If the witnesses do not have time to set it out here maybe they can send a note to the committee on what the stages are in capital applications.  We had better understand it.  A business case is developed by hospital management in conjunction with the group and I imagine that goes up to the HSE and there are all the other layers.  The health estates have their role to play as well.  That can be a frustrating process when there is a good idea so maybe the witnesses could give us a note on what that process is.  Has the question of shortening that process been looked at so that it would be made more efficient so that these good ideas can be delivered more quickly?</p></speech>

We all know that the real word that is not being used here is "profiling".  The reason Mr. Reid said that there will be a three-year plan put together is that this needs to be politically profiled.  Mr. Breslin and Mr. Reid both have one chance and one opportunity to be straight up with the public.  There cannot be an overspend on the children's hospital without it having dramatic impacts on capital planning.  It is impossible.  We are all educated and we can all do maths.  Mr. Breslin and Mr. Reid have one opportunity to be straight up and this is it.  No matter how much the witnesses have prepared for this committee collectively in the HSE and in the Department, they have this one opportunity.  As an elected representative, I am asking them on behalf of the public and on behalf of the people of Ireland, to tell us the impact this will have on capital projects across the country.  I do not want to hear the witnesses tell me that this discussion has not happened or that this analysis has not been done because there are many competent people in the HSE.  In fact, there are very competent people in the HSE who know exactly how this is impacting capital planning.  I ask the witnesses to tell us how this will impact on capital projects over the coming years.</p><p>Our guests should not hide behind the budgetary process, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and so on.  I can give examples, as we all can in all our areas, of projects that were expected to come forward in the coming years that I now know are being pushed out.  Our guests have one opportunity to tell us exactly how the overspend will affect capital planning.  For example, there is a national maternity strategy, which was begun by the previous Government but published by the current Government.  I am 100% behind the strategy, given that it is one of the best strategies I have seen for any section in healthcare.  Just &euro;5 million is needed for the planning and design of a new maternity hospital in Limerick.  My children, my brother and I were born in the current hospital.  It is not fit for purpose.  Three years after the plan was published, the &euro;5 million is still being profiled and is not available.</p><p> This is our guests' opportunity.  I ask them not to give the answers they gave previously because I do not accept them.  They should be aware that we will return to whatever they state.  This is their one opportunity to be open and honest with the public.</p></speech>

When he asked the question on the previous occasion, we had the information that in 2019, &euro;75 million of the &euro;100 million excess cost on the children's hospital would be borne by the Exchequer and &euro;25 million by held capital.  That did not have a negative effect on the timing of projects but the question in our minds at that stage was what the split would be for 2020.  As of last Tuesday, the Government has put aside a reserve of &euro;200 million, which indicates there will be sufficient Exchequer money to meet the additional costs of the children's hospital without impact on other projects.</p> <p>  That may be immediately misinterpreted that we have so much capital that everything can be done at once.  I have been around long enough to know that all capital projects take their place in a queue.  There is an overall constraint.  There is a 45% capital increase in health this year.  There is a growing budget but there will always be more projects than there is money.  For the children's hospital, to date there has not been an impact on the timing of what we can do.  The provision on Tuesday will allow us to manage forward without that impact.</p></speech>

We are three and a half years into the national maternity strategy.  The &euro;5 million should have been committed last year or the previous year.  Why has the &euro;5 million for the new maternity hospital in Limerick not been committed?  It is a small amount relative to the quantum we are discussing.  Re-profiling is happening.  No projects are being dropped or anything like it.  Rather, everything is being pushed out.  Everyone can see it.  That is just an example but I could give another ten.  The HSE, through the Department, cannot find &euro;5 million for this essential project.  It is the only hospital in the national maternity strategy located outside Dublin that needs to be completely rebuilt.  It needs to be located on the site of University Hospital Limerick.</p></speech>

It should be taken in the spirit in which it was meant.  The Department must live with what is policy but the strategy is years behind schedule.  If everything is fine, and the extra money has been found and so on, why has the project at St. Conlon's nursing home in Nenagh, which I represent, been pushed back?  I hear that it has been pushed back but perhaps, and I hope, it has not been.  Why can the &euro;5 million, which is small relative to the quantum, not be found in the algorithm?</p></speech>

Everything will be re-profiled.  The reason I asked a direct question earlier was not to try to catch anyone out but rather because the details will all become public in any event.  We know they will.  The question from a political point of view is when they will become public.  Freedom of information requests, parliamentary questions and everything else will reveal the entire matter.  That must all be done by the HSE and the Department.  They are good at their job and they have to discuss such matters.  On this date at this time, however, we cannot get an answer on a national strategy.</p></speech>

We will not move the Central Mental Hospital to a new, modern building in Portrane until next year.  There are 200 year old buildings all over the health estate.  The nature of the health estate, irrespective of the children's hospital, is that we must always pick and choose and try to prioritise.</p></speech>

As an Opposition spokesperson, I support it 100%.  That &euro;5 million cannot be found for the new maternity hospital exemplifies the problem, although I use it only as an example.

Section 39 organisations recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Health.  Why does the HSE have a practice of giving such organisations their funds, making them sign agreements that it knows relate to deficits and giving them loans for the rest of the year?  Is there a danger of some such organisations trading recklessly because of the position in which the HSE puts them, which is vulnerable because of the work they do?</p> <p>  On home help hours, I have a request rather than a question.  Will the HSE make home help demand-led, purely because it will save it a great deal of money by keeping people out of acute care, which costs multiples of the cost of home help?</p><p>The majority of people in politics would believe in that.  Is there any intention to realign the acute and non-acute groups in the HSE?  I believe it should happen.  When will the recruitment embargo end?  It was meant to end this month but now I hear it will be September.  It is causing issues that will be felt in the long term.</p><p> Who is in place in Sl&aacute;intecare and how much has been put forward in costs?  There is an obligation on the Department to keep up to date with what was decided on Sl&aacute;intecare by the Oireachtas.  Where are we with regard to status?</p></speech>

On home care, the basis to do what the Deputy is asking is to put in place a statutory entitlement, similar to the nursing home subvention scheme, and there is a lot of work under way to do this.

The Minister has proposals to do this, which he hopes to bring to the Government before the recess.  They are very much in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will mean change for some hospital groups but others are already aligned so it will not mean much change for them.  With regard to who is in place for Sl&aacute;intecare, we have a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office in the Department led by Laura Magahy.  It has published its report for the first quarter and it is about to publish its report for the second quarter.  It hit all of the milestones in the first quarter.  I do not know whether we will hit all of the milestones in the second quarter but we will get very close.  These are publicly available.</p></speech>

I am happy to provide the breakdown of the figure, and what it shows is that most of the positions are front-line facing.  We go through them in detail every month ourselves and with the hospital groups.  There is no embargo in place at present and our recruitment levels show this.  Every month for the first four months, from January through to April, on average almost 400 people were recruited.  There is significant recruitment going on.</p></speech>

We have done the analysis, looked at the populations and looked at how we would get from the current hospital groups and CHOs, some of which are not aligned.  We have a proposal on which we are consulting with other Departments and the HSE is involved.  The Minister hopes to go before the summer break.</p></speech>

It will take legislation over a couple of years before we build them into completely statutory bodies but that is very much in line with the milestones set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.</p></speech>

A huge amount of energy and work has gone into making the services what they are in some of these hospitals.  There is a fear in some that they may be aligned to different groups irrespective of the CHO area but they have established strong clinical links, whereby if a patient is admitted to Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, which is in my constituency, digital scans can be sent to consultants in Dublin to be examined and have decisions made based on them.</p></speech>

This is not what this is about.  We will always have referrals between one hospital group and another and that is working at present.  We will not try to over-engineer this but we will try to have counterparts between managers working in a hospital and in a community in the same geographical area.  This will not interfere with patients needing to move outside of those hospitals.</p></speech>

Why do we have this variation?  Why would one consultant's contract allow 0% private work while another may allow 30%?  What is the origin of this?</p></speech>

There is a series of contracts.  If we go back, the 1997 contract might have variations whereby one person is not entitled to any private practice, in which case the private practice is 0%, while somebody else is entitled to private practice in public hospitals based on the percentage of beds designated as private in the hospital, which differs in various hospitals.  We could have hospitals with percentages of 15% or 25%.  Rolling forward, many people moved from the 1997 contract to the 2008 contract but at present there are still approximately 300 people working off the old 1997 contract.  In the 2008 contract there are perhaps three or four variations.  Again, there is a contract that is public only and consultants are not entitled to get private income; there is a contract under which people can do private practice but only in the hospital; and there is another contract that allows people to do private practice off site.  All of these affect the actual monitoring of activity.  Under the 2008 contract, if people are allowed to do private practice in a public hospital, it is at 20% of total activity, so for every four patients a consultant has, he or she can have one private patient and this is monitored.  When a consultant is being assessed to see whether he or she is in breach we have to look at the contract to see what is the permitted amount.</p></speech>

How does the HSE adjudicate the level of time and the number of private patients and compare it with the number of public patients to ensure the threshold is not breached?</p></speech>

I am just saying that when I talk to managers in other hospital systems who do not have the mixing of public and private, they wonder how they hell one would ever monitor it in Ireland if that is the way it is organised.  It seems really complicated to them and they are right.</p></speech>

In terms of control, there is a monthly process involving chief clinicians and hospital managers having that discussion with consultants on their committed hours, work plans, etc.  That is a kind of local monitoring.  I fully accept that there are weaknesses in the system.  However, having spoken to clinicians in all of the hospitals I have visited in the past five weeks, there is no doubt that the commitment of the vast majority to the public system is very strong.  They work well above and beyond their contractual commitments in the public service.  I have seen them and I know the pressures they are under and the commitments they have.  While I acknowledge that, I accept fully at the same time the weaknesses of control on this.  It is something I have a discussion on everywhere I go and we will be aiming to strengthen it.</p></speech>

However, we need safeguards for the public.  We need safeguards for the HSE and the Department to ensure items like this cannot grow to excess.  When one looks at some of the reports from the Revenue Commissioners, it raises concerns.  I am concerned, looking in from the outside, at what is generating some of this.  On the procurement process, it was mentioned that 30% of a &euro;2.2 billion sample of spending was found to lack competitive tendering.</p></speech>

It is not a massive amount of money.  One then sees it jumping off the page that there is a huge level of expenditure within the envelope of the HSE that still has not gone through competitive tendering.  There is a frustration when one sees that.</p></speech>

The nature and reach of the HSE spend in terms of local and regional is significant.  As such, the plans that have been put in place have brought compliance levels up hugely.  As a public service who made recommendations to the Minister to establish the Office of Government Procurement, I am committed to public procurement processes.  I know what savings the State can make from that.  There is a bit about the spend at a lower level in the regions and how we get them into contractual commitments.  It was a very big challenge in my previous role in local government also to get the reach and compliance levels.  However, we are focused on it and accept fully that any percentage is a problem.  Regarding the plan we have, we are not at the 80% level we set out to reach.  That will certainly take us more time.  I fully accept there is an issue.  The sample of &euro;2.2 billion is quite a big spend and scale and to put the complete wrap around all of that is the challenge we are facing into.</p></speech>

The HSE seems to be delaying on delivering the conditions to house that project.  I would be grateful if Mr. Reid could follow that up for me.</p></speech>

If a woman attending an obstetrician in public hospital is in mid-examination and there is a crisis in a theatre, the obstetrician will run out the door.  I have been in that position a number of times.  I imagine while they are running out the door and getting to the theatre to save somebody's life it is very difficult to quantify whose time it is on.  I agree it is difficult to separate the two when a patient is depending on the professional to come to their rescue in the public system.  However, it is of concern to this committee that it would be left to people's own honesty to follow up on breaches of the contract, irrespective of what mix of a contract people have.</p> <p>  Based on today's submission, I note the cost of claims to the State have increased in recent years.  I am referencing the clinical indemnity scheme.  In 2016, it was &euro;61 million; in 2017 it was &euro;88 million.  Am I right?  No, it was much more.  On the clinical indemnity scheme it was &euro;2.8 billion, an increase of 17% on the previous year.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As the witnesses will know I am also a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  Why have open disclosure, mediation and the different practices that are supposed to reduce the costs not had an effect on the figures?  Has the Department just not done anything yet?</p></speech>

One is the maturity of the scheme.  There were previously insurance arrangements in place.  As it takes over from those insurance arrangements, in insurance and particularly in clinical indemnity insurance, there is a long tail to lots of the claims.  So they could take five or ten years to work their way through the system.  We are now building up towards a plateau of the State Claims Agency having the likely number of claims - a full book of claims - at this stage.  We have been going through that period.</p> <p>  The other thing that has been happening is that the awards have been changing and in many cases have been increasing, particularly the interest rate.  There was a change in the interest rate for lifetime awards which had a big effect.</p> <p>  The last question then, which is where the Deputy is-----</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.</p> <p>  What is the annual cost of CervicalCheck?  I am talking about the entity that is CervicalCheck from the time it was established to last year.  What was the annual spend for that?  The witnesses may not have this to hand.  I am talking about staffing costs, the running of the building and also the contract costs to the different labs.  I do not need to know the amount for each lab.  I am looking for a figure for the bill for the work.</p> <p>  Having sat through more than a year of this, I have concerns that by the looks of things there was no quality assurance and no governance.  Everybody was moving around different jobs and we cannot find out who was where and when.  Other than sending out a reminder letter, I find it really hard to know what people in CervicalCheck have been doing for the past ten years.  How much was it costing to allow them to do whatever they were doing there?  Although I am very supportive of the Scally report, that does not answer everything.  All it does is lay out to us in black and white some of the questions we have had for the past year.  It does not fix any of the historical issues.  While I am very happy to draw a line in the sand and move on to HPV vaccination and eradicate cervical cancer and associated cancers, this committee needs to identify what was going on for ten years so that it never happens again either here or elsewhere.</p></speech>

It may have been going on forever but I was unaware of it.  On the leasing ones, when were those arrangements made and what are the contract arrangements?</p><p>Is it a 25-year lease?  Is it a ten-year lease?  Perhaps we could have detail on that.  It is of interest to the public.  When one looks at a building and sees "HSE" over the door, either as a client or as a taxpayer, one assumes that is where the money is going.  If we could have that quantified, it would be useful for the committee.</p><p> I refer to claims against the State, probably, for next week as well.  Hospital consultants have made much commentary lately on pay restoration.  As Mr. Breslin will be aware, many consultants have left the system, which has been a challenge.  I refer to the brain drain due to the recession.  I am quite concerned by the increase in claims against the State and increase in locum use.  Is there any data to suggest that there is a correlation between the increase in litigation when one has a more fluid workforce rather than the standard?  Has the Department any data to show it is dangerous or more dangerous to the outcomes for patients not to have regular staff who are working all the time in a particular hospital?  Has the Department done any work on that?</p></speech>

I cannot say that that has been identified but let us stand back from it and ask what do we understand good quality healthcare to be.  It is generally based on multidisciplinary teams that develop a relationship over time and perform in a way where they know what the skills within the team are.  Undoubtedly, if the Deputy is asking what is the preference, it is to have permanent staff working in a continuous relationship with their colleagues.  That is in the literature more than in the data but that is a fair conclusion to draw.</p></speech>

If the system that has been created by whoever we want to blame for it has led to staff perhaps having the ideal qualifications and ticking the boxes in terms of employment but not being on the ground keeping an eye on things, and if that is having a negative impact on outcomes for patients and claims against the State, which we will deal with next week, it is a ridiculous equation.  I cannot see why we would fail to try to address that.  If the solution is permanent consultant staff who are happy to be paid, it seems an obvious course of action.</p> <p>  Finally, there are orphan drugs.  Mr. Reid mentioned the cost of the PCRS and so on.  In terms of a re-evaluating point for drugs that have been approved such as Orkambi, Spinraza and some of the more expensive drugs, I accept Spinraza has only been approved.  Those are merely two examples off the top of my head.  Is there any scope in the future, especially with drugs that did not necessarily meet the criteria of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, for re-evaluating the provision these drugs?  Regarding the patient cohorts, is there a five-year or ten-year review process built in to see are we getting value for money?  When something is approved, it is approved for ever?  What if new data came out?</p></speech>

We can give the Deputy examples of them.</p> <p>  We are continuously approving budgets.  On the criteria that the Deputy set out in the drugs process, the team who are involved that she mentioned provide a great service for us in terms of evaluation but, obviously, Spinraza, which she mentioned, was one on which we made a decision based on the benefits in that case and how we would do it, and we have made that decision.  It is one with a significant cost.</p> <p>  On the assessment of them over time because, as the Deputy knows well, new drugs come on board, there is an ongoing assessment of the total spend we make through the PCRS and what other drugs are coming on stream that might help us mitigate some of those costs.  We have very good data from the PCRS team, in terms of drugs and the usage of them, and the distribution of them as well.  There is good data.  It is an ongoing process.</p></speech>

If one gives somebody something, it is difficult to take it off them.  My question is, if new data emerges that shows that the efficacy is less than what it was at the start, is there any process to pull back on a drug that may have been approved for whatever other reasons it was approved?  Once the horse is out, it is gone.</p></speech>

There was a deficit in IT systems.  Some funding was made available to address that.  Where are we in that regard?  If I remember correctly, we were told there were seven different ledgers.

It takes a long time to take a project as big as this through public procurement, but in the meantime we have upgraded what we might call the HSE's corporate reporting system.  That assists us in taking data from all the different voluntary agencies that give us data and from our own legacy systems.  That was done in the last six to nine months.  On the western seaboard we have also installed the SAP ECC 6.0 system in both the mid-west and north west statutory areas and in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin.  We refer to that as "stabilisation", but those are entities of between &euro;300 million and &euro;400 million, between &euro;700 million and &euro;800 million and &euro;140 million, respectively.  Those are quite big implementation projects.  Those three upgrades have been done.  More and more of the HSE is now on a single system.  We have also improved the system that draws the data.

There are a series of milestones.  After we appoint the external third-party firm by the end of this year we will work for between 12 and 15 months to design, build and test at a national level.  We have to build a single national system and test it.  Then we will deploy it.  By the end of 2022 we will have deployed across the first 40% of the health system by value.  We will deploy across the entire east and then move out from there.  A very detailed end-to-end plan has been drawn up, with a summary of the milestones along the way.  The ICT capital committed to this programme is worth &euro;82 million.  At this point I do not have any concerns about the funding capacity to deliver the programme.</p></speech>

Some are our own systems and some are those of the voluntary agencies, which are separate legal entities.  By the time we are finished we should have about 50 of the larger voluntary agencies on a single healthcare system.  At the moment there is no single set of standard processes.  We will try to clean the data that comes from those processes and we will probably spend too much time trying to make sure it is as accurate as possible.  However, we do not have sufficient capacity to get good quality insight into the data and use our accountants' time to assist with decision support.  We spend a disproportionate amount of time gathering the data and trying to clean it up and make it as comparable as possible, but it comes from disparate systems.  We need processes based on a single standard that are operated in a standard way.  We also need to expand our own shared services.  That should give us data of a much better quality, which we can turn into high-quality financial reports to assist with decision-making.</p></speech>

I am very concerned by some things that have been brought to my attention by people working on the site.  I refer to the management of the site and the degree of waste.  Could the witnesses tell me anything about the oversight that is in place and who is carrying it out?  I am quite concerned by reports of really wasteful practices.  I hear of works being done, dug up and done again, which suggests very poor site management.  This may well be limited to a part of the site, but we are certainly hearing about it.  There is also an issue around subcontractors.  It will be important to hear from them.  Is there a mechanism that will allow  issues of concern to be brought to the HSE's attention?</p></speech>

It has a team in place.  Part of the design team is also monitoring the site.  Everything has to go through an employer's representative from the main contractor.  There is certainly monitoring and surveillance, but if people are aware of issues I encourage them to contact the board.  Issues should already be identified by the board through its presence on the site.  However, if a taxpayer or a member of the public wonders why something is being done or thinks it does not look right, he or she should contact the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, ask if it is aware of the issue and ask what it is doing about it.  I would encourage that.  If Deputies have any concerns, I will be very happy to pass the information on.</p></speech>

Is it that kind of arrangement?  They should see any problems themselves.</p></speech>

On foot of the mobilisation for this phase of the project, the resources on site on the purchaser's side were increased substantially.  This was done to make sure that as the works got underway, enough people were monitoring the site on a daily basis.  They are present full time rather than visiting the site.</p><p>Matters would come to their attention and they would address them speedily.  That is important because, although a large amount of risk has transferred to the contractor, there is always a tendency for a contractor to lodge a claim.  Therefore, a proactive approach that sees an issue and addresses it with the contractor before it reaches that point is much preferable to leaving things and hoping they will not arise in the future.</p><p> I am very happy to take any particular information and pass it on.  I will certainly be raising it with the development board, in light of what the Deputy has said, so they can be fully satisfied they have enough procedure in place to identify issues, and also have procedure so that, if there are people who have an interest in it and want to raise issues, they are able to do that.</p></speech>

It cannot be that kind of culture and they have to be assured it will not be that kind of culture if they come forward.  People will not come forward if they feel they may not get any more work on the site, and so on.  Goodwill can be ruined by not having that kind of culture, so it is very important that is the case.</p></speech>

It should be the culture not just on the development board but on the part of the contractor that if somebody suggests something that could be improved upon, that would be part of a collective effort to bring this project to a conclusion on time and on budget.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

If this was substantially covered while I was not present, the Chairman might tell me because I do not want to go over ground that has been covered.  The majority of section 38 agencies were non-compliant or not fully compliant with public procurement.  What are we doing about that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-27a.692" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062700002#PP00500"><p>The review identified that almost all of the section 38s reviewed would not have been compliant.  The framework we have in place now, where they make a return each year with their compliance statements, requires the boards of these organisations to review their procurement practices and make a declaration in that regard.  It is quite a binary test, in other words, one is either compliant or non-compliant, and there is no such thing as being substantially compliant.  This means the numbers in terms of compliance are quite low.  However, in monitoring the compliance from the point at which we did the review, we believe there have been significant improvements, first, in terms of the boards' own awareness of public procurement rules and understanding of what the obligations are in terms of spending public money, and, second, the control systems they are putting in place.</p> <p>  In terms of what HSE is doing about it, our own HBS, or health business services, procurement service is engaging with all of the section 38s affected, and it is running seminars and training sessions with them in terms of bringing their staff up to speed around procurement.  We have also made available to them the PAS procurement system, which shows all of the contracts that are in place for both the HSE and the Office of Government Procurement around the kind of goods and services they procure.</p> <p>  While the numbers look quite startling and most would be non-compliant, we believe they are on a journey towards being compliant.  Indicative of that would be that the number of organisations that have declared themselves compliant since the review has gone down, and they are saying they are non-compliant.  While that might seem perverse, it is simply becasue they have a heightened awareness of what it means to be compliant or not.  We think that is a journey towards actually improving over time.  As we establish the contract management support units, CMSUs, that will assist them in this regard. </p></speech>

It sounds like addiction recovery: "We are on a journey".  Anyway, we will watch this space.

There is a whole range of issues across all of the section 38s, and individual reports and then a composite report were done.  This demonstrated a whole range of areas where there is compliance and non-compliance with what would be good practice.  Following that, they have all come back through our teams to set out their action plans against each of those areas.</p></speech>

However, if it is a journey we are on in regard to the section 38s, the HSE too seems to be on a journey in terms of righting the wrongs.  It needs to have a mechanism to ensure that, where a service, product or otherwise is being provided at the best possible value for money, there is no internal ownership that would leave a grubby complexion.  As part of the journey we are on, we need to come up with a mechanism to ensure people declare that and to ensure it is known, so the process is above reproach.</p></speech>

The country is too small and everybody has a first cousin working somewhere.  I am talking about situations where they might not have direct responsibility but they might have worked alongside the person in the health service who does have direct responsibility for 30 years and as no procurement process is being followed, therefore a company can be asked to do something on the basis that it is a good company.  I know Mr. Mulvany is not able to answer the question and that there is no evidence to suggest wrongdoing but as part of the journey we are on, there will need to be a mechanism whereby that sort of thing would not be allowed or in circumstances where there is only one provider that it would have to be declared so that the arrangement would be above reproach and that there is value for money.</p></speech>

It does not necessarily have to be a level 8.  The Garda Commissioner, Mr. Drew Harris, was before another committee last night and it is a bit like him saying that we have all the laws in place, and there is no need for a police force.  Obviously, in practice, that does not work so I think we need something a little bit more robust than there being a policy and therefore nobody is breaking it.  I suggest that as part of what is a difficult journey with such a large organisation.  It is coming up all the time that it might be embraced.</p> <p>  I will focus on local issues for a moment, as something came up locally which highlighted something that could be potentially worrying.  Is there a section 38 organisation called Inspire Wellbeing, or is it a section 39 organisation?</p></speech>

The person had a particular need and was moved to a different part of the country.  The family is not happy with the location in which the person is housed and has been to'ing and fro'ing with the HSE to get that solved.  I made an inquiry and got a nice response back from the general manager of disability services in the relevant area.  It was suggested to me that the individual, who is a single person, was being held in Mulroy Park, Carrigart, County Donegal.  The matter was subject to a court case lately on foot of an attempt to have the person relocated to the person's home county to be near the family.  It was suggested to me that the rent being paid for the property in Carrigart, County Donegal was &euro;600,000 per annum.  I made the person repeat it about 50 times to me because as a former auctioneer it struck me as being on the scale of the Miesian Plaza as opposed to Carrigart, County Donegal.  The response that came back was that the HSE does not rent the property, as referenced by me.  It went on to say that it had sourced Inspire Wellbeing.  What I would like to know is whether it is the case that we are resourcing a section 39 organisation to the extent that it can afford to pay rent of &euro;600,000 per year to look after one person, or is the information false?</p></speech>

I do not wish to mention names, although I have permission from the relevant people whom I have not identified, so should they be identified I am covered.  Perhaps Mr. Mulvany could check with the general manager of disability services in CH01.  I specifically asked about the case.  I accept the information I received was anecdotal.  How could it possibly be true that we would be associated with paying &euro;600,000 a year, albeit for a specialist property or whatever it is, but it would be nowhere near that level?</p></speech>

I do not know whether the sum is for a building or the entire fee for looking after a client, but that is a different discussion.</p></speech>

I do not want to be sensationalist but the response I got was just a little bit silent in the sense that it said we are not renting the property and we engage X company to look after this person.  If the specific needs demand such a high amount of money then so be it, but it was communicated to me that an obscene rent was being paid for the property and that the taxpayer was funding it, perhaps through the section 39 organisation.  If we are, we are crazy, because on a ten-year lease that is &euro;6 million and I am sure we could build ten facilities that we would own.</p></speech>

I am sure the company is above reproach.  Perhaps I have been given false information.  I just wanted to get clarification.  It would not have arisen back that far.  This happened in 2018 or even in early 2019.  I will give the witnesses a copy of the response from their colleague and they can come back to me with a more detailed note because it would be a worry if that were the case.</p> <p>  I have one other question which, again, is a bit local.  It is about infrastructure.  As the witnesses are aware, in the north-west area the Daughters of Wisdom built Cregg House in 1965 and provide care to those with severe to profound intellectual disability.  They carried out a tremendous service over the years.  More recently, it evolved into the HSE providing the service and the HSE agreed to lease the property until 2020.  Cregg House is now for sale on the open market for what I consider to be a very modest guide price, which is not to say that it could not go much higher, depending on what the open market dictates.  From local knowledge and having been an auctioneer and valuer, for the HSE to replicate what is on that site would cost between &euro;25 million and &euro;50 million.  I do not expect the HSE to declare an interest to all the other competitors who may perhaps be interested in buying this property but from a common-sense perspective the HSE nationally should examine future needs.  We are de-segregating residential settings to community settings but from my experience in the constituency one size does not fit all.  Some people still need a campus setting.  I would hate the HSE and the State to lose the opportunity to buy something which would cost infinitely more if it was seeking to provide it.  I do not expect the HSE witnesses to put anything on the record today but perhaps somebody would come back to me in private or at another time and give an indication to me one way or another.</p></speech>

My interest is in the care of the people and this piece of infrastructure, while it is not perfect and perhaps needs work, at the guide price, plus whatever adjustments the HSE might want to make to bring it up to new standards, would be nothing compared to going to a greenfield site to build a facility.

The Deputy can put another zero on that figure.</p> <p>  On where the pressure has been in the first quarter, the breakdown is between the acute hospitals which have had significant pressures on them, and their service pressures are increased on last year and there are community pressures, with significant demands on home support packages, and step-down services. </p> <p>  On the specific question of what will happen for the rest of the year, as we outlined this morning, we are setting out for all the senior budget holders - managers in the acute hospitals and in the community organisation - a month by month profile for the rest of the year that aims to bring them in on target.  That is the process that we are undertaking.  We are saying that we cannot sustain the level of overrun which happened last year, I agree with the Deputy.  This quarter, or the first four months even, is better than last year, but there is still an overrun and it is not something we can sustain for the rest of the year.  </p></speech>

There was a challenge earlier about continuing to meet the service demands and the pressures on us but our commitment is to deliver the service plan that has been committed to, both to our acute hospitals and community services, and live within our budget.  That is why we are looking ahead, month by month, at actual spend limits by each hospital manager, group and community organisation.  That is the process we have in place.  If there are certain service demands or pressures above and beyond that - such as current homecare packages where we have demands that are above and beyond even the extra budget we received last year - we are holding to our budget and our commitment that almost 17.5 million hours have been committed, to over 53,000 people for homecare packages; we aim to live within that budget.  There are another 6,500 people who are currently looking for enhanced packages, that is extra hours, or new homecare packages but we are aiming to hold it within the budget we have to meet those difficult service pressures.</p></speech>

I think our spend per person is way up there compared with other OECD countries, but are we getting the value for money for the amount invested?  Every year it increases by millions yet there seems to be no improvement of services, and there are still waiting lists.  One would imagine that when one allocates millions extra every year it would relieve the pressure, not add to it, yet more money is spent and there is less progress and less value for money.</p></speech>

The HSE has had continual extra allocations of budget and we are still under the service pressures that we have been under for several years.  If we stand back from that, if we keep putting more money into the current way we deliver the services we will keep getting the same answer.</p></speech>

It is more money for the same level of service.  Why is this happening?  Where is the waste?  If the HSE gets money, it should give value for it, and the waiting lists should be shortened and so on.  We do not seem to be getting there.  It is more money for the same service or less, rather than an improvement.  There must be a reason for this.</p></speech>

Currently, we have very stretched acute hospitals, emergency departments and waiting lists, and the community services are also stretched.  The Sl&aacute;intecare process and the strategy and vision it sets out is to have much more integrated care, so it reduces pressure on the acute side and increases capacity on the community side.  One challenge that I have set out with the team is to hold our budget for this year; aim to use the better funds we have more wisely; examine any activities or services that do not add value to the front line and stop them and ensure that the money is going to the front line where we need it while separately working with our colleagues in the Department and the Government; and laying out the requirement for investment, which Sl&aacute;intecare sets out, but with a new and different way of delivering services.</p></speech>

We are trying to recruit more.  That will all cost more money.  Doctors and GPs are becoming more scarce around the country.  We are trying to attract them but there are parishes which would normally have one, two or three doctors, or a primary care centre that do not have any.  How will we pay all these extra staff and live within the budget?  How can the HSE marry those two things?</p></speech>

In the first quarter, we recruited more than 1,100 people.  We were running at just less than 400 per month over the first three months of the year.  A lot of recruitment is taking place in the organisation.</p></speech>

Is the figure known for what it would cost if every hospital had the doctors, nurses and health professionals that it needed?</p></speech>

That determines the numbers of personnel.  During the economic difficulties and downturn there was no room for recruitment.  We are playing catch up, particularly in some hospitals and community organisations, which is required.  We cannot keep recruiting at the current level.  This year's budget allows for certain recruitment of staff.  We have not put an embargo in place, we have said that people and areas will continually recruit once the budget is available and once it is an approved position within the service plan.  We need to focus purely on those positions and ensure that we do not recruit in other areas which do not have the budget.</p></speech>

I could name maybe ten projects in the Kilkenny area, alone, including a project in St. Columba's hospital which is supposed to come on stream in 2021, and a primary care centre in Thomastown.  What will be the effect?  No one can tells us.  The Minister could not tell the D&aacute;il today what would or would not be affected in plans for health.  Something has to suffer.  Something must be thrown out.  If there will be a &euro;0.5 billion overrun something will have to be removed from Project 2040.  Who decides what will be removed and who will suffer because of the overrun in the children's hospital?</p></speech>

It is about &euro;640 million.  A large proportion, approximately 75%, of that is contractually committed so there is a very reduced flexibility after that.  Our second challenge is the national children's hospital, as the Deputy just mentioned, and the impact that has had on the overall national capital budget and the implication that has for the HSE.</p><p>The discussion that the HSE and the Department have had has been about what level of funding would be required from the HSE to support the extra investment needed in the children's hospital and what implications that will have on the HSE's capital budget.</p></speech>

They have not worked under the 2008 contract.  They cannot avail of the terms of the settlement.  If somebody who is still on the 1997 contract wants to move on to the 2008 contract, there is a procedure where that person applies to the HSE for a contract change, which is assessed and can be done.</p></speech>

Given that they are pre-2008 consultants, they are some of the most experienced consultants in some of the hospitals.  They took the view that the 2008 agreement was not being honoured and so they did not sign up to it.  Now that it is being honoured, at what point do they come in?  We might have to get more detailed information from the witnesses.</p><p>I have seen charts and schedules, and I see about 95 types of pay rate, depending on the three contract types and where someone is in their progression.  It is highly confusing.  Some consultants have made the case that older, more experienced people, who had not previously signed up to the 2008 agreement, who effectively interviewed and hired some of the newer ones, and are more senior in the hospital, are going to end up on a lower pay rate because they are only signing up to the 2008 agreement now.</p></speech>

The HSE will have to look at some of the applications and see how they do this.  Those consultants did not sign up to the 2008 contract even before this issue arose.  They chose not to move on to that contract in 2008 when it was expected that there would be increases.  The question now arises of how they would be treated if they were to move across to the new contract.  The HSE would have to look at that and first decide if it will agree to the contract change.  The likelihood is, if someone wanted to move on to a 2008 contract, so long as it is equivalent and they are not moving from no private practice to private practice, the HSE would probably look favourably on it.  It would then have to determine, based on the circumstances of that individual, where is an appropriate point for them to be placed.  To my knowledge, that has not happened yet.</p></speech>

It is the law and the health Acts allow this, but the Comptroller and Auditor General would not have highlighted if he did not feel it merited highlighting.  Changing the deficit from the year from &euro;283 million down to &euro;86 million is a very substantial change in the bottom line for the year's activities.  It might not seem big in the context of the &euro;15 billion health budget, but is significant when we look at the bottom line and the surplus.  That is why people would be concerned about that, so I ask the witnesses to send us the note on both those things.</p> <p>  I will move on to the State Claims Agency and I will work from some of the accounts in front of us.  There is a short note there on page nine.  First, the National Treasury Management Agency will be appearing before this committee next week, and a large part of that meeting will focus on the State Claims Agency and medical negligence.  We need the most senior people from the witnesses' sides, whoever they are, to be here for that.  I am talking to the HSE and the Department today, and to the NTMA next week, because we feel the demarcation lines are part of the problem, in that they make it nobody's problem.  The Department sends things off to the HSE and what comes back is nothing to do with it and is outside its control.  The State Claims Agency is trying to gather information, but is not on the front line where the accidents are occurring, so those boundaries are not ultimately helpful.  Because the HSE passes it over there is not enough ownership of the problem.  It receives a bill every so often and sends the State Claims Agency a cheque for a few hundred million euro each year.  I know that does come out of the HSE's budget, but the HSE might feel the pain of the payments more if they were being managed internally to a greater extent.  There has not been enough learning here. We are asking this now, because the meeting next week would not be useful without the HSE's liaison people with the State Claims Agency.  I will leave that to the witnesses, but we want to gave a productive meeting.  We started our work on the State Claims Agency a year ago, and we said we would come back to it after its financial statements, which we will have next week.  We want to look at the State Claims Agency and medical negligence is the biggest element of that, and that comes under the witnesses' Department, so I am flagging that.</p> <p>  The HSE's accounts show that the outstanding balance for medical negligence is &euro;2.792 billion, which is a phenomenal amount.  During the year, the HSE paid out &euro;318 million.  What was the value of the new claims that came in?  I know the State Claims Agency makes its judgment on how much cases are going to be worth, and in the HSE's accounts it only shows what was paid out, but there is no reference to that figure.  Who knows that figure?</p></speech>

That is what was booked out, but what was the value of the claims received during the course of the year?  I am worried because it is escalating year-on-year, and that is why we are looking at it.

These data in note 11, collate what was physically settled and paid in the year on a pay-as-you-go basis, which is how this scheme operates.  The &euro;2.792 billion estimated contingent liability is based on the State Claims Agency's actuarial position at our statement of financial position date.  That is a cumulative total based on if it became nuclear and we had to find the money, so that is the estimate of what we would potentially have to pay out.  I can certainly go back and get that figure in order to determine what new claims would be included in that database.</p></speech>

In other words, the HSE had a figure at the beginning of the year from the previous year's accounts, &euro;318 million was paid out or settled.  I do not know the value datum recorded on that, but it is gone out of the system, and new figures have come in giving a total of &euro;2.79 billion, a figure is missing there.</p></speech>

We are reassured that it is not because of our level of incidents or claims, especially catastrophic claims, is outside international norms.  It is more to do with the overall claims profile and how the legal and insurance systems work as opposed to the risk aspect.  We are highly focused on managing clinical incidents and clinical risk, aside from any question about the budget.</p></speech>

I hope that will prove the point you are making, Mr. Mulvany.  The Committee of Public Accounts cannot make a judgment without seeing the information.  I think you are getting a feel for where we are coming at for next week.  It could be useful work on the part of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have been at it slowly for some time.  That is the position with the State Claims Agency.</p> <p>  How much does the agency ask for?  How much does the HSE provide for in the year?  A letter was released recently under a freedom of information request to the HSE.  The letter was to Ms O'Connor from Greg Dempsey of the Department of Health on the 2019 HSE national service plan.  It was dated 20 December 2018.  This is presumably on the website - I got a copy of it there.  The letter refers to amendments to the service plan that the Department has requested the HSE to make.  The first point was that the Department requested that the funding for the State Claims Agency be reduced by &euro;20 million while the nursing home support scheme and the fair deal scheme would be increased by the same amount.  Can someone from the Department of Health explain why the Department asked that question, given that we know the cost of claims are going up every year?  I came here years ago and we were at &euro;1.5 billion.  The figure has been going up by several hundred million euro every year.  The figure is now almost &euro;3 billion.  Why would the Department issue a letter on that basis?  The heading refers to amendments required in advance of formal approval of the national service plan 2019.  I have given the date.  The letter was released under the freedom of information process.  It is a public document.  The letter requested that the funding for the State Claims Agency be reduced by &euro;20 million when in fact the Department knows that payments are going in the opposite direction.  The idea was to put an extra &euro;20 million into the fair deal scheme.  Can the Department officials explain the thinking behind that?</p></speech>

One thing we did as we got to the end of the year was look at how the State Claims Agency turned out at the end of the year.  In doing that, it turned out a little better.  We still boosted the figure by &euro;40 million coming into this year.  Actually, in the HSE year-to-date budget reporting - touch wood - we are not showing a deficit on the State Claims Agency.

We had it on stand-by for the end of March.  It involves a reciprocal healthcare arrangement.  It is provided for in the legislation we have introduced through the Houses.  There is a reciprocal health care arrangement between ourselves and the UK.  This means the entitlements that people currently enjoy as a result of the UK being an EU member state will survive a no-deal Brexit.  The reason is that we have a common travel area going back many years.  We are going to be able to continue to have the flow of people, labour and tourists, between the jurisdictions.  We have also built in provisions such that we have the ability to operate the cross-border directive.  The UK has said that it will facilitate this.  If people want to go to a hospital in Liverpool, then the Irish taxpayer can pay for it.  I am uncertain whether the UK will want to reciprocate and send people to Ireland, but we will do it in that direction.</p></speech>

We are familiar with it.</p> <p>  Talk to me briefly about one thing that is totally confusing for every member of the public.  I am referring to the different regions the HSE operates.  There are community healthcare organisation regions, hospital regions and hospital group regions.  It is utterly confusing.  It makes no sense.  Who is going to do something about that?  Does it matter?</p></speech>

It is not a model we would design the way it is, to state the obvious.  There are six hospital groups plus the children's hospital group.  Then there are nine community healthcare organisations.  Sl&aacute;intecare sets out a different path to have single integrated care organisations.  As the Secretary General pointed out earlier, that is a process the Minister is working through in terms of bringing proposals or outlining proposals for Government.  Only one area is aligned by hospital group and community group.  That is not the way we want it for the future.</p><p>If one hospital group is dealing with two or three community groups, it can be difficult.  Notwithstanding that, there are good examples, as I said earlier, of the acute organisations working closely with community organisations at local level, which is where we see better impacts.  However, the system we have is not how we would have designed it organisationally.</p></speech>

There tends to be as assumption that the charge hits on 1 January but, as I understand it, it is spread out over the 12 months.  It is absorbed over a period.

What would have happened to the delivery of health services if that additional funding had not been given?  Is it the case that the provision of those services had been predicated heretofore on the assumption of receipt of a large Supplementary Estimate?  Had we not received the corporation tax bonanza, the Oireachtas might not have been able to allocate those additional moneys.  I agree with Mr. Reid that the HSE needs to live within its budget, though others might disagree, but I am wondering what would happen to the delivery of services if the executive were obliged to adhere to its Estimate.  The silence from the witnesses suggests they might be thinking, "Perish the thought".  That gives rise to the question of whether we are being presented with genuine Estimates and if there is always an expectation of a back door to additional funding.  It is not good for the HSE or the Department of Health to seek more money every year.</p> <p>  On a related matter, it came up in correspondence to the committee last week that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is now involved in a budgetary oversight group or committee.  Is that the Cabinet sub-committee that issues quarterly reports or some other committee?  We were going to write to the HSE to inquire what the new monitoring system referred to in the correspondence comprises.  Will the witnesses clarify what is involved?</p></speech>

One of these was the establishment of a new health budget oversight group, which is an official group that meets on a monthly basis.  We also receive monthly financial management reports based on the Cabinet committee briefings.  In addition, an arrangement is in place whereby the Department of Health gives a memorandum to Government on a quarterly basis outlining the financial management for the health sector.  The budget oversight group is chaired at assistant secretary level by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and includes representatives from that Department, the Department of Health and the HSE.  We have met five times so far and are due to meet again next week.  The purpose of the group is to facilitate a timely flow of information and to act as an early warning mechanism.  It was established in consequence of the provision of the Supplementary Estimate last year and the budgetary implications of that additional allocation.</p></speech>

As I said, we only heard about it last week.  This committee submitted a recommendation previously that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should engage with the Departments that consistently have a pattern of requiring substantial Supplementary Estimates.  The response we had from the Minister last week mentioned the oversight committee to which Ms Mulvihill referred.  Will she provide the committee with a more detailed note on the full membership and so on?</p></speech>

Ms Mulvihill said that the new oversight group will function as an early warning system to prevent shocks, which brings to mind what happened with the national children's hospital last autumn.  I presume part of the group's remit relates to capital expenditure. When the escalating costs of the hospital project became apparent, somebody in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said, "Hang on, we cannot run our lives getting shocks like this every so often; we need our foot in there."  Whoever that was did the right thing.  We are always talking about the need for joined-up thinking in government.  If the witnesses think there is a political innuendo in my question, they do not need to address that.  My point is that in light of what happened with the national children's hospital last year and what happened with the Supplementary Estimates, I fully endorse the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in doing that.</p></speech>

However, reforms relating to capital expenditure were set out in the context of the establishment of the projects office within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is a project tracker, for example, and revisions to the spending code are to be introduced shortly.  There are different monitoring arrangements for capital expenditure.  The budget oversight group is concerned predominantly with current spending, with the focus on seeing where expenditure is versus allocations, seeking to realise the savings that underpin the national service plan, and monitoring staff and pay numbers.</p></speech>

I am making that suggestion, to which we will return later.  Will the witnesses send us a note setting out what they have said and elaborating on it?  It is the first time this new mechanism has been described at an Oireachtas committee meeting.  It is welcome and should be put on the record.</p> <p>  My next question relates to staff in section 38 and section 39 organisations.  I understand the split across the sector is two thirds HSE staff to one third non-HSE staff.  There is a figure in the documents of 76,000 employees at the end of 2018 and another figure of 41,000.  If I am reading it right, there are 25,000 staff in voluntary sector acute services and 16,000 in non-acute services.  Can the witnesses provide a breakdown among section 38 and 39 organisations, or are the latter included in the numbers at all?</p></speech>

The first six months of them have been published.  The HSE internal audit unit routinely releases HSE internal audit reports biannually under freedom of information.  Some 75 of them are currently being examined for release and it is expected it will be by July.  I know we had several cases before where the reports could not be released.  It was the one relating to the Console charity.  The HSE did not release it and we did not want to, even with Oireachtas privilege.  At the time the HSE stated that if it had carried out the audit with the knowledge it would have to publish it, it might have written it up differently.  Has the HSE changed the structure or the format of its reports?  Are they suitably anodyne that they are all publishable?  Is all the hard stuff left out? </p></speech>

It does not go through every report.  The national director for internal audit would bring key reports to the attention of the committee, particularly those where there would be systemic concerns that might have high risk.  If there are findings which are non-systemic, they would probably not be considered by the committee.  They are very specific to a particular organisation.  The real concern for the audit committee would be those which would have a wider relevance across the organisation.  The national director goes through those at a high level with the committee and members can raise any questions they want.</p></speech>

The former CEO said he was not aware of the issue until he saw a report of the court case on television either on the day of the meeting or the previous day.  On page 178, there is a paragraph on risk management which states that as a result of the issues identified by the Scally report in the area of risk management, the HSE established a working group, which is detailed in the section.  It states that the group's mandate is to prepare proposals in regard to risk management in the HSE for consideration by the incoming board risk committee.  It appears the HSE's risk register did not pick up on this issue in advance.  Who can speak about improvements to the HSE risk register?  What will be the next issue to arise?  The CervicalCheck issue did not appear on the risk register because once that case was lodged, it was passed over to the State Claims Agency on the basis that the HSE was finished with the matter and would send a cheque to the State Claims Agency when it had a figure for costs.  The reason for having a risk register is to learn from past mistakes and prevent future issues arising.  That was a by-product in this case.  If the CervicalCheck cases has been managed internally to some extent, there would have been a greater awareness of the issues long before they became public.  They should have been on the HSE's risk register before the High Court case.  That is an observation.  Can anyone comment on that?  The witnesses get the point.</p></speech>

The only thing I would say about that point is that in my view the issue around disclosure in CervicalCheck and the introduction of an audit, the purpose of which, at a point, would have yielded information and then a decision as to whether that should be disclosed - ultimately a decision to disclose it and then not to actually do so - was a risk before ever a claim would be lodged.  If one was doing proper risk management across a screening programme, that is an area where one would identify a risk and put it on one's risk register.  Whatever about at the top level of the HSE, within the screening service it should have been on the risk register before ever a court case was taken and we ended up where we were.  It is a big ask for the health service to have the foresight to actually see risks before it sees claims but that is the ask.  It is to look through the business it is involved in and ask where the vulnerabilities and weaknesses are and what could go wrong, and to proactively manage those so that it does not have claims.  I hear the point the Chairman is making.  When the claim then comes in, one gets a warning sign very quickly and if it is not on one's risk register, one gets it on to one's risk register.  Properly managing risk within a healthcare environment requires one to identify risk much earlier than when a claim is lodged.</p></speech>

There has been quite a lot of work on that.  The risk committee has been working in quite a different way in that it has been meeting.  To go back to the Chairman's point about being able to spot the things in the system that are of concern and that might keep any of us awake at night, the risk committee has been meeting with national directors looking at where the vulnerabilities are in the system to see how it can then support services in terms of risk management.</p> <p>  The other point is that we have been focusing more attention on how we develop our risk register in terms of more regular reviews.  There was a time when once the risk register was done, people moved on.  We have been working with national directors and their teams to use risk registers more as a working document in terms of proactive management of situations as they are arising.  The emphasis has been changing.  A group is working now on trying to devise a new approach to risk management.  Presumably, that will be discussed with the incoming board as well.</p></speech>

We would like to see the ratio of legal fees versus the actual settlements because the figure is running very high.  I ask for a breakdown of the figure by type.  As Mr. Mulvany said, commercial disputes may have accounted for some of the costs.</p> <p>  To go back one page, there is a figure for IT consultancy costs of &euro;2.3 million and a figure for other consultancy costs of &euro;23.529 million.

I will link this to the next question.  I received a phone call over the lunch break to say the HSE direct home help staff in Laois have been told that from tomorrow there will be no more overtime for any weekend work and they will be replaced by agency staff because the HSE will not have to pay for travel.  Perhaps the overtime rate on a Sunday for the HSE home help staff is a higher cost.  We have been talking about older people.  This will impact on older people with dementia, for example, who are used to a particular person coming in to them.  Now on a Saturday or Sunday there will be agency people.  I cannot believe there is anything wrong with the HSE's own staff precisely because they are the HSE staff.  I presume this weekend issue is due solely to financial reasons.  Will somebody please send on a note in this regard?  I am referring to County Laois and the word is out today.  In this report I see a figure for &euro;100 million owed to the HSE because private facilities in public hospitals have not been paid for and within the same hour I have been told that HSE home help staff are instructed they can no longer visit clients at the weekend because the overtime is too dear.

What is the procedure right from when a person goes into hospital to when the bill goes home, for example with accident and emergency?</p></speech>

That charge is going up slightly - in the context of what the HSE receives from it - because fewer people are using their private insurance.  This is a result of the campaign by the private insurers.  While it does not compensate in any way for the loss of income to do with the private insurance, it is going up slightly.</p></speech>

These are mainly primary care centre sites.  There are 14 sites mentioned.  Will the HSE send a note to the committee on this?  The Committee of Public Accounts is looking at PPPs across all Government Departments that operate PPP developments with regard to how long a lease is and so on.  We are not looking for financial arrangements but we need a bit of transparency on PPPs and we have said this to several other Departments that have PPPs in their financial statements.  Whether or not they give value for money is a moot question.  The answer is that nobody in this building knows because nobody has access to the commercial information to be able to make a call on it.  People tell us that PPPs do offer value for money but I am agnostic because I do not have a basis for believing or disbelieving them.  We do not have the information so I want to add this to the Oireachtas and committee's state of knowledge by gathering information on PPPs for members from every Department or agency that comes in to the committee.</p></speech>

Currently the tax team is looking at the 2018 review.  Mr. Mulvany referred to &euro;2.5 million or the &euro;2.6 million figure.  This is based on a look-back for all of our areas on the major heads of tax to see whether or not we had collected tax at the right time and in a timely way.  Under some of the main tax headings of PAYE, corporation tax, professional services withholding tax and VAT we would look at areas where somebody, for example, might have been paid as a supplier.</p><p>Under Revenue regulations, they potentially should have paid tax.  We do an analysis that we have agreed with Revenue.  We would say that we are 99.8% compliant from a tax perspective.  We pay approximately &euro;1.6 billion in taxes.

The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also remind people to switch off their mobile phones.  Apologies have been received today from Deputy Fitzpatrick.  </p> <p>  We are joined today by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, and his officials.  They are all very welcome.  As there are no amendments received for the proposed Bill would the Minister of State like to go straightaway to making some opening comments? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-27a.1078" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019062700002#A00900"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman.  I do not have a whole lot to say at this stage regarding opening comments.</p> <p>  The Bill is fairly straightforward.  Obviously the Programme for Partnership Government includes a commitment to take measures to reduce the gender pay gap and  promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey.  This commitment is being implemented by means of action 1.23 of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 on which the Government is to promote wage transparency by requiring companies of 50 or more employees to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results.</p> <p>  The main provisions of the Bill are as follows.  The Minister will have the power to make regulations to require public and private employers to publish information setting out the differences between the mean and median hourly remuneration of male and female employees.  The reporting will be done on a phased basis beginning with employers of more than 250 employees, then employers of more than 150 employees and then to employees of more than 50 employees.  This will apply to both full-time and part-time employees in relation to bonus payments and benefits-in-kind.  The Bill requires an employer to include a narrative setting out the reasons for the gender pay in the firm and the measures, if any, being taken to address that gap.  The Bill also provides for a number of enforcement mechanisms.  An employee will be able to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission will be able to apply to the Circuit Court to require an employer to comply with the regulations where it has reason to believe that an employer has failed to comply.  I shall raise a number of issues as we go through the Bill and I will further consider them for Report Stage.  </p></speech>

When will the information start to become available?</p> <p>  Companies with more than 50 employees have been mentioned.  An unlimited company, for example, publishes very little information about the internal workings of its structures.  Let us say an unlimited company has 200 employees.  Under the Companies Act there would be very little information about how it operates.  What would its  legal obligations be versus its present obligations under the Companies Registration Office, CRO?  How is that squared legally?</p></speech>

The requirement is that companies initially with 250 or more employees will carry out a wage survey and publish that, and that will be mandatory.  Over time we will learn from larger companies.  We have engaged with the unions and employers and everyone is in agreement that this is the way to go.  The larger companies have the wherewithal and capacity to do these wage surveys, and to publish them.  As we move forward we will be moving down to the smaller companies.  They will learn from the larger companies as there will be a sharing of information.  Eventually we will bring this to companies of 50 employees.  We will not go below companies with 50 employees because one could identify individual salaries and wages of individual workers, which is something that we want to avoid.</p></speech>

Another area is a gender breakdown of full-time employees, part-time employees and employees with contracts for flexible working hours.  I also suggest that we change the size of companies to which these regulations apply, the time at which they apply, and the number of scales and timescales.  Also, I want to ensure that the legislation applies to legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices, to ensure that the attached employer narrative is mandatory, and to ensure that where people are not complying and not publishing the information that employers could, potentially, face fines or have their names published in a report by International Research and Exchange, IREX.  These areas that I have mentioned relate to Report Stage.</p></speech>

There is one aspect that I may consider further and possibly table a Report Stage amendment, namely, whether differences in bonus pay should be reported on a per hour basis rather than as a difference in the total bonus pay.  The argument would be that if staff in a particular category or department in a firm get a bonus of, say, 2% of their pay then a woman who works part-time, therefore, by reason of this earns less than a full-time employee and will automatically have lower bonus pay.  I will have to consider this further.</p> <p>  Section 20A(6) provides for the publication of gender pay gap information by each Department, scheduled offices, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  I want to signal that I will give further consideration to this subsection with a view to ensuring that it covers public service organisations in a comprehensive way.  I will bring forward a Report Stage amendment, if necessary. </p></speech>

A person who fails to comply with a Circuit Court order is in contempt of that court.  This represents enforcement by civil means rather than by the creation of an offence.  For example, if we were to create a summary offence with a maximum fine of &euro;5,000 is there a danger that some employer would be happy to ignore the regulation and accept the fine?  With some large companies this would be a small issue.  To prevent this from happening the Bill provides that a court order can be sought requiring the person to comply.  If he or she fails to comply then he or she is in contempt of court.  I wish to consider further whether this mechanism can be improved.</p><p>A key issue would be what power a court would have to deal with a person who persists in his or her contempt.  In the light of further consideration on this point, I may bring forward a Report Stage amendment.<br/><br/>Section 85D allows for an employee to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission of non-compliance with reporting regulations by his or her employer.  The director general of the Workplace Relations Commission will investigate the complaint if satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie </i>case or if, on investigation, the director general or an adjudication officer finds in favour of the complainant he or she may make an order requiring the employer to take a specified course of action in order to comply.  This is the only remedy that may be ordered, for example compensation may not be awarded as it is not an appropriate remedy in this situation.  Enforcement of WRC orders is through the District Court.  The idea is that if an employer is in breach of the regulations, for example the employer has not published the gender pay gap information, apart from proceedings by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC under section 85C, an employee of the employer concerned can take proceedings in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Since the Workplace Relations Commission is a rightly very accessible and low cost way to take a complaint this has to be a protection for the employer and for this reason the director general or an adjudication officer will only investigate a complaint if he or she is satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie </i>case.  As I have stated, enforcement orders under the section will be through the District Court and the same issue arises at section 85C.  For this reason I may return to this on Report Stage along with section 85C and I will table an amendment if necessary.</p></speech>
