Deputies Hourigan and Verona Murphy have sent their apologies.</p> <p>  To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  The service requests that individuals continue to wear face coverings when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people's physical space.  The public health advice should be heeded.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament. </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we engage with the Department of Justice and officials from the Prison Service to examine the 2020 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 24, Justice, and Vote 21, Prisons.  As per the committee's request, the Department has provided it with a copy of the independent review of voluntary mess committees in Irish prisons, which the committee may wish to examine during the engagement.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials: Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service; Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice; Ms Oonagh Buckley, deputy Secretary General; Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, assistant secretary; Mr. Seamus Clifford, assistant director; and Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation at the Irish Prison Service.  We are also joined by Ms Marianne Nolan, principal officer for the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. </p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The witnesses are all very welcome.  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#A00700"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of &euro;399 million in 2020.  This was a reduction of &euro;140 million, or 26%, on the prior year.  The main reason for the reduction in the level of expenditure on the Vote was the transfer of responsibility for certain services to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth following the formation of the Government.  This included the transfer out of responsibility for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers.  However, the processing of asylum applications remains the responsibility of the Department of Justice.</p> <p>  The Data Protection Commission was also established as a new Vote in 2020.  Previously, the commission was funded from the Justice Vote.</p> <p>  Expenditure under the justice Vote in 2020 was distributed across five programmes.  The biggest expenditure programme relates to the range of services that together address the strategic objective to "provide a safe and secure Ireland".  In 2020, the total spend for that programme was &euro;207 million.  This was up almost &euro;27 million, or 15%, year-on-year.  The largest component of this spending related to criminal legal aid, which totalled just over &euro;62 million in 2020.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion relating to the appropriation account for Vote 24.  However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control regarding material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2020.</p> <p>  I also drew attention to the payment of an EU fine by the Department.  The fine, in the amount of &euro;2 million, was imposed due to delayed transposition by Ireland of an EU directive relating to money laundering and terrorist financing.</p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21.  While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.</p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 21 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;401 million.  Around two thirds of the expenditure, totalling &euro;271 million, relates to pay.  The remainder is spread across a range of areas, including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchases, education and services for prisoners, and other operating costs. </p> <p>  Note 6.5 to the appropriation account provides an update as at September 2021 on progress made by the Prison Service in its arrangements for the operation of staff voluntary mess committees in the larger prisons.  The note outlines that governance arrangements have been reviewed and written agreements have been put in place between the committees and the Prison Service.</p><p>I understand that the Accounting Officer has provided further detailed information about the operation of the committees in recent correspondence.</p><p> I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account for Vote 21.  However, I drew attention in my report on the audit to the basis of the valuation of land at Thornton Hall.  While the land was valued by the Valuation Office at &euro;2.7 million in 2020, the Prison Service continued to carry the assets at Thornton on the statement of financial position at the historic cost of &euro;49.3 million.  This was in contrast to the valuation method applied for all other land and building assets.  In my opinion, the exceptional accounting treatment of the assets at Thornton Hall was not warranted.</p><p> I also drew attention to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts operating in 2020 for the supply of goods and services to the Prison Service.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms McPhillips.  As detailed in the letter of invitation, there will be five minutes for her opening statement.  I understand Ms McPhillips wishes to share her time with Ms McCaffrey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh McPhillips" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#B00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to meet with the committee in relation to the 2020 Justice and Prisons Votes.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office for their work on this.  The Chairman has introduced the team.  With his permission, I will share my time with Ms McCaffrey.</p> <p>  Vote 24, the justice Vote, is one of six in the Vote group and covers a wide remit of activity, both in the Department and a number of agencies in the justice sector.  In 2020, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, there were five expenditure programmes with 50 individual subheads.  The Vote structure was realigned substantially in 2021 to take account of the Department&rsquo;s major restructuring and the 2020 transfer of our integration and equality responsibilities to the expanded Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  These changes have rationalised the Vote&rsquo;s structure and reduced the number of programmes from five to two - criminal justice and civil justice.</p> <p>  Any review of 2020 must take account of the pandemic and, like the rest of the world, managing the impact of Covid-19 on our staff and business has been a central focus at all levels in the Department and the whole justice sector ever since, perhaps nowhere more so than in the prisons, which the director general will speak to shortly.  The management of the pandemic in the Department has been led by the management board and the Covid-19 response management group, supported by our specialist occupational health and safety unit.  This work included ensuring business continuity for the public services we provide, introducing remote working, onboarding more than 700 new staff over the past two years and safeguarding and supporting all our colleagues, including those serving abroad and those who had to remain in the workplace in front-line and public-facing roles.</p> <p>  Our criminal and civil governance teams communicated regularly and consistently with our 25 agencies to support them in responding dynamically and safely to the evolving public health restrictions.  It is a credit to the professionalism and commitment of the whole organisation that, working together, we succeeded in doing this and much more through the last two years.</p> <p>  There was also a significant impact on specific areas of the business.  The legislative teams supported colleagues in the Department of Health in drafting legislation and regulations, including the necessary Garda powers.  The restrictions on international travel and checks on people arriving into the State meant many dynamic changes for staff of the border management unit at Dublin Airport, including supporting mandatory hotel quarantine.  The pandemic impacted the provision of immigration services to our customers, necessitating the temporary extension of immigration permissions through 2020 and 2021.</p> <p>  Innovations were also introduced, including the first ever online citizenship ceremony in 2020 and more followed in 2021.  Under the Department&rsquo;s IT strategy, we are investing in developing much-needed digital systems, but the prolonged need to either restrict or stagger staff attendance in offices increased processing times, particularly in some high-volume immigration areas.  This situation improved as restrictions lifted and staff could return to offices.  We took the opportunity to re-engineer and streamline processes and this has been having a positive effect in recent months.</p> <p>  Members will appreciate that the recent essential work to welcome and process the refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine has necessitated the redeployment of experienced officials to staff the one-stop shop and reception centre.  This currently operates from 8 a.m. to approximately 4 a.m., seven days a week, at Dublin Airport, as well as at offices in Cork, Limerick and Rosslare to facilitate those arriving through other ports of entry.  This whole-of-government operation has received and processed over 25,000 people under the EU's temporary protection directive over the last two months.  The compassion and professionalism of colleagues involved is a great credit to them and reflects the response of the whole country to Ukraine.</p> <p>  Returning to Covid, as the country entered the first lockdown in March 2020, the Department was acutely aware of the huge difficulties and fear that restricting people&rsquo;s movement could bring to those at risk of domestic abuse.  Colleagues quickly developed and implemented an inter-agency plan, including the Still Here public awareness campaign.  This was a collaboration with front-line services in the public sector and in civil society in order to reassure victims that the practical supports they needed would still be available.  Additional financial supports were provided to front-line NGO partners and measures were put in place across the sector, including through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Operation Faoiseamh.  The Judiciary and the Courts Service also prioritised domestic abuse cases and provided for remote hearings for protection orders where necessary.  The Irish Prison Service risk-assessed those being released from prisons and the Legal Aid Board established a helpline to provide prompt legal advice and legal representation in court where needed.  The success of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s community engagement and policing strategy through the pandemic has rightly been recognised and I know the committee also recently heard from the Policing Authority about its important oversight work, which has had significant value in maintaining public trust.</p> <p>  There are a large number of agencies in this Vote but I want to mention in particular Forensic Science Ireland, as its long-planned, state-of-the-art laboratory HQ is nearing the final stages of construction.  I am pleased to report that despite the impact of the restrictions on construction activities in the earlier phases of the project, the lab is now on-track for completion this year within its budget of &euro;99.5 million.  This new facility will be one of the most sophisticated pieces of public infrastructure ever constructed in this country and will provide the hard-working staff of Forensic Science Ireland, with a high-spec, purpose-built facility, achieving the highest standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage.  It represents a very significant investment in our criminal justice system and the future of the Forensic Science Ireland.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to Ms McCaffrey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caron McCaffrey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#B00400"><p>As the Secretary General has outlined, it has been a truly remarkable and challenging period for communities across the globe and Covid- 19 has also had a major impact on the Irish Prison Service as we sought to keep all those who live and work in our prisons safe.  As a service, we have proven to be adaptable, flexible, resilient and highly innovative and our staff have embraced the challenges presented to us by the pandemic with professionalism and dedication.</p> <p>  The year 2020 saw the introduction of new and innovative methods of service delivery, including the delivery of teleservices for chaplaincy and psychology; maintaining links with family and friends virtually using video link technology; the introduction of electronic money transfer systems in partnership with An Post; and the introduction of in-cell telephones to help prisoners keep in contact with their loved ones and to support their mental health.  As a result, we were able to face down the challenges of Covid-19 and continue to provide the best possible level of service to prisoners in our care and to their families.  In early 2021, it became clear to all of us that living with Covid-19 was going to be a reality for some time.  Many of these new systems introduced in response to Covid-19 have now become essential tools for the delivery of prisoner services and for supporting prisoners, and have been permanently retained as we have moved into a less restricted environment.</p> <p>  Preventing the spread of infection into prisons and keeping those in our care safe did have an impact on expenditure and on the costs of providing prisoner services in 2020, with additional costs relating to the purchase of personal protective equipment for staff and prisoners, additional infection control costs, and healthcare and specialist cleaning supply costs.  This was necessary expenditure to mitigate against the risk posed by the virus and our infection control measures were central in our success in effectively managing the threat posed by Covid-19 in a prison setting.</p> <p>  In 2020, additional funding was provided to the Irish Prison Service under the Government economic stimulus package.  This allowed for a number of important projects to be advanced, such as building roof repairs, CCTV and security system upgrades, nationwide carbon reduction LED lighting replacement and upgrades to fire alarms.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges presented by Covid-19 since 2020, the Irish Prison Service has continued to deliver on the strategic actions set out in our current strategic plan, including our programme of prison modernisation.  Despite the impact on the construction sector due to the closure of construction sites at certain times, significant progress was made during 2020 on the capital development project at Limerick Prison.  Work on the project has continued in 2021 and 2022 and the project remains within budget and is expected to be completed later this year.  The project will provide quality accommodation for prisoners and enhanced services, and will provide an additional 90 male prison spaces and 22 additional female prison spaces.</p> <p>  Over the lifetime of our strategy, we have continued to implement a programme of reform within our service.  We continue to work closely with our key stakeholders to enhance the supports available for prisoners, including supporting prisoners on their transition from prison back into their communities.  As we emerge from this global pandemic, work is now turning to the development of a new strategic plan for our service through which we will build on recent reforms and take account of our experiences and learning from the past two years.</p> <p>  I can go into further detail as the members require.</p></speech>

It has been a very difficult time for everyone, given the role of the Garda, the Prison Service and the Department.  I thank them for all the work that was done over that difficult period.</p> <p>  On the issue of capital projects, Ms McPhillips referred to the roll-out of the Forensic Science Ireland's laboratory headquarters, which is on time and will remain within cost.  I understand the project will cost &euro;99.5 million.  Does that include fully kitting out the facility and having it fully operational?  When is the project likely to be finalised?</p> <p>  During the transition of evidence from one facility to another, the chain of evidence cannot be broken.  How is that planned to be dealt with to ensure there are no gaps in the transition period?  Has that been planned for?  Over what time period will that take place?  What level of planning has gone into that at this stage?</p></speech>

A lot of planning has gone into that.  The project is well advanced.  It is 79% complete at this stage.  The building is watertight.  A reasonable amount of it has been kitted out.  There were 235 people on-site at the building in February, which I thought was a fascinating number.  It is a massive project.</p> <p>  There is a detailed transition plan.  The move will start in the third quarter of this year.  The building will be handed over from the contractor in or around August, we hope.  Then, from August until the end of the year, there will be a detailed transition to move the existing operation out, as well as the accreditations which are necessary for each part of the system.  Obviously, all the scientific end of it has to be accredited to the international standard.  There will therefore be a certain amount of dual use of the existing laboratory in the Phoenix Park and then the transition to the new one.  The director, Chris Enright, and the staff of the laboratory are absolutely-----</p></speech>

It will not be accredited until the end of the year - roughly December.  It is hard to be exactly precise about that because it will be necessary to wait for the accreditation.</p></speech>

In my constituency, for instance, we had a project which went on for eight years.  A huge amount of additional money had to be paid by the Department as a result of that delay.</p></speech>

Contracts were signed and an issue then arose about whether to proceed with the contract.  Full interest was paid on the purchase price for a period of, I think, six years.  Interest of six years was paid.  It was one of those projects.</p> <p>  I wonder about the mechanism in place for projects from start to finish.  The Office of Public Works is involved in some of these projects.  There is also the issue of buildings which are no longer being used, for instance, we had problems with many old Garda stations.  The issues then arises of the existing building housing the forensic science laboratory.  What is the process for dealing with projects from start to finish?  In view of the fact that building costs are changing by the day, is there a need to have a process in place so that decisions are made in a timely manner, rather than waiting for two or three years for a decision to be taken?  It should be taken from start to finish.</p></speech>

In terms of capital projects generally, we are guided by the public spending code, which is our bible in these things.  We have to follow all the requirements in the public spending code.  We rely to a great extent on OPW in relation to acquiring sites and the verification of whether a site is a suitable and meets all the requirements of the particular project.  The different agencies in the Department have slightly different approaches to these things.  The Courts Service has a huge capital programme.  The Accounting Officer for the Courts Service is responsible for that.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a big capital programme, as do the prisons, and the Garda Commissioner is the accounting officer for that.</p></speech>

In that case, contracts were sent to the Office of the Chief State solicitor and the OPW to sign off on them.  There was a gap of two years between the contracts being sent and being signed.

Contracts are important and the devil is in the detail, so it is necessary to go through that.</p> <p>  In terms of us doing a review of the whole capital piece, what we did in preparation for the national development plan, NDP, was look across the whole sector to see what the needs were.  Then we looked at what budget we would get and what we could do.  However, we rely on the OPW a lot in relation to those matters.</p></speech>

We hope to get the report from the justice committee on it.  In terms of the projects, the Deputy is absolutely right that there will be a real implementation challenge and a huge number of regulations to be made once the legislation is done.  On the preparatory work to implement the measures, there is a huge amount of change involved for the oversight bodies in particular, but also for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department itself.  We have an implementation project.  I will ask Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan to come in on this because it is under his remit.  We have approximately seven individual projects, one of which is in relation to GSOC and the changes that will be needed there.  We are doing a review of how the process will operate.

We have a team established solely to look after its implementation.  Ever before the legislation is fully enacted, we have already commenced the work in scoping out what will need to be done under each of the seven or eight projects, the number of which will depend on how we decide to break it out.  All of the agencies will be involved in that.  At some point, we will need to get external advice to tease out the implementation details and make sure the whole thing fits together because all of the different parts in intersect with each other.  We need to make sure they are all properly lined out.</p> <p>  Even as we are hopefully moving through the Oireachtas with the enactment of the legislation, as things may emerge from detailed implementation planning, we will be able to bring that back to the Oireachtas and explain how this or that is going to work out or maybe some tweaks need to be made here or there.

In the 2021 appropriation account, which has just been finalised, the land will be reflected at the current valuation of &euro;6.5 million.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if this has been flagged to other State agencies.  At various times in the past five or six years, we have had discussions with Fingal County Council, IDA Ireland and, since its establishment, the Land Development Agency on a number of occasions.  There is interest in it but we regard it as a strategic State asset.  As the Deputy said, it is fully serviced and quite close to Dublin Airport.  We definitely have a strategic interest in a portion of the site from a criminal justice perspective but we would be open to discussions on the rest of the site.  We have signalled that to the relevant agencies.  The Land Development Agency, in particular, is keeping it as an option.  I will yield to the experts on this, and their view is it would not be suitable for housing but it may be suitable for decanting other strategic infrastructure from other areas.  They are keeping that under review but it is more of a long-term consideration.</p></speech>

In 2020 there were 2,399 cases in total of compensation claims pending against the Department, with 1,855 of those relating to in-cell sanitation.  What is the up-to-date position on that?

Significant progress has been made on concluding those claims.  There have been 2,773 claims received, of which 2,040 are concluded.  I suppose the contingent liability that the State Claims Agency put against that scheme was quite high at over &euro;30 million but the expectation now is the scheme will be concluded at around &euro;15 million.  There are specific caps in place for compensation and there are also caps in place regarding legal fees that can be paid.</p></speech>

My understanding is the hepatitis C treatment programme takes approximately 12 weeks.  Is there a detailed programme in place in each of the prisons to provide that care to prisoners while they are in prison?

It is more prevalent among the prisoner population due to issues related to addiction, high-risk behaviour and some people's inability to access services.  The HSE has a national programme and over 5,000 patients in the State are now being treated with highly effective direct acting antiviral drugs for hepatitis C.  Professor Aidan McCormick, the HSE clinical lead for the hepatitis C programme, has engaged directly with us and is committed to giving access to all communities, including prisoners, and that is very important for us.</p> <p>  We now have a process in place with the HSE and pilot projects will be rolled out in Cork and Limerick prisons in the first instance to ensure we can provide a robust and comprehensive hepatitis C programme, similar to what is happening in the community, and where this can lead to a point where the condition is curable for people entering prison.  During the course of this year the programme will roll out in the two prisons and be extended.</p></speech>

I do not have much time.  I would like to touch on the ongoing debacle relating to and the set of debacles that resulted in the killing of Shane O'Farrell in 2011.  In 2019, a scoping inquiry was established instead of the full public inquiry that both Houses of the Oireachtas had unanimously called for.  Considering that it is now 2022, and I assume that the witnesses will not be able to give us any sense of when that the scoping inquiry will be concluded, does the Department accept that scoping inquiries in respect of matters such as that to which I refer are not an appropriate way to provide answers?  Does it also accept that the scoping inquiry in this case has become just another blockage for the family of Shane O'Farrell and for those of us who want to find out precisely how his tragic death was allowed to happen?</p></speech>

That includes a new contract management system to allow us to start planning at the earliest possible stage for a contract to be awarded.  We have a comprehensive corporate procurement plan.  We have engaged external professional procurement consultants to assist us in ensuring we are fully compliant.</p> <p>  In 2020, the deputy and Comptroller and Auditor General appointed 16 contracts to a total value of &euro;15.15 million, where contracts were rolled over.  That compares with 26 such contracts in 2019 so there has been an improvement.  The value in 2019 was &euro;18.5 million so our figures are going in the right direction.</p> <p>  Of those 16 contracts, five involved the Office of Government Procurement.  I can inform the Deputy that all of those contracts are now in place.  Eleven cases were being managed by the Irish Prison Service and I can assure the Deputy that all of those contracts are now in place, with the exception of one which is currently out to tender for a value of &euro;93,000.  I can also inform the Deputy that we continue to make improvements in this regard.  The value of our non-compliant procurement radically reduced in 2021 to &euro;5.6 million.  So far this year, only two contracts are non-compliant.  It is an area of particular focus for the prison service and we have made good progress in that regard.</p></speech>

Are any of the contracts under Vote 21 or Vote 24 long running?  Are any of them contracts that have been in place for more than five years?  I know Ms McCaffrey said some of those contracts have been put out to tender, which is good and probably best practice, but have any of those contracts been rolling for more than five years?</p></speech>

The Probation Service is one of our many agencies but it is a particularly successful one in terms of what it does.  I might ask Mr. O'Sullivan, who looks after governance of the criminal agencies, to come in but we have a governance agreement in place that is fully compliant.  Mr. O'Sullivan may wish to expand on that.</p></speech>

We also have an annual performance delivery agreement.  Under those arrangements, we meet the head of the Probation Service at least twice a year and back that up with a constant stream of regular informal engagement and support.  In fact, the Minister met the Probation Service and senior team on-site in the past week or so and had a very good engagement.  We obviously set targets and the resource allocations, and work closely with the Probation Service to consider where it is going strategically in the coming years.</p> <p>  There are also service level agreements for the provision of ICT and financial services.  The Probation Service relies on the Department for a lot of those central support services.</p></speech>

I will come back to the Deputy in a moment.  The top offences referred to the service in 2020 related to drugs offences.  Approximately 75% of referrals related to drugs offences, theft, assault, public order, road traffic and burglary.  The number of offenders dealt with in the community in 2020 was 15,500.  The figure for 2021 was 15,400.  Some 9,300 probation reports were completed for court in 2020 and 10,000 were completed in 2021.  That shows a considerable volume of business.</p></speech>

I am struck by the number of claims that have been made by prisoners for injury and other actions involving prisoners.  There are 445 claims of that kind and more than &euro;2 million has been awarded in compensation.  There are 107 civil claims for injuries received while on duty and other issues involving prison staff, which is a high number.  There are 110 claims through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal arising out of injuries received by prison staff.  Have our guests the figures for recent years that we could use as a comparison?  Has that trend increased?  The number of prisoner claims seems high.  Have those numbers increased or decreased?</p></speech>

I will follow up on that point.  As I mentioned earlier, many of the claims by prisoners relate to in-cell sanitation.  We have received a significant number of in-cell sanitation claims and they account for many of the claims made by prisoners.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, our staff do become injured on duty.  There are some slips, trips and falls but it is obviously a difficult environment.  Our staff are required to break up altercations between prisoners and become injured while doing so.  They are also, unfortunately, assaulted from time to time.  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is a specific scheme to deal with prison officers who have been-----</p></speech>

I have many questions about prisons.  The Joint Committee on Justice recently spoke to Ms McCaffrey and Mr. Black.  It is good to see them again.</p> <p>  Much of what we have been talking about relates to the costs and benefits of the rehabilitation programmes and the emphasis on the rehabilitation of prisoners with a particular focus on libraries, education and access to education.  The spending review for 2021, the Review of the Programme of Work and Training in the Irish Prison Service, was produced by Ms Caroline Finn.</p><p>It states it does not represent the official views of the Department or Minister for Justice, so I am not sure what its status is.  Will Ms McCaffrey clarify its status?</p></speech>

We want to ensure that what we are doing at a prison level is aligned to what is happening within the employment market.  We put that forward as a spending review so that we could learn and improve our work training activities.</p></speech>

The second key finding states: &ldquo;Approximately 30% of the prison population take part in Work and Training at any given time, though this is not the only structured activity available in prisons.&rdquo;  That figure seems low.  Is it a fair reflection?</p></speech>

Within a prison, you may go to school for the day or you may go to work and training.  In some cases, you may go to school in the morning and to work and training in the afternoon.  Obviously, from a Prison Service perspective, we encourage as many prisoners as we can to participate in work, training and education.  There has been an impact because of Covid, unfortunately, but we are now back at a stage where our workshops and education facilities are operating at maximum capacity.  One of the core functions of the Prison Service is to help people gain an educational qualification or a work training qualification so that they are much more employable on release.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, because of Covid, we had to reduce the number of people in our workshops to ensure social distancing, but we are certainly now back to ensuring our workshops and schools have as many prisoners as can possibly be held within a work training activity or classroom.</p></speech>

I am concerned about equal access for all prisoners to those programmes, and prisoners on protection in particular.  What proportion of prisoners on protection have access to education, training and work?</p></speech>

The majority of prisoners self-declare that they require protection; it is not a regime imposed on them by the Prison Service.  It is much more difficult for people to access education and work training under those circumstances.  However, we make every effort to ensure they have access to activities.  In certain prisons, schools would be open on certain mornings or afternoons for protection prisoners.  Similarly, teachers in some prisons go to protection landings to ensure those prisoners can engage in education.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point Ms McCaffrey made about self-declaration, but the State is paying for these prisoners to be in prison and it is part of the prison rules, and of the Nelson Mandela Rules, that people should have access to education and training.  That is a key part of the strategy.</p></speech>

One of the critical things we did earlier in the Covid pandemic was to introduce in-cell learning and a blended model.  That is something we are working hard to build on.  I might ask my colleague-----</p></speech>

There is a cost to that and to providing the digital tools that are necessary for it.  The Prison Service could come under criticism at a later stage for having invested in the sorts of digital tools, such as tablets and so on, that would be necessary to deliver that and I do not think it should be criticised for that.  I am trying to pre-empt that criticism.  A consistent recommendation in the report of the Inspector of Prisons is that digital tools such as tablets be made available to prisoners in order that interaction can take place with education facilities outside the prisons to ameliorate some of the difficulties we are talking about.</p></speech>

We are planning a trip, along with some of our colleagues from the Department, to look at what has been done there and to see if we can build on what we have done during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I certainly believe a central focus of our new strategy will be on ensuring the tools are available to prisoners within their cells.</p></speech>

This issue arises in the context of the different programmes for prisons&rsquo; officers, whether they relate to regime management plans or the organisation of the prisons more generally.  The library seems to be the first facility to go every time, with the additional gym instructor being cancelled.  Access to education is always the first thing to be removed.  On our recent visit, we talked about staff being occupied by court visits and so on.  That is a necessary part of the process and it would not be a solution to have remote hearings only, and perhaps the courts should come to the prisons if there is an overwhelming issue in that regard.  Are the regime management plans, following lockdown and from now on, task specific or office specific?  For example, are staff attached specifically to committals or to the library?  Is there an opportunity for enhanced efficiency?  If, for example, committals take up only a part of the day, could that person then be assigned to a different task, such as opening the library again?</p></speech>

Regrettably, there are unpredictable draws on staff and that has an impact on the services.  The purpose of the regime management plan is to give as much predictability as we can to services so that they know in advance that they are not going to be in a position to do face-to-face work and can plan their administrative work around it.  Some of the difficulties with closures of libraries earlier in the Covid pandemic were infection control issues, such as the sharing and cleaning of books, and that constituted a significant part of the closures.  I might ask my colleague-----</p></speech>

Maintaining all the services is a difficulty because, as the director general pointed out, there is a draw on staff to carry out necessary court escorts and so on.  We have also had to assign staff temporarily to Covid duties over recent years.  I am reassured by the Minister, as recently as yesterday, having made clear that in order to address this systemic problem, she wishes to seek to secure, through the Estimates process this year, additional resources for the Prison Service.  From my perspective, that should ensure we will be able to provide psychology, education and work training services on a more optimal basis because it is a challenge to maintain them all daily.</p></speech>

What oversight does the Department of Justice have of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report on design and performance indicators in policing?  What work is being done in this area?</p></speech>

Those are very exacting performance meetings every month.  They assist with where the Garda is at, what is going on and where it needs to get to.  I might ask Mr. O'Sullivan to expand on this if it is okay because he oversees the governance side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#H00200"><p>I will just make a few additional comments.  We have worked very closely as part of developing our performance arrangements with all the agencies to integrate the work we are doing around performance targets and KPIs with the work the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Revised Estimates volume.  As the committee knows, in the Revised Estimates volume each Vote appears alongside key outputs and public service activities and measurements.  We now ensure what we are engaging with the agency on is lined up to what is appearing in that so there is a clear link between the money that has been voted and the type of indicators being provided.</p> <p>  Performance targets in the area of policing are obviously a complex area.  There is clearly a long way to go and I think all the agencies will accept that.  The other thing to say is there are other important actors in the oversight environment for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, principally the Policing Authority which through the annual policing plan engages with the Commissioner and his senior team around their targets under the policing plan and also holds them to exacting account.  It takes part in the monthly resource meeting the Secretary General has referred to.  Ourselves, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely on managing wider resource issues and what kind of impacts there are.  It is internationally recognised as an area where there is more work to be done and obviously ensuring we do not skew activity by putting in indicators that are easy to measure but are not necessarily what communities want.  A lot of it goes beyond numbers.  The Garda has done much work around assessing community confidence in its services and sometimes that is at least as important as whether or not a particular number of incidents is reported or whatever.  There is an awful lot of work in the space but more to do.</p></speech>

On the mechanisms in place for the Department, if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not meet its performance indicators, what type of procedures are in place, or how is that being dealt with?</p></speech>

However, more generally, what you have is an iterative process, and this is something the Policing Authority would speak to as well, where you are working through the issue and asking the organisation to go back and review what it is doing to try to reach the target or maybe identify why the target has not been met and what are the factors.  Usually there are a lot of external factors that would impact on levels of activity so there is kind of an iterative process rather than a command and control one.  At the end of the day, the Commissioner remains accountable and responsible for the performance reports and we work through the issues with them as they arise.</p></speech>

The Garda is the envy of its counterparts worldwide as a growing service, both with respect to sworn members and also civilians.  There is lots more expertise in the Garda staff cohort as well.  The growth of that is really important.  Digital and IT is an important area from our point of view to get the best value, to ensure the staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the best tools available to them and to combat the growth in ever more sophisticated cybercrime, etc., but also just ordinary crime.  Every element of crime has a digital element to it now and garda&iacute; need the tools to combat that.</p></speech>

That related to the fourth anti-money laundering directive.  There was a gap in between the time it was transposed.  The Commission had instituted legal proceeding and we ended up with a fine.  We have done a lot of work on our transposition of EU measures generally but on that one, a fine of &euro;2 million was paid to the Commission in 2020 due to the delayed transposition of the directive.  It referred to a period between July 2017 and December 2019 that related to the enactment of both the primary and secondary legislation for that directive.  I should add there are two more directives since.  It is an ever-evolving area and we are constantly trying to keep up to date on money laundering.  It is a difficult area and one the EU is very active in.</p></speech>

It was an area where some significant issues arose in recent years, especially during Covid-19.  I would certainly like to have a look at what the Department has to say about non-compliance.</p> <p>  Turning to the D&oacute;chas Centre during Covid-19, two reports were carried out but they have not been published.  The most recent response I received to a parliamentary question stated that, "based on legal advice received by my Department, it is not proposed to publish the report at this time".  Somebody said the Prison Service did an exceptional job in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  One of these reports concerns Covid-19 and the experience in the D&oacute;chas Centre.  I cannot understand why that report would not be published.  It should be published.  Ms McPhillips might tell us what is meant by &ldquo;at this time&rdquo;?  The other report may or may not be linked to the original report.  We would need to see it to evaluate that aspect.  Is it intended, at some point, to publish these reports?  What is the impediment to publishing a report relating to Covid-19?</p></speech>

There is also a separate process that I cannot go into.  Between all that, the strong legal advice is that we cannot publish these reports at this time.  We are examining them to see if there may be elements we can publish, because we do want this information in the public domain.  We also want to implement the recommendations.  We are not, however, in a position to publish the report at this time based on the legal advice.</p></speech>

Moving on to Thornton Hall, the new valuation for the site is &euro;6.2 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to the valuation of &euro;2.7 million.  In this context, there is the land itself, but also the significant development of a road and lighting at the site, which means it is now fully serviced.  That is my understanding.  Can Ms McPhillips provide the methodology to explain the variance between the &euro;2.7 million and &euro;6.2 million valuations?  We already know there is a significant issue regarding the historical cost of the site.  What is the methodology?  How are the valuations so different?</p></speech>

We get expert valuation people to do it.  In 2015, it was valued at &euro;2.4 million.  It was then valued in 2020 at &euro;2.7 million.  Probably because of Covid-19, but I am only speculating in this regard, that was a paper-based, desk exercise.  It did seem to us to be a reasonable valuation in respect of the increase in land values between 2015 and 2017.  On foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s views on this issue, we sought a further valuation and that was &euro;6.7 million.</p></speech>

Our interest is in roughly 40 acres.  The remainder of the site is available for development by the State.  We flagged this in 2015 and 2016 to Fingal County Council and we had a detailed discussion about the site's proximity, or lack thereof, to Ashbourne.  The council feels it is outside their zones in respect of being suitable for housing, and I yield to the experts on this matter.  The land is a little bit distant from both those things.  We also flagged the availability of the land to the IDA, which has looked at it several times.  More recently, when the LDA was established, we flagged the availability of land with that organisation as well and we have had discussions in this regard.  Ms McCaffrey and I met with representatives of the LDA in recent weeks to discuss this issue.  Additionally, in the context of the war in Ukraine, we have also flagged the availability of the site.  If the land is not suitable for housing, and again other people will decide the suitability in this regard, then it may also not be suitable for modular housing in the context of the refugee crisis either.  The site is, however, suitable for other developments.</p></speech>

The consultants who supported us to do the transformation were EY, but the Department very much led the process.  That was completed at the time.  Elements of the Department were unaffected by that process and we always knew we would have to return to them.  The immigration area is one of them.

This committee had requested an investigation into voluntary mess committees in prisons.  Our inquiries arose following protected disclosures from a whistleblower.  I will direct my questions to Ms. McPhillips from the Department first.  Was that whistleblower, Noel McGree, directly engaged in the course of this report?</p></speech>

Those funds should have come under staff development.  I have actually abolished the prisoner assistance programme fund, PAPF.  It was based on the profits generated from our tuck shops.  The money was primarily spent to address prisoner hardship, on prisoner programmes and to support our community return and community support programmes.  I was of the view that selling items in the tuck shop as an economic activity was not really what the Prison Service is about.  It is a service to prisoners.  We have changed the manner in which our tuck shops operate and, instead of selling at recommended retail prices, we now sell products at cost plus 5%.  The programmes that were previously supported by that fund now receive Exchequer funding.  We received Exchequer funding for prisoner programmes and to support the community support and community return programmes.  However, we continue to sell tobacco at cost price.  That generates enough money to allow governors to support prisoners who find themselves in economic hardship.</p></speech>

It is money collected to reimburse the costs of the meals provided.  This is not public money that we are talking about.  I think the Deputy is referring to a staff recognition event that took place in Mountjoy Prison, for which the mess committee, from its own funds, purchased a small amount of alcohol.  I would clarify that the mess in Mountjoy Prison is not within the confines of the prison.  It is outside the prison, just inside the main gate.  I will further clarify that there is not a provision in the Civil Service code that prohibits alcohol being consumed at an event.  I can clarify that there is certainly no alcohol being consumed within our prisons.  This was a specific staff recognition event that took place outside of work hours and the moneys involved were the staff's own moneys, not voted or public moneys.</p></speech>

There is an initial disclosure, or perhaps multiple disclosures, depending on the circumstances.  First of all, they are assessed.  They are then investigated by an external concern.  These issues may sometimes morph into or may be factors in more wide-ranging systemic examinations that the Department does or causes to be done of specific issues.  In that instance, there may not be the read-across from the initial process around the discloser's own concerns into the bigger issue.  However, obviously, the issues are taken into account.</p></speech>

Obviously, sometimes the information they provide is good and sometimes it is not.  I understand that prison is a very challenging environment and staff are dealing with very challenging situations at times and all of that.  However, prisons would have a high level of autonomy and Ms McPhillips outlined that in her briefing notes, which I read yesterday.  I would be aware of that from Portlaoise and Midlands Prison, which is just up the road from me.  Some whistleblowers seem to go through the consequences of the whistleblowing - I suppose I could phrase it that way.  For some whistleblowers who I have spoken to, the turn of events since and the outworking of the cases would confirm that they suffered enormously.</p></speech>

We cannot have a situation where staff that come forward are bullied, browbeaten or forced out of their job.  We cannot have situations such as that.  That has happened, unfortunately.  I will not name any specific cases.  There is one case that I am aware of and have followed very carefully.  The consequences for that person and her family have been absolutely enormous.  The Prison Service has a duty of care.  It is not like a lot of other jobs.  It is not like being on a building site or working in here or in an office.  It is different.  I just would make that point to Ms McPhillips and Ms McCaffrey.  Going forward, we have to do these things differently.</p></speech>

We have identified 112 acres of the site as available for future development and we are looking to maintain 40 acres, as the Secretary General mentioned earlier.  We have very limited availability to build on the existing footprint of the prison estate.  We are putting a new wing on Limerick Prison at the moment.  There is potential for wings to be added to some of our existing prisons, should capital money allow, but we do not have any land on which we would be on a position to build a larger prison and I suppose we-----</p></speech>

One of the issues that has bedevilled Mountjoy Prison, and one of the reasons we wanted to move to greenfield site, is the issue of drugs being thrown over the yards and its proximity to the canals.  Certainly, that remains a problem.  Many of our prisons are inner-city prisons.  The greenfield site offers an especially secure location for the construction of any new prison.</p></speech>

I think prisons did an incredible job, especially in the first wave, of protecting prisoners and staff in overcrowded congregated settings from what could have been an absolute catastrophe.  It came at a significant price, however, and there is an opportunity to learn from that.  It is clear from going through all the reports of the Inspector of Prisons that prisoners reported very significant information about how not to get Covid but much less information about what to do if they had it and how that was to be managed.  There was a significant mental health impact from the isolation that was necessary, especially in the first wave, including the missing of family visits.  There is an opportunity there.</p> <p>  I would like to refer to the staff survey that was done in 2021 by the Office of the Inspector of Prisons.  The staff recommended in-cell telephones and video calls to improve relationships with family members and to improve mental health.  This would have obvious benefits for education and training and access to mental health supports, which is a big problem irrespective of Covid.  That recommendation came from the staff.  Sometimes one is criticised for providing services to prisoners, but this is a staff recommendation.  I want to amplify it from the staff survey.</p> <p>  There is an ongoing concern about the mental health impact of the current quarantine experience.  Ms McPhillips is aware of that but I want to flag it to her because it will come back.  These things can come back in many different ways from a cost perspective to the State.  In terms of the directions that were possible under the Act, it was July 2021 before a direction was given.  However, the sunset side of things is not clear with regard to unlocking and unwinding the restrictions on exercise and so on.  Ms McPhillips is aware of that also but these are the difficulties.</p> <p>  We spoke in great detail about D&oacute;chas at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, but the overcrowding in D&oacute;chas and the refurbishment that is necessary are very significant.  There is an ongoing problem about the profile of people there with overwhelming addiction, mental health and welfare issues, many of whom should not be there but need to be in supported facilities.  I am not sure where the Department is moving and whether sufficient departmental priority is being given to being able to move to that.  We have gone through it in detail at the justice committee but I just wanted to highlight it here again.</p> <p>  Deputies have talked about the cost to the State of the slopping-out cases.  It was &euro;1.5 million in compensation and another &euro;500,000 in legal costs for in-cell sanitation for 2020 and 2019.  It comes with the overcrowding problem.  In the Inspector of Prisons report on Arbour Hill, one can see the effect of a doubled-up bunk being in a single cell with a toilet, with no screen between the toilet and the lower bunk.  Prisoners report trying to use the toilet on the landing for each other's dignity.  These are ongoing very visible and obvious problems that have to be addressed, especially where there are not separate sanitation options.</p> <p>  With regard to the priority areas under the regime management plan, RMP, there will be work on training as an essential service.  That will be prioritised.</p> <p>  I want to leave prisons for a second.  The money laundering directive came from the EU in 2015.  Ms McPhillips said there was a difficulty between July 2017 and 2019 in the transposition of it.  Will she clarify that?  It was a 2015 directive.  It should have been implemented by 2017.</p></speech>

This is a very significant event for us.  This is the only time the State has been fined in the case of a measure which we were responsible for implementing.  It is very complex legislation.

As the Secretary General said, it was part of an overall suite of measures, including perhaps other EU measures which had more pressing timelines even at that point.  The other complication in this instance was that the State fell foul of a change in European Commission practice in regard to the enforcement penalties beginning in January 2017.  Previously, where a member state had remedied the infringement by the time the case came to court, the Commission would not seek a fine.  The Commission changed its practice so that by the time this came to court - and this is not an excuse obviously but the context-----</p></speech>

We would have been aware of that but I appreciate the point.</p> <p>  I will go back to Ms McPhillips who made a comment earlier that caused me concern so I want to make sure I understand what she means.  She said that we are constantly keeping up with money laundering directives, and that there were subsequent directives.  That phrase "constantly keeping up" raises a very large flag for me.  Given what we are seeing with Russia, the difficulties throughout Europe and our own exposure even though it is very small going by those figures from the Department of Finance, I do not like that phrase from Ms McPhillips.  Would she like to clarify or explain what she means?</p></speech>

It is a constant iteration and the EU will continue to iterate it and we want it to because we have to keep on top of this.</p></speech>

The ODCE was to be replaced by the Corporate Enforcement Agency.  The expectation was that would happen in January.

What role did the Department have in the MOU?  Has it been signed at this stage?  When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was in recently, we were told it would be within weeks.  A huge level of frustration was expressed when it was discovered in FOI.  We are seeing cases, for example, the FAI case.  People are wondering where it is.

We took that away to make sure we have the learnings for the future, but also to look at what we can do now to support people with their mental health.  We are looking at group psychology sessions to support people because of the impact of isolation and quarantine, which were absolutely necessary in the context of Covid outbreaks within the prisons but which, regrettably, were quite impactful on people.  We are very attuned to that.</p></speech>

The oversight elements that are in place at the moment in all the agencies have been added individually over the years.  GSOC was created in approximately 2006 and the Policing Authority in around 2015, so they are piecemeal.  The intention of the Bill is to make that coherent.  It does not make it much simpler, but it makes the processes more coherent.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there is a community-based project in Dublin and one in Tipperary, but it does not seem to be widespread throughout the State.

As I recall, Judge Mary Martin promoted this approach a decade ago.  It is acknowledged that it is a successful approach to reparation, which is very important for victims, but also in moving people away from reoffending.  Why can the process not be accelerated?  Ms McCaffrey has a problem with prison space and people have to be doubled up in cells that are not suitable.  It would be better if the cells where there is slopping out were empty and we did not have prisoners in them.  Most people would agree with that, but because of the pressure for space within the Prison Service, with approximately 3,500 prisoners, people are being committed to prison who will reoffend.  Why are more programmes of restorative justice not being rolled out?  It is a benefit, even if we only look at it from a financial position.  That is one concern, but reducing crime and antisocial activity and improving community safety should be the big considerations.  Why is this process not being driven on more quickly across the State?</p></speech>

A review of penal policy is nearing completion at the moment and that will set out the guiding principles for our priorities.  Restorative justice is one of those priorities and a sparing approach to the use of imprisonment.  Prison is a sanction of last resort.  You are quite right, Chair, about the need to invest in restorative justice on a consistent basis in terms of its application across the country.  Announcing it, as we said earlier-----</p></speech>

It is frustrating.  People are being sent to prison and while I am not advocating locking people up and throwing away the key, the system does not allow for reparation for victims.  I recall one case where an individual had robbed four or five different households and they got a number of weeks in prison and then they came out.</p><p>I remember totting up the amount of money stolen as this detail came out in the court case.  Surely it would have been better for the person to repay the money and make reparations to the victims.  If the people who had been burgled or assaulted received some compensation from the perpetrator or if there had to have been a restorative justice element of some kind, that would have been better.  This has been proven internationally and everyone in the Garda up to the Garda Commissioner knows it.  While I do not want to misrepresent him, my understanding is the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, wants it.  Senior garda&iacute; at all levels believe this is the way to go.

It is absolutely vital in addressing criminality and addressing people's behaviours, surfacing the issue that has caused the criminality in the first place.

My understanding is there was a particular issue with prisoners needing to be taken from Cork Prison to an outpatient clinic in Cork University Hospital for their care.  I had understood it was proposed that all treatment would take place within prisons rather than having to incur the additional cost of taking prisoners to a medical facility.  What is the proposed programme for hepatitis C?  As it is a 12-week programme, it is an ideal opportunity.  There will be significant long-term savings in the cost of medical treatment.</p> <p>  What is the proposal for the old prison in Cork?  Obviously, there is a maintenance cost associated with a facility not being used.  What are the plans for that property now?</p></speech>

The intention is that the treatment plan will be devised over an eight-week period and, as the Deputy points out, it will be extremely cost effective in the management of hepatitis C.  Based on our discussions with Professor Aiden McCormick, the lead for the national hepatitis C treatment programme, the intention is to have a particular tailored programme for people in prison.  The Deputy is quite right.  One of the difficulties that bedevils us is we have a population of people in custody whose health status does not compare favourably with the general community.  Therefore, taking them out to external secondary services for tertiary care is very costly in terms of the resources we need to assign, in terms of drawing staff away from prison.  We are very anxious to develop any clinical services we can provide within the prison.  This is one of the services we feel we can pilot successfully, it is hoped in Cork and Limerick, and extend nationally subsequently in a very cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

Our intention is to have both pilots operational this year in Cork and Limerick.

We have had this operational through a collaboration between Mountjoy clinical staff, our staff, and the Mater Hospital on an interim basis for a number of years.

Essentially, we just need to agree with our colleagues in the HSE on the treatment plan that will be rolled out for prisoners in those prisons.  We ensure the prisoners who require treatment receive that treatment.  We evaluate the effectiveness of it in the context of clinical care and in the context of the savings that will accrue both to the prison service in terms of escorts and to the HSE in terms of clogging up its services.  I would hope that, early next year, we would seek to roll it out to all our prisons.</p></speech>

When we constructed the new prison on the site of Cork Prison, we decommissioned the old prison, so we are not maintaining that building.  The accommodation in Cork Prison was the worst quality of accommodation we had within the estate before it was replaced.  It had a very limited regime of activities.  The new prison has been built and the old one has been decommissioned.  We have not moved to demolish it because demolition would cost several million euro.  It is quite expensive to demolish a building.  It remains decommissioned, but obviously it is a site that could potentially be used in the future by the Prison Service.</p></speech>

All of the attendant services are available on site.  We have a school.  We have work training activities.  There are no plans in the short term for future development on the Mountjoy site.  We spent some money recently on the training unit, which is also on the Mountjoy site.  We had closed it in 2017 to repurpose it as an older persons' unit.  Unfortunately, just as it was finished in December 2019, Covid hit and we did not think it was the right decision to put all our vulnerable elderly prisoners in that accommodation.  We are moving now towards its reopening.  That has been fully refurbished and decorated.</p></speech>

There were certain scenarios that could be accommodated and some that could not.  However, I acknowledge the work of the Prison Service in engaging with both families and public representatives in that regard.  That is good news about Mountjoy and the D&oacute;chas centre.</p> <p>  Turning to Vote 24, I have a number of questions on different headings and I will ask them in the time I have remaining.  Subhead D3 is social disadvantage measures, and there was an underspend of nearly &euro;1 million.  Some of that was obviously down to Covid-19 but it also refers to certain projects for youth justice not being fully drawn down in 2020, related to the delays in establishing new projects.  How are we getting on with that at this point?</p></speech>

They are activated again.  In fact, the budget for youth justice and the youth diversion projects for 2022 has an increase of over &euro;6 million, so there is a huge amount of work going on there.  They are fully firing now.</p></speech>

Again, no more than with the policing, security and community safety Bill, there is a detailed project implementation plan relating to the establishment of the regulator.  It is a very complex project and complex regulation so there is a lot of work going into that.  A team is working on it at present.</p></speech>

The next two matters are linked.  They are the funding for prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence as well as funding for services for victims of crime.

That excess arose due to the roll-out of the Still Here campaign.  We also increased the grants available to the front-line partners we have in this space.  Between the Still Here campaign for awareness raising and the increased provision for front-line services, there was approximately &euro;400,000 extra spent in 2020.</p></speech>

First, I have a brief question.  In 2020, an issue under the remit of the Department of Justice that came to my attention is funding for the coroner's court.  I understand there has been some difficulty with the discharge of bodies, particularly in areas where there is high population.  Outside of Dublin and other areas of the country this is the remit of the local authorities, but it is the remit of the Department of Justice as it pertains to Dublin.  What measures has the Department been undertaking to deal with that issue in the context, of course, of it being a deeply personal issue for many people?  In Ireland we have an important tradition where the death and funeral process is very swift in comparison to what might be the case in the United Kingdom where it takes weeks.  It is quite important from a cultural standpoint.  I will open with that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh McPhillips" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#R02400"><p>The Deputy is correct.  Something we were very conscious of at the beginning of the pandemic was the potential and the great unknown about how this would all play out.  We established a dedicated team in March-April 2020 in respect of coroners and the pathology services generally.  Obviously, the Office of the State Pathologist is under the Department.  The pathologists in hospitals are under the HSE, so there can be quite a complicated provision there.  I will ask Ms Buckley to comment on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.496" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#R02500"><p>There are challenges around this and they became particularly difficult during the pandemic because of the Covid-19 precautions that had to be brought to bear.  Dublin also became the recipient of a lot of bodies where Covid-19 precautions had to take place so it took a bigger hit nationally, if I can put it that way, which was really unfortunate.  As the Deputy said, one is always conscious of the families involved.  One thing involved here is that Covid-19 deaths are natural deaths so unless there was another reason for a post-mortem they would not necessarily have undergone that.</p> <p>  The other issue with this, and the Secretary General has mentioned this a few times, is that there are very specialist skills associated with doing post-mortems and so forth.  It is constantly a challenge to recruit and have those skills in place to facilitate the mortuary service.  The other issue is that some hospitals offer the service and depending on whether the hospitals are in a position to offer the service, that can increase or decrease the pressure on the Dublin mortuary.  We had quite a significant issue in the last few weeks where a couple of hospitals had to stand down, for reasons pertaining to themselves, and the mortuary then took the hit.  At one point, we were up to a delay of two weeks in post-mortems.  I am pleased to tell the Deputy that as of yesterday, when I was briefed on the matter, we had only nine post-mortems outstanding.  Effectively, there is currently no backlog of post-mortems in the Dublin mortuary.</p> <p>  We have a specialist unit now that is concentrating on the coronial service and the mortuary service.  A feature of the justice plan for this year is that we intend to look at the overall structure of the system to see how it needs to be structured for the future.  Our coronial service was last properly overhauled in 1846, so we probably need to have a look at it.  That is very much in our plans for the future.  However, at the same time, I have a dedicated and excellent team working on making sure that the current service is maintained and supporting the Dublin coroner, who is independent, in doing her important work.</p></speech>

That is good to hear.</p> <p>  I will move to a slightly more controversial matter.  As part of our briefing and with regard to the State Claims Agency, there are approximately 2,400 claims outstanding in respect court cases being brought against the Irish Prison Service.  Am I right that approximately &euro;3.1 million was paid out in compensation in respect of claims by prisoners in 2020 and there was &euro;1.5 million in compensation and &euro;500,000 in legal costs awarded in respect of in-cell sanitation cases between 2019 and 2020?</p><p>To me, that sounds a little unusual.  I want to try to get a better understanding from the officials of what is actually going on in that particular case.  Obviously, it is quite a large amount of money relating to the Prison Service.  Will the officials give us the background if that is possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caron McCaffrey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#S00200"><p>I can assist the Deputy in that regard.  There was a case that went as far as the Supreme Court in regard to the lack of in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison.  That case was allowed on appeal and damages in the sum of &euro;7,500 were awarded.  The legal costs involved in that case were very significant.  The State Claims Agency manages these claims on behalf of the Prison Service.  In February 2020, the State Claims Agency put in place a specific scheme to address the number of claims that had been made in this respect.  To give an update on the figures, as of now 2,773 claims have been received, of which 2,040 have been concluded, so there has been very good progress in respect of that scheme.  An important point to note in regard to the scheme is that damages have been capped at a maximum of &euro;7,500.  There are three different categories or levels of compensation depending on whether a person was on a restricted regime and sharing a cell, on an open regime and sharing a cell or in their own cell.  Importantly, the legal costs have also been capped and that relates to the level of award that is granted.  The maximum legal costs that will be paid in respect of a claim is &euro;1,700 and the minimum for compensation awards at the lower end of the scheme is &euro;1,000.</p> <p>  It has been a very successful scheme.  Certainly, if we look at the legal costs that were attached to the original case that was litigated in the courts, the expenditure is far less than that.  The State Claims Agency at the beginning of the process in regard to in-cell sanitation claims put a contingent liability of &euro;37.7 million against the claims.  Now, because of the success of the scheme, it looks like the liability to the State will be in the order of &euro;15 million.  Therefore, the scheme that has been put in place has been very successful.  There has been good engagement with both plaintiffs and their solicitors and the expectation is that that scheme will be concluded, hopefully, before the end of this year.</p></speech>

Some &euro;150 million has been invested in the last ten years to put in-cell sanitation into Mountjoy, which was the biggest facility.  We now have a construction project in Limerick which will eliminate the small number who continue to not have access to an in-cell toilet.  A significant amount of progress has been made.</p></speech>

I want to make one final point.  The pandemic obviously brought about an enormous change in the requirements of policing in Ireland and the work the Department had to do in order to adjust to facilitate that.  One observation is that I felt there was a significant rise in the level of substance use by younger members of society in Ireland, which is extraordinarily concerning to me, particularly when it comes to the use of what we would consider class A drugs, such as cocaine, among young members of society.  I am hearing about a lot of usage by teenagers and this has been reported to me through my constituency office.  This is extremely concerning.</p> <p>  I want to put on record that this is something we need to try to get some degree of control over.  I do not wish to put across the position that this can be eliminated and, obviously, it cannot be.  However, it is the case, unfortunately, that drug use is rampant in Ireland, particularly among younger members of society.  While that is a topic of much debate, when it comes to more serious drugs it is a huge concern.  The Department has to try to find more useful ways and, instead of trying to put people in prison, to try to guide young people away from substance abuse and drug use.  It needs to find more proactive ways of getting people off the streets and away from dealing drugs.  That is very important.  We need to re-evaluate this through education programmes, rather than the stick approach, which, unfortunately, is not working.</p> <p>  Garda&iacute; are under immense pressure and finding it very difficult to deal with gang-related crime, which has been an issue in Ireland over a long number of years.  I want to make the point to the Department, the Secretary General, the assistant secretary general and all of the officials here that we have a lot of work to do to prevent people from ending up in prison and in situations of addiction.  Unfortunately, from what I have seen and what I have heard through my office, this is a huge problem that is going to have huge knock-on consequences for people's mental health and the growth and development of young people in Ireland in general.</p></speech>

The Department is a very active participant in the national drugs strategy that is led by the Department of Health.  That health-led approach is something we are very committed to and the Garda probably outlined to the committee its increased use of the adult caution scheme in regard to this, rather than criminalising people.  Obviously, garda&iacute; enforce this area very strictly in regard to large-scale importation and so forth.  They have had a lot of success over the last couple of years and I am sure recent events will help to support that.

There are nine counties, including Laois and Offaly, that do not have even a single bed, despite all of the attendant difficulties which public representatives and others come across.  What is the current situation with the budget?  Am I correct to say there are only 140 beds in the State?  That is very low.</p></speech>

There is a view under the Istanbul Convention as to how many beds, what distance and all that kind of thing.  When it comes down to the practice, it is not 100% as straightforward as that.  I agree there is an under-provision at the moment and we will be working on that.  We are committed to making a huge difference on this.</p></speech>

When victims of domestic violence leave, often taking children with them, they are sent 60 or 70 miles away across two or three counties to a refuge.  Their children are taken away from schools, from social workers and, very importantly, from family support, the GP and all other services.  It creates chaos, and that is the only way I can describe it.  It is making it difficult for people to leave those situations.  Even in genuine cases of domestic violence, unfortunately, victims often make their way back, hoping things will change.  There is always that hope.</p></speech>

Offaly has a different plan, by the way, although I do not want to go into it in detail.  Offaly has a plan that involves three locations and it is trying to operate a different system for domestic violence.  That is the plan going forward and it has been shared with me.  Nonetheless, we badly need one refuge for the two counties of Laois and Offaly.</p></speech>

The third is from Inland Fisheries Ireland, as well as the 2020 financial statements.  It is a clear audit opinion.  The fourth is that of Legal Aid Board.  It is a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control relating to the level of resourcing of internal audit and to non-compliance with procurement rules.  The fifth is the Public Trustee for Ireland, which is a function established under the Land Act of 1903.</p><p>It concerns the 2021 financial statements, and there is a clear audit opinion.

The responses to my questions on the Shane O'Farrell case were very frustrating.  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice indicated a number of times that she could not comment on the questions I was asking because, if I am correct, a statutory inquiry was ongoing.  There is no statutory inquiry; there is a scoping inquiry that has no statutory powers whatsoever.  The Secretary General indicated on a number of occasions that she would provide some written responses, but this committee should have a view on expenditure on trying to find ways to avoid delivering a public inquiry into this matter that is obviously necessary.  In the follow-up correspondence, will the secretariat make that point and ask for full information?  Will it also ask the Department, following on from the completion of the scoping inquiry, which we hope will be sooner rather than later, to give the timeframe it envisages if a public inquiry is initiated?  What is the timeframe for the establishment of such an inquiry?</p></speech>

I do not buy that.  The questions will be on the record.  The Secretary General indicated on a number of occasions that she may provide a note of the matter.  As well as asking for the information, we should point out that the scoping inquiry should not be a reason not to answer the questions.  Second, could we get a view from the Secretary General on the timeframe for establishing a public inquiry if one is to be established?</p></speech>

Correspondence group B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up on meetings of this committee.  No. 1147B, from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, dated 24 March 2022, provides information requested by the committee regarding remuneration for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.  Before opening the matter to the floor, I will address the next flagged because the two are related.</p> <p>  No. 1149B, from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 25 March 2022, also provides information requested by the committee regarding the remuneration of the new CEO of Horse Racing Ireland.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.  These items were flagged by Deputy Carthy and me.</p></speech>

It appears to me that the justification for a salary above the scale previously set down was justified from a business case presented by Horse Racing Ireland itself.  The new CEO was appointed before the new salary was approved.  I would love to know what would have happened if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had not approved the new salary.  Would the CEO have stepped down?  If not, there would have been no need for the increased salary in the first place.  It is public money.  I do not know whether we can secure a route to assert whether the salary was justified and necessary and represented value for money.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could point us in the direction we need to go to seek clarification.  I am aware representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be before us shortly.  Perhaps that is the best avenue but I am open to direction.</p></speech>

Did NewERA advise on recruiting or was it just on the salary?</p> <p>  Another issue arose over a car that was declined.  I believe this pertains to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need to make inquiries into what transpired.  A salary is one thing but an overall package is entirely different.  What happened?  It is a bit too open-ended for my liking.</p> <p>  The second last paragraph on the second page of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform states that, in line with the statutory remit referenced, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine sought an independent assessment by NewERA of the remuneration proposed by Horse Racing Ireland.  Following its assessment of the proposal of Horse Racing Ireland, NewERA recommended that the proposed salary of &euro;190,773 be approved.  It appears that the basis for this seems to have been the salary of the outgoing person and that there is established custom and practice in relation to that.  That actually raises another issue, concerning, for example, the salary scales of the Secretaries General and the deviation.  Is what I am referring to a standard now?  The response is coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Where there is a deviation, is it now going to be the basis for why a salary should commence at a particular level, that of the previous incumbent?  For example, if the Secretary General of the Department of Health moved out of that role and somebody else moved in, would that person&rsquo;s salary represent the standard set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  I would like some clarification on that.</p></speech>

As I said, there are then other questions because the appointment had been made prior to the formal approval being granted.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly said, these decisions can subsequently be used as justification for future decisions, so it is important we pursue this issue to find out how exactly we arrived at this point.  It does not appear to be the type of robust analysis we would expect of NewERA.</p></speech>

Regarding the car, I think what was applied for was a car allowance, which, effectively, would be a payment made to the chief executive as part of his or her salary, and there would be benefit-in-kind taxation of the allowance, but that was declined.  What was agreed was that a company car would be provided, presumably on the basis that this person would be travelling around to racecourses and so on.  That was that aspect of it.</p> <p>  NewERA is part of the NTMA and has a specific focus to advise Departments on commercial State bodies and issues that arise in that regard.  Its role, therefore, was to examine the case that was made regarding the salary and to express a view on it.  Because NewERA is part of the NTMA, it has a role that can be examined by the committee when it has the NTMA before it to explore a little more what it does, the nature of the advice it gives, how it arrives at its conclusions and so on.</p> <p>  Finally, my understanding is that when a pay level is determined, it is determined in relation to the post and not in relation to the individual.  The example given was the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  Anybody filling that post will attract that salary.  It was not a salary determination for an individual.  Similarly, here, it was, I think, the lower salary scale that was originally approved in, let us say, 2012 or whatever.  It was never applied.  The application was, effectively, to revise the pay rate for the role to the higher level.  That was agreed, or at least recommended, by NewERA and approved by the Ministers.</p></speech>

I wanted to flag this correspondence, particularly because it relates to previous correspondence and engagement with RT&Eacute;, specifically No. R1198B from the Department of Social Protection.  It is about bogus self-employment and RTE workers' cases.  I do not feel the Department of Social Protection's related correspondence adequately addresses our question as to why it cannot provide interim updates on the outcomes of those cases where a decision has not been reached.  That is very clear in its correspondence.  I suspect it might relate to the fact that it has been reported that RT&Eacute; is appealing those decisions that have gone against it to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  I would see that as a way of delaying justice for those concerned by up to six months.  From our engagements with RT&Eacute; and the reports in the media, I still find it bizarre that RT&Eacute; has committed to back pay of up to only four years and-----</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; has committed to back pay of up to only four years and nothing at all in respect of holiday pay or pension contributions.  I do not see how it could get away with that.  I know the Chairman has referred to the other correspondence, but could we write to both the Department of Social Protection and RT&Eacute; to ask them both whether RT&Eacute; has appealed every single case that went against it or just a handful of cases?  We should have been getting those interim updates because there seems to be a lack of understanding that RT&Eacute; exploited these workers.  I for one would not accept Ms Forbes's assertion that this is a legacy issue because RT&Eacute; continues to deny these workers their entitlements by unnecessarily prolonging the process.  My big fear is that if these cases end up in court, I have no doubt but that a future director general of RT&Eacute; will tell a future Committee of Public Accounts that spiralling legal costs are a legacy matter.  That may well be Ms Forbes's legacy.  Can we write to both and ask-----</p></speech>

I know databases go out of date if one does not continue to populate them but is there a role for retrieving some of the information that was there?  It was very well used.

An additional line of inquiry might be to ask the Central Statistics Office what its data source for the non-profit sector will be in the absence of Benefacts.

This relates to the second-hand car market.  There is a world of difference between second-hand electric vehicles and other second-hand vehicles.  If one buys a second-hand petrol car with 60,000 miles on the clock, one will have a rough idea of the lifespan of the car but if one buys an electric vehicle, the battery is the issue.  It is very expensive to replace.  It seems that targets are being set at national level in the context of our climate obligations but it is then stated that it is a market function.  Maybe the committee should write to the Department of Finance regarding the vehicle registration tax, VRT, implications in respect of second-hand electric vehicles.  There will be implications in that regard in the context of reaching our targets and the policy.  That will obviously have an implication in the context of fines and all sorts of things.</p></speech>

One could have this crazy scenario in order to avoid any questions on a particular line of expenditure that one would simply move it to another Department and then no historical questions can be asked because the new Department says that was historical and the old one says it can no longer answer questions in relation to that because it has moved.</p> <p>  It appears that these issues of emergency accommodation are arising all the time.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in the new Department that is dealing with these areas, confirmed in the D&aacute;il today that the catering firm Aramark has been given a contract to provide meals to Ukrainian refugees and that there has been no procurement process employed at all.  That raises a red flag to me.  Every time there is an emergency and there are poor people in difficulty someone manages to make a lot of money out of it and there are always question marks in respect of the process employed.</p> <p>  In respect of this correspondence, I suggest that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requesting whether or not it has evaluated this move on the part of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and whether it has a view on this contract.  We should seek from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the full details of the contract - the timeframe, the money involved and the safeguards that have been put in place.</p> <p>  It strikes me that it is never a set of local catering companies that get these contracts.  It is always huge corporations and in this instance, one that has had a lot of question marks with regard to previous ones.</p></speech>

The proposed action is to note and publish it and to forward the Department's response, along with the correspondence that gave rise to it, which was R0947, to the Joint Committee on Health for its information and any action it may deem appropriate.

I note the Department had made specific reference to legislation by Deputies O'Rourke and Cullinane that would seek to address the issue.  I suggest the most appropriate follow-up by this committee might be to refer it to the Joint Committee on Health.</p></speech>

I completely understand Deputy Munster's frustration and the frustration of the employees who have waited a very long time.  It is not only a question of recognising the other issues, such as holiday and other entitlements and backdating some of what was found.  I am not sure the Scope section, at the same time, can give us an interim report.  They are pretty much saying that they are not going to.</p></speech>

I have seen some of the work that they have done previously.</p> <p>  We would not benefit from a piecemeal approach.  On proper updates, I am comfortable with what they are proposing here in terms of that particular Department's role in this because it is a serious review.  If it was coming from Revenue, that would be the view we would take as well.</p> <p>  I completely understand the frustrations in relation to how RT&Eacute; is handling the situation.

I propose that the committee write to both RT&Eacute; and the Department of Social Protection to ask has RT&Eacute; appealed every case that went against it or is it only a handful of cases where there are technical issues or whatever.  It would be interesting to know from both because the Department's response might be related to the fact that RT&Eacute; is appealing and prolonging shamefully the issue for the workers.  It would be no harm writing to both to find that out.</p></speech>

I suggest that we seek that clarification as to whether the case of each person who is employed by RT&Eacute; on a contract basis was examined.</p></speech>

First, I find the position of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, on this matter utterly lacking in substance of explanation.  They told us in December that they would be ready to start installing the CCTVs in January, the beginning of the new season, and that was New Year's Day.</p><p>It was stated that it would take six weeks.  Now we are informed that it could take almost six months.  That is another four or five months.  That beggars belief, particularly when we think of the benefits that CCTV monitoring would have for the industry and, more importantly, those tasked with regulating it.  We cannot help but wonder why there is delay after delay.  It raises more questions than answers.  It is very frustrating that each time we ask for an update, we are told it is happening.  It is being kicked further and further down the road, however.  I ask that we request a further update by June.  I hope I am proved wrong, but I suspect the board will kick this further down the road for reasons best known to itself at this stage.</p></speech>

Can we ask the Department of Health what has been expended to date, including on the design?  We have been waiting since 2018.  There was the Mulvey report.  There are very serious concerns about ownership and control of the national maternity hospital.

I raised it with the Garda Commissioner, and I raised it again this morning with regard to the memorandum of understanding.  Can we ask it for an update on whether the memorandum of understanding has been signed?  There is an impediment to the establishment of the new corporate enforcement agency as a consequence of not having this.  It has been given extra powers but Garda resources are critical.  This was one of the fault lines when we were debating the legislation.  Can we get an update on this?</p></speech>

In the letter I set out that the committee would write to the Department of Health to request further information on the proposed appointment or secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan to Trinity College and that the information would include how the decision was made, who made the decision, who was involved in the decision-making, what was the expected salary and expenses and what were the total expenses in terms of offices and any secretarial backup or anything else.  It would also include the total cost involved for the Department over the period of five years and what official processes and guidelines the Department has transfers and secondments.  Since the matter became one of public interest, the issue of processes and guidelines to which the Department operates is crucial.  I am not clear about it and I do not know whether anybody else on the committee is clear about it.  It is important that we do this.  If the committee agrees we will request it from the Department of Health.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The Department will come before the committee in the near future and that will also provide an opportunity.</p> <p>  No other items of correspondence have been flagged for consideration.</p> <p>  With regard to our work programme, the following engagements are confirmed for May.  We will have the Department of Finance on 5 May, University of Limerick on 12 May, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May and, as I mentioned, the Department of Health on 26 May.  I will set out some proposals for June and then open the floor to members.  As 2 June falls in a non-sitting week, the next available date is 9 June.  I propose that we schedule a meeting with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on that date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

It is on the work programme and responsibility for direct provision now resides with that Department.</p> <p>  I also propose that we schedule an engagement with the National Pediatric Hospital Development Board in June, with representatives from the Department of Health.  The board was last before the committee in July last year when we examined its 2019 financial statements.  Is it agreed that we schedule this engagement?  Agreed.  It is very frustrating that we are denied the information we need.</p> <p>  Before Easter, we agreed to examine local government oversight and accountability.  I suggest that we also look at this in June.  With the agreement of members we will consider how we might approach this when we meet next.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have had some discussion about who we want to come before the committee.  There are a number of parties.</p> <p>  Other bodies on the work programme include the Department of Education regarding the special report on education and training boards.  There is also the Central Bank and Revenue Commissioners on the outstanding chapter on assessment and collection of insurance compensation fund levies.  There is also Horse Racing Ireland and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board.</p><p>If there are any other matters members wish to raise, they can put them forward now or at the next meeting.  As usual, we will run it through like that.  Members can let the clerk know.  If there are any specific issues regarding any of the groups coming in over the next month, members can let the clerk know so we can put them on the agenda and notify the guests of them.</p><p> That concludes consideration of the work programme for today.  The last item on the public agenda for today is any other business.  Does any member wish to raise anything?</p></speech>

We did not receive any response.  We wrote again on 8 April and that question was put again.  I propose that we write again requesting that information.  I remind the committee that this information related to the waiving of the substantial increase in salary allocated to the post.  A public statement was made by the Secretary General on his appointment to the role on a permanent basis that he was waiving that portion of his salary.  The public and this committee have a right to know for how long that took place, bearing in mind that whatever portion he did not take was available to the Department for other purposes.  I propose that, following the meeting, we write again and continue to seek that information.</p></speech>

Under the Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community, published by the Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, face masks should continue to be worn when moving around the campus and during the committee meeting, except when speaking.  This will help reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.  I ask for the full co-operation of witnesses and members in this regard.  Are the minutes of the private and public meetings of 27 and 28 April 2022 agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p><p> In the absence of the Chairman today, I as Vice Chairman do solemnly declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and ability execute the office of Vice Chairman of the committee without fear or favour, apply the rules as laid down by the House in an impartial and fair manner, maintain order and uphold the rights and privileges of members in accordance with the Constitution and Standing Orders.</p><p> Before we begin I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of a witness physically present or who gives evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of identifiable persons or entities, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with such a direction.</p><p> Before I hear from our witnesses, I propose that we publish their opening statements on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the witnesses from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  We have engaged with some of them before.  I welcome Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe, chairperson, Commissioner Emily Logan, Commissioner Hugh Hume, and Ms Aileen Healy, director of administration.  Mr. Justice MacCabe will have ten minutes for his opening remarks.  Then we will have questions and comments from members.  Each member will have about ten minutes and may speak more than once if they so wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.656" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#B00200"><p>I have been chairperson of GSOC since late January this year. As the Vice Chairman has indicated, I am joined today by my fellow commissioners Ms. Emily Logan and Mr. Hugh Hume, who joined GSOC in February last year.  Mr. Hume has a background in policing at a senior level in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and served as deputy chief inspector in the Garda Inspectorate.  Ms Logan was Ireland's first Ombudsman for Children and served as the first chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  We are also joined by Ms Aileen Healy, our director of administration.  We will be happy to discuss our work in 2021, the annual report for which I understand will go to Cabinet shortly and will be published soon.  It will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before it is published.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss our plans in the context of the significant institutional reforms in policing oversight that will affect the work of GSOC in the coming years.  We will do our very best to discuss and answer questions on our annual reports for 2018 to 2020, but members will appreciate that given we were not around at the time, it may not be so easy.  If members have any detailed questions we are not in a position to answer, we will take a note and come back to the committee in writing as soon as we can.</p> <p>  A few weeks ago we appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Members may have taken the opportunity to have a look at the report, so while I do not propose to rehearse the matters discussed at that committee, my colleagues and I will do our best to give members such information as we can and, while GSOC is not perfect, I hope the committee will be satisfied the service we provide is rigorous, comprehensive and professional.</p> <p>  GSOC was established in 2007 following the passing of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  We were mandated to provide independent oversight of policing in Ireland.  Our current staff complement is 135, and our most recent budget allocation in 2021 was &euro;11.272 million.  Working from our headquarters in Dublin and regional offices in Cork and Longford, GSOC is the vital interface between the people and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We operate in 26 counties, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  The work is challenging and complex, and results depend on the skill and dedication of our staff, each of whom carries a heavy caseload.  I would add that it depends also on the co-operation we have from other interested stakeholders in the investigative process.</p> <p>  Our primary job is to investigate complaints from the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We also conduct investigations into matters referred to us by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, by the Minister for Justice and by the Policing Authority.  We also conduct investigations into matters we judge to be in the public interest to investigate.  We do not do this off our own bat but under the statutory mandate that has been delivered to us by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  We do not prosecute garda&iacute; nor do we discipline them.  If our investigations lead us to conclude that a crime may have been committed, we send a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions which, as the State's independent prosecuting authority, must decide whether a prosecution is warranted.  If our conclusion is that no crime has been committed but there is an issue of neglect of duty or misconduct not amounting to a crime, we pass the file to the Garda Commissioner whose responsibility it is to impose such disciplinary sanction as he thinks fit.  I ask the committee to note, again, that this is not a decision we take off our own bat but one that arises from our statutory mandate.  In certain circumstances, our statutory mandate permits GSOC to refer to the Commissioner for investigation complaints that come in directly.  In addition, we are one the designated bodies to which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can make protected disclosures.  Where in the course of our investigations we identify systemic issues, we make recommendations to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, advising it as to the need to improve policing policy and practice.  Since 2018, we have also operated a local intervention initiative that has facilitated the speedy resolution of some complaints without the need for formal investigation.  That is an innovation that has been extremely successful over recent years.</p> <p>  By their very nature, some investigations are straightforward and some are not.  Some can be dealt with quickly and some require a commitment in terms of staff, resources and time that we know can be frustrating to everyone concerned.  This is understandable from the point of view of complainants, who are anxious as to the outcome, and for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose careers are, in effect, on the line.  As we are bound by the principle of due process and the need to respect human rights principles, we cannot and will not prioritise speed at the expense of rigour in completing our investigations.</p> <p>  The period being considered by the committee today has been busy for GSOC.  The volume and complexity of our cases have increased year on year, and the issue of resourcing has been the subject of constant concern for the organisation.  Staff numbers have increased in recent years, but so has the volume of complaints we receive.  Resourcing will continue to represent a significant challenge for GSOC in the context of the additional powers and responsibilities we anticipate the Oireachtas will mandate when it comes to consider the policing Bill.</p> <p>  The period under discussion also covers the upheaval faced by everyone in Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Covid obliged us to make rapid adaptations to our working practices to ensure the continued and safe delivery of our functions as an essential service for the public.</p><p>GSOC's staff adapted admirably to the challenges posed by COVID, and in 2020 and 2021 we succeeded in delivering service to the public, including fielding a significantly higher volume of complaints.  In that context, it is perhaps a bit strange, because in the context of Covid we had to close down our public office.  People did not have a walk-in facility.  For some period of time, we did not have a telephone facility because of the transition from a full office situation to people working remotely.  However, in that period, nonetheless, the number of complaints we received and dealt with increased.  It appears the issue of Covid had ramifications that did not extend to stopping people from making complaints to GSOC.</p><p> The period 2018 to 2021 saw reform in policing and in policing oversight take centre stage with the publication of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in 2018.  The most significant result for GSOC is the recent policing, security and community safety Bill.  This is mammoth legislation that proposes not only sweeping changes in the law but fundamental change in the composition and mandate of GSOC.  We welcome this draft legislation.  It fills a clearly defined and long-signalled gap in Ireland's policing accountability infrastructure.  Transition to the proposed new structure and arrangements are my focus.  It is my brief to ensure the transition to whatever new organisational structure that is mandated by the members and their Oireachtas colleagues is seamless.  To that end, a cross-organisational transition project group has been established to co-ordinate the work that needs to be done, including liaison with the Department of Justice, a thorough structural review of GSOC, and detailed business analysis and planning.  A key theme of this work will be resourcing.  GSOC will have additional powers and functions, which will, by definition, involve more work, which will in turn require the organisation be adequately staffed with appropriately skilled people and technological backup if it is to be fit for purpose.  The complexities of investigating wrongdoing in the modern world we inhabit do not come cheap, but it is my belief the Minister and the Department are alert to the ongoing resource issues faced at present by GSOC and will support us as we look ahead to transitioning to a reformed ombudsman institution, which is one of the features of the new legislation.</p><p> At the hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts a few weeks ago, I invited the Chair, with some members of the committee, to come visit us at our HQ.  I offer the same invitation to this committee today.  I ask members to come see us, meet the staff, listen to them and see the work they do.  In the few short months I have been here, they have impressed me with their dedication, energy and enthusiasm.  It is my belief the committee members will also be impressed.  I thank members for the opportunity to come to the meeting today.</p></speech>

We will come back to him on that.  His opening statement is a very good summary of the work that GSOC has been involved in over recent years and, particularly under Mr. Justice MacCabe's stewardship, over recent months.  I will open up questioning from committee members.  Some are attending online and some are attending in person.  I know Senator Eugene Murphy and Deputy O'Donoghue have other parliamentary business.  I am not sure if they will be joining us in person, online or at all.  Members may come and go during the meeting.  The first member to ask a question is Senator Buttimer.</p></speech>

I thank GSOC for the work it is doing.  Indeed, I pay tribute to the work done by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the Covid period, when they were at the forefront of our State's response to Covid-19.  Very often they had to perform tasks that in ordinary times they would not dream of doing.  I thank them most sincerely.  In the context of Mr. Justice MacCabe's remarks today, he spoke about the complexities of investigating wrongdoing and how it does not come cheap.  I ask Mr. Justice MacCabe to distil those comments further for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.660" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice Rory MacCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#C00400"><p>I will explain it in the following way.  When I came in last January, the first thing I did was to ask to be briefed on the cases that were to hand and whether any of them had been around for a long time.  Basically, I asked if there were any unexploded bombs around of which I needed to be aware.  I was then briefed by different groups in GSOC.  Listening to them, I asked how it was taking so long to close cases.  There were cases that may have been going on for two or three years.  I asked how it was possible they were not closed and when they would be closed.  It is only when we dig down into the situation that we see the complexity that is involved.</p> <p>  A complaint arrives in many different ways.  A member of the public can knock on the door at GSOC and come in.  A complaint can be made by telephone call or arrive by email.  Though the website, members of the public can access the online claims form, which is available not just in English and Irish but in eight other languages.  Members of the public can also come to a Garda station to make a complaint.  That is an issue to which I will return to later.  It may have its own particular resonance.  The first point of contact will be a caseworker.  Caseworkers are people who are trained in examining cases.  Their responsibility is to look at cases and to recommend whether a case is admissible in the first instance.  Once the assessment process is done, it then proceeds either to investigation or it might get sent to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The powers the investigators have in GSOC are similar to the powers An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has.</p> <p>  Our instruction manual in GSOC is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and, to a certain extent, the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  They form the instruction manual and we are bound by it.  Behind that is the Constitution, because the European Convention on Human Rights Act and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act were mandated by the Oireachtas.  The Constitution is a document that is mandated by the people.  It is enshrined in the Constitution that due process is something to which the members or I, or anybody who is unfortunate enough to have to face the courts of Ireland, is entitled to as a right.  Things like being informed of the charges involved, if there are charges, being entitled to legal representation, and being entitled to a fair trial, if it comes to it, in course of law are all rights everybody has.  They are rights that accused persons in the normal criminal courts, as it were, are entitled to.  They are also rights to which members of the Garda who are accused of wrongdoing are entitled.</p> <p>  The investigation process may involve interviews and cross-interviews.  When one set of interviews is completed, it may be necessary to go back to the start and reinterivew people based on information that has arisen lately.  That is not typical, but it is not abnormal.  We could be faced with a situation where one case could absorb the entire resources of GSOC if it is to be properly investigated.  In a situation where investigators typically have a caseload of about 60 cases each, perhaps members can understand the impact on resources if even one investigator is dedicated full-time to one investigation.  It is often a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul in terms of the resources we have.  It is almost impossible to be prescriptive as to how long an investigation is going to take.</p> <p>  Once the investigation is complete, the report comes to us as the commissioners.  The way we operate at the moment is that we do a week on each.  For example, Ms Logan might be on, making decisions this week, I will be on next week, and Mr. Hume will be on the following week.  Once the investigation is complete, the senior investigating officer will submit a report to the commission for decision.  That may be a decision to discontinue the investigation because we do not consider that wrongdoing has happened, a decision to pass it to the Garda Commissioner if we consider it a disciplinary matter, or a decision to submit it to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.</p><p>Once it goes out of our hands, we are basically at the mercy of the Commissioner.  While there is a requirement that disciplinary matters be dealt with within a specific time, it is often not possible to comply with that.  Once we send the file to the DPP, it is within the discretion of the DPP to decide when to come back to us with the direction.  The DPP has other fish to fry apart from us.  That is a flavour of the investigative process.  Once it comes back-----</p></speech>

Mr. Justice MacCabe has spoken today about the complexity and the resourcing issue.  If we asked a question on the level of resourcing, and it may not be a fair question or Mr. Justice MacCabe might say it is not pertinent to today's discussion, has he a response to the level of resourcing he thinks might be adequate in terms of personnel or a budget?  The complexity of cases to which Mr. Justice MacCabe referred, and Ms Healy wrote in correspondence about the increased complexity of many cases brought to the ombudsman's attention, raises serious concerns about GSOC's capacity to deal with them.  Is there a role for us as a committee to advocate with the Department and the Minister in Government on GSOC's behalf?</p></speech>

When this Bill was debated in 2005 by the then Minister for Justice, now Senator Michael McDowell.  He indicated that if we were to carry out all the investigations that were required, and he said this in the context that he did not intend to set up a huge quango at the time, he would envisage that the organisation would need between 150 and 200 investigators if it were to operate correctly.  At the moment we have about 60 investigators divided over three offices in Dublin, Longford and Cork.  It very much depends on the mandate that comes out of this draft legislation.  We will make certain assumptions in the course of the transition and Ms Logan will talk about the transition in that context.  We are making certain assumptions and working on the basis we will need that.  It might seem like a reasonable question to ask how many investigators we need.  The reality is we do not know because we do not know how much extra work we are going to be asked to do.</p></speech>

In his comments Mr. Justice MacCabe talked about three issues in regard to resources.  The first is finance, the second is human resources, and the third is expertise.  To give an up-to-date figure, this morning members will have seen the Central Statistics Office publish its statistics for 2021 on victims of sexual violence in this country.  It is not news to anyone that 82% of the victims of sexual violence in this country are female, but what is new and different is that 56% of all victims of sexual assault and sexual violence in this country are children - people under the age of 18.  That is not so well-known.  We have developing patterns and changes in allegations that are coming to us that mean we will have to respond differently in future.</p></speech>

I have one final question.  In table 5 on page 7 of the briefing we got for the meeting today, it is stated that 4,615 queries were handled in 2021.  The number of allegations dealt with in that the complaints were closed was 2,902.  Am I to extrapolate from that that almost 1,700 cases are not closed?  Am I right or wrong in that?</p></speech>

They do not all actually translate into complaints.  Approximately just over 2,000 of those translated into complaints.  The figure of 2,902 for the complaints closed actually included some complaints from previous years.  We are not exactly counting apples and oranges there.</p></speech>

We do not dismiss it.  Much work goes into making sure we have full information before we make a decision that something is not admissible.  The figures that Ms Healy is giving are figures that happen after our casework staff have gone through the process of examining everything that comes in.</p></speech>

That is working out very well.  It is considered both by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ourselves to be a very effective and timely way of dealing with service level complaints from members of the public.  A member of the public might contact us about an issue that does not in itself necessarily indicate wrongdoing by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It may just be that it has not been a good service.  We are able to pass that in a semi-formal way to an inspector in the local area who will deal with the matter and resolve it very quickly and, it is to be hoped, to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p> <p>  To give an example from our most recent report where a member of the public complained that their immigration status was not being progressed expeditiously, we passed that to the inspector who was able to establish that it was actually a resourcing issue.  It was not a case of an individual behaving badly.  They were able to progress the immigration status for the individual very quickly.  That left the individual very happy, and rather than going into the formal, structured, due process approach the Chair has discussed, it meant the member of the public got a result in a quick manner.  Last year, 173 issues were resolved in that way.  It works really well and it is to be hoped it will roll forward into the new legislation as well.</p></speech>

I listened to Mr. Justice MacCabe and one thing that struck me as a red flag was on protected disclosures and how they are dealt with.  Obviously, the commission is dealing with protected disclosures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, would the commission also deal with protected disclosures from the public that would also involve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p><p>I am very interested in this because I spent the past 18 months looking at the changes in the protected disclosures legislation in Europe.  Yesterday we worked on practically signing off on the new Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2022.  Can the public send in whatever would be a protected disclosure that involves An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or even the Courts Service?  Would GSOC deal with them directly?</p><p> Mr. Justice MacCabe spoke about rights and how everybody is entitled to rights and that the certain stages in this.  Mr. Hume said that in some cases GSOC get complaints, which it passes on to the relevant sergeant or superintendent in a station who will deal with it.  Once the local officer takes it on, does GSOC get feedback to let it know whether the issues have been resolved?  The reason I ask that goes back to the original question on protected disclosures.  Until this Bill is passed and signed off on, there is very little within the current protected disclosure law to establish whether the rights of a whistleblower or whistleblowers have been respected, whether they have been protected and whether the issues they raised have been dealt with.  There is still no follow-up to establish whether that has happened.  Is there a link from the top down and a link back up so that there is harmony and everyone knows what is happening?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.678" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Hume" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#E00200"><p>I will deal with the second point first.  In regard to protected disclosers, we are mandated to investigate protected disclosers made to us under section 5 of the Act, and we do that.  Last year, we received 20 protected disclosers into the organisation.  Currently, we have approximately 69 investigations in hand that would come under the gambit of a protected disclosure.  The protection of the rights and the anonymity of a protected disclosure made to GSOC is one of our primary functions when we receive it.  We take this extremely seriously and place a great deal of emphasis on this.  We have a dedicated protected disclosure unit, which is of a very high standard.  In fact, it leads the way in Ireland and is a member of the European Alliance for Integrity in terms of setting standards and processes across Europe.  It operates to a very high standard and is involved in helping other Departments develop the transposition of new legislation.</p> <p>  Human rights and the protection of the whistleblower disclosure are at the forefront of everything that is done in regard to that matter.  If a person contacts the commission, only the three of us are allowed to access the communication and make a decision as to what happens next.  That is sacrosanct, of which I can assure the Deputy.</p> <p>  In regard to learning from the protected disclosure, and I am responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s points in reverse order, we do a number of things.  We have moved to take cases through the DPP to court.  We have taken cases through discipline and we have provided systemic learning to the Garda Commissioner to say there was nothing criminally wrong and nothing of a disciplinary nature but there were some organisational structural failings that need to be considered.  All three of us have written to the Commissioner identifying specific issues that we believe need to be addressed.</p> <p>  Moving to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question on whether a member of the public can contact us in respect of a protected disclosure legislation, or in respect of the Courts Service, the answer to that is quite simply "No", because a protected disclosure is in regard to an employee, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who wants to tell us about wrongdoing he or she has observed while an employee within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a member of the public wants to report a matter to us, he or she can do as part of our complaints series but he or she does not get extended the rights, anonymity and protection of a protected disclosure unless he or she was a member of that organisation when the wrongdoing was observed or he or she became aware of it.  The legislation is geared towards employees rather than more widely.</p> <p>  People who make complaints to us get protections.  We look after the data and we ensure they are properly protected but at some stage their details have to be released to the person we are investigating and they do not have those protections.</p></speech>

I will give a hypothetical scenario.  Let us say an individual was arrested, was brought before the court, was sentenced and was sent to prison and had underlying problems, such as mental health problems, ADHD or illiteracy, and did not get the proper care, treatment or even legal representation while in prison awaiting a second hearing.  Can a concerned person come to GSOC with that information?  Has GSOC the power to deal with that or where would the person go?</p></speech>

Our remit is limited to behaviour of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If prior to going to that court or prison, there were inappropriate behaviours while in Garda custody, we would certainly examine those issues.  However, once a person passes to the custody of the Prison Service, that is primarily the Inspector of Prisons' remit.</p></speech>

Such a case was reported in the past week or so.  Someone would have recourse to the courts in any event for a remedy in that regard.</p></speech>

Specifically in regard to mental health or people in detention, our teams will go out.  Our teams have been out to Oberstown Children Detention Campus to hear from young people under the age of 18, and into prisons to take statements from individuals who may be detained there as well.</p></speech>

They are under a great deal of pressure and it is very important to come before the committee and explain the work.  I have certainly learned a great deal today.  I also wish to put on record my thanks to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who go above and beyond every day of the week, in particular those who did Trojan work during Covid-19.</p> <p>  Before I became a Deputy, I worked at senior level in a multinational organisation so I am very familiar with putting together business cases for additional headcounts and business continuity planning.  I am impressed by the ability of GSOC, as an organisation, to put forward the business case for an increase in headcount.  I was quite struck to see in the briefing documentation that in 2018, the organisation grew by 30% which is quite an achievement, both from the perspective of being able to put forward that case to get that funding but also from a recruitment and human resources perspective to be able to make it work in such a short space of time.</p> <p>  I note from Mr. Justice MacCabe&rsquo;s contribution that he mentioned that 60 of the workforce of 123 are investigators.  I was struck by the fact that that is approximately 50%.  As the team grew, how did GSOC prioritise in terms of investigators versus administration staff and other personnel?  Is that 50:50 balance the sweet spot?</p> <p>  In regard to business continuity planning, Covid-19 was the ultimate test for every organisation in the country.</p><p>All of the members provide essential services, but in many cases they may have had to work from home, which was a big transition.  I know there were some teething issues for everybody, but I would like to learn a little more about the phone line issue that was mentioned and whether there were any repercussions.</p><p> I am also curious about the categorisation of cases, and there was very interesting information in the briefing document on the categorisation of cases by source.  Is there any categorisation that happens by complexity, with category A, B or C indicating higher workloads, for example, and cases that are likely to take longer?  Could the committee have visibility of that because it would help in our role as advocates?  As new Bills are introduced and additional responsibilities, as the witnesses indicate, are put on the organisation, additional resources would need to come along with that.</p><p> With regard to the new policing security and community safety Bill, has there been any preliminary work to pre-empt changes that will happen within the organisation as a result of the change management, tendering for new information and communications technology or anything like that?  It might help future-proof the process ahead of schedule, if that is possible.  Those are my questions.  They take in the 50-50 balance within the workforce, the small query around phone lines, the categorisation of work cases and any pre-emptive work the organisation is doing or perhaps could be doing to future-proof the ombudsman's office.</p></speech>

We had much success in 2018 in getting an additional 42 staff but, to be honest, it took us most of 2019 to recruit those 42 staff.  There is always staff turnover, with staff getting promoted or retiring.  There is a particular challenge not only in constantly replenishing our staff but also in getting staff with some of the specialist expertise we need.  The increasing complexity of our cases means we need more specialist skills and competencies.</p> <p>  For 2022 we get additional funding in the budget for staffing, and that means we will be able to recruit perhaps an extra 30 or more staff this year, and we are in the process of doing that.  This week we will have 140 staff and another nine investigators coming on board in the coming weeks.  We will be holding competitions to recruit more over the coming months.</p> <p>  This relates to some of the earlier questions as well and what we need to do in the context of the new legislation and the change in our remit we see coming.  In the coming weeks we will start an exercise to do a very thorough and comprehensive business analysis.  That will look at the work we have on hand, the processes and systems we have to do it, and what we need not just in terms of people and skills but also information and communications technology systems to deal with that future work.  We hope to put together some very comprehensive workforce planning with that and we hope it will in turn inform future estimated demands for the new organisation.</p></speech>

Initially, like most organisations, we sent the majority of our staff home.  It took a bit of time to provide them all with technology, such as laptops etc.  We did not allow our staff to take calls from their home locations because some of the calls staff get can be quite traumatic.  From a staff welfare perspective we thought it very important they would have supports in place.  As soon as we could we brought a small number of people back to the office and they fielded calls from the office on a rota basis.  Members of the public also called into us and could leave a message before we returned the call.</p></speech>

People would have got through and left a voice message.  Our call takers in the office the next morning would have picked up those messages and returned calls to the people who contacted us the previous day.  The Deputy also asked about the public office.  We closed the public office because of the public health restrictions.  The public office was reopened in October last year, when the restrictions started to be lifted.  We noticed there is not much of a demand for the public office anymore and people seem to have moved online, with 80% of our complaints now made online or by email.</p></speech>

They are subject to regular review by the three of us, and every six to eight weeks, the investigating officer will present on progress for a case.  Category C contains the most minor cases, perhaps related to discipline, and they are prescriptive in that they largely follow definitions of types of cases.  We are currently in the process of revisiting that and looking at international partners.  I spoke yesterday to representatives of the Independent Office of Police Conduct, IOPC, in England and Wales, which is our sister organisation, trying to understand what it sees as new and emerging threats from wrongdoing within policing.  We are moving to a threat, harm and risk-based approach where we look at the harm the allegation could cause to members of the public, society and confidence to policing.  It is a move to being more risk-based.  The incident in itself will not decide if the case becomes important.  It could come down to the vulnerability of the individual, their circumstances and the allegation being made.  It will be more nuanced and that will define our prioritisation of investigations.</p></speech>

Is there any bird's-eye view of estimating how much time goes into certain cases?  I appreciate that cases must be prioritised, but as they are prioritised, does the commission have any idea, based on their complexity, how long an investigator might have a case on the books?</p></speech>

Even at the end of a criminal investigation and it goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions, it may decide not to prosecute and we might start the process again as a discipline investigation under different regulations.

Before GSOC started, there was an unfortunate incident in the midlands where a young man was shot by member of the Garda response unit.  The initial investigation took place and then there was an inquest.  Then there was a judge-led inquiry, and that is effectively what GSOC would do.</p><p>That inquiry took three years and cost &euro;18 million, and that was one investigation.  That is just an example of the type of complexity that arises.</p><p> As far as the transition is concerned, the committee may have an interest in that and I might ask Ms Logan to talk to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.701" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#G00200"><p>On the transition to the new model, there are two key issues, the first of which relates to an entirely new governance model.  A three-person commission is appearing before the committee, whereas the draft legislation provides for one Garda ombudsman.  All of us who are appearing before the committee were appointed with an express mandate in our contracts to manage the transition, and our job is to prepare the organisation to move from being a three-person commission to having one ombudsman.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to streamlining the investigations, for which we set up a project group in July last year.  While the legislation is at pre-legislative scrutiny stage, we are not sitting back and waiting for the legislation.  Instead, we are proactively, to use the Deputy's expression, taking a pre-emptive strike.  We set up a project group of 19 people internally in the organisation last July, which looks at issues the committee has identified such as ICT that will support better data capture of the kind of work we are doing in order that we will have better analysis and better evidence for the decisions we are making.  We are confident that we are safely ahead of the legislation.</p> <p>  We have identified resources as a key issue, along with the issues of institutional independence and what is called the timeliness of investigations, which was mentioned earlier.  In the context of support from anybody who will end up voting on the Bill, I would ask them to be mindful of the question of timeliness.  Mr. Justice MacCabe referred to our reliance on, and co-operation with, other bodies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The legislation places an obligation on us to provide timely investigations, but we cannot do that without there being a similar obligation on the people with whom we need to co-operate for the investigations.</p> <p>  I assure the committee that as a commission, we are jointly responsible for the governance and executive management of the organisation and for the transition.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions, many of which follow on from those of other members.  To take up on what Deputy Higgins asked, it would be helpful, if we are making representations as a committee to ensure the ombudsman&rsquo;s office can be resourced more appropriately, to get some kind of statistical analysis of approximately how many more cases could be processed given an additional five, ten or 20 inspectors or whatever the case may be.  Judging by our guests' comments, that will be difficult because every case is different, but perhaps we could have some kind of a rough guide as to how many inspectors will be required to undertake a given volume of work, which might help us in our representations.</p><p>Given the level of work GSOC has carried out over recent years, we are all becoming more familiar with it as the years go by.  Will our guests outline the major gaps identified in Ireland's policing accountability?  Where are the major gaps we need to focus on?  It is a broad question.</p><p>To follow on from Deputy Buckley's line of questioning, how many protected disclosures have been made per annum over recent years?  Were any of those protected disclosures made within GSOC?  I do not think there was any last year, but our guests might indicate how many protected disclosures GSOC has dealt with internally over the preceding years.</p><p>The <i>Irish Examiner</i>reported a couple of weeks ago that a number of disclosures made to GSOC did not warrant further investigation, presumably for a variety of reasons.  The article stated a number of them had been sent to a board of inquiry.  How is that board constituted and who sits on it?  Is it internal within GSOC or is there some kind of external process with which we might not be familiar?</p></speech>

In 2021, we received 20 disclosures from workers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which takes our total number of investigations to some 69 ongoing disclosures at this time regarding potential wrongdoing within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  In the same year, we received no internal complaints.  Ms Healy might have the details for previous years.</p></speech>

In 2018, there were 24; in 2019, 31; and in 2020, 19.</p></speech>

In our most recent report on protected disclosures, we highlighted that we had sent four disciplinary files in 2021 to the Garda Commissioner.  He will consider them and, as Mr. Justice MacCabe stated, it is a matter for the Commissioner to decide whether there has been a breach of disciplinary standards.  If he decides that is the case, he will form a panel.  It is a matter for the Commissioner to establish that panel and then to review the decision of the panel.  We are not involved in rulings regarding discipline findings.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, when GSOC was being debated in the context of the 2005 Bill that ultimately set it up, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated he believed that if every investigation were to be carried out by GSOC, the commission would require between 150 and 250 investigators.</p> <p>  The Bill the committee will eventually consider in the context of the reform of policing, which will be major legislation, will propose that every investigation will commence with GSOC.  It is probably not unrealistic to imagine, therefore, that there will need to be an increase in the number of investigators of the order envisaged by the then Minister.  Obviously, there would then have to be a commensurate increase in the number of support staff for the investigators.  Given we do not know what way the legislation will pan out in the course of our business analysis between now and the time of the passage of the Bill, we may then be in a better position to be more definite about the requirements.</p></speech>

Commissioner Hume referred to section 5, which relates to getting relevant information that may indicate potentially relevant wrongdoing, but the second part of that means we are obliged to make a decision in opening a case that it must be in the public interest to do so.  We use five criteria to make that decision, and we have a policy on that in order that we have consistency throughout the commission in making those decisions, but it is quite a unique legal power GSOC has as against other bodies in regard to protected disclosures.</p></speech>

The article reported that GSOC had ended up withdrawing its case and allowing the Garda to investigate the matter it was dealing it.  What is the protocol for such cases where there is a duplication?</p><p>Does it fall between GSOC and the Garda to determine who is best to investigate it or is there a role for the Commissioner to give direction?  What happens in that situation?</p></speech>

There is no clear delineation.  We have the power to investigate, but if we felt it was in the public interest for whatever reason - there could be a multitude of reasons and complexity that link into other aspects of criminality - or the wishes of the protected disclosure, we will make a decision and determination in the public interest.  By and large, that is by working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We look at a case and decide what is in the public interest and what is in the best interests of everyone.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.713" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#H00400"><p>I thank all the witnesses for coming in.  The first issue relates to the staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and where garda&iacute; are being deployed.  That is a big concern for me when I look at the county of Limerick.  One station could cover 40 square miles with only two Garda cars and three garda&iacute;, whereas in a city base there might be ten vehicles and 40 or 50 garda&iacute; covering probably 3 square miles with a bigger population.  I want equality.  Everyone is entitled to feel safe.  Everyone is entitled to have a good service whether they are in the county or the city.  The biggest effect from a policing point of view is had by community police, who do an absolutely fantastic job because they get to know the people in the communities where they work and that helps when they are dealing with families in an area.</p> <p>  Another issue is the vehicles, supports and resources we have for the Garda.  It is important to be able to use the technology that is available.  It would also help the Garda if we could get over the legal challenges against certain technologies.  The local authority was brought up recently for having cameras in place, which people had objected to.  The cameras were necessary because they were in areas where a lot of crimes were being committed.  Cameras are also very handy on the motorway at the moment to control speed.  If garda&iacute; are pursuing someone, the technology is available to alert them if the people pass a camera, as there is registration recognition built into the cameras.  The technology is there to allow the information to be given to the Garda.  That is especially important in an area of 40 square miles as a person could go anywhere.  It is like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  All such equipment can help the Garda, especially in the county.  Such technology is within the cities because there are cameras on nearly every corner.  I am interested in helping the Garda in the county.</p> <p>  In Limerick, we have had investigations into garda&iacute;.  It has taken up to three years to bring investigations into eight garda&iacute; to a conclusion.  In the middle of the investigation there was an attempt to move the process to Dublin and to have it heard there.  That was only media propaganda trying to bring it to Dublin.  I am glad that was turned around and it was brought back to Limerick where the Courts Service is quite adequate and capable of carrying out investigations itself.  At the moment eight garda&iacute; are out and they have not been replaced.  Why has it taken three years for a Garda investigation and for charges to be brought, if they are to be brought?  That is not good enough.  If charges are brought, we should have the evidence to follow it up and it should not take three years for the process to go forward.  I want garda&iacute; back on the beat.  If garda&iacute; have been involved in wrongdoing, they must be dealt with, but if they have not, get them back out and deal with the issue.  It should not take three years to deal with an issue and for people to be out of work.</p> <p>  In terms of disclosures, phones were taken off all the garda&iacute; in the divisions in Limerick.  I believe the only Garda county division to have its phones taken were from County Limerick and that did not happen in other counties.  If they did it in one county, why did they not do it in every county?  Why was it targeted towards my county of Limerick?  If there has been wrongdoing in the Garda, I want it dealt with swiftly.  I do not want it to take three years.  If people have made disclosures, they do not want to wait three years either for a process to be put in place.  I would welcome answers to some of those questions.</p></speech>

I have no knowledge and, in any case, I would be prohibited from discussing it in any way.  It is fair to say that as a general principle we recognise the importance of more timely investigations and speeding up investigations that we lead.  We believe the new legislation that is coming forward will allow us to do that.  We are looking at ways to continually improve and reduce the time it takes for our investigations - this is not one of ours - but we want to get better at that.  We are very conscious that people's careers are on hold during investigations.  Internally, for those investigations that we lead on, we are constantly looking to see how we can improve and make them more timely.</p></speech>

The three members of the commission are appointed by our Head of State, President Higgins.  We are independent of the Garda.</p> <p>  As a Limerick woman, I am familiar with some of the issues the Deputy raises, but as a member of the commission I must explain to him that we have no remit for that.  Our job is to take complaints from members of the public about the conduct of guards.  Conduct means an act or omission - inaction - by garda&iacute;.  While the Deputy's concerns are completely valid, our remit does not extend to the concerns that he has expressed here today.</p></speech>

I understand that GSOC is completely independent, but I was hoping that it would have something to do with making sure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's investigations can also move on a par with those of GSOC.</p></speech>

It might be the case that the kind of issues the Deputy is talking about come up as a pattern.  If we get lots of people from Limerick complaining about it - not that I am suggesting Deputy O'Donoghue goes back to his constituents - but if we see a pattern or trend, that is something we will have the power to raise with the Garda Commissioner.  That it is something on which action needs to be taken, but it is the prerogative of the Garda Commissioner to do that.</p></speech>

I again thank the witnesses very much for their attendance and for dealing with the various queries that have arisen to date.  I was going to ask them to give a breakdown of the types of cases, but I see they have done it in the annual report.</p><p>What I like about the various annual reports is that the same style has been retained so it is easy to compare the figures, year on year, for anybody picking up the reports.  The 2020 report notes that 30% of referrals relate to deaths unrelated to road traffic incidents.  I was also struck by the figure for sexual offences, which was reported as 7%.  I am not sure how those figures compare with the previous years; I have not checked.  However, 30% seems a high figure.  I know the report includes a number of case studies but our guests might give us a flavour of the types of cases with which the commission deals for those watching these proceedings.  I am looking to get a general sense of the cases with which GSOC is dealing.</p><p> GSOC currently has 140 staff, which I think I heard our guests say includes nine investigators.  I know that recruitment is ongoing.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and that committee engaged with GSOC only a couple of weeks ago.  How is that recruitment going?

Those are my initial questions but I will have a few others to follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Hume" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#J00400"><p>I will make a start on responding to the Vice Chairman.  I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about our work.  The breadth and scale of investigations within GSOC are significant.  We talked already about the local intervention schemes.  Let us consider an example where there has been a failure of service and a member of the public has come to us for assistance.  That is one level.  It can be very important for that individual and have a major effect on his or her ability to work or function.  Such cases can run from bad manners, bad behaviours and indirection to failures to investigate a matter that is brought to the attention of a garda.  In our report, we talk about a case where a landlord was potentially bullying and harassing an individual.  That individual sought assistance from the Garda and the garda in that case failed to do anything.  That case was then referred to us.  I will talk about that case again in a moment because it is a good example.</p> <p>  There are also cases that include a more serious neglect of duty in a disciplinary sense.  Such disciplinary cases can be more layered.  There may be indications that there is some sort of bias involved because of somebody's background, the geographic area concerned or the person's orientation.</p> <p>  There are also criminal matters.  Such cases can commence with a small level assault or excessive use of a baton or handcuffs.  As Ms Logan has already talked about, criminal matters can also include some of the most serious cases, for example, abuse of power for sexual gain, domestic violence and even rape.  That is the full spectrum of behaviours, including criminality, indiscipline and poor service.  GSOC is currently considering accusations of poor service through to the most serious matters of criminal matters on a daily basis.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman also asked about supervised and unsupervised disciplinary investigations.  I mentioned the example of the individual who complained about a landlord.  When a complaint comes to GSOC, as Mr. Justice MacCabe said, there is an assessment process to decide the nature of that complaint, the resource and the immediate steps that need to be taken.  That assessment process could identify whether the issue is disciplinary or criminal.  All criminal matters will reside with GSOC.  We investigate all criminal matters and do not allocate them to anyone else for investigation.</p> <p>  We receive death or serious harm referrals from the Garda in cases, for example, where somebody is found dead in a cell or after a road traffic collision.  The Garda Commissioner may delegate that to a superintendent who will tell us that a certain person has suffered death or serious harm in circumstances in which the Garda may have played a role.  We investigate that.  It is never passed to any other body.  It is only GSOC that deals with that.</p> <p>  I will move on to disciplinary investigations and the core of the Vice Chairman's question about supervised and unsupervised disciplinary investigations.  There are three types of investigation, namely, unsupervised, supervised and GSOC-led disciplinary investigations.  When the assessment comes in, we will consider the harm that the allegation may have caused.  The example I gave of the landlord who was being abusive and threatening to his tenant was dealt with as an unsupervised investigation.  We passed that back to the Garda, which investigated it.  Such investigations are not done without any oversight because the Garda has to report back to us with its findings, which we look at.  There is also an appeals mechanism.  In that case, the Garda decided the situation was not good enough.  The garda in question went before a panel and was disciplined for the failure involved.  It is those levels of failure to investigate certain matters that are unsupervised and reside with a Garda senior investigating officer, SIO, a superintendent of the Garda, who then comes back to us.</p> <p>  The legislation states that a disciplinary investigation can be supervised by GSOC if we believe it is necessary and in the public interest.  The allegation we talked about was around the failure to investigate a conflict between a landlord and a tenant.  If that was a failure to investigate, for example, a domestic violence case or a case of sexual misconduct, we would say the investigation requires supervision.  That supervision is quite intrusive.  It means we can be present during interviews and can direct investigative strategies.  The Garda is investigating but we are taking a close and hands-on approach to the matter.  If there is any indication of bias, we might decide that is the appropriate way to proceed.</p> <p>  The third level is where GSOC leads on disciplinary investigations.  That arises with regard to the most serious matters.  In such circumstances, we might decide we want to take the investigation forward ourselves.  That may be the result of a death or serious harm referral that while not criminal, touches on disciplinary matters.  It might happen in a situation where the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided that a previous investigation was not a criminal matter but we decided there may be relevant disciplinary matters.  We can also take on investigations under our own initiative.</p> <p>  That is a broad sense of the work we do.  We consider the harm involved.  If it is low-level harm and activity, the investigation is unsupervised.  If a higher level of harm is involved, the investigation can be supervised.  For more serious cases, we take on the investigation ourselves.</p></speech>

We understand that we are not working in a vacuum.  We also understand, as a State institution, that there may be victims of sexual violence who do not know we exist.  We have made efforts to engage directly with people who might have trusted relationships with victims.  For instance, we have good relationships with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Women's Aid.  Last year, we engaged formally with the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, because of the increases in sexual violence against children.  We will have a formal, written memorandum of understanding with Tusla to make sure we are not missing anything with regard to children.  We have had good external co-operation in that regard.</p></speech>

I presume that encompasses anything to do with a minor.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.727" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily Logan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#J00700"><p>We get between 50 and 60 such cases per month.  Every morning, we have what we call a "diver", which is a summary of every single case that comes in.  The diver comes in to key members of the organisation at 7.30 a.m.  We have a dedicated team who are monitoring only for child protection cases.  There are between 50 and 60 such cases per month and that includes children who were either victims of crime or who may have witnessed a crime.  That is not to suggest that there is an increase in risk to children in this country.  It is merely a reflection of the people who are coming to us.  The more people come to us, the better it is.</p></speech>

Given the content that GSOC deals with, and some of the individuals it may be dealing with, have our guests any concerns or has GSOC any protocols around security for investigators and their well-being, particularly where sexual and domestic violence cases are concerned?  Is there a programme in place within GSOC to ensure investigators can get assistance, should they need it, for their personal well-being?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Hume" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#K00100"><p>There is as part of the wider Civil Service.  One of the advantages of being part of wider Civil Service support is that welfare processes are in place.  Internally, we also have what is called a threat management policy that considers threats.  These include those that come from investigators themselves, such as suicide awareness and self-harm awareness, and threats that may be made to Garda members by people who contact us, in addition to threats made to members of our own staff.  When we are involved in operational activity, we also use risk assessment to decide where the level of risk will be in future.  We work very closely with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on aspects of crime and security to ensure there are proper threat assessments around any threats made to staff.  Does Ms Healy want to talk about the welfare supports we offer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.730" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aileen Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#K00200"><p>We have an employee assistance service that staff can contact directly.  That service also gives training sessions to staff and we refer staff to it, especially those who may have attended a traumatic incident.  We provide those supports for them and make those services available to them for support afterwards.</p></speech>

For instance, we recently invited psychologist Dr. Tony Bates, with whom people will be familiar, to talk to our case workers who experience the extreme end, namely, death or serious harm.  There is also the entry point, where members of the public who ring can be distressed.  Early reference to mental health can be complicated for members of the public trying to ring to contact us.  We try to support our staff.  We get traumatic calls that can include allegations of child sexual abuse and people with suicide ideation.  As a public body, it is our job to make sure, and we have joint responsibility to do so, our staff are supported when they come across those kind of difficult situations that can be distressing on a human level.</p></speech>

If I understand the numbers correctly, in 2018 the commission said - I am reading from table 4 - complaints received were 1,921 and 1,897 complaints were closed.  In 2019, I presume that when it received 1,700 cases and closed 1,800, it was probably because of the case workers.</p></speech>

Okay.  On the volume of cases, when the commission stated it received 1,921 in 2018 or 2,189 in 2021, is that after case workers have vetted them to make them cases?  What percentage of the commission's cases are uncorroborated, vexatious or malicious?  Does it have indications of that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aileen Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#K00800"><p>In 2021, of that 2,189, for instance, 1,332 were admitted as complaints, which was 61%, and 39% were determined not to be admissible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Vice Chairman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#K00900"><p>Okay.  I will ask about those that were inadmissible.  I am also conscious that some of the complaints the commission must receive are malicious and vexatious.  That is not to take away from the genuine ones, but what kind of percentage of such complaints is there in the 39% for 2021?  Are they categorised at all or are they just cases that are not taken on?  We are talking about the actual cases but what about the ones that are also taking up time?  They take up the time of the organisation and they could, in theory, have implications for members of the force and other individuals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Hume" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2022042800002#K01000"><p>We publish those in our report.  The single biggest reason for inadmissibility, which amounted to 742 cases last year, was that even if proven the complaint would not amount to a criminal or disciplinary matter.  People may ring up to say they want to complain about this but maybe that is the law or Garda policy rather than bad behaviour by an individual.  That was the single biggest reason cases were not admitted.  Following on from that, 14% of cases were inadmissible because the allegations fell outside 12 months.  We have a 12-month window to make a complaint, which accounts for a number of cases.  We can extend that period if there is good cause, but sometimes no good cause is offered.  That was the second biggest reason.  We break down all the reasons, which include persons not authorised to make a complaint, instances where a complaint is vexatious, or is about the control or direction of the Garda, or a garda was not on duty when an allegation was made.  There is a very narrow band of when we can admit those.  The breakdown of complaints is visible and publicly available.</p></speech>

It shows its proactiveness as an organisation in knowing that legislation is coming down the track at some point and the changes that legislation will present.  The fact the commission is getting the work under way deserves to be commended.  I compliment it on that and, as I said, on the design of its annual reports, which makes them very easy reading, especially the breakdown by division.  It is unusual, to be honest.  Each annual report is different and it is very hard to make comparisons year-on-year, but the commission's reports are very straightforward.  Do any other members want to come in with any additional questions?  No.</p> <p>  I thank the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for their presentation this afternoon and their engagement with the committee.  I particularly thank Judge McCabe, Ms Logan, Mr. Hume and Ms Healy for their attendance.  I certainly found the discussion and engagement extremely interesting, as have colleagues on the committee I am sure.  We will probably engage again.  We will come back to the commission regarding the invitation to its headquarters, which the committee will consider.  I will allow GSOC members to leave before we consider our public petitions this afternoon.  We have further work.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Catherine Naughton, director, European Disability Forum, and Dr. Mary Keogh, advocacy director, CBM Global.</p> <p>  I remind members that they can participate in the meeting only if they are physically within the precincts of Leinster House.  In this regard, if members are joining us remotely, they must confirm they are within the grounds of the Leinster House complex before they can contribute to the meeting.  For anyone watching online, some witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented nature of this, I ask everyone to bear with us should technical difficulties arise as has happened over the past while.</p> <p>  I must advise everyone participating in these proceedings on matters of privilege.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precinct that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending and giving evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given.  If witnesses are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect the decision of the committee.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to that effect as well.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Naughton to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am in Brussels and, therefore, will attend remotely although I would have loved to have been able to go to Leinster House.</p> <p>  The European Disability Forum is a European network of organisations that represent persons with disabilities.  Our members includes organisations like the Disability Federation of Ireland and European-wide organisations like the European Union of the Deaf and the European Blind Union.  The forum is a very inclusive umbrella organisation and our main objective is to promote the rights of persons with disabilities in Europe.</p> <p>  In terms of situations of risk and emergencies, people with disabilities are routinely excluded from full participation in everyday life.  When society breaks down as a result of conflict or a natural event, including those we see today in ever greater frequency caused by climate change, the barriers people with disabilities face are exacerbated.  The result is they are more exposed to risk and abuse and have less access to aid and support.  This reality applies to all persons with disabilities.  When we think of the war in Ukraine, we immediately realise that somebody who uses a wheelchair would have difficulty entering an inaccessible bomb shelter.  We also need to remember that the community of people with disabilities is very diverse.  A whole range of people in our community may experience barriers in the scenario of trying to safely reach or stay safe in a bomb shelter.  Imagine people who require daily support; people with essential dietary requirements or therapies; people with psychosocial disabilities, autism, dementia or an array of neurological conditions; or people who are deaf and so have difficulty hearing air raid sirens.</p> <p>  My intervention refers to all persons with disabilities and their families.  In the scenario I describe where a person cannot get to a bomb shelter, members know his or her family members will stay with that person.  So the number of people affected by inaccessible non-inclusive disaster risk reduction is great.  Recently, I met a woman, Tetyanna, who has arrived from Ukraine and is a wheelchair user, as is her husband.  She wanted to stay in Kyiv, but when there were air raid alerts, she wanted her son to go in the bomb shelter but he would not go without her, so she had to flee.  Therefore, we are talking about a huge number of people being affected.</p> <p>  Some of the specific examples of this exclusion include policies of residential institutionalisation, which increases the risk of exposure to a person-to-person spread pandemic, like we saw during Covid-19, and makes evacuation more difficult during extreme weather events such as flooding and wildfires or situations of conflict like in the Ukraine; inaccessible life-saving aid; inaccessible transit centres for displaced populations; and inaccessible information about emergency services and basic services but also about long-term integration and social protection for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  People who live in poverty are often more likely to be impacted by climate change.  As members will know, persons with disabilities in Ireland and across Europe are more likely to live in poverty, exposed, as they are, to discrimination, unemployment and underemployment, and the extra costs related to disability that they face every day, such as the cost of accessible transport, housing and other disability-related supports that they often must for pay out of their own pockets.</p> <p>  Sometimes policymaking is not inclusive.  As well as not including the requirements of persons with disabilities, some new policies can have a negative impact on their lives, such as the potential for carbon pricing schemes to reinforce social inequality.  There is not enough official and academic documentation of the extent of discrimination, but studies after the great east Japan earthquake in 2011 showed that the mortality rate for persons with disabilities was two to four times the rate for the rest of the population.  Recent examples of crises in Europe, where many of these situations have happened, include the Covid pandemic, and we all know what happened in residential care institutions during the Covid-19 pandemic; flooding in Germany in 2021, where there were also examples of people in residential care facilities who could not be evacuated; and the war in Ukraine, where one can see examples every day.  Ireland must deal regularly with flooding, which affects the whole population, including persons with disabilities and their families.  The development of strategies to ensure inclusive and accessible preparedness and responses to flooding must be done in partnership with the disability community.</p><p> From the examples I am giving, it is clear there are many overlapping fields of work that must better focus on disability inclusion and better connect with each other in order to address the problem.  These fields include: immediate humanitarian action and long-term response and recovery to build back better; climate action; disaster risk reduction and management; civil protection; and social protection.   Depending on the context, policy makers and technical professionals working in these fields may have to address different specific priorities.</p><p> Some of the main issues relevant for the greater European region are clear and crosscutting, as identified in a very recent review of disability inclusion in national disaster risk reduction policies in Europe and central Asia.  The review and policy paper, which are included in our submission, identified priority gaps and make detailed recommendations for change.  Broadly speaking, these fall under the categories of: systematic collection and use of disability disaggregated data; meaningful participation of organisations of persons with disabilities in decision-making; accessibility including communication; risk information; critical infrastructure and services; improved expertise on disability inclusion; and a dedicated budget to ensure disability inclusion.  National governments, including not only Ireland but all EU member states, are ultimately responsible for ensuring this under their obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Specific articles are particularly relevant and Dr. Keogh may refer to some of them.  I will draw attention particularly to Article 4.3 on meaningful participation of persons with disabilities through their representative organisations and Article 11 on situations of risk and emergencies.  They require a whole-of-government approach.  We see this in the way the committee discusses all of its topics.  The committee, with its commitment to dialogue with the disability community and its coverage of horizontal disability rights issues, is a very positive example of the type of meaningful participation foreseen in Article 4.3 of the convention.</p><p>  I want to note the range of expertise found in community and voluntary sector in Ireland.  It is a very important resource for planning.  Within the sector we have specialist knowledge, expertise and assets that can be deployed quickly, including on accessible transport, equipment, knowledge and relationships that can support effective inclusive preparedness and responses.  I saw this at a recent meeting with the Disability Federation of Ireland and its members when discussing the response to Ukraine.</p><p> It is essential to stress that all of these scenarios, from disability proofing to emergency management and dealing with displaced populations as a result of any crisis, require the collaborative, adequately resourced and long-term commitment of many Departments.  Targets such as disability inclusive emergency preparedness and response must be complemented by similar work on disability inclusive health, education, social protection and employment policies.</p><p> International frameworks and guidelines exist and are being implemented.  The European Forum for Disaster Risk Reduction Roadmap 2021-2030 is an example of how policy improvement is continuing at this level.  It should be the priority of national governments to support this work and replicate it in their own settings, according to their own contexts and challenges.  As well as working towards more equitable societies, studies have shown that disability inclusion is an investment and not a cost.  This requires building capacity in government, the disability community and all agencies involved in disaster management and preparedness and climate action.  Since it is critical to ensure meaningful participation of persons with disabilities through their representative organisations, the European Disability Forum and our members in Ireland remain at the disposal of the committee for any further work it explores in this field.</p><p> By its nature, disaster preparedness is preparing for things we do not know will happen.  We never expected the Covid-19 pandemic.  We did not expect this war on European soil.  We need to learn from all that we could have done to prevent the dreadful impact on persons with disabilities so we are really prepared.  All we know is that we do not know what will be the next thing we need to face.  I thank committee members for their attention and I look forward to listening to the contribution of Dr. Keogh and hearing the questions afterwards.</p></speech>

I extend thanks to the committee for the invitation to speak today on the important topics of persons with disabilities and situations of risk and humanitarian situations.  I work as advocacy director with CBM Global Disability Inclusion, an international organisation with a dual mandate for international development and humanitarian action.  It is a federation that works alongside people with disabilities in the world&rsquo;s poorest places to transform lives and build inclusive communities where everyone can enjoy their human rights and achieve their full potential.  Our federation members include CBM Ireland, and colleagues are here today.  It is an active member of the D&oacute;chas working groups on disability, international development and humanitarian action.  At the heart of how we work in CBM Global and CBM Ireland is partnership with the disability movement.  We work with and support organisations of people with disabilities in our programmes to ensure we meet the needs of, and are accountable to, the individuals and communities we serve.  We are pleased to be here today as an associate member of the European Disability Forum and a member of the International Disability and Development Consortium.</p> <p>  Before covering the topic we are here to discuss today, which is primarily Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is important to acknowledge that while humanitarian disasters occur year on year, the past three years in particular have witnessed a period in time where we have seen the lives of persons with disabilities in the most precarious of situations stemming from global pandemic, climate events happening more regularly and conflict and war.  Ms Naughton touched on this.</p> <p>  The areas outlined for protection under Article 11 are illustrated by the Covid pandemic, which caused the unnecessary deaths of many persons with disabilities worldwide.  They can also be seen in the extreme weather events Ms Naughton spoke about, such as the floods in Germany in 2021, the heat dome in Canada and ongoing food security crisis in countries such as Madagascar, where the impact of climate change has impacted negatively on millions of people, including persons with disabilities.  They are also illustrated in the dire situation of persons with disabilities currently living in Ukraine and the urgency of an inclusive humanitarian response, including safe evacuations and an inclusive response to the refugees arriving in our countries.  These are just a few current examples.  We also know that persons with disabilities are impacted daily by conflict, crisis and climate in other parts of the world, such as Syria and Yemen.  These are ongoing crises.  The urgency for the full implementation of Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, will always be with us, as emergency and disaster situations continue to unfold at a rapid pace.  As Ms Naughton said, this is mainly without warning.</p> <p>  For today&rsquo;s intervention, I would like to look a bit more closely at the role of the various actors that can be involved in implementing Article 11, which is focused on risk and humanitarian situations for persons with disabilities.  The original drafters of the CRPD asserted that the main responsibility for Article 11's implementation lies with the governments that ratify it.  This is correct, as it is with all international laws.  They also foresaw an important role for organisations of persons with disabilities and wider civil society to support a inclusive humanitarian response.  With this in mind, while focusing on the role of the Irish Government, I will also highlight the importance of organisations of persons with disabilities and their critical role in supporting humanitarian responses and the role mainstream organisations can play. </p> <p>  The Irish Government has a dual role in the implementation of Article 11.  It must consider the safety of persons with disabilities in Ireland during times of risk, disaster and conflict.  Ms Naughton spoke about constant flooding and situations that arise in Ireland and really thinking about how they impact on ensuring the inclusion of persons with disabilities.  It is natural for us when thinking of conflict and disaster to think of it happening somewhere else but we know these situations happen in Ireland.  The pandemic has highlighted this.  It is interesting to see how this was detailed in Ireland&rsquo;s first report to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was published in November 2021.  Under its reporting of Article 11, it details the domestic actors involved in emergency response planning and the role of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in ensuring accessible communications.</p><p>One of the key barriers that many organisations of persons with disabilities faced worldwide during the pandemic was getting access to basic information that was being provided within media channels and various networks.  The report also outlines in broad terms the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Obviously, it was written during the pandemic so does not offer a reflection on it.  We are still going through it.  However, it considers the effectiveness of the response and how the Government did that in partnership with organisations of persons with disabilities.</p><p> In addition to Ireland&rsquo;s domestic responsibilities under the convention, it is also responsible for international co-operation and development aid and making sure that, under Article 32, the funding that goes from the Government into overseas and humanitarian aid takes disability inclusion into account.  Broadly speaking, this sets up an important role for the Government to ensure the funding channelled through international or development co-operation modalities for the purposes of humanitarian response is inclusive of persons with disabilities.  The D&oacute;chas working group on disability and international development has for many years been focused on influencing in this respect.</p><p> A recommendation from an Irish perspective is that the committee may wish to consider the organisation of learning and exchange between domestic and international stakeholders on responding to situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies.  This could be an exchange between governmental and non-governmental organisations based in Ireland, and with colleagues such as Ms Naughton of the European Disability Forum as well as the International Disability Alliance, to consider how to exchange with the Irish disability movement examples of good practice in disaster risk reduction planning and humanitarian response.</p><p> I refer to the role of organisations of persons with disabilities in terms of what was foreseen in the context of the CRPD.  Momentum for organisations of persons with disabilities having a role in humanitarian response has been growing in recent years.  Typically, in times of risk, disaster or conflict, persons with disabilities can be viewed as passive recipients of assistance - when they can actually get access to it, that is.  The view of persons with disabilities as powerless in these situations is widely held and perpetuated by the media and imagery we see daily.  It is not a true picture, however.  In many situations, persons with disabilities and their representative organisations such as the EDF are active contributors to response in times of emergencies and risk.  Examples of this can be found within the field of disaster risk reduction.  I have provided in my written submission a hyperlink to a video showing how persons with disabilities have become involved in disaster risk reduction in Bangladesh.  A similar situation pertains in respect of climate action, which is obviously an ongoing emergency and will continue to be such.  Persons with disabilities and their representative organisations are engaging with the impact of climate change in their communities.  For example, a CBM Global partner organisation in Madagascar that represents persons with disabilities is currently mapping out where persons with disabilities are and the challenges they face in accessing humanitarian and food security assistance in Madagascar.</p><p> As we are sharing the panel with our colleagues from the European Disability Forum, we wish to highlight the work of EDF and its members, including its Irish members, in times of risk and crisis.  In particular, it is worthwhile examining the toolkit it has developed on the inclusion of refugees with disabilities.  This is pertinent at the moment as refugees, many of whom may be persons with disabilities, are arriving into Ireland.  All of these examples are what the CRPD drafters had in mind when they were thinking of organisations of persons with disabilities leading and being active contributors in times and situations of risk.</p><p> The final example I will highlight, which is more at a global level, relates to the disability reference group.  It includes a work stream on building capacity of organisations of persons with disabilities to be part of the humanitarian sector, including leading the influence for change that is needed.  There is very much a partnership at the moment between the humanitarian sector and the disability movement in respect of how to become better at this from an inclusive perspective.  Another recommendation is to consider an exchange between Irish organisations of persons with disabilities and Irish emergency responders to share and chart a path forward for inclusive response.</p><p> It is critical for mainstream organisations and organisations of persons with disabilities to work together.  International non-governmental organisations, national governmental organisations and organisations of persons with disabilities working together have an important role to play.  We are slowly beginning to see a realisation that, in times of risk and emergencies, there needs to be a collective approach so that more people who are impacted by conflict, climate and crisis can be reached.  There are recent practical examples of this.  The inter-agency guidelines on inclusion of persons with disabilities in humanitarian assistance were launched last year.  These are the first humanitarian guidelines to be developed with and by persons with disabilities and their representative organisations, along with traditional aid agencies.  The launch in Ireland last year marked the beginning of a new phase of Irish action to promote uptake and implementation of the guidelines.  A commitment coming from this was a stronger focus on disability across all programming, along with funding for partners working in humanitarian assistance.</p><p> The VIVID-T consortium, a funded project by EU volunteers, focused on improving inclusion in volunteer management and humanitarian action.  CBM Ireland led the project consortium and worked closely with CBM Global, the Abilis Foundation, the European Disability Forum and ASPEm, as well as colleagues here in Ireland such as Tearfund Ireland and Viatores Christi.  Through close collaboration, the project is examining building a community of practice in respect of inclusion in the context of situations of risk and humanitarian situations.  These examples of working together highlight how, in future, working in consortiums and collectively bringing different levels of expertise is critical to how we can make progress on ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities under Article 11 are implemented.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.760" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022042800002#C00300"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their informative and thought-provoking presentations.  We are discussing how to deal with a humanitarian crisis and the fact such a crisis or emergency disproportionately affects disabled people compared with the rest of the population.  We came through the crisis that was the Covid pandemic.  We are witnessing another crisis in Europe with the Ukrainian war.  Of course, unfortunately, there are many wars happening all over the world, some of which have been going on for several years, with millions of people killed, displaced or injured, ending up with a disability themselves.  Of course, there is the ongoing climate emergency that will increase in terms of severity and the number of events.</p> <p>  What our guests are basically saying is that if disabled people are included in the preparation for the response to a crisis, we will have a better response that will ensure more people will survive.  What they are saying applies across the board.  If disabled people are involved in all aspects of policy development across all Departments, such as in respect of housing, transport and so on, we will have better outcomes.  That seems to be an ongoing problem here.  How can we improve inclusion and have more disabled people involved in preparation across all policy areas, but particularly in the context of crises?</p> <p>  To take the Covid response as an example, a vulnerable persons subgroup was set up as part of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, initially.  If memory serves me right, it was disbanded in mid-2020.  Even though there were calls for it to be re-engaged, that was not done.  That was important because the response to special education, for example, was then not seen as an essential service and it was delayed.  Disabled people were not necessarily prioritised in the roll-out of the vaccine.  Carers definitely were not prioritised.  The way carers were treated throughout the Covid pandemic and the fact they were not even considered for the Covid payment afterwards was disgraceful.  How can we improve the involvement of disabled people?  Are there good examples, especially in Europe, in the context of how countries are responding to the Ukrainian crisis, for example?</p><p>Do we have any data on the number of disabled people who are coming to Ireland and what kind of supports they are getting here?  We may not have any, because it is ongoing and new and our data on disability in this country is quite poor.</p><p> I have a question specifically for Dr. Keogh.  We have a high rate of poverty in Ireland among disabled people and a lot of social exclusion.  Some 28% of the population is at risk of energy poverty.  Do we need to look at our climate action plan again and adjust it, even though it is only from last year?  Do we need to look at that more in respect of including disabled people?</p><p> Ms Naughton said there was consultation with the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, which does a lot of good work.  However, it is not a disabled persons&rsquo; organisation, DPO.  Is there involvement with DPOs directly as well in the work that Ms Naughton does?</p></speech>

I think she had the answer to her question on the vulnerability subgroup, which was dropped.  We know that at each phase of the Covid-19 pandemic &ndash; the Deputy mentioned vaccination and education, but there were also the issues of returning to work and around the lifting of measures such as face mask wearing and everything such as that - that people with chronic illness, medical conditions, older people and people with disabilities also have pre-existing health conditions and were at high risk.  There are more risks also as the pandemic reaches what we hope is its final stages.  Maintenance of the subgroup would have been wise to continue at each stage.</p> <p>  On the response to Ukraine, this week there was a meeting called by the European Commission of the disability platform, which is the network that it set up for the implementation of the European disability strategy.  This network includes the focal point for disability in the different European member states.  It did an open call &ndash; this is a bit in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on co-operation with DPOs &ndash; for members to be part of the committee.  There are 14 different civil society organisations on the disability platform.  There are DPOs as well as LGBTI representative organisations, AGE Platform Europe and service providing organisations.  There are a range of stakeholders there who can have their say and be part of the discussions.</p> <p>  It was mainly the countries neighbouring Ukraine and the Baltic states that spoke about their response.  In terms of good examples, Lithuania was able to say exactly how many people had come from Ukraine - how many women, how many children and how many people with disabilities.  They did a very effective registration.  They set up a working group with humanitarian organisations and included the national disability organisation as well.  They had regular engagement with the humanitarian community in Ukraine and with the disability community.  My impression from what they said is they were asking very specific questions about how they would recognise disability so people would have access to support.  They had already organised how they would recognise the Ukrainian disability certificate and allow people access.  Under the temporary protection directive, in principle, people arriving from Ukraine can access employment support services, education and so forth.  However, it is not so straightforward with disability-related services and how each country will recognise disability.  The example from Lithuania impressed me because they seemed to have collected the data very well and they had foreseen how they were going to provide disability-related support to people with disabilities who had arrived from Ukraine.</p> <p>  From the beginning, on 24 February, when the war escalated with the invasion, I have been very impressed by the response from DPOs in all of the countries.  We have members in all of Ukraine&rsquo;s neighbouring countries and many of them are very under-resourced, yet immediately stepped forward.  They were locating people with disabilities who had crossed the border, they were trying to provide direct assistance and accommodation and they were reaching out with transport and assisted living.  Without many resources, because of pure human solidarity, as we have seen in Ireland as well, the disability community in the neighbouring countries as well as across Europe has been helping out.  Our members have been reaching out saying they have a place where they can receive people with disabilities, for example, in Spain, Italy and Portugal.  They have been trying to facilitate people arriving to them so they can provide the Ukrainians with safe and secure places to stay while the war is going on in their country.</p> <p>  A good example of response is also the fact the European Union got its act together very quickly with the temporary protection directive and allowed people immediately to find safety in Europe under this legal measure.  This is something that could have been activated in previous crises, such as the Syrian war, but it was not.  At least here it was done.  It shows that when the European Union acts together, it can provide this legal protection when it needs to and provide people with that safety they need during war.</p> <p>  The Deputy brought up the important issue of the fuel crisis.  We know many people with disabilities who are using, for example, different kinds of assistive equipment, such as wheelchairs and so forth, use more energy at home.  They are having to choose between buying food and paying their electricity and gas bills.  While we have not done it yet and we are not ahead of this in the European Disability Forum, we need to discuss together how to make sure we do not lose track on climate goals while also ensuring we do not disproportionately punish people with disabilities with rising costs of fuel.  This is something on which we need to have research, discussion and make sure, in those measures that need to be taken to protect our climate, we do not reinforce inequality.  Unfortunately, I do not have the answer to this.  However, it is something we need to make plans for without undermining climate action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.763" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Keogh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022042800002#D00300"><p>I will just mainly follow on without repeating much of what Ms Naughton said.  I will just kind of give some specific examples.</p> <p>  On climate and energy, that is a very valid point because it links in with the cost of living at the moment.  Even taking a step back to look at when we talk about the development of climate action plans that happen at national level, it is very rare that organisations of persons with disabilities are actually part of that consultation that helps shape those plans.  That brings out that bigger policy piece that needs to be thought through.  There will be research launched in the coming weeks which will show, out of all of the national climate action plans worldwide, there is a very small percentage, perhaps ten to 12 countries, that have actually included some examples of thinking around disability inclusion and climate action.  Do not quote me on that exactly, but it is literally that small.  Colleagues in McGill University are doing this research and will be publishing it soon.  As Ms Naughton said as well in terms of the humanitarian response, it is about putting organisations of persons with disabilities into these decision-making rooms and being able to shape these policies.  These are critical, whether it fits within a vulnerable subgroup that is set up under a Covid response or at a national level.</p> <p>  I can give some examples in the countries we work in.  When we think of the Covid response in Ireland, obviously it was an emergency that landed on everyone&rsquo;s doorstep without any planning, so we were playing catch-up the whole time.  As I said, the reflection piece that will come later will show where the gaps are and we are know where gaps are.  Within the countries we work in, even getting access to vaccines for persons with disabilities, such as in Madagascar, where vaccines are not actually available, is a critical issue.  There are all of these kind of universal pieces of access and consultation that are needed to help drive responses, whether they are to climate or the pandemic.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised a question around data.  Ms Naughton spoke about the data coming from the work the EDF is doing on its members.  We know also that there are major gaps in data around persons with disabilities worldwide.  Some of the research that was done by the International Disability Rights Monitor in terms of Covid was looking at gathering that data and showing where the gaps were.  The UK showed the numbers of death of persons with disabilities, but in many other countries it is not recorded.  Similarly, for any other type of emergency, it is not there.  That is something to think about from the committee&rsquo;s perspective.  Ireland has been progressive around kind of the Washington Group questions and even doing national surveys on the experiences of persons with disabilities.  That is something we can showcase to others in terms of how to use that type of data gathering.</p> <p>  On climate action, Ireland is on the Security Council at the moment and seen as kind of one of those small governments that is able to really influence policy.</p><p>Being able to push for inclusion in regard to climate action and try to drive it forward, in partnership with organisations here in Ireland, really is critical.</p></speech>

It is a huge privilege to have Ms Naughton and Dr. Keogh here with the wealth of knowledge and experience they have.  I wish we could download some of that knowledge.  It is great to listen to them.</p> <p>  At a time of crisis, all the weaknesses in our systems are shown up and a shining light is thrown on the lack of default provision.  The Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the climate change crisis show all of that up very well.  The problems are blatant.  The job of this committee is to try to make the consideration of disability matters the default, with the needs of our friends and family members who have a disability placed front and centre.  I appreciate Dr. Keogh's point about how the media portray people with disabilities during times of crisis as vulnerable, with the suggestion that their situation is almost a hopeless case.  That absolutely is not true.  This almost ableist attitude makes people with disabilities feel they are not able to get through crises when, in reality, we know it is the complete opposite.  They are people like the rest of us and they are not hopeless cases.</p> <p>  We have many great humanitarian organisations in this country, including GOAL, the Irish Red Cross and Concern.  Reference was made to our position on the UN Security Council.  How far away are we from a situation where disability matters are not confined to a little box in one corner and are instead to the forefront in crisis situations?  When will members of the Defence Forces, for example, be trained in rescuing and looking after people with a disability and ensuring all the responses suitable for our friends with disabilities are in place?  Are we on a concrete pathway to achieving that or is the progress too piecemeal, without any uniformity to it?</p> <p>  I have much more to ask but I will move on.  This has been a very good conversation and I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

From a Government perspective, we know it is not the easiest thing to co-ordinate services across a whole range of Departments.  Ms Naughton spoke about the need for a whole-of-government approach to disability inclusion.  The Government makes an effort around that, as all governments do.  It is the vision of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, that states would really look at how that type of cross-departmental working can happen.  In the case of international development aid and humanitarian assistance, which operates mainly through the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is really important to have that conversation.  A lot of the issues are mirrored at the domestic level as well.  Sometimes we think of these issues as operating in silos, which is easy to do because it is the way things do operate a lot of the time.  The whole cross-functionality aspect is really important in terms of taking a disability-inclusive approach.<br/><br/>We are making progress but it is slow.  Inclusion does not happen overnight but there should not be excuses made for a lack of progress.  It is about trying to figure out the strategic ways to move forward in these areas.  Learning and sharing knowledge are important.  I work in the international development sector and there is so much experience there, including in terms of crisis response and influencing and working in partnership with governments.  We in this country can learn from our colleagues in the international development sector and <i>vice versa</i>.  That collaboration is already happening through platforms such as the D&oacute;chas platform and the international development platform, which work with the peak bodies on these issues.  Progress is slow but it is happening and we learn from each event.  The Covid crisis was huge, it is continuing and it will have ongoing effects for many years.<br/><br/>That was a roundabout way of answering the Senator's point.  She mentioned some of the great humanitarian organisations we have in this country.  Independent Living Movement Ireland is really pushing for a strong disability rights perspective, which must be at the heart of any type of co-ordination we do.  Part of that is responding to the ableist attitude that often arises from a rights perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.770" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022042800002#E00700"><p>I will give two examples that relate to Dr. Keogh's points.  A few years ago, I delivered training to a group of CEOs of humanitarian organisations.  It really amazed me that all ten of them stayed for the whole day.  When we were doing the reflection at the end, I said I was surprised that they had all showed up for this one-day training on disability awareness and stayed for the whole day, with none of them going off to meetings.  I asked them why they were there and they explained that their main donor, which was the Australian Government, had asked them to report on their work on disability and disaggregate data.  All the organisations it funds had to report back at the level of beneficiaries and they could not get away with not doing so.  That is one of the abilities the Government has as a funder of such organisations.</p> <p>  The other example is related more to domestic issues around how we get our emergency services and public services to include people with disabilities.  I was involved in looking at the disability mainstreaming approach of the Government in Kenya.  I went to different Ministries there and had to interview people for the United Nations Development Programme.  All the Ministries, including those with responsibility for children and training, had all been requesting training on disability awareness from the disabled persons organisations.  The latter were very busy providing that training and I was really impressed that all these Ministries were availing of it.  When I inquired as to why they asked for the training, because it was a bit weird that they would be so proactive, they said that in their performance evaluation, they had to show what they did.  They got three out of three points if they had all their civil servants trained, two out of three points if they had only engaged random training and so on.  They were being judged on how well they had done it.  Their accountability mechanisms related to what measures they had taken for disability mainstreaming.  Those two anecdotes struck me as showing instances of actions that were impactful in terms of disability mainstreaming in a way that is not usually achieved.</p></speech>

The CRPD requires states to ensure the safety of people with disabilities during conflicts and emergencies.  However, we know people with disabilities are disproportionately affected by humanitarian emergencies and conflict situations.  As the witnesses highlighted, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a stark reminder of that reality.</p> <p>  There was reference to Ireland's domestic and international obligations in this area.  I have several questions in that regard, most of which the witnesses have already touched on in response to questions from colleagues.  The Australian example was really helpful.  Will they explain further how other countries are working effectively with people with disabilities to develop policies and mechanisms that can best ensure safety in disaster and conflict situations?  Real examples in this regard are very helpful.</p> <p>  The current and growing impacts and risks of climate change were mentioned.  Will the witnesses outline what practical approaches can be taken to prepare for climate-related events and emergencies?  Often in these discussions, we are dealing with abstract concepts and we talk about a human rights-based approach to disaster, risk reduction, humanitarian relief and that kind of thing.  If the witnesses could give more examples of what that looks like in practice, it would be really useful to the committee.</p><p> The anecdotes the witnesses provided are very helpful.  They outlined how people with disabilities can be viewed as passive recipients of assistance rather than active agents.  Will they elaborate on some examples of how people with disabilities and their representative organisations are active contributors in responses during times of emergency and times of risk?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Keogh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022042800002#F00200"><p>With regard to good examples, Ms Naughton might speak about Kenya and how organisations for persons with disabilities worked to influence the Kenyan Government to make sure disability data was gathered in the census.  As already stated, it is difficult to provide evidence when there is no data.  There was a strong advocacy campaign to drive forward the Kenyan Government including disability data in the census.  It was driven through a partnership and advocacy approach.</p> <p>  We also have other examples from humanitarian responses to Covid-19.  We have a publication coming out soon showing where organisations for persons with disabilities influenced humanitarian clusters in Nepal and Bangladesh.  We are also looking at how to influence other areas.  Research we carried out found that in many of the countries we work in, a key issue during the pandemic was getting access to social protection for persons with disabilities.</p> <p>  The successes come from being able to have the data and the evidence.  The rights-based approach can be fairly lofty in many of the countries we work in.  Even in our country, there is the famous saying from years ago that we cannot eat human rights.  This is the reality in many senses.  We know human rights are very important but people's experience on the ground is quite different.  Influencing is critical in partnership.  We have examples we can share with the committee on how this has happened in various countries we work in.</p> <p>  Ms Naughton might be able to speak more on climate change and disaster risk reduction.  It is about looking at consultation and bringing people into the responses as they are developed.  Covid came and we knew we could not plan for it.  We can plan for it happening again with regard to what the response needs to be.  We can bring Irish organisations for persons with disabilities into helping shape it.  This will be critical.  Ms Naughton will speak about good examples of disaster risk reduction and other areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022042800002#F00300"><p>It is easier to illustrate disaster risk reduction with a story.  One of my colleagues working on inclusive disaster risk reduction in Thailand spoke about doing evacuation practices with the army and emergency services and including organisations for persons with disabilities.  What she said, which will not surprise anyone, is that people with disabilities from among the population were the ones who helped to find the answers.  Wheelchair users know how they can get out of a building with a bit of help or support.  The police or army does not have to invent it.  They work with people and ask how they usually manage, what should be put in place to make sure it is safe and how to reach the person.  Organisations for persons with disabilities know where their members are.  They know where they are living.  They have their phone numbers.  Doing this together meant that the solutions were found much faster and targeted towards the people living there.  They knew the risks they faced and the biggest problems for them when there was a flood or typhoon.  People with disabilities should be involved in practices and simulations to help find solutions and be part of it.  This will also contribute to what was mentioned earlier by Senator McGreehan about the ablest attitude.  It will overcome this.  People with disabilities are used to being creative in how they need to get around within their communities because of all the barriers that are there.</p> <p>  Active contributors were mentioned.  In the first week after the invasion of Ukraine, we put on our website links to our members who are working on it so people could support their work directly.  Organisations for people with disabilities are providing cash assistance to people with disabilities in Ukraine.  They are helping people to find accessible shelter as they travel across Ukraine and to find accessible transport.  It is the humanitarian responders and UN that should be going into dangerous places and making sure people have food, water and medical assistance.  In fact, the disability community has been doing this proactively.  I was discussing this with our Hungarian member, who explained they do not have much accessible transport themselves but they had lent their buses to evacuate people from Ukraine to get through Hungary to get to another safe place.  They did this with an open heart but in the meantime they have no transport.  They knew the transport was needed to get people with disabilities out of Ukraine.  We see many examples.  I am not sure whether I have included for the committee links on our website to the work of our organisations but if not I will send them.  We have weekly meetings co-ordinating our work and helping people find solutions and link up together.  We also link up with humanitarian organisations so they are in a better position to do their job.  They are the ones who usually have the means and resources to be there in conflict and difficult settings.</p></speech>

I do not want to repeat what other members have touched on.  People with disabilities should be at the heart of all discussions in society and should have a space in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will the witnesses give practical suggestions in respect of how we can build expertise and capacity in disabled persons' organisations?  Many of them are still working with very limited resources and volunteers.  Is there anywhere the voluntary organisations can access the training and resources they need to strengthen their work on Article 11.</p> <p>  Ireland's representative organisation at the European Disability Forum is not a disabled persons' organisation.  What impact does this have on the ability of Irish disabled persons' organisations to benefit from learning opportunities at an international level and to have meaningful engagement on the implementation of Article 11?  Do the witnesses have examples or advice on how we can do better?  Ms Naughton gave great examples from other countries.  Without putting words into the mouths of the witnesses, can we in Ireland perform better?  If so, how can we do it?  We need the people themselves at the heart of it.  Nothing about us without us.  I come to every committee meeting with this in mind.  Much of the time it seems people who have a disability are not included.  We are here and we are doing the talking.  Politicians are the best in the world at speaking on behalf of people instead of including them.</p> <p>  I have spoken openly about how proud I am of Ireland taking in Ukrainian refugees.  Not all Ukrainian refugees are able-bodied people.  There have to be people who have disabilities among them.  What is the involvement of the witnesses in this?</p><p>Are people with disabilities around the table for discussions to integrate people from Ukraine with disabilities and other difficulties?  That is my final point.  Again, I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.777" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022042800002#G00200"><p>I thank the Senator for those good points.  The first she mentioned was about capacity.  Of course, a problem in every country is the ability of DPOs to be able to have the resources to do their work.  We find in many countries now, when governments take a good initiative to try to include people with disabilities in developing transport policy, that if the DPOs do not have the human and financial resources to do the policy work, it is hard.  I will use the example of the European Disability Forum.  We have staff to participate in policy advocacy, analysis, giving input and me being here today because we have public funding.  The European Commission has the rights, equality and citizenship programme and there is an open call for applications.  It is not a closed, targeted call as some countries would have.  DPOs are able to apply, explain what they can do, explain what they want to do and receive funding.  I am not saying that with this funding there are not co-financing requirements and other obligations, but it is public funding.</p> <p>  The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities did a general comment on the participation of persons with disabilities, and funding of a diverse disability movement was one of the things to which it drew the highest amount of attention.  Reliable, sustainable funding is required, even in crises.  I remember the first meeting I had with our board when Covid-19 started; we called it corona then.  The only DPO in our membership that had immediately been given some funding from its government to help was Disabled Peoples' Organizations Denmark.  The government had come to it and asked how it could help the government reach people with disabilities.  It gave funding to help DPOs get their work online, to help people with disabilities tackle isolation and loneliness and to help target them with information that was accessible.  This was funding that was provided in the emergency to help offset the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on people with disabilities when there was the lockdown.  Honestly, the real start is public financing.</p> <p>  The second issue is how to reach all the active national grassroots DPOs and not only the platform organisations at national level and European level.  Indeed, the work we do in Brussels, even in policy advocacy, is very far away from people's day-to-day reality.  We will continue something that happened during the Covid-19 pandemic.  A lot of training and capacity building was previously only for members who were able to provide a budget for travelling to meetings, but we do an awful lot of things online now.  Obviously, people must have an Internet connection and so forth, but we have way more participation in training and networking events online.  We miss the networking, relationship building and collaboration of face-to-face meetings, but we will keep a lot of training online.  It is keeping an open door.  There is a lot of information provided for anyone who wishes to show up.  That is accessible with sign language and captioning, so it is still necessary to put some resources in.</p> <p>  Even national organisations that do not have all the grassroots organisations in their memberships can provide things through their websites and through online meetings.  They can make sure everybody has the information and can get involved.  When a consultation is being done, for example, on new climate actions in Ireland, while it is very dry to do just a written contribution or consultation online through the website, it still allows people to contribute.  Having public debates online in accessible formats means ordinary people who do not have the days to travel to Dublin for meetings can participate.  Making it low-threshold entry for people to participate in discussions is something that could enhance involvement of grassroots organisations and enable them to participate.</p></speech>

I will share an example.  We did some research last year which looked at the challenges organisations of persons with disabilities have in terms of operating within the countries we work in and as our partners, because we work in partnership with organisations of persons with disabilities.  One of the key things that came out of that research, and I can share it later with the committee, is the area of funding.  Funding is critical for our organisations.  In fact, core funding is critical.  What we have a lot of the time is project-based funding which gives opportunities to respond.  Quite an amount of funding came during Covid-19 and it was focused on being able to respond to that, and now it is also the case with Ukraine.  However, all of that is very much project-focused.  Core funding is a critical thing for organisations of persons with disabilities.  It gives them the opportunity to develop their own strategy.  It gives them the space to be able to respond to their membership.  That was one of the things we found in our research.</p> <p>  We have a range of partnerships with organisations of persons with disabilities in the work we do.  At a global level, we have strategic partnerships with the International Disability Alliance and the World Blind Union, where we fund in to give funding that allows both organisations to be able to take their work forward rather than us actually giving funding and directing that work directly.  They have the space to do that.  At community level, we are very much the same in terms of the organisations we work with, looking at what funding is needed.  Always in one's work on funding there is the issue of the funder giving funding with criteria or conditions that need to be adhered to.  While that is also important for due diligence on the legal side and the financial side, there needs to be some space with regard to giving organisations the space to be able to grow as well.  This is the critical thing around funding.  I echo Ms Naughton's comments on that.  Funding and resourcing organisations of people with disabilities would be critical from the Irish Government's perspective.</p></speech>

They spoke about various countries and the humanitarian issues that are facing people with disabilities.  What is very much before us at present is people with disabilities coming from Ukraine.  There are also many other countries the witnesses work with.  I was in Burkina Faso some time ago and saw people with disabilities on the street, abandoned and in very difficult situations.</p> <p>  I have been reflecting on the evidence the witnesses have given this morning.  When Covid-19 struck in March 2020, people with disabilities and their families and carers were almost abandoned by the State for the first complete lockdown.  The services that were in place, the service providers, the backup, the respite care and so forth formed one of the areas where everything was closed through lockdown, and those who are most vulnerable have always suffered the most.  In Ireland, which is a relatively wealthy country in terms of providing services, and across the globe, when a humanitarian crisis hits, be it a pandemic, war, famine, flooding or whatever, the most vulnerable are always the most at risk.  We need to be able to highlight that and to put it at the very forefront of the discussions that are happening.  The issue is that when the crisis hits, the most vulnerable are the people who are the most affected.  In July, August and September of 2020, when the real issues of the first lockdown were highlighted, people with disabilities were the people who were hit the hardest during that part of the pandemic in terms of isolation and human carnage, along with the mental health issues that followed it.  The witnesses' evidence has been very worthwhile.  Do they wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

That is probably no longer an excuse now in many senses.  A pandemic has happened so future thinking needs to ensure the gaps that were evident do not happen again and consider how the policy piece comes around that.  The OPD involvement in that is really critical.  However, it is a bigger picture, and it is linked to the climate emergency, than this way of thinking that we can suffer through and get to the end of this crisis.  The critical thing is that crises are coming regularly and almost daily now.  If we do not manage to get our systems, be they Government or NGOs, to be capable of rapid response - that is one of the key things about humanitarian systems - and if we are not able to have systems that are fluid enough for rapid response, we are always going to have these conversations about those who are left behind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.782" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2022042800002#H00200"><p>I think it is even worse than what was said about Covid-19 because not only were people left out in the lockdown, at the beginning in a number of European countries that tried to go for that herd immunity approach, the public health announcements actually said this is just like a flu for most people and the only people at risk of dying are older people or people with pre-existing conditions.  People's lives were totally devalued.  In some cases we saw institutions where staff were shipped off to hospital to be treated and the residents were left behind.  It showed us that however far advanced we think we are, we are actually a lot further behind.</p> <p>  The joint committee can play a very important role in showing this example of dialogue, planning and discussing together.  I realise I did not answer one of Senator Flynn's questions about Ukrainians with disabilities arriving to the country.  It could be very useful to have a conversation at some point with Ukrainians with disabilities who have arrived to try to find ways to show a good example.  Ireland has a very important diplomatic role in the world and could show a great example of how to receive refugees with disabilities in a time of war by identifying who they are, providing the support they need and helping them, during the time they are with us, to participate in all parts of Irish society, including the economy.  Ireland has done a great job in welcoming people from Ukraine to the country, so to continue and enrich the ongoing discussion on the emergency, perhaps the committee can dig deeper when it comes to those people and families with disabilities to show some good practice for the future and how this can be improved.  As the Vice Chair said at the beginning, there are wars going on all over the world and displacement of people is happening.  Perhaps this is an area Ireland can strive to deal with really well.</p></speech>

To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or in close proximity and to adhere to public health advice.</p> <p>  Today's meeting is an engagement with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality related to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV.  I sincerely welcome the Minister.  She is participating via Teams from her Leinster House office, where she is accompanied by Mr. Ben Ryan, assistant secretary in the Department of Justice.  We are grateful to them for their engagement on this important module and this important part of our work.  </p> <p>  I will read the note on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee but if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to particular matter, and they continue to do so, witnesses are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  They are directed that only evidence that is connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  </p> <p>  I now call the Minister to make her opening statement.  We are delighted to have her here with us.  We have already had a number of hearings on the recommendations of the citizens&rsquo; assembly.  We see our role as a committee to prepare an action plan for the implementation of those recommendations.  We are grateful to the Minister for her engagement with us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022042800002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chair and committee for giving me opportunity to join them this morning to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, in particular, regarding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I thank them for their support and commitment on this issue.  I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairperson, Dr. Catherine Day, and other members of the assembly for their dedication to, and hard work on, this topic.  I welcome the Citizens' Assembly's examination of these critical areas of life and policy.  As the committee members will be aware, this is an area of work on which I, as well as my colleagues in government, have identified as a priority.  We welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in advancing these recommendations.  It should be underlined that the majority of the recommendations are very much aligned to work that is being carried out across Departments and in particular, by my own Department.  Any recommendations that are not already captured by our ongoing work will, of course, be considered on their own merits.</p> <p>  Some of the work aligned to the recommendations made by the assembly includes the audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is segmented across different Government agencies, which was published in July of last year.  As well as this, there is the development of the third national strategy to address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which I will submit to Government in the coming weeks.  There is also the review of the provision of accommodation for victims of domestic violence, which was undertaken by Tusla and was published in February.  It took into consideration both the needs of victims and the types of accommodation that is required.</p> <p>  In addition, as part of the implementation of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, my plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence, we worked with our NGO partners and others to map the journey faced by individual victims to identify issues and support needs not met.  Following this, my Department conducted a review of the grant schemes application to identify and address any gaps in services.  On the foot of the outcome of this work, I provided additional funding of &euro;445,000 to organisations in 2021 to fill the gaps that were identified.  The mapping exercise identified situations in which there are parallel civil and criminal proceedings, and possibly child protection proceedings, as having the potential to further traumatise victims and to give opportunities for perpetrators to seek to exercise coercive control.  My Department is working with key NGOs to identify practical solutions based on international best practice to address these issues.</p> <p>  Work is under way to develop specific training for all of the key personnel, including those in the legal profession, with whom a victim may come into contact during their journey throughout the criminal justice system.  The introduction of preliminary trial hearings will reduce delay and allow for sensitive legal issues to be dealt with before the trial starts.  In March, my Department held its inaugural victims&rsquo; forum for State, social and community groups.  Findings from these forums will assist my Department, and indeed other Departments, in developing further supports for victims. </p> <p>  Improving the system for victims, particularly for vulnerable victims, is a key priority for me and for my Department.  As part of the reforms being introduced under Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, the victim will be entitled to their own dedicated legal advice and support throughout the process.  The major reforms we are driving will collectively ensure we have a criminal justice system that places victims at its centre and that removes the fear many victims have in coming forward to report what happened to them.  This should be a system that supports, informs and empowers vulnerable victims at every point.  I appreciate that that is not the case at the moment.  That is what we are striving to achieve. </p> <p>   I am also currently leading work on a new whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which will further advance the recommendations made by the assembly.  This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention, as well as on ensuring that victims are better supported.  It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. </p> <p>  A number of the objectives in the new national strategy are in line with the assembly's recommendations.  The first of these is to ensure the availability of accessible, quality specialist and community-based domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services across the State, so that all people who experience domestic, sexual or gender-based violence have access to integrated services, no matter where they live.  Another objective is to ensure a victim and survivor-centred wraparound service through the creation of a clear, integrated local pathway.  This builds on the mapping of the victim and survivor journey work we have done.  It is for adults and for children, both female and male, victims and survivors to access the domestic violence and sexual violence information services and various different supports.  The strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals that we set.</p> <p>  I am finalising the strategy for submission to Government in light of the public and sectoral consultations that formed part its development.  I am also working on finalising an accompanying action plan for the rest of this year and next year, which will set out how each of the arms and aims of the strategy will be achieved, which Departments and agencies are responsible for them and the timeframe for delivery, so that it is targeted, ambitious and deliverable.  I intend to bring both the finalised strategy and the action plan to Government in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  Furthermore, it is my goal that everyone who needs a refuge space will get one.  I am deeply committed to working with partners in the sector and with Government colleagues to achieve that.  I acknowledge that this is also a key recommendation. </p> <p>  In February, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and I published the review by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, of accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  The review highlights gaps in geographical coverage and inadequate provisions for safe accommodation.  It provides a list of priority areas where additional services would address the most immediate need.  I fully acknowledge the need to dramatically increase the provision of refuges across the country.  Key to this will be ensuring that organisations can access the funding that they need.  To this end, I have established a high-level interdepartmental group to review the current system for the provision of refuge space and accommodation and to identify changes that can be made to deliver additional spaces as effectively and as quickly as possible.  The timelines for delivery of refuge places, as well as further targets for national and nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation, will be outlined in the third national strategy.  Further detail will be contained in the accompanying action plan.  </p> <p>  Committee members may also be aware that the Government will, for the first time, establish in law a national agency whose task will be responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The agency will be responsible for overseeing all of the actions set out in the third national strategy for delivering domestic violence services.</p><p>It will bring together the expertise that exists within my Department and Tusla and will report to me and to any other subsequent Minister for Justice.  Bringing the responsibility for policy and service delivery together under one Ministry, establishing the agency in law, and introducing oversight from the Department of the Taoiseach demonstrate our recognition of the need to have a dedicated and expert-focused approach to this work.  It demonstrates our commitment to work together to reach our goal of zero tolerance and to ensure the coherent delivery of the best possible DSGBV services and supports throughout the country.</p><p> I want to emphasise that I am committed to the challenge of preventing and responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I acknowledge that while we have achieved a lot in this area, much work still needs to be done.  Zero tolerance of all forms of DSGBV is an ambitious but necessary goal and by continuing to work together I am confident we can achieve that.  I very much look forward to continuing to work with the committee to progress the recommendations of the assembly.  I again thank the members for having me before the committee this morning.</p></speech>

I acknowledge her immense personal commitment to addressing this issue and to moving forward with the Supporting A Victim's Journey plan.  That was acknowledged by the NGOs that appeared before us on this module as well in previous weeks.  I will ask members to engage in questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.792" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022042800002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister for her time this morning.  It is very much appreciated.  I hope she has had an opportunity to follow some of the work this committee has been doing in recent months.  The committee has a short timeframe and we are very much focused on ensuring that what came out of the citizens' assembly is translated into actions for citizens.</p> <p>  I commend the Minister's statement, in particular the commitment to recognise and acknowledge those historic and current gaps in supports and services for survivors of DSGBV.  That is critical.  It is very important that she had it in her opening statement and I recognise that.  I want to focus on a couple of different areas of the third strategy.  Delivery of any plan is contingent on effective implementation, which is also then reliant on adequate budget allocations from the Government.  Could the Minister confirm if the action plan to follow the publication of the third strategy will be published before the summer recess?  Will she and her Department be the accountable body in respect of the implementation of the action plan?  I ask this in light of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, which was to have oversight of DSGBV; however, it seems to meet quite sporadically, perhaps twice in 2020 and once in 2021.  I recognise the role Covid in that scenario, but the committee has met only once so far this year.  Is that likely to change with the new responsibility of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence?</p> <p>  How will regular reporting on the performance be measured?  Has the Minister given consideration to publishing a quarterly or biannual performance indicator, similar to what the Garda does in its monthly report to the Policing Authority?  Will she make it available?  This is most important.  Publicly available information on performance indicators is a key tool to demonstrate not just the commitment but delivery, transparency and accountability.  It could play a very positive role when it comes to our efforts to halt DSGBV.  Significant commitments have been made around the fourth pillar and I do not think any of us would be straying from the truth if we say there has never really been effective policy co-ordination and implementation at national and local level.  I understand this is a big ask, but reporting could go some way to addressing concerns.</p> <p>  The Minister also acknowledged in her opening statement that there is a requirement for significant current and capital expenditure.  The current annual budget allocated to DSGBV is quite small.  Figures provided by Departments in January of this year put the figure in or around &euro;40 million.  That is quite a low level of funding, given the task in hand.  Has the Department costed in full the third strategy and will a budget for its implementation be sought by the Minister when the strategy is submitted to the Cabinet?  She mentioned that would happen in the coming weeks.  It is key for survivors and advocates that Government commitments are backed up with clear budget lines and costing, not just on an annual basis but for the lifetime of the plan.</p> <p>  I wish to touch briefly on refuges and the services provided.  This is an anomaly that has never sat easy with me or most of the service providers with whom I engage on a regular basis.  I refer to the fact that there is no dedicated capital expenditure budget in any Department to provide safe accommodation for survivors of domestic violence, DV.  We understand that the capital funding for approved housing bodies and Cl&uacute;id services to provide refuge accommodation is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but the current position is that the primary responsibility for the provision of refuge places is with Tusla.  The primary purpose of the homeless current expenditure is for those who cannot provide accommodation from their own means, not specifically for victims of domestic and gender-based violence.  We recognise that capital assistance scheme, CAS, funding is available to approved housing bodies, but there seems to be a lack of any proactive measures from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deliver accommodation specifically for victims of domestic and gender-based violence.</p> <p>  The Minister acknowledged that we do not meet our obligations under the Istanbul Convention to provide adequate accommodation and wrap-around supports.  Tusla provides just one third of the refuge spaces that we are obliged to have under the convention.  Nine counties have no DV refuge places at all.  My county of Longford has no DV accommodation provider.  The Minister mentioned the report by her and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We need to substantially increase the number of refuge places given the current needs, projected needs and international obligations.  Who is responsible for the delivery of the 60 units?  There is a growing concern that this identified immediate need will not be progressed until the DSGBV State agency is established.  That would be wholly unacceptable given that it has been established as a current need.  Has the budget been secured for the 60 additional units?  What is the timeframe for delivery of them and will they include the wrap-around supports and services?</p> <p>  In terms of the service providers on the ground currently, it appears there is an over-reliance on communities and people's generosity in terms of fundraising to meet the resource needs of applying to multiple State agencies for different streams of funding.  That was very much exposed during Covid.  Because there is no multi-annual funding in place, it makes planning for these services incredibly difficult.  We really lag behind international norms on this issue.  I fail to see how a proper service level agreement that is fit for purpose could not include multi-annual funding.  What progress has been made to rectify this?  Will funding for operational costs be streamlined so that these services are not applying to multiple Departments for multiple sources of funding?</p> <p>  We recently heard from AkiDwA, which gave rather compelling evidence on the issues that face migrant women who experience domestic violence and abuse.  One of the issues they raised passionately is the limited value of allowing a woman to remain in Ireland on a stamp 3 visa, where she is unable to financially support herself or her children.  Why is the provision to obtain a stamp 4 visa, with permission to work, through ministerial consent, not included in the INIS domestic violence guidelines?  We need to have very clear pathways for protection, support and care for these migrant women who are reliant on our immigration system.  That seems to be lacking at the moment.  Does the Minister believe the third strategy adequately provides and protects migrant women and immigrant victims of DSGBV?</p><p>Does the third strategy include a national action plan to address female genital mutilation, FGM, in Ireland?  If not, why not?</p></speech>

The Minister might take as long as she likes in responding to those because there is a great deal of substance and the Deputy touched on quite a number of matters that were raised with us in previous hearings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.795" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022042800002#D00300"><p>If I skip over any of the issues, the Chairman might remind me but I think I have made a note of most of what the Deputy mentioned.  This will absolutely be published before the summer recess.  I appreciate the intention was to publish it this month but we want to ensure we get a number of elements right.  The change for the provision of services from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to my Department has meant we have had a particular focus on that work and ensuring there is enough done on the development of new refuge accommodation for inclusion in the strategy.  It is a really important element of the strategy.</p><p>I also took a decision to have a final consultation, knowing it would probably delay the publication of the strategy.  This was important as we have consulted with people, organisations and representative groups.  We have worked side by side with them for the past year and half.  That has slightly delayed things but I can confirm that it will be published before the summer recess.  It will be published in a matter of weeks.</p><p>There are a number of layers in the structures we have in place with respect to accountability.  The Deputy mentioned the Cabinet committee on social affairs.  Currently, the Department of Justice - that is me and my team - will oversee the implementation of the strategy but it is a whole-of-government strategy.  The agency working with the Department will oversee the implementation when it is set up.  The Cabinet committee on social affairs will meet on a regular basis but we do not have to tie down particular dates.  It will be meeting more regularly than it does now.  There is a separate structure involving the Secretaries General from the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department, who will meet to ensure the information needed for the Cabinet committee can be provided and there is time for the Departments to be engaged.  There are quite a number of sides involved but the day-to-day implementation will be through the Department and agency.</p><p>There will be continuous work to develop the agency and measures will be put in place to ensure continuous engagement with front-line workers and the community and relevant sectors.  We are already engaging with them and we are looking to identify the best way to establish the agency within the critical path was set out by the various different players and things that need to happen over the next 18 months.  Everything will be done in consultation and that will continue when the strategy is launched.  If something is not happening or working, we will get the feedback from the sector and those working on the ground.  That will be very helpful.  This is the first time we have co-designed our strategy with the sector and I hope that process has been very beneficial for both sides.</p><p>On reporting, the intention is to report on a half-year basis.  We need to allow time for work to progress and things to happen.  As there is a level of engagement and structure built into the agency, there will always be that engagement with the sector and those working on the ground.  We will set out clearly the budget not just for this and next year but for the lifetime of the strategy.  That will include not only my Department but other Departments and their actions.  Quite a number of actions will not require any additional funding within a budget but there will clearly be funding required that would be new money.  Of course, with regard to current spending for the delivery of services, funding will increase, and there will be capital spending on refuges and accommodation.  We have already set out figures as to how much it will cost to deliver in the short, medium and long term throughout the strategy.</p><p>With regard to refuges, accommodation and related services, the intention is there will be wrap-around support for services connected with refuge and accommodation.  I appreciate that to date there has not been <i>per se</i>, a dedicated DSGBV capital fund and instead it has come through the capital assistance programme.  That means it is very much a bottom-up approach in that agencies, individuals, community groups and local authorities must go to the scheme and Tusla, and it is quite a difficult and lengthy process.  If there is no agency on the ground or particular group that is willing to drive the process, or if there are just other challenges preventing it from happening, this can be a very difficult process.  The interdepartmental group I mentioned has been established, and it comprises representatives of my Department and the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as Tusla.  We are currently looking at the structure and how it can improved so it is not just a bottom-up approach.  There must be potential, if the State must intervene, for there to be a more proactive approach in that regard.</p><p>We are already engaging with various different refuges on the ground working on new projects.  We are getting information from them on what is working and not, and we are sharing best practice.  That will help us deliver best practice in capital delivery.  It is the same as when we build schools, we have a template and we know what works or is best practice.  We want something similar here so that every refuge is not just about physical beds and the accommodation that people need but the wrap-around supports, services and environment that must come with that.  We are looking beyond that in terms of other supports people might need separate to the refuge.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has said publicly that the capital assistance scheme and his Department will support funding to develop those other ancillary supports and not just the accommodation piece.</p><p>I am very conscious there are nine counties where there are no refuges.  I was in the Deputy's county recently and met representatives of the local women's network.  I know there is fantastic work happening on the ground and we must harness those efforts in working with organisations to see how we can deliver new accommodation as quickly as possible.</p><p>On the question of who is responsible, we are working with Tusla and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to sign off on a memorandum of understanding, MOU.  Once that is signed, my Department and I as the Minister will be responsible for the delivery of services working directly with Tusla.  That means there will be no gap.  Currently the work is happening, as it normally does, between Tusla and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Once the MOU is signed, the responsibility will transfer to my Department.  Once the agency is established, that will take over in that regard.  I assure people there will be no gap.</p><p>There was a question on timelines and this takes in the short, medium and long term.  People might see a couple of months as the short term but irrespective of how much we can tidy the process, shorten it and improve it, it takes time to develop and build any time of accommodation and ensure services and supports are correct and fit or appropriate for what we need.  In the short term we will be able to set ourselves target over the next two years for what we will deliver in the lifetime of the strategy, which is five years.  The longer-term plan is for ten years.  That is the way it has been set out the Tusla accommodation review to ensure we can meet our Istanbul Convention requirements.</p><p>We agree that funding must be increased for service providers and that is what we are working on.  That is to ensure we are not just getting increased funding every year to match the increase in accommodation but that we are looking at increasing support for those people already there and the work already happening to allow those services to expand.  In many counties where we have accommodation, it must expand as well.  It is not just about new accommodation but expanding the services that are there, which will require additional current funding.  We are looking at all those figures, which will be set out in the strategy when it is launched.</p><p>On the question of migrant women, there is a particular focus on ensuring that those who are most vulnerable have access to supports and information and they are supported in the best way possible.  That is why we have engaged with many of the organisations and they have been key in providing the type of information we need to ensure this strategy is adequate and it protects immigrant and migrant women.  That includes looking at our immigration system and ensuring that information is provided in the right language.  It means working with the organisations that are closest to those communities.</p><p>On the question of female genital mutilation, one of the requests was that this would allow anybody to seek international protection.  It already falls under &quot;gender&quot; as a reason to be able to seek international protection.</p><p>That is a UN term that captures quite a number of different things.  Certainly, if somebody has been a victim of FGM, she is currently legally entitled to seek international protection.  There will be further work done, through the Department of Health, on the strategy on this particular issue as well.  I think that I have touched on most issues but I am happy to come back in if I missed something. </p></speech>

Will the memorandum of understanding she mentioned apply to the provision of the urgently needed 60 new additional units, as identified in the report done by the Ministers for Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth?  Has a budget been secured for the units?  I have no issue with what the Minister said about the timeframe.</p> <p>  She is correct that the provision of refuges or places in communities is driven by groups on the ground.  That is something we have historically seen develop without a grand plan being put in place.  A group formed, recognised a need and went through the process of ensuring there was safe accommodation in their community.  The Minister was also correct that there needs to be more Government involvement in that because while a group may have the capability and skills to apply for these services and these places, that in no way, shape or form takes into account the need on the ground.  The initiative needs to be driven by Government but based on recognised need and not based on a group that may or may not have the capability..</p> <p>  Finally, is the Minister happy that the plan has been fully costed?  Is she happy that she has a good idea how much it will cost to implement the plan?  Is she confident that the budgetary needs will be made available?</p></speech>

I cannot say that we have the final budget but, yes, I am confident that there is a very clear commitment by all of the Government that the strategy will be funded.  So if it is going to work, be implemented, have the desired effect and there is zero tolerance across all of government and all sectors, the strategy needs to be fully budgeted.  I am confident that it will be but we are still finalising and engaging with Departments.  We have not reached a point where I can say that we have the overall figure but we are close.</p> <p>  The MOU will apply to accommodation and not just the delivery of service, all of which will move over to my Department and then the agency will have specific responsibility.  That is an important element because it will work closely with the sector.  This is not about replacing the invaluable organisations that work on the ground; this is about supporting them, learning from them and then using all of that information to be targeted and focused.  As the Deputy has outlined, this should not be about where there is a group on the ground and capability to be able to apply.  Organisations will have the capability and no accommodation but at the same time it is a very difficult process and we have to look for it.</p> <p>  What we are trying to make sure, through the work that we are doing in the interdepartmental group, that will then be taken over and implemented through the agency, is that it is looking at need, population and assessing goals and objectives.  The approach is everyone who needs a refuge space will get one and to date, unfortunately, that has not been the case.  We have fantastic accommodation and fantastic people work in this sector but we need to fill the gaps.  We also need it to be a little more-----</p></speech>

No. 37 states: "All Government action to prevent and counter domestic, sexual and gender-based violence should be coordinated by a Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for implementation of a national strategy."  The Minister has clearly set out that she is that "Cabinet Minister", not will be, and that this principle is being implemented in the transfer of responsibilities entirely to the Department of Justice, which is welcome.</p> <p>  We, as members of the committee, are conscious that the murder of Ashling Murphy put an immense focus on the gaps in service provision for the victims and survivors of DSGBV.  We are glad that the aim to have a zero tolerance of DSGBV in society has been included in the draft national strategy, which we welcome.  I am also glad, as Chairperson, and along with committee members, to see that the draft national strategy is aligned with the important recommendations made by the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a number of issues that I have with specific recommendations, and that arise from the hearings that we have already had and the previous exchange with Deputy Clarke.  First, we are glad to hear that the new national strategy will be published before the summer recess and, indeed, in a matter of weeks.  I was glad to hear about the action plan.  Will the action plan be published alongside the strategy?  I think that the Minister said that both will go to Government together so we could anticipate that they will be published together.  That will be important because we need to see the timeline in the action plan and that will inform our own work on the committee.</p> <p>  Recommendation 38 states: "Eliminate tolerance in our society of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence by developing and implementing awareness, prevention and education campaigns" and I am conscious that is somewhat beyond the traditional remit of the Department of Justice.  Given the Minister is committed to the establishment a new agency, which is also welcome, will it have a remit to implement or oversee the implementation of an "awareness, prevention and education campaigns"?  Next week, the committee will engage with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris.  We will examine these campaigns and their roll-out at third level, and in future weeks we will look at their roll-out across the education sector.  Again, just looking at the need for co-ordination, which underlies the Citizens' Assembly recommendations, the draft strategy and, indeed, the fourth pillar of the Istanbul Convention, which is policy co-ordination, will the agency have that remit?</p> <p>  I welcome that a statutory agency will be established as it will help with the implementation of the recommendations.  Is there a timeline for its introduction given primary legislation will be required?</p> <p>  Under recommendation 39(e), the assembly called for the "Putting in place a Victims/Survivors Commissioner as an independent advocate and voice for victims/survivors".   Is there a plan to put in place a commissioner for victims and survivors separately or as part of the remit of the new agency?  I am conscious that the Minister mentioned the very welcome introduction of an entitlement for victims to their own dedicated legal advice and support throughout the process and that provision may meet the need that was identified by the assembly.  The broader issue of "a Victims/Survivors Commissioner" was raised by the assembly.</p> <p>  Recommendation 39 also set out a number of points concerning the justice system, and specifically the courts system.  At previous committee hearings NGOs expressed serious concerns about a lack of co-ordination, in particular, between criminal and family court processes.  This is something that I have heard about for a long time.</p><p>Any of us who have met survivors have heard for so long about real frustration and distress.  Real damage has been caused in some cases to children, for example where family courts dealing with custody and guardianship issues do not have information on parallel criminal proceedings around domestic violence, breaches of protection orders and so on.  How can we ensure that co-ordination is better carried out?  Will that be the remit of the new agency?  What measures are being taken now in advance of the establishment of the agency?</p><p> A related issue also addressed in the citizens' assembly is the way in which counselling and medical records and the victim's character are addressed in courtroom settings.  The assembly has called for guidelines and specialist training for judges and lawyers, which the Minister addressed in her opening statement.  At the hearings we heard real concern from NGOs that the new provisions around admission of counselling records in the 2017 Act are still not really addressing victims' needs and concerns and are still enabling defence counsel to undermine the victim's character.</p><p> I am sorry, I have gone over time.  I have two more questions.  One is on coercive control.  We heard there was concern about a lack of understanding among criminal law practitioners and prosecution and policing authorities about how to police and prevent coercive control.  Finally, on recommendation 42, which the Citizens' Assembly put forward under a different heading, Gender Equality Principle in Law and Policy, the assembly called for a statutory body for gender equality under the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister charged with cross-Government co-ordination of gender equality issues.  We flagged with the Minister that we would ask her about that even though it is beyond the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Does the Government have any plans for a broader statutory body for gender equality and broader co-ordination on gender equality issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.803" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022042800002#F00200"><p>On the vast majority of the recommendations, work is already in train or will be included in the strategy, which is really positive.  The Chairman mentioned the completion of the first one in respect of a dedicated Minister, the agency and better co-ordinated structures that we are putting in place that I mentioned previously.</p> <p>  In terms of the agency itself, the timeline we have set out is 18 months.  There is potential for the time to be shorter or for it to be longer, but I would hope it will not take longer.  That is based on the time it has taken for previous agencies to go through the initial phase of passing the legislation, establishment and everything else.  We have a critical path, as I mentioned, that my Department has set out, looking at all the actions that need to happen.  We have already started that work.  We have started engagement with the sector to make sure the structures that are in place are correct.  The critical path will be included in the strategy so we will be able to see how things are progressing.</p> <p>  The remit is not just the delivery of service and refuge accommodation but will also include responsibility for the delivery of national campaigns.  The latest strategy had a particular focus on national campaigns.  It was split into two segments over six years and we had various campaigns around the themes "What would you do?" and "No excuses", which only finished up last year.  The intention for the new strategy is that there will be more focused campaigns and education pieces within our schools.  We are working closely with the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, on that piece.  We are also already working with higher education institutions and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris.  He is working on a consent campaign and a national consent hub with NUI Galway.  From that, a wider national campaign on consent will follow.  That will happen before the agency is in place but anything subsequent in terms of campaigns will be delivered through the agency.  </p> <p>  The agency will also be responsible for gathering information.  That is something I think we are missing when it comes to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, having enough information to be able to develop our policy.  Much of it comes from the sector, which is amazing, but it is important that we have very clear and defined information and that we are collecting it on a regular basis.  The agency will be tasked with that.</p> <p>  The commissioner is not something we have on our agenda in terms of actions.  What I have tried through Supporting A Victim's Journey is to identify and map the journey a typical person may go on as they go through the criminal justice system.  We have been working with the sector, those who are on the front line and who engage with victims, and we have been speaking directly to victims, to identify gaps in the system and where we need to expand our support or provide additional funding.</p> <p>  Separate to that, we established a national victims' forum, which met for the first time approximately two months ago.  It is not specific to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence but a vast majority of the organisations that are engaged with the forum deal with this issue.  The intention is that there will be an opportunity for different committees and working groups on topics that people want to work on to make sure victims' voices are heard and that information feeds in.  It is something I am very open to exploring or looking at further if it is felt that a specific commissioner or a particular role within the agency is needed.  I am willing to look at that further to see if there is something more we need to do there.  The whole point of this is that the victim is at the very centre so their voice has to be heard at every stage.</p> <p>  On coercive control, and in any new laws that we pass, it is so important that the Garda, the legal professions, judges, and anybody else including those in the health sector are aware of this, know the laws, are up to speed and can pass that information on to their client or to victims and survivors.  A number of strands of work are happening in that regard under Supporting a Victim's Journey.  Education was a key priority for Tom O'Malley in his original report and subsequently in Supporting a Victim's Journey.  We have had training start with the Judiciary.  We have had court settings where there was specific training around domestic and sexual violence.  The intention as more judges are trained is that they would be able to train and engage with colleagues further so that we have a larger number of people who are specifically trained within the judicial system.  Similarly when it comes to our solicitors and barristers we have been engaged with the Law Society and Bar Council for almost two years now on this, identifying the education they are providing through their own structures and how we can improve it.  We are also doing a mapping exercise, similar to Supporting a Victim's Journey, to see where education is being provided across the various areas and how we can fill any gaps and where there needs to be improvement.</p> <p>  When it comes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I appreciate that for the past couple of years it has been difficult to provide the in-person training, which is absolutely vital in respect of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The Commissioner has given a commitment that in-person training will start again this year specifically for those in the divisional protective services units, DPSUs.  We would like to see in-person training expanded as part of the general training, in which it is included at the moment, and that it would happen on a regular basis to make sure that when we have new laws, such as those on coercive control, Coco's law or the forthcoming provisions on stalking and non-fatal strangulation, people are aware of them and victims benefit from that understanding.</p> <p>  Family and civil justice is something I am very conscious of.  One of the first people I spoke to coming in to the Department, a victim, explained that it was a massively difficult issue for her.  There are two elements to this.  The family justice oversight group has been looking at the family justice structures within the legal system.  It will be publishing an overall strategy for family law accompanied by the family courts Bill, which is going to develop family court hubs.  There will be a particular focus in that strategy, as well as the domestic violence strategy, on how we can bridge that gap where there are civil and criminal proceedings happening at the same time, and how we can make sure that people are not re-traumatised and that there is sharing and crossover of information where possible.  It will be encompassed in two different strategies, which are being worked on at the moment.</p> <p>  The medical records issue is very much part of Supporting a Victim's Journey.  We have been working with the Department of Health.  One of the key elements is making sure that victims know they can object to their records being presented in court.  That is often not known.  A body of work is being done to look at how it currently happens and what better mechanisms we can put in place to protect victims.  There is work ongoing on that and there will be further detail in the strategy.</p> <p>  There is no plan within my own Department to have a specific agency.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has appeared before the committee and he said the same.  He gave a commitment to write back to the committee.  While responsibility for gender equality used to be with the Department of Justice, it has now moved to his Department and he would be best placed to develop such an agency if that were to happen.  Of course, it would have my full and absolute support and that of my Department if that route were be taken.</p></speech>

I call Senator Pauline O'Reilly, the Vice Chair of the committee, to be followed by Deputy Clarke for a very short follow-up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.806" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022042800002#G00300"><p>I thank the Minister.  I wish to focus on recommendation 39(a).  The Minister mentioned the family courts Bill.  We have had internal discussions on the balance to be struck when it comes to mediation.  I believe that currently less than 5% of those involved in family law cases go through mediation prior to taking it to the courts.  What is the Minister's proposal?  How can we step up mediation and collaborative law while also ensuring that people are not forced into compulsory mediation?  When it comes to gender-based violence, it is important that people are free to go to the courts and are not forced to endure a longer period before exiting something that may be quite harmful to them.  I know that the National Women's Council has asked that we do not have mandatory mediation.  From people not involved it seems that the best outcome would be that everyone should go through mediation before going to court.</p></speech>

The Senator is right that there are cases where mediation is not the answer and is not the appropriate forum for people to engage.  She is also right that not enough people go through mediation.  Often a calm situation can become quite adversarial when it goes to the court, and it is often not the appropriate setting for people to reach an agreement.  The family justice plan of action will try to divert and create better pathways for mediation for people, while acknowledging that will not work for everybody and it certainly will not be mandatory.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.809" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022042800002#G00600"><p>A group, chaired by my Department, has been working on that over the past year.  It is linking in with the judicial system, the court structures and various representative groups, looking at best practice in other jurisdictions.  It is taking that information that we are developing now, the overall plan and the strategy itself.  Once we have it published, we will be able to go into it in greater detail.  However, I reassure the Senator that the group has been meeting for approximately a year and has had engagements with different groups, including children because much of the time children are involved in these cases.  We have tried to take in different perspectives - those who are in the system, those in the legal profession and also those outside it - and try to take it away somewhat from a legal setting.</p> <p>  Obviously, the hubs themselves could be extremely important where we have not just the courtroom but we have these other types of supports available to people.  I was recently in Dolphin House which has that type of support there, including the facility for mediation in the same building as the courtroom.  It is about ensuring that people are aware it is there, know what it can do and how it can help them.  We need to ensure those supports are available to people in the same place at the same time.  That is where the signpost is for any other type of support they might need.</p></speech>

What can already be quite a lengthy process is often lengthened further because of mediation.  That is often the reason people do not enter into mediation because it is quite difficult to get practitioners.  I assume funding will be included in that plan.</p></speech>

Senators Chambers, Doherty and I are co-signatories of that Bill.  Senator Doherty did considerable work on that, as did Noeline Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.  Key to that Bill is that we allow character witnesses to be cross-examined.  They come before a judge after someone has been found guilty.  It is about ensuring that they can be cross-examined.  We know there is a very low incidence of reporting cases of rape and sexual assault and subsequently of people following through and going through court procedures.  I know the Minister is doing significant work on that.  I ask her to ensure that the Bill progresses through the D&aacute;il with Government support or to incorporate the elements of the Bill into her own legislation.</p></speech>

I support the intentions of the Bill and anything that will encourage victims to come forward and to know that their voices will be heard even perhaps at the end when a decision has been made and sentencing is being passed.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, explained, a number of elements of the Bill need further work.  There is no issue with that.  It is a matter of engaging and trying to see where we can fit this into the general scheme of legislation that is passing through.  We have prioritised a number of Bills for this year.  We need to ensure we can progress this work while not delaying any other Bills.  It is something that I support, but we need to engage with each other and to look at the overall scope and intention of the Bill.</p> <p>  Supporting a Victim's Journey very much focuses on providing legal aid.  We need to see where that might fit because there are a number of questions around where and when that comes into play if somebody has not had them before.  We need to work through various details but, in general, I support the principles of the Bill.  It is about ensuring that we get the timing right and that we can also progress all the legislation that has been set out.</p></speech>

We have spoken at length about the need for refuge places and the need for those pathways, hubs and other supports.  I want to look at specifically in this instance where the safest place for the survivor is in the family home.  Yesterday afternoon SPARK and One Family made a presentation in the audiovisual room at which a deeply concerning issue was raised that I was not aware of.  Where a barring order has been put in place because of domestic violence and the abusing partner pays the mortgage on the property, that is assessed as means for the purposes of social welfare.  Phenomenal steps were taken during the Covid pandemic relating to rent supplement where the survivor of domestic violence needed to seek alternative accommodation.  In this situation there seems to be a very real discrepancy that is resulting in survivors and their children being further traumatised because if that is taken in as means, it results in reduced social welfare payments and increased levels of poverty.  The outlook for the family is much more challenging than it could be if this was simply looked at again.</p><p>We are in a position to provide payment, and rightly so, to those who flee the family home because of domestic violence but there does not seem to be the same corresponding level of support for those who are in a position to stay in the family home and the perpetrator of the abuse leaves.  Is the Minister aware of the discrepancy and anomaly?  What engagement has she had with her Cabinet colleagues who have more responsibility for social welfare payments, specifically under the second pillar of the convention that calls for safe accommodation to be made a priority?</p></speech>

He is extremely welcome, as are his staff.  We look forward to an excellent debate on the issues, which are of great importance, particularly those relating to the shared island unit and the fantastic work an Taoiseach is doing in that regard.  I compliment his Department and, of course, Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue and Mr. Eoghan Duffy.  They have been at meetings of the committee before, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  We have had very fruitful discussions.</p> <p>  We have received an apology from Mr. John Finucane MP, who cannot make it.  Since parties elected in the North, to the UK Parliament and here in the South are represented on this committee, we will make use of a rotation to ensure every party represented in this Parliament and in the UK Parliament gets to speak.  The rotation is as follows: Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, Alliance, the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and then Independent Members, including Aont&uacute;.  We might have a few minutes at the very end for a wrap-up.  That is the general rotation.  The committee is happy with that.  We also agreed that, after nine minutes of a contribution, we will indicate that there is one minute to go so that everybody gets a fair share.  Is everybody happy with that?  Yes.</p> <p>  I have to read the notice on privilege for everybody.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.  They may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given and should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person's or the entity's good name.  We have to read that note before every meeting.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the precincts of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not here.  That is standard and arises from the requirements of the Constitution.</p> <p>  I now call on the Taoiseach to make his opening statement, if he is ready.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe ar&iacute;s.  Beidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an-mhaith againn anseo inniu, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;.</p></speech>

Is pribhl&eacute;id dom a bheith i l&aacute;thair anseo, mar Thaoiseach, chun labhairt leis an gcoiste.  T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och den choiste as ucht a gcuid suime sna h&aacute;bhair seo.  It is good to have the opportunity to meet with this committee today to discuss the Government's shared island initiative.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh sp&eacute;is agus rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht an choiste, ar pr&iacute;omhghn&eacute;ithe iad agus muid ag tabhairt an tionscnamh ar aghaidh.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go n-iarrtar ar chomhalta&iacute; an choiste seo agus ar chomhalta&iacute; choist&iacute; &aacute;bhartha eile an Oireachtais a bheith rannph&aacute;irteach in&aacute;r n-imeachta&iacute; agus in&aacute;r n-idirphl&eacute;it&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la maidir le hoile&aacute;n comhroinnte.</p> <p>  I launched the initiative 18 months ago as a whole-of-government priority setting out a broad, positive, inclusive agenda focused on engaging with all communities and traditions to build consensus around a shared future and delivering tangible benefits for the whole island, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement, resoundingly endorsed by the people of this island in historic referendums almost 24 years ago, empowers us all to work for a better and reconciled future without in any way compromising our different and equally legitimate identities, beliefs and aspirations for the future of this island, whether nationalist, unionist or neither.</p><p>The Government's shared island approach involves raising the level of ambition for what we achieve through all-island partnerships; working with the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government, local authorities and civil society, delivering on cross-Border investment commitments and developing a new generation of projects focused on our major shared challenges, North and South; and fostering inclusive civic dialogue and a comprehensive programme of research to inform our shared island policy and to help build consensus on a shared future. <br/><br/>I would like to set out to the committee how we have taken this work forward so far and through this year.  Through the revised national development plan, NDP, last year the Government set out an unprecedented commitment of &euro;3.5 billion for all-island investment out to 2030, including an extended and increased commitment of at least &euro;1 billion this decade to the Government&rsquo;s shared island fund established in October 2020.  As part of the revised NDP, we defined new investment priorities across virtually all sectors to deploy this funding.  <br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Our goal is to work through all-island partnerships to invest for a more connected, sustainable and prosperous island for all.  The Government is working intensively to do that.  I established a shared island unit in my Department to drive and co-ordinate delivery of our priorities across all Departments.  In 2021, the Government allocated &euro;50 million from the shared island fund to start moving ahead with two long-standing cross-Border projects - the Ulster Canal and Narrow Water Bridge &ndash; that have been talked about for decades.  The Government also commenced a major new North-South research programme.  Last month, with the Minister, Deputy Harris, I announced more than &euro;37 million in the first awards by the Higher Education Authority under the programme, resourced through the shared island fund.  We are funding research teams in universities from all corners of this island to work on pioneering projects over the next four years, for example, on cancer and vaccine research, biodiversity conservation and developing an Atlantic innovation corridor across the multi-city region of Derry, Galway and Limerick.  These are just some of the 62 successful projects.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Earlier this month, I announced a new &euro;5 million shared island development funding scheme open to local authorities throughout the island.  Local authorities want to work together on a North-South basis, for instance to create tourism trails, conserve heritage, protect biodiversity and help meet regional skills needs.  This new funding initiative provides the seed capital to local authorities to bring their proposals to the point where they can then apply for more substantial support in both jurisdictions.  The aim is to empower councils to develop a pipeline of new cross-Border capital projects that will deliver common regional development goals and maximise the opportunities from working together on an all-island basis.  Through this year Ministers across government are working to advance new shared island fund projects, which includes electric vehicle charging infrastructure; cross-Border community climate action partnerships; Border region enterprise development and all-island civil society partnerships.  I also want to see culture, arts and creativity as a key pillar in the shared island initiative.  We are taking account of shared island themes and opportunities in developing the new Creative Ireland programme that will run for the next five years.  We are working to foster more co-operation between our arts councils and by culture Ministers to support a deepening of artistic and cultural exchange.  In the time ahead we need not just to better accept cultural diversity on this island, but to celebrate it.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The Government is also working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to move ahead with our cross-Border investment commitments under the New Decade, New Approach agreement.  This includes capital investment to support expanded access and collaboration on higher education in the north west region, working with Ulster University&rsquo;s Magee campus and the new Atlantic Technological University Letterkenny campus and delivering new cross-Border greenways and our transport connectivity commitments, including the Government&rsquo;s contribution to the A5 upgrade.  The shared island fund means that we have the resourcing ready to go for all of these major projects.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The Government and the Northern Ireland Executive have also commenced the first ever all-island strategic rail review to be completed later this year, including a focus on better connections for the north-west.  Informed by the outcome of this review we will make new strategic investments in sustainable rail, working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government.  We want to do significantly more with both the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government.  The PEACE PLUS programme, funded by the European Union, the British and Irish Governments and Northern Ireland Executive, will provide more than &euro;1 billion over the next seven years to support peace and prosperity on this island.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> We want to complement this with new, more strategic and impactful dimensions to our North-South and east-west relationships.  I have had good engagement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and with political leaders in Northern Ireland on how we can do that as part of our shared island approach.  By working and investing together on common goals, including on climate action and sustainable transport, we are aiming to move ahead this year to establish new all-island research hubs, supported on the Government side through the shared island fund and by Science Foundation Ireland to bring industry, research agencies and institutions together to conduct world-leading research and development in areas of common priority for both jurisdictions.  These hubs will contribute to our collective foreign direct investment, FDI, offering and indigenous enterprise base that supports good jobs in towns and cities throughout the island.  The Government wants to see a deepening of beneficial co-operation and societal connections on the island in all areas.  That is how we can, both in government and in society, take forward the core commitment of the Good Friday Agreement to &quot;strive in every practical way towards reconciliation&quot;.  As I know this committee will agree, that is a fundamental interest for us all on this island.  I have asked all Ministers to bring forward new investment, policy and co-operation initiatives that will deliver on our shared island priorities as set out in the NDP.  This work is under way co-ordinated by my Department.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> My Department has also commenced a wide-ranging shared island research programme, working with the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Irish Research Council and other partners.  Earlier today, I participated in the launch of the fourth ESRI shared island research report, which is the first systematic examination of education systems and outcomes across both jurisdictions on the island from primary through to tertiary levels.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> The ESRI has also examined and published reports in recent months on the structure and collaborative potential of the services economy, foreign direct investment and of primary healthcare systems, all on an island-wide basis.  ESRI work under way, to be published later this year, is examining renewable energy supports, productivity levels as well as migrant integration and early years experience and policy, North and South.  On 12 April, I participated in the launch event for a major report to Government by NESC - Shared Island: Shared Opportunity.  This was the first NESC report with a dedicated and strategic all-island focus. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Following broad-based consultation throughout the island over the past year, the council has made a series of recommendations on how we can deepen beneficial co-operation throughout the island in economic, social and environmental terms.  The council found very significant support in practice for all-island approaches to key challenges.  The Government will positively consider NESC&rsquo;s recommendations, co-ordinated by my Department, and we will seek to take them forward in consultation with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government.  We want to see all of the outputs under the shared island research programme informing policy, planning, political debate and agreed actions on how we work for a more equitable, connected and prosperous society on this island in the years immediately ahead.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> N&iacute;l aon amhras ach gurb &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad &oacute;c&aacute;id sa t&iacute;r ina bhfuilimid ag d&eacute;anamh an mh&eacute;id taighde seo ar an oile&aacute;n ina ioml&aacute;ine.  T&aacute; an m&eacute;id oibre a rinne an ERSI ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach.  Molaim &eacute; do bhaill an chomhchoiste mar d&eacute;ile&aacute;lann s&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais &oacute; thaobh m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste de go h&aacute;irithe sa Tuaisceart agus na ca&iacute;onna agus na deiseanna at&aacute; ann n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh chun infheist&iacute;ocht agus comhoibri&uacute; idir oideachas&oacute;ir&iacute; sa Tuaisceart agus sa Deisceart teacht le ch&eacute;ile chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na ceisteanna sin agus r&eacute;iteach na faidhbe sin a chur i bhfeidhm.</font></p><p>Broad-based, inclusive all-island civic dialogue is also central to the Government&rsquo;s approach.  Over the past year and more, more than 1,300 citizens and civic leaders have participated across nine events so far in our shared island dialogue series.  Inclusion is at the heart of these dialogues, involving people from across all sectors, communities, political traditions and regions.  We are ensuring the inclusion of voices that are not sufficiently heard in our peace process, particularly those of women, young people and ethnic minorities.  The dialogues are looking in practical ways at how we can better share this island, for instance, on climate action, healthcare co-operation, tourism and sport.  Dialogues are also engaging with societal questions around identity, culture, equality and inclusion.  Those are issues that we need to acknowledge and discuss and on which we need to do better together on this island.</p><p> The Government is hearing from those most directly involved in different sectors how a shared island agenda can be further pursued around impactful, beneficial, achievable actions by Government and civil society.  Shared island dialogues will be held throughout this year on an in-person and regional basis, a basis on which we did have an opportunity to proceed during the first year.  The next dialogue will be convened by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Heather Humphreys, on enabling rural and community development on a shared island, on 20 May in Monaghan.</p><p> These discussions are affirming the goodwill and common ground there is in civil society, across different communities and political traditions, to co-operate on common challenges for this island.  They are also making clear that people do not view identity in simplistic, binary terms, as it is too often portrayed in politics, particularly in Northern Ireland.  New voices, perspectives and experiences in our communities are reframing debates and defining new priorities for how we share this island in the years ahead.</p><p> In a dialogue I participated in with young people, equality, climate, education, economic opportunity and mental health were among the greatest concerns.  They want to see these issues far more to the fore in how we work through the Good Friday Agreement.  The dialogues are directly informing how the Government is working to deepen our North-South and east-west partnerships through the Good Friday Agreement.  They are also proving to be a starting point for broader and deeper civic conversations on a shared future.  They help build understanding, confidence and consensus around taking forward a more ambitious shared island agenda for the years ahead that can benefit all communities.  The Government will continue to support and engage with civic initiatives as an integral part of our shared island approach.</p><p> I want to say something about the political context for this work.  Next week, the people of Northern Ireland will vote to provide a new democratic mandate for the devolved power-sharing institutions at Stormont.  It is vital for the future of Northern Ireland and for relationships on these islands that the political parties take their mandates from the Assembly elections and move quickly to form a new Executive.  That is what the people of Northern Ireland want.  This is a moment for political leaders to live up to the commitments of the Good Friday Agreement, which is overwhelmingly supported by people across this island.  Political leadership by all with a role and responsibility is also fundamental in getting beyond the issues around Brexit and the protocol that have hindered the peace process over the past six years.  We need to return the focus to working collectively to support progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland and across this island and to realising the opportunities in our societal, economic, cultural and political relationships through the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.  These are the Government&rsquo;s objectives and responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are significantly prioritising, resourcing and delivering an ambitious, practical agenda to support that through our shared island initiative.  </p><p> I thank the Chair and committee members.  I look forward to discussing this work with them and to ongoing engagement with the committee on the shared island initiative.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have a discussion on this matter because the whole shared island concept has created a non-threatening space on the island, across societies, for the first time.  I welcome the Taoiseach's presentation.  There was a lot in it and it is a pity that we are constrained by time limits at this meeting.  To make the best use of the time available to me, I am going to go straight into questions.</p> <p>  My first relates to the Taoiseach's opinion on the significance of the research.  I know there are elements of society in Northern Ireland that, for example, cling onto the health services and use that as a vehicle to say they do not want an all-island economy.  We value the health service even though its outcomes on illnesses such as cancer and coronary care are worse than the equivalent outcomes in the South.  What is the significance of the research from the points of view of health, the all-island economy, education and young people who wish to attain jobs and lives?  What is the point to all this research?  Some would suggest it should be handed over to a citizens' assembly that should be allowed to do that work.  What is the Taoiseach's opinion on that?  Why do we not do that?</p> <p>  With respect to dialogue, I am conscious of the fact that conversations have got going.  The difficulty for me and some who are creating conversation is that the dialogue is very much one-sided and nobody seems to be reaching out to the unionist community.  What will a shared island dialogue with the Taoiseach's Department bring that is different?  How do we engage the Protestant community in Northern Ireland?  What is different in that regard?  What do the dialogues bring?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will not be left with enough time to answer the questions without that extension.  Not everybody is present.  Is that proposition okay with everybody?  It is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.834" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1633" speakername="Niall Blaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022042800002#C00500"><p>What is the Taoiseach's position on dealing with issues of legacy, truth and justice?  It has not been mentioned today but we met with a group from the United States yesterday - the Ancient Order of Hibernians, AOH.  The UK Government has put proposals out there that the Taoiseach has rejected.  What is his opinion in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.835" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022042800002#C00600"><p>The Taoiseach is very welcome, as are Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy.  Their time is precious and it is brilliant to have them here.  I have said on many occasions that the shared island unit has been the single most progressive move on the island of Ireland since the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a step change in how we look to the future as we try to build this island and its people to be stronger, better and more prosperous.  The whole ethos is about bringing our jurisdictions together because keeping them apart is no good without the people in the island coming together.  The shared island approach is pragmatic, practical and makes common sense.</p> <p>  Some people talk about making a plan for the future and creating a pathway.  One can either choose to accept or ignore that.  I choose to look to the facts.  I see the acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the Taoiseach's office and of all the incredible work he and his officials are doing with respect to the research.</p><p>This morning I pointed to the research published by the ESRI on education and training systems.  My question comes from that.  We have research.  We have the dialogue series and we have the projects.  I believe that will create the blueprint to create the future that we want.  In life, very few things are certain.  However, it is certain that we are stuck together.  This island is one island no matter what our constitutional status is.  We must look to the fact of that.  This shared island is the blueprint for the next 100 years, the next ten years, the next five years with all this on-the-ground work and all this incredible research.</p><p> I glanced through the executive summary on education.  How will the Department of the Taoiseach lead all this incredible knowledge?  How is the Department looking to spread that knowledge, working with the Northern Ireland Executive, when it comes to implement the changes based on the research and the incredible work that has been done to allow us to become more synchronised, with our policies converging close together?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.837" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022042800002#D00200"><p>I very much welcome Taoiseach's very positive message and his detailed presentation.  The shared island strategy will build on the benefits the island generates from the Good Friday Agreement.  Importantly, it can also harness the potential of the Agreement.  It is not just a strategy, but a strategy underpinned by substantial public funding.  A total of &euro;3.5 billion is committed in the NDP for all-island development up to 2030.  The Taoiseach stated there would be at least &euro;1 billion this decade for the shared island initiative.  That is fabulous funding, which can do an enormous amount across all sectors in our society.  What he has outlined are not just ambitious but realisable projects.  I very much welcome that the unit is funding local authorities.  In our engagement with departmental officials previously, we discussed the great corporate knowledge and know-how in local authorities in the Border region.  I am pleased that will be harnessed.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach also mentioned comhoibri&uacute; idir oideachas&oacute;ir&iacute; at higher education level.  I previously discussed with him the potential for the development of more structured co-operation on an all-Ireland basis in the provision of further education.  I mentioned the potential for Cavan Institute with our neighbouring college, South West College in Enniskillen.  I believe we need a strategy for further education.  As we know, many of the people who may have underachieved at younger stages in life, go through the route of progressing to further education and getting third level degrees and even higher qualifications.  Further education is very important in dealing with disadvantage and with skills deficits in some areas.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach also mentioned research hubs.  Since 1998 on our island, enterprise and commerce have gone ahead and done a considerable amount on an all-Ireland basis.  Some colleagues here will realise that in Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, south Tyrone and Armagh we have seen the interdependence of business and commerce.  In my home region, agrifood, engineering and construction projects are key drivers of economic development North and South of the Border.  I would like to see funding for enterprise centres not just research centres, but centres where workspace would be provided.</p> <p>  I very much welcome that the shared island unit is involving sectors, not just a limited 80 or 90 people mulling over every subject.  It is going out to young people and to different groups with particular interests in different subjects and involving them in putting forward suggestions for how they want to see our island develop on all-island, cross-border basis.  I very much welcome the Taoiseach's presentation.</p></speech>

Senator Blaney spoke about the shared island creating a space that is not a threatening.  It is important that it is creating a space where people, respecting each other's views on the constitutional question, can participate without fear or favour.  It is not a Trojan horse; it is designed to pragmatically create opportunities to solve problems on the island and enhance working together on the island.</p><p>The research is very significant because this is the first time that we have had a systematic research programme on different services and systems in the two jurisdictions on the island.  For example, the analysis this morning is of the education systems from primary to tertiary, and the outcomes.  It particularly focuses on school completion and educational disadvantage.  There are clear conclusions that on school completion there is a greater degree of early school leaving in the Northern system than there is in the Republic and that the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme and school completion programmes from the 1990s onwards and throughout the early 2000s have had a clear impact on improving school attainment and school completion in the Republic.</p><p>We would like to work with the new Executive and the UK Government in taking that forward.  Senator McGreehan asked how we can take it forward.  We also have lessons to learn from the North.  The Executive has taken an initiative on this and had an expert panel to examine this.  We would like to share ideas.  At one level of the education ecosystem is teacher research.  I would like to see the Drumcondra research centre with its counterpart in the North getting together and having an exchange in the first instance to look at the metrics to identify schools that would be eligible for a certain level of support, as we did in the Republic.</p><p>Educational disadvantage is a very long haul.  We cannot do stop-start initiatives.  It cannot be just a project-based initiative.  What came across from the stakeholder forum, which formed part of the ESRI research was that the educational communities, North and South, are ready to move beyond the project-based or <i>ad hoc</i>approach to educational projects.  They really want a more systemic programme-based long-term approach.</p><p>We stand ready to support any initiative in the North through funding and so on.  Obviously, we need to work with the educational interests in the North, the Executive and the UK Government.  We are very determined because it has been a long-term view of mine that this is one area that has not been progressed sufficiently in terms of early school leaving.  As Minister for Education and Science, I was involved in educational development projects in the Republic.  It is a long-held passion of mine that every child should be entitled to get an opportunity to complete school, irrespective of background, tradition or whatever.  We should do whatever we can on the island.  As co-guarantors of the agreement, that is an interest of ours.</p><p>Health is very important.  I will cover the three contributions together.  I was in Altnagelvin Hospital last week.  The Republic had allocated approximately &euro;20 million to the cancer centre there.  Patients on both sides of the Border benefit from that collaboration.  In the cath labs, I met patients from County Donegal who had just had stents inserted.  Instead of travelling to Galway city, it was a 20-minute journey to Altnagelvin Hospital.  I know that Deputy Smith is interested in Daisy Hill Hospital.  We should look at the health area and use the research base to see if we can add capacity to the health services in the Border area and look at it from a more regional perspective.  We need to see if we can win further support from both jurisdictions to add to that capacity and provide accessible services regionally.  That would also apply to Enniskillen and so forth.  The research will help us to do that.</p><p>The NESC research was particularly important because it is very strong on the climate issue.  Already out of the dialogues, an all-island climate biodiversity network has been established.  An all-island women's network has also been established arising from the dialogues.  The NESC report is particularly valuable.</p><p>People know my position on legacy.  I am very clear.  We have to listen to victims.  There cannot be any attempt at changing what both governments have agreed to.  There cannot be unilateralism on this front or any amnesties or anything like that.  I have been very clear.  I have met many victims groups in the past while.  We need to continue to listen to the victims and put them centre stage.</p><p> My view, which applies to what Senator McGreehan said, is that the three sets of relationships that underpin the Good Friday Agreement are the key to this island.  Those are the North-South and British-Irish relationships and the traditions within the North.  They still remain the cornerstone of this island and will remain so far into the future.</p><p> I could not agree more with Deputy Smith on further education.  We have to link further education to the idea of progression pathways, greater student mobility on the island and we have to try to harmonise qualifications frameworks as best we can to facilitate student mobility.  We were up at the postgraduate medicine course on the University of Ulster's Magee campus.  Some students who are studying medicine there cannot get placements in the Republic which is not satisfactory.  We just have to create greater mobility and be flexible.  Our institutions and agencies in the Republic have to be far more flexible in facilitating this mobility of people such as workers and students across the board.  I do not know where I am on time.  I apologise.</p></speech>

There will be funding from the shared island fund for that.  However, enterprise has been ahead more so on the indigenous base than the foreign direct investment, FDI, base.  There is a kind of guarding-of-the-domain approach from the FDI agencies.  I pay tribute to Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland which have worked very well together in terms of trade missions and so on.</p></speech>

He presented to us here in October on an all-island cancer research industry strategy.  Significant progress has been made on that as a result of the contacts that have been made.  The Taoiseach is absolutely right.  Considerable progress is being made on the health front.  There is also Mr. Brian Rowntree who has been a very senior executive in many capacities in the North.  I am working with him to deal with some of the issues that were raised.  Daisy Hill Hospital is one of them.  The Taoiseach pointed out increasing capacity in Border counties such as Louth and in south Down and so on.  We can all serve our public better by better organisation and cross-Border relationships which improve health services for everybody.  There is nothing political in that.  It makes common sense for people there.</p></speech>

I compliment the initiative as well as the staff in the Department of the Taoiseach who are working on it, Ms O&rsquo;Donoghue and Mr. Duffy.  They have led a phenomenal programme of engagement.  I have had the opportunity to participate in some of it and I know it is very strong, constructive and creative.</p> <p>  The work of this committee has been very interesting.  We have engaged in a range of constitutional questions and questions around reconciliation, education and the development of the island.  What stands out most from the Taoiseach's presentation is the political context he set out at the beginning and the end.  The agreement is driven by a desire for reconciliation, mutual trust, understanding and a basis on which the island can move forward together based on those concepts, ideas and ideals.  The value of the shared island dialogue is that it goes through so much of this in practical terms and identifies practical ways of building relationships and simply meeting more people from different communities on the island.  That is very constructive work.</p> <p>  I very much respect the Taoiseach's background and position on this and the language he uses in describing it.  I see it as very constructive and as building a genuine interest in reconciliation with the unionist community, in particular, with which we need to build better relationships all the time.  I very much respect that historically and respect the work the Taoiseach does today.</p> <p>  Irrespective of the practical work of the shared island unit, what can this committee do?  What can the Government do?  What can we do as a people to reach out and do more in terms of reconciliation?  What more can we do in terms of understanding and respecting difference and getting to a genuinely personal appreciation of different perspectives before we can build any different constitutional future?  What is the Taoiseach's more broad political reflection on what we can do?</p></speech>

We find that there is considerable help from and co-operation with both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs which we want to continue.  The committee has visited Belfast, Ballymurphy, community groups, survivors groups and political people as best it could.</p> <p>  We are travelling at the behest of Deputy Smith and Ms Michelle Gildernew, in particular.  We are going to Fermanagh and mid-Ulster in approximately a month's time.  I see the smiles from Sinn F&eacute;in.  We are travelling at the behest of Deputy Tully as well.  I apologise.  I should have mentioned her.  We also hope to go to Derry.  We would be happy to work with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The key message we are getting from the Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs is visit, meet, communicate and listen.  That is what the shared island unit is doing and what we are doing as a committee.  The more we can build on that, the more sense it makes.</p> <p>  Some of us met with the Ancient Order of Hibernians yesterday which visited the Oireachtas.  It was talking about British policy and so on.  My point to the order was that if we can agree a shared future on this island, whatever that may be, and if all communities and political parties can sign up to that, there is no reason it cannot proceed.  I could not see the British Government opposing any consensus that arose on this island for all political groups.  That is why working together and meeting each other is critical and important.  I have had a few meetings with Mr. Brian Rowntree who the Taoiseach knows.  He has considerable experience.  We can be given a wealth of information on our housing issues down here in terms of how the housing emergency has been dealt with and how health issues are being dealt with up there.  There are considerable opportunities for us.</p> <p>  The only problem we have here is engaging with the unionist community in the political sense.  We have Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr. Stephen Farry of Alliance is on the line, we have the SDLP and so on.  We would love to meet unionists who are happy to do so politically without feeling it is any threat to their uniqueness and their remaining British, as guaranteed under the Good Friday Agreement, as it is guaranteed for people to be nationalist or republican or to follow whatever beliefs they want.  What the shared island unit is doing is progressive and it is the way forward.  It is putting money behind what it believes in and it is working.</p></speech>

Reconciliation is key but trust is important.  What we find is that people from civic society are participating in the dialogues and are engaging.  I am conscious there is an election on and so on.</p><p>No one is putting up barriers to the shared island programme.  It is important that people feel free to participate irrespective of what community they come from or what political views they have.  It is important we maintain that.  If someone is interested in education, health or climate change, irrespective of their politics, they should feel free to participate and contribute.  As the Chair said, we all benefit from that participation.<br/><br/>This morning, I had some dialogue on the education front, working with Atlantic Technological University and the Ulster universities.  We told them to come back to us with proposals and we will provide some funding towards them.  They are looking at both the Letterkenny and Sligo campuses for potential developments.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, on Deputy Carroll MacNeill's point, it is about listening, meeting and talking but we have to expand it a bit more than we are doing right now.  We should be encouraging greater engagement with younger and newer Members of the Oireachtas.  We should be creating secure fora with Chatham House rules where people can engage over weekends to discuss these issues without fear or favour.  We are all politicians and people are often very conscious of their base.  That was always the issue historically.  If someone participated with Deputies or Senators from the Republic and that got found out, it was thought that would damage the person back in their own political base.  I will not bore the committee with my own experiences but I always remember what happened in 1992 with Ian Paisley.  The DUP was going to participate in an engagement between 12 Members of this House and 12 unionists.  At the eleventh hour the DUP pulled out and the late Ian Paisley went on RT&Eacute; attacking left, right and centre the notion that we were going to go up into his constituency.  Official unionists and loyalists were then with us so maybe that was the objective.  It was fine and it was no big deal in the end but we learned an enormous amount from it.<br/><br/>I am always conscious that we have to respect where people are coming from.  We have to respect their challenges.  That is the great art of politics.  Equally, others have to respect our challenges and where we are coming from.  We have moved on a lot and many political representatives here have very open engagement with unionism but we have to make sure we create greater opportunities.  The councils are important and we have provided them with seed funding.  It is not Border councils alone but all councils on the island.  We would encourage councils at a greater distance from the Border to think imaginatively about projects they could share with a council in the North on an ongoing basis.  As we have these dialogues, I am conscious that there needs to be a regional focus in the Republic as well.  The Good Friday Agreement is not just about the North at the Border level.  What do young people in Galway, Waterford or Cork feel?<br/><br/>A very good point was put to me when I spoke to the TASC think tank last week.  One woman made the very good point that we all have some view and look at things through a certain political, societal or generational prism, but there are whole new sets of communities emerging on the island that might have a completely different approach to this.  They may not be looking at it through the same lens we have historically looked through.  That is particularly true of the younger generations.  The question is how we engage younger generations on the issue.  That is what the dialogue is endeavouring to do because it requires active engagement.  We have to work hard to work out how we get more active engagement between different groups.  Some of it happens naturally.  Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned enterprise.  Sport happens naturally and there is lots of interaction North and South in that regard.  An article from the <i>Evening Echo</i>was just sent to me by a family member about the time 7,000 Derry fans went down to Flower Lodge, as it was then known, which is now P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Rinn.  It was Derry City's first game in the League of Ireland against Cork City, I think in 1986.</p></speech>

More than 7,000 supporters came down and it was a big occasion.  We forget those moments.  That shows the progress that has been made.

T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte rompu.  On my behalf and that of the Sinn F&eacute;in MPs, I would like to welcome them to the committee.  The Good Friday Agreement and this committee are unique for two reasons.  They are very practical but they are also visionary.  They provide an opportunity for all the representatives of the people of this island to meet together and deal with issues of common concern, issues that will help improve the quality of people's lives wherever they live in Ireland.  They provide a visionary platform for us to look forward and imagine how to move peacefully from where we are now to a new and reunited Ireland.  Unfortunately, the unionist MPs do not engage with this committee, although they are very welcome to and we would love to see them.  The Taoiseach is right that civic unionism is engaging on these issues.  It would engage in a citizens' assembly and would look forward to that opportunity.</p> <p>  I commend the Taoiseach for the shared island unit initiative, which is also making an immediate, valuable and very positive contribution across a wide spectrum of all-Ireland issues that affect people's lives.  The unit's all-Ireland framework complements the Good Friday Agreement in so many ways.  It has identified key issues and my colleagues will raise questions with the Taoiseach about those issues.  I would like to raise a few additional areas of concern, which I think the unit has the capacity, as it evolves, to explore and provide leadership on.  I mentioned a citizens' assembly.  I would also raise the setting of a date to hold a constitutional referendum on this country's independence.  We would also like to look at representation in the D&aacute;il for MPs.  We have seen how practical and helpful that is.  On a constituency level, I was delighted to hear the Taoiseach talking about an ambitious and practical agenda.  I would like to think Tyrone, Fermanagh and the rest of Armagh would be included in that rail network.  Obviously, the A5 is a big issue for those of us who live in that community and for any of our Donegal comrades coming through Aughnacloy.  The road is certainly not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  An Taoiseach talked about accessible services regionally for cross-Border health and ensuring our constituents across the Border community have better access to health services.  As somebody who represents the area the Enniskillen hospital is in, I would love to talk to An Taoiseach about that.  I will write to ask for a meeting as I would love to discuss that matter further.  That is the future for sustainability in rural communities.  There has been a move towards centralisation and we need to ensure people have access to services.  There is a lot in there.  When discussing health, I would like to think we are also talking about mental health and accessibility for mental health services.</p> <p>  I have worked with Fergal Mythen but I did not know that news about him.  I have worked with him for 25 years or more and I would like to take this opportunity to wish him well.   He has been a huge help to us in the past and over the decades.  I wish him well in the future and in his new role.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo go l&eacute;ir.</p></speech>

T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte rompu.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m le hobair dhearfach an aonaid um oile&aacute;n comhroinnte agus gu&iacute;m gach rath air ag dul ar aghaidh.  Leag an Taoiseach amach go hiontach cuimsitheach an r&eacute;imse oibre at&aacute; ar bun ag an aonad sin ar fud an oile&aacute;in agus is rud maith &eacute; sin.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach knows one of the key components in positively sharing this island is our ability to move freely throughout the entirety of the island.  He referenced heavily in his contribution the experience of young people.  It is the exclusive and positive experience of an entire generation of young people as it should be; they can move freely across all the country without being hindered or obstructed.  The Taoiseach knows with the recent passage of the United Kingdom's Nationality and Borders Bill 2022 through Westminster there could be a very direct impact on our shared society and on many people within it being able to move freely from the South into the North.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach outlined the core and component parts of the work of the shared island unit around community development and reconciliation, education, healthcare and greenways.  Looking at all those from above, we can see many people within education and the healthcare sector are outside Ireland or Britain and are not Irish or British citizens.  They will be directly affected in their daily life.  The shared island unit and what it is trying to achieve will also be affected.  I will not lean too heavily into this but as a member of this committee looking at the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the passage of that legislation by Westminster demonstrates a further disregard for the Good Friday Agreement by the British Government.  That is because it has sought to put in place a law that directly affects so many people here and has an impact on the Good Friday Agreement; it runs contrary to it, in fact.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach touched briefly on the matter of legacy and I agree that victims must be central.  We must also get back to and see implemented what was in the Stormont House Agreement, which is what we all signed up to.</p> <p>  Where does the Taoiseach see Article 2 of the Constitution featuring in the work of the shared island unit?  The Taoiseach is absolutely correct about reconciliation and I endorse that work absolutely.  Article 2 states it is a birthright and entitlement of everyone born on the island to be part of the Irish nation.  It is an obligation on all of us in government and the Parliament.  The Taoiseach mentioned the experience of the Derry fans going down to Cork.  When important sporting events organised on an all-Ireland basis cannot be watched by audiences in the North, that is not being part of the Irish nation but rather being excluded from it.  Where does the Taoiseach see Article 2 in particular resting?</p> <p>  Does the Taoiseach share the concerns of this committee about the Nationality and Borders Bill 2022?  Has he raised it with the British Prime Minister and, if not, would he be minded to raise concerns with him given its potential impact?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.857" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022042800002#G00300"><p>To respond to Ms Gildernew, there are different forms of participatory democracy, if we can call it that.  To refer to my earlier remarks, citizens' assemblies tend to be a set group of people meeting on a specific topic with specific terms of reference.  As we discussed earlier, for me the building of reconciliation and trust between North and South and different traditions is an entirely different sphere of activity that must be ongoing, sustained and not timebound.  In many respects the shared island programme has a civic dialogue dimension to it.</p> <p>  More than 1,300 people have now participated in that from different backgrounds and not just those selected randomly from a group, as would be the case with a citizens' assembly.  That has value but these 1,300 people are from all sorts of backgrounds.  Some have an interest in climate, some are interested in sport and some are interested in tourism.  They have come together in different sectoral formats to discuss areas of concern to them and how matters can be advanced.  As I said, one of those led to an all-island women's forum and an all-island climate and biodiversity forum and network being established.  There are significant people in research in University College Cork who are working with Northern counterparts to come back to us with biodiversity projects.</p> <p>  This is not something a citizens' assembly on its own would be able to achieve.  We want to get people working together proactively on the island, irrespective of background.  We want them to bring their expertise to the table and achieve progress and greater connectivity.  The Narrow Water Bridge, for example, is about connectivity and tourism.  The Ulster Canal is about tourism, recreation, jobs and connectivity as well.</p> <p>  The shared island unit is not getting involved on the constitutional side in terms of setting dates or anything like that.  There is a broader Good Friday Agreement framework to governance and there are political parties with different perspectives on that.  We have made the point.  That gives us capacity to open it to all communities, and the challenge is to build trust so people can participate in a shared island without the sense it is a Trojan horse for something else.  That is a concern of unionism, to be frank.  So far no barriers have been put up to it.</p> <p>  It is interesting and heartening to see the enthusiasm in the third level sector and 62 projects have now been sanctioned.  There was mention of mental health and one of those projects relates to the championing of mental health in Northern Ireland.  The woman's name escapes me but it is a fascinating project.  I met those involved, and they are teaming up with computational experts and people in computer science to develop apps for young people for early interventions on mental health.  These are the kinds of activities we are promoting and it is where we want to keep the focus.  There is also work on liquid biopsies to detect cancers and monitor tumours.  It involves a consortium of third level institutions, including Queen's University and universities in the Republic of Ireland.  That could be revolutionary in the diagnosis of various cancers and types of emerging tumours.</p> <p>  If we layer constitutional issues over this and set dates, we would kill this work.  People will retreat to their trenches and there would be all sorts of issues.  We do not need to go there.  That is my view, although without prejudice to my opinions on how I would like to see the situation evolving and so on.  That is the rationale behind where we are going.</p> <p>  I do not know if a submission was made by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile as the north west made the highest number of submissions on the rail network issue.</p></speech>

We were up there recently and that emerged in the work.  The Senator is right in saying it is no wonder because there are major issues with connectivity there.  Funding is there for the A5.  Everyone I speak to seems to say there are planning processes and public inquiries.  We are ready to go and the money is there to progress the A5.  We are very interested in hearing what we can do with Enniskillen hospital and how we could be of assistance.</p> <p>  Mobility is very important and we must do some work in the Republic of Ireland around migrants, for example.  I met representatives from the North West Migrants Forum briefly at the John and Pat Hume Foundation event.  We are doing further examination of that and people should not have any fear that if they come into the Republic of Ireland from the North, there would somehow be a challenge to them because of status or whatever.</p> <p>  The Nationality and Borders Bill 2022 is completely different and it involves people from all states.  It has not been finalised and the debate is continuing within Westminster.  It has not yet been passed.  We are engaging with the British Government to try to change this with a view to ensuring it does not interfere with mobility on the island.</p><p>It could be very damaging to Northern Ireland, to tourism there and to a whole range of issues that have clearly not been foreseen, such as educationalists coming in.  Aspects of life could be hindered.</p></speech>

From our perspective, it is hard to comprehend how this could get to the table.  It runs contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is clearly an issue in respect of which we are very much on the case.  I also agree the Stormont House Agreement is the template for dealing with legacy issues.  All of us have a role to play.  The Government stands ready.  We have also made it very clear to unionist politicians if they have cases or issues they want to raise with us, and they think the Irish Government needs to do more regarding its archives, by which I mean its documentation or whatever, we are willing to respond.  That has not been firmed up on in terms of people actually coming to us.  There is a meeting coming up that we are organising with one particular victims' group.  I have met victims' groups from the North of Ireland.  Some cases have been raised publicly but we said to come and meet us and to bring the documentation or presentation.  We did it with the Smithwick inquiry.  The Government did not hold back.  We fulfilled our obligations in respect of that inquiry.</p> <p>  We see the shared island unit as a practical way of dealing with Article 2.  We are all living on the one island.  We need practically to share that island.  We can make improvements to broadcasting and so on.  We work with the agencies and all the various bodies to fulfil that.  I said earlier that some of our agencies have to look differently at issues.  Sometimes they look inward but they need to look at the island context in terms of all the citizens on the island to make sure services are available.  We see the shared island unit as a very pragmatic working out of that constitutional provision.</p></speech>

The clerk has just informed me, and I should have been aware of this, that we have to be out of here by 4.30 p.m.  It is not because of the Taoiseach but another booking of the room.  Ms Claire Hanna is next, followed by Mr. Stephen Farry.  We then have a speaker from Sinn F&eacute;in and Senator Black, who are online.  Ms &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley is also online and I understand Senator Emer Currie has joined us.  Ms Hanna is very welcome.  I will tell her when the time is up.</p></speech>

I also thank the Taoiseach for his attendance, participation and the overview of the shared island unit.  Everybody agrees it is a really positive development in many ways for the evolving constitutional conversation and for people's basic and immediate needs and well-being, which can sometimes get a bit lost in the conversation when we are focusing exactly on the when and how of change rather than the why.  We want to organise on an all-island basis and focus on what we can actually do with those powers.  The way the unit is approaching those practical and infrastructural challenges, and joining up services, will do a lot more to move hearts and minds as well as doing a lot of that engagement.  Even with the challenge of the Covid pandemic, that has been very impressive to watch.  The focus on newer communities and younger generations is really welcome, as is bringing people into the conversation.  An NGO I used to work with was working on trying to find a solution to malaria and used to say imagine if the answer is trapped in the mind of a nurse down the country somewhere.  It is about pulling out all the ideas from across the island, including from people who are not necessarily engaged in political parties and some of the other networks and structures.</p> <p>  I do not want to go over what colleagues have already spoken about.  I know transport, infrastructure and future-proofing, as in getting us ready for a transition to a low-carbon economy and life, has been discussed.  I will touch briefly on skills and their regenerative potential.  John Hume said many times that the best peace process is a job.  Areas around the Border in particular may need more regeneration and some investment and opportunity to take advantage of some of the new jobs and new industries that will be available in the economy of the future.  Skills and higher and further education will be a very important part of that.  I have maybe been spending too much time with my colleague from Foyle, but I know Colum Eastwood has always talked a lot about the north west and the university.  I am aware of the all-island task force on higher education and the Royal Irish Academy document on all-island higher education.  Are there any plans around that issue?</p> <p>  I also have a more technical question.  Yesterday, the Northern Ireland affairs committee met with the UK Government's Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.  We discussed some of the new funds, such as the shared prosperity fund and some of the other funds that will replace much of the transformative European money.  What level of engagement are the officials able to have with some of those funds that may be purporting to try to achieve some of the things the shared island unit is doing?  It would be good if we could make all these investments more than the sum of their parts and make sure that, at a planning level, we are able to tie up and bring together all the opportunities.</p></speech>

She is probably in transit.  The commitment is to infrastructure and to how we can advance services.  Her point about Covid is very well made.  I did not say so earlier, but there is huge potential for public health collaboration on outcomes in health and public health, such as Covid, infectious diseases and a whole range of other areas in the public health domain.  I was struck yesterday by a report that flashed up online, which stated the Republic of Ireland had the highest level of life expectancy in the European Union.  I did a double take because it always bugged me that we did not have the same level of life expectancy as other countries.  We were sixteenth in 2000.  A message is there somewhere in how we went from sixteenth to number one.  I remember, when I was Minister for Health, we used to do an all-island mortality study so there are lessons all round.</p> <p>  On the skills front, we are committed to a cross-Border apprenticeship programme.  Over the next while, we want to put flesh on the bones of that initiative.  Apprenticeships are very important.  They are enjoying somewhat of a renaissance in the Republic after experiencing a lull for quite some time, especially in construction trades and so on.  To go back to Deputy Smith's point about further education, apprenticeships can have a role in that.</p> <p>  On the north west, we have met with Ulster University.  Colum Eastwood was at that meeting in respect of all-island third level development and collaboration between Ulster University and the Atlantic Technological University.  We have said we are willing to respond too, but the university has to develop the initiative.  All colleges have to develop such initiatives in collaboration and then come back to us to say what they think will work.  We will then be in a position to support and fund that.  We will be funding an initiative emanating from Ulster University on that front.</p> <p>  We are engaging with the UK Government on the levelling up fund.  We want it to be involved in this because the east-west dimension is important and speaks to the broader range of traditions and perspectives.</p><p>We are working with the British Government to see can we get matching funding and other funding in respect of some of the initiatives we are undertaking under the shared island fund.  We think there is potential there also.  To be fair, the UK Government put significant funding behind the PEACE PLUS programme with the EU, ourselves and the Executive, which has given a healthy fund also, so we think there is real potential on that east-west levelling up front.</p></speech>

I welcome the Taoiseach and thank him for joining us.  Like Ms Hanna I am taking a short break from the election campaign in Northern Ireland.  I stress at the outset I very much value the work of the shared island unit.  Notwithstanding wider political and constitutional discussions people wish to have and engage with, on a practical level there remain significant opportunities and stark deficits with the practical, socioeconomic and environmental co-operation on the island.  Regardless of whatever else happens there is an ongoing piece of work there to fully capitalise in that regard.  I highlight the environmental skills piece in particular and ask for a comment on the potential for the island rail network, especially the Belfast-Dublin corridor, but beyond that as well.</p> <p>  I also ask the Taoiseach to comment on a couple of wider issues.  The first one expands from the shared island unit's day-to-day work and ties in with Brexit and the protocol.  Much of the focus has been on issues around the Irish Sea interface and the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland but I am also conscious Brexit imposes a border on the island with the delivery of services and also freedom of movement.  I would be interested in the Taoiseach's thoughts on what could be done bilaterally by the jurisdictions to try to compensate for the, shall we say, very low level of engagement in the Trade and Co-operation Agreement, given both are key elements of our mutual economies.  Indeed, we have talked previously of an all-island economy in services that has been somewhat disrupted.  There are issues around mutual recognition of qualifications that are critical in that regard.</p> <p>  On the wider Brexit piece, there is increasing speculation and fear the UK Government may be on the brink of doing something reckless on a unilateral basis on the protocol.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can comment on how the Government is going to respond, if that proves to be the case in the next few weeks, to try to ensure the focus is on mutually-agreed outcomes rather than unilateral action.  As a final point, returning to the election campaign in Northern Ireland, we are very conscious that while we hope there will be a swift return of the government in Northern Ireland we recognise there may be delays.  To what extent can the UK and Irish Governments work once again in partnership as they did on New Decade, New Approach, if their good offices are required to try to bring the parties together after the election?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.874" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022042800002#J00500"><p>I thank Dr. Farry.  I agree there are significant opportunities through the shared island initiative for co-operation and getting projects off the ground.  The all-island rail feasibility study is a particularly important one.  It is comprehensive by nature but we would be anxious to get going on the more practical initial jobs that could be done fairly quickly after publication.  The Belfast-Dublin corridor is one that would make itself readily available to allocation, upgrading, increasing speeds and so on to make it more efficient.  We got very significant representations in the north west.  I see Senator Blaney's face as I mention Belfast-Dublin.  Coming from Cork I understand where he is coming from - it is kind of instinctive.  However, we must look at that which is readily doable.  That is one area.</p> <p>  Dr. Farry made a good point about the service economy.  At the moment we are working on mutual recognition and making progress on it.  It is very important we do so.  There is perhaps a longer-term issue around potential divergence of regulatory standards, especially in the services area with procurement, tendering and all that.  We need to keep a weather eye on that to see how we can ensure we harmonise services on the island so companies are not disadvantaged in bidding for public service projects and so forth and that there are not changes in standards around food or environmental issues.  On balance, the UK has, to be fair, a strong record on the climate change agenda.  Successive UK Governments have been very positive on that front and long may it continue.</p> <p>  I am conscious there is an election on and that statements or words from me could impact or create a stir that may not be necessary between now and election day, but we will engage on a number of these issues.  I am conscious too that over the lifetime of Brexit various things have been floated.  Some sink and some are refloated.  I do not react immediately when I begin to see articulation of certain ideas from time to time.  Overall, unilateralism does not work in the context of the Good Friday Agreement.  Having been involved in the Government that signed the agreement and the early days of education partnerships and so on, behind all the peace process throughout the late 1980s and 1990s were the two governments working together, hand in glove, no surprises, heads up, good clarity on the communications between them, working together as the anchor of the agreement.  That remains the case today.  Both governments are there as co-guarantors to even-handedly, fairly and objectively support the process.</p> <p>  We will play our part in the aftermath of the election, though there is a responsibility on the part of all parties going before the people to respond to the people's mandate.  The people are not electing members of parties to not take their seats in the Assembly or to not form an Executive.  The people want the parties they vote for to take their seats and form an Executive.  I am very passionate about the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement because one of the challenges over the lifetime of it has been the degree to which the institutions were not up and running.  They were pulled down for various reasons, and so on, and we did not have and Executive or an Assembly.  That damaged the standing of the Assembly and Executive in the minds of the public and probably damaged politics as well, if one contrasts it with public esteem for the Scottish Parliament over time.  There is therefore an urgency that those who are elected fulfil their mandates to have the Assembly and form an Executive, irrespective of what way the votes fall.  That is the democratic way and what I am passionate about.</p> <p>  Those are my general comments on some of the issues Dr. Farry raised.</p></speech>

I am convinced of that.  We have been helpful in that regard.  People have raised legitimate questions about the protocol.  I do not dispute that at all.  We have actually sensitised the EU to work on those issues and it has done, as Dr. Farry knows, and it has engaged with the UK Government.  After the election we hope we can pick up the baton again and get going on that and bring this to a resolution.</p></speech>

This is one of the most positive engagements I have had since I entered the D&aacute;il in the sense of the possibilities and opportunities that have opened up and been presented to us.  It is very clear that we are all on the same page in respect of where we need to go and what we need to do.  I acknowledge all of the research reports that have been done, including the NESC report, that the Taoiseach mentioned.  There are very good recommendations, evidence and solid work in there.  I tuned into of the launch of the one on education this morning in which there was very good stuff.  These will only be as valuable as their implementation but I hear what the Taoiseach is saying in terms of the resources being put into them.  I accept his sincerity in trying to bring this forward.  He quoted Mr. Donogh O'Malley who stated: "We will be judged by future generations on what we did for the ... [education of our children]".  It hit home for me.  Too often party politics is played with.  We just need to get over it.</p> <p>  I hear what the Taoiseach is saying about people stretching themselves.  It is only out of our comfort zones that we will really achieve the success we need to achieve and to achieve what Mr. Donogh O'Malley achieved through education.  That is being borne out now in terms of where we are at.  That is not to say we have achieved everything but in terms of the knock-on impact on wages and productivity, especially with inflation and all the other challenges that we have, the work being done forms a very solid foundation for all of that.  </p> <p>  It will be no surprise to the Taoiseach or to Senator Blaney that the Belfast-Dublin corridor is obviously important but the Atlantic innovation corridor is very important.  We know the figures and evidence of the regional gaps that need to be addressed.  The western rail corridor and the Atlantic Technological University fit into all of that.  We almost have a perfect storm in the opportunities we have.  Maybe I should not call it a storm.  However, if the technological university, the Atlantic innovation corridor and all the other initiatives are resourced properly - they have to be more than names - we can achieve an awful lot collectively on this island.  I am certainly excited about that.</p> <p>  I will ask the Taoiseach about student mobility on the island.  He may know I am a rapporteur for a report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The work this morning was very useful and we will use parts of that report.  We can achieve a lot that way.  We only had 1,624 students from the North attend higher education institutions in the South and only 2,085 students from the South attend higher education institutions in the North.  That is 1% and 3.5%, respectively.  Good things are being done by individual institutions but, as the Taoiseach said, we need to get beyond that to something more systematic.  Is he committed to increasing those numbers?  Does he see a role for the shared island unit in this regard, maybe in leading the way on bursaries or scholarships?  I acknowledge some are being provided for post-doctoral and doctoral students engaged in cancer research, which I welcome.  However, we could lead the way at undergraduate level if some funding from the shared island unit 2 was put into that, if we there is room to manoeuvre.</p> <p>  I have to ask the Taoiseach about engaging with the diaspora and the issue of giving the vote to the diaspora, and to the people in the North in the presidential election.  Where is that at?  I apologise to Deputy Tully.  I have taken up considerable time.  I am fairly enthusiastic about this.</p></speech>

The first is the reopening of the Ulster Canal and phase 3, in particular, which is the restoration from Clonfad to Castle Saunderson.  Waterways Ireland has put a rough estimate of &euro;90 million to &euro;100 million on this restoration.  Some &euro;1 million has been given to Waterways Ireland so far to carry out preparatory work, which will done by the end of next year.  Would it be prudent to commit the funding needed for phase 3 now in order that Waterways Ireland can start preparations to continue this work and take the project forward?  As the Taoiseach said, the potential to vastly enhance the lives of people and communities along the Border through the Ulster Canal is very important.</p> <p>  The second project is the A5 upgrade.  It has  been mentioned by my colleagues but I will mention, in particular, the section of road on the N2 from the Border to Clontibret, which was part of the NDP but suddenly does not seem to be a priority.

I ask that the section be prioritised as part of that project.</p> <p>  I welcome the all-island strategic rail review.  It is very important.  We know how adversely affected the region has been by the Border.  Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal have no rail infrastructure at all.  County Derry's rail infrastructure only goes eastwards to Belfast.  It is badly needed.  Six years ago we had a rail infrastructure there which, unfortunately, was not maintained.  The line was not kept free or open.  Investment in both road and rail infrastructure in that area would greatly enhance and attract investment.</p></speech>

One of my questions is on a very practical issue that we come across daily, which is the provision of passports.  Some people are coming into the office who have been waiting six months, which is simply not acceptable.  This is a considerable issue.  It may need a separate meeting with the Passport Office or the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p> <p>  Part of the all-island initiative relates to greenways.  We have had one from Newry to Carlingford and I ask for that to be enhanced.

The north east is no different as Mr. Brady knows.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for her positive comments.  As she said, education is key to jobs, quality of life, future engagement and that whole idea of the Atlantic innovation corridor.  We are funding interesting research through the shared island unit, which was submitted by the Atlantic Technological University in Galway, on how peripheral or regional areas and be developed socially and economically.  We can give the Deputy the contact details for the researchers in terms of what they are proposing to identify and what the ingredients are from a human capital perspective in the Border region to enable economic development.  That was one of the projects that came through the application process and was awarded funding through an independent peer review.  We do not get involved in deciding on the merits of research projects.  They are independently reviewed but that struck me when the Deputy mentioned it.</p> <p>  We have commissioned the Higher Education Authority to conduct research this year to examine patterns and barriers to student mobility on the island and between Ireland and the UK more broadly.  The Deputy's figures were more or less correct but what is interesting is that when we were with Queens University staff recently, they made a point to us that there had been a considerable jump in the number of applications from the Republic to the university.</p><p>That could be related to the Scottish fee aspect as well, we do not know.  It could be a factor stemming from Brexit, because it will impact on this context as well.  Potential problems were also indicated regarding student caps in the North.  I do not understand that.  Neither the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, nor the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, are here, but we do not have caps in the Republic.  We do have caps on some of the professions.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is engaging in this regard.  We need more people in areas such as therapies and medicine, for example, as well as others.  We can ask the authorities in the North if we can get additional places for students from the Republic.  That would help them and us in respect of extra placements.  It is what we need to do in the short term.  There is also a requirement for the study I mentioned that is examining this context.  </p><p> I might have said this already, but I was struck by the postgraduate medicine programme on the Magee Campus of Ulster University.  The students there apparently cannot get clinical placements in the Republic.  We work to remove barriers such as these.  Students on that programme will get placements in the North, potentially.  There is no reason they should not, but clinical placements should be an all-island undertaking because there are different levels of hospitals, including tertiary, and specialisations, from paediatric to cancer to heart.  All students, North and South, would benefit if there was a full range of access, especially in an area like medicine, to proper clinical placements and a wide range of them.  </p><p> Moving from student mobility to the diaspora, this aspect is progressing.  My understanding is that the legislation for that referendum is advancing, but I can get a note on it.  I did not check it before I came in.  Regarding the Ulster Canal, Deputy Tully has obviously been talking to representatives of Waterways Ireland, or perhaps not.  The chief executive has an ambition for the higher things in life, as in a desire for &euro;100 million straight up.  I am jesting with the Deputy because I had an engagement in the context of the North-South bodies, and the chief executive, whose name I cannot remember, came in with all guns blazing.  We will give him &euro;14 million and that is not a bad start and no harm for engaging.  We have given &euro;12 million for phase 1 and &euro;1 million for phase 2, and we are engaging with Waterways Ireland regarding phase 3.  The &euro;1 million for phase 2 is to allow preparatory work to be done and the representatives of Waterways Ireland are to come back to us in that respect.  There is funding of &euro;1 billion overall and we are trying to spread it out and get different areas covered.  Those projects that make progress will gain more as well.  To be fair to Waterways Ireland, it has a good record.  The Ulster Canal is a fantastic amenity and has great tourism potential as well.  We will be working with the organisation in this regard.  </p><p> On the A5 project, the funding is there from our perspective.  We will fund it more generally as well.  Is the road from the Border to Clontibret a part of that?  </p></speech>

We can talk to the Department of Transport about this.</p> <p>  The rail review, then, covers all areas.  I note that Deputy Conway-Walsh got in the subject of the western rail corridor.  Along with all her colleagues from the west, she has made the importance of this project clear to us as well and it is covered by the rail review.  The main issue with all of this will be delivery.  There must be realism at some stage.  I will not repeat what I said earlier, but there is one corridor that could readily be done quickly, potentially.  The Minister tells me that many rail projects, because of all the sorts of inquiries and planning processes needed, take much longer than non-public transport.  That is the only inhibitor.  </p> <p>  Turning to passports, the six months referred to seems a bit long.  It is down to 30 weeks now from 35 weeks.  The problem is applications have mushroomed.  The numbers have gone through the roof.  The Passport Office will process approximately 1.7 million passports this year.  I think I heard the Minister refer to 1 million-----</p></speech>

From the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we are joined by Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong, senior adviser at the climate action policy unit; Ms Margaret Power, assistant principal; and Mr. Derek Rafferty, principal officer, governance and rental standards.  From the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, we are joined by Mr. Robert Deegan, principal officer, residential energy efficiency division; and Mr. Tony Collins, principal officer, heat and business energy efficiency division.  From Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, we are joined by Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Byrne, director of national retrofit; programme managers Ms Dara Stewart and Ms Orla Coyle; and Mr. Chris Hughes, energy performance of buildings directive-building energy rating development.</p> <p>  Members have been provided with the opening statements and briefings.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  Those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action they say at the meeting.  There are some limitations on parliamentary privilege for witnesses who are attending remotely from outside Leinster House and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Armstrong to make his opening statement on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Derek Rafferty, head of the governance and rental standards unit, and Ms Margaret Power, assistant principal at the climate action policy unit.</p> <p>  Housing for All sets out a target of an average of 33,000 new dwellings per annum.  The State plans to invest &euro;20 billion in the next five years, which is the largest investment in the history of the State.  Over its lifetime, Housing for All seeks to eradicate homelessness and promote social inclusion.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is implementing a range of ambitious decarbonisation actions for housing, planning, marine and natural heritage protection and analysis of Ireland's climate.  In 2021, we worked with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and a range of other Departments and agencies to publish the climate action plan.</p> <p>  Housing for All takes account of our climate action targets though the following policies: the implementation of nearly zero energy buildings through our building regulations, which will ensure that while we achieve more energy-efficient buildings, we also build healthy, sustainable and durable buildings suitable for the Irish climate, both today and into the future; and the Department's retrofitting programme for local authority housing, which is an essential measure to target climate justice.  The Department plans to retrofit approximately 40% or 36,500 local authority dwellings not currently performing to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 to get them to B2 or cost optimal level by 2030 at an estimated cost of &euro;1.2 billion.</p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has lead responsibility for the EPBD in Ireland.  However, overall policy responsibility is shared between that Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, also has a lead role in the implementation of the EPBD and supporting the development of regulations.</p><p>Since the first enactment of the EPBD in 2002, Ireland has implemented the building energy rating system for new buildings and existing buildings which are rented or sold since 2007.  We introduced requirements for nearly zero energy buildings for buildings other than dwellings in 2017 and dwellings in 2019.  We have set the building regulations performance requirement for major renovations where more than 25% of the surface area of the building is renovated to a BER of B2 or the cost optimal level.  In 2021 we set a requirement that electric vehicle charging infrastructure be installed in new buildings or buildings undergoing major renovation which have more than ten parking spaces and in certain existing non-residential buildings from 2025.</p><p> Ireland is viewed internationally as an exemplar in the implementation of the EPBD with all new dwellings now requiring an A rating.  Recent Central Statistics Office analysis shows that heat pumps are installed as the main heating system in 80% of new dwellings and oil boilers are being effectively phased out in new dwellings.  The building energy rating system is also viewed as an international exemplar, with a centralised database and a robust quality assurance and auditing system.  A total of 58% of all dwellings have received a building energy rating.</p><p> Ireland supports in principle the proposals for the 2022 review of the EPBD.  These align with the Climate Action Plan 2021 and Housing for All.  We are supportive of the proposals for zero emissions buildings, minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings, declarations of the global warming potential of new buildings and further requirements for electric vehicle recharging Infrastructure.  Some of these proposals will require further assessment as they may impact on costs and the supply of housing to the market.  The requirement for minimum energy performance standards for existing dwellings is in line with the Housing for All commitments to introduce, where feasible, minimum building energy ratings for rented properties from 2025.  The Department proposes that the impact of minimum energy performance standards should also consider traditional buildings, which may have specific technical challenges.</p><p> The Department supports the requirement for declarations of global warming potential and proposes that it should be aligned with the timeline for the review of the construction products regulation.  The certification of construction products, in accordance with the construction products regulation when reviewed, will ensure that environmental certification is in place throughout the EU Single Market to support global warming potential declarations for new buildings and drive the decarbonisation of construction supply chains.  Further proposals on the provision of electric vehicle recharging infrastructure and bicycle parking are also welcome inclusions.</p><p> In addition to the points I have outlined, there are proposals on the harmonisation of energy performance certificates, or building energy ratings as they are known in Ireland, carbon removals associated with carbon storage and the calculation of cost optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements.  We are happy to discuss all of these in more detail with the committee today. </p><p> We are working very hard to meet housing demand through new builds and the private rental sector.  We have ambitious targets in terms of the quantity, type and location of homes to be delivered and we are also ambitious for climate action, including energy efficient housing.  Through robust implementation of the EPBD and our building regulations we are ensuring the homes we are building for future generations continue to achieve the high standards we are setting for decarbonising our built environment.  We are happy to address any question the committee may have.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Tony Collins, principal officer in the heat and business energy efficiency division.</p> <p>  An important aspect of the EPBD proposal is the development of a national building renovation plan to ensure the renovation of the national stock of residential and non-residential buildings.  This builds on the requirement of the existing directive on the preparation of a long-term renovation strategy.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications published Ireland's current long-term renovation strategy in 2020.  This plan sets out our long-term strategy for the renovation of buildings to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s building stock is highly energy efficient and decarbonised by 2050.</p> <p>  The Department has since published the national retrofit plan as part of the Climate Action Plan 2021.  The retrofit plan sets out a detailed roadmap to achieving our targets of retrofitting the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 and installing 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes by 2030.  This will see approximately 30% of the housing stock being upgraded to warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills, lower emissions and enhanced asset values.</p> <p>  The plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key areas.  These are driving demand and activity, financing and affordability, supply chain, skills and standards, and structures and governance.  For each of these areas, barriers were identified and time-bound policies, measures and actions were put in place to address them.  Successful implementation of the plan depends on ensuring that effective policy action is taken, and balanced progress is made, under each pillar simultaneously.</p> <p>  Important proposals in the 2022 review of the EPBD, such as the requirement to support renovation through appropriate financial measures, prioritising people affected by energy poverty, providing technical assistance through one-stop-shops, designing financing schemes and addressing the split incentive, are all in line with commitments in the retrofit plan.  Good progress has already been made on the implementation of initiatives in this regard.  In February, a range of new and reformed SEAI grant schemes were launched to support homeowners to decarbonise their homes, making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades.</p> <p>  Budget allocations for schemes targeted at those in energy poverty have been significantly increased this year and enhanced supports for approved housing bodies and the private rental sector are also available.  The new measures include a new national home energy upgrade scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a BER standard of B2.  There is also the establishment of a network of registered one-stop shops to offer a start-to-finish project management service for home energy upgrades including access to financing.</p> <p>  There is a significant increase in the number of free energy upgrades provided to those at risk of energy poverty alongside changes to the operation of the warmer homes scheme.  This includes ensuring the scheme prioritises those in the worst performing homes first and opening the scheme for homeowner revisits, thereby allowing them to apply for deeper energy upgrade measures now available under the scheme.  A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation has also been introduced for all households.  This will help to reduce energy use urgently as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to exceptionally high energy prices.</p> <p>  These new initiatives will be funded by the national development plan financial allocation for residential retrofit of &euro;8 billion to 2030.  By providing clarity on the annual allocations for the coming years as well as the total allocation to the end of the decade, the plan gives the retrofit sector the confidence to invest, plan for the long-term and expand.  New and expanded upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship supports will also help to ensure we have the skilled workforce available to deliver on our targets.</p> <p>  A total of &euro;267 million has been allocated for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and the solar PV scheme in 2022.  This is the highest ever allocation for the schemes.  The investment this year will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including more than 8,600 homes to a BER of B2.  This is a near doubling of the number of homes delivered to B2 standard in 2021.  In addition, as Mr. Armstrong mentioned, &euro;85 million in funding has been provided by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the local authority energy efficiency retrofit programme.  This means that of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million, 58%, or &euro;203 million, will be spent on dedicated energy poverty schemes and local authority retrofits.</p> <p>  The retrofit plan recognises that even with the enhanced grant rates available, many will need to access finance to fund their upgrade.  For this reason, the Department is working with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Finance, the SEAI, the European Investment Bank and financial institutions to design a new low-cost loan scheme for retrofit.  This scheme will be introduced later this year and will help to address further the affordability issues related to retrofit.  This again is in line with the directive proposals.  We are working closely with colleagues in the SEAI, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other relevant Departments to further build momentum and ensure the building stock is decarbonised in line with our 2050 net zero commitments.  We are happy to address any question the committee may have.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Ms Dara Stewart, programme manager for the energy performance of buildings directive and building energy regulations operations, Ms Orla Coyle, programme manager for project support, and Mr. Chris Hughes, energy performance of buildings directive and building energy regulations development.</p><p> The SEAI is Ireland's national sustainable energy authority.  We work with householders, businesses, communities and Government to create a cleaner energy future.  The SEAI is funded by the Government through its parent Department, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and the Department of Transport.  In 2022, our budget allocation is more than &euro;440 million.  The SEAI provides expert advice to drive positive change through our analysis, modelling and support for policymaking.  We enable direct action through our design and delivery of grant and incentive programmes, and through our capacity-building processes with citizens, communities and private and public sector organisations.  In pursuit of our mandate, we collaborate closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including Departments and State agencies.</p><p> The energy performance of buildings directive, EPBD, was first published in 2002 and it is the main legislative instrument to promote building energy performance.  The EPBD, which has gone through several iterations over the years, sets out requirements for a building energy calculation methodology, including minimum standards for new buildings and works to existing buildings, which are Part L of the building regulations; energy performance certificates, which are the building energy ratings, BERs; nearly zero energy buildings; and a registration and accreditation system for assessors.  Together, these requirements have resulted in a positive change of trends in the energy performance of buildings, including a 70% improvement in the energy performance of new domestic buildings and a 60% improvement in the energy performance of new non-domestic buildings compared with 2005.</p><p> The concerted action EPBD is a joint initiative between EU member states and the European Commission to enhance the sharing of information and experiences from the national adoption and implementation of this important European legislation.  It is organised around meetings between national teams and regularly brings together more than 120 participants from 29 countries.  The SEAI is a member of the concerted action management team and is the central team manager responsible for work on nearly zero energy buildings.  Ireland is a leader among its European peers in terms of its implementation of the EPBD, with the early introduction of the electronic building energy rating, BER, register and advertising guidelines replicated in other member states.  The SEAI is also represented on the energy in buildings and communities programme of the International Energy Agency, IEA, which includes sitting on the building energy codes working group and the Horizon 2020 clean energy transition strategic energy technologies, SET, plan for energy-efficient buildings.</p><p> The SEAI administers the BER system in accordance with the European Union energy performance of buildings regulations 2012.  The SEAI&rsquo;s statutory functions include registering assessors to carry out assessments; issuing directions on how assessments are to be carried out by assessors and how certificates are to be issued; specifying the procedures, methodologies and software to be followed by assessors when carrying out assessments; and maintaining the national and assessors registers.  As the issuing authority, the SEAI has delivered the systems and processes for administering the BER system, including registered assessors, published BERs and mandatory advertising guidelines for property dealings.  The SEAI completed a significant update to the BER advisory report for dwellings, which became available in June 2021.  The updated report provides a personalised roadmap for homeowners on how to upgrade their homes to a target of a B2 energy rating or better.  This is a key instrument to help achieve the ambitious home energy upgrade targets in the climate action plan.  The BER is a requirement for many of the SEAI&rsquo;s grants schemes.</p><p> To support further the implementation of the EPBD, the SEAI has supported the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the roll-out of the building regulations for new and existing buildings, the development and publication of calculation methodology, and the development of cost-optimal studies; supported the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in the publication of the long-term renovation strategy; mobilised investment in renovation through our grant schemes, the introduction of packaged solutions, and the development of the recently launched one-stop shop programme; provided financial and technical support in the development of national standards, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, standards for energy retrofitting of dwellings and heat pumps and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's standards for energy efficiency in traditional buildings, based on lessons learned from our grant schemes; supported the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in informing large building owners regarding the requirements for building automation and control systems and electric vehicles, EVs; and undertook future-proofing of the forthcoming recast directive through our research development and demonstration programme, which has supported projects in monitoring the performance of technologies in buildings, investigating operational performance of buildings, researching the embodied carbon of buildings, and piloting the building renovation passport.</p><p> Since its introduction in 2002, the directive has evolved, and changes to it have been effected at a national level through the EPBD implementation group, which is a collaboration between the SEAI, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The proposed EPBD revision, published in December 2021, has a twofold objective: to contribute to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of buildings and final energy consumption by 2030, and to provide a long-term vision for buildings and ensure an adequate contribution to achieving climate neutrality in 2050.  The European Commission target is that the community&rsquo;s building stock will be emitting zero emissions by 2050.</p><p> The SEAI is working with our departmental colleagues in preparation for the proposed changes to the directive.  These may include the following high-level requirements: all new buildings to be zero emissions from 2027 for public buildings and 2030 for all others; whole life cycle greenhouse gas emissions to be calculated for all new large buildings from 2030; minimum energy standards for all buildings; availability of building renovation passports and smart readiness indicators for buildings; and the reclassification of the BER system.</p><p> We thank our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for their continued support and close collaboration.  I welcome this discussion with the committee and my colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions the members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

By way of background for members and those who may be watching these proceedings, regarding this recast directive, on 15 December 2021 the European Commission adopted the latest proposal to revise and recast the energy performance of buildings directive.  It is part of a broader overhaul of EU climate and energy legislation, which is referred to as the Fit for 55 package.  The principal aim of this package is to deliver on the climate action goal of a minimum reduction of 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  The main objectives of the recast directive are to reduce substantially greenhouse gas emissions and final energy consumption in the building sector by 2030 and to set a long-term vision for an EU building sector that is climate neutral by 2050.  In this respect, the recast directive aims to increase the rate and depth of renovations of energy-efficient buildings, improve information on the energy performance and sustainability of buildings, and guarantee that all new buildings in the EU meet ambitious zero emissions building standards.  In that regard, the committee felt this proposal warranted further scrutiny and hence this meeting.</p> <p>  I go to the members now to ask their questions, three of whom are under time constraints to get to other meetings.  If other members agree, I will call Deputies Flaherty and O&rsquo;Donoghue and Senator Fitzpatrick.  We will then revert to normal running.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

It is great to see a sea of work under way in this area.  It is important and is a key pillar of our programme for Government.  I will tee off with some key questions for each of the witnesses.  Starting with Dr. Byrne, regarding the BER reclassification, this is being done to bring it in line with European standards.  Is this going to be problematic in a context where members of the public are still getting used to the concept of BERs?  I ask Dr. Byrne to expand on this point.  When he refers to the reclassification of BER, what does he mean?</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy regarding the point he made about the public.  The BER has existed since 2006 and it is only now, with the climate crisis we are in, that people are really starting to sit up and pay attention to it.  This change will have an impact.  I ask Mr. Hughes to give a bit more detail about what this means in practical terms for the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.922" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022042800002#C00500"><p>Regarding the harmonisation of the energy ratings scale, different member states have adopted different approaches.  In Ireland, for example, we have ratings of A1, A2 and A3, etc., and this scales down to a G rating in buildings with poor energy efficiency.  At the higher end of the scale, buildings will have close to zero energy use.  There is close banding in respect of differentiation between buildings.  An A1-rated energy-efficient building today will still be energy-efficient in the new classification regarding its low-energy use and use of renewable energy.  The recasting, and subsequently having ratings on a scale of A to G, will simplify things for consumers.  It will also mean it will be easy to compare building ratings in respect of the classifications used by the different member states.</p></speech>

That G rating will include the poorest 15% of the building stock, as measured by energy use.  The other bands will then be equally divided across the scale.</p></speech>

Therefore, an A-rated building today will still perform well in future, when the harmonisation is brought in from 2025 onwards.</p></speech>

Some have expired and the current number is that approximately 56% homes have active BERs.  There is a full breakdown of that on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, website.  We provide BER data on a regular, quarterly basis to the CSO.  It combines those data with census data and scale that up to population.  There is a full breakdown by heating system type, county, year of construction and fuel type on the CSO website under its climate and environment section.</p></speech>

I notice that since local authorities have moved into the area of retrofitting that many companies are specialising in that work to the detriment of the private sector, which are not doing this work.  Has the SEAI made any recommendations to Government as to how we can get more people involved in training and apprenticeships?  Does the authority have any role in that?</p></speech>

One is that there is a shortage in the retrofit construction sector generally and separate from that there is the issue of the BER assessor community.</p> <p>  We have been working closely with our colleagues on assessment needs.  Late last year, we had the expert skills group on the future requirements of the green economy which identified that we needed in the region of 17,000 workers in the retrofit sector.  We have approximately 6,000 workers in the sector at the moment.  Five education training boards, ETBs, have been identified as centres of excellence for training up workers.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has allocated &euro;17 million this year to double the number of apprentices coming out specialising in retrofit trades and the green economy.</p> <p>  On the BER assessor community, we have a significant number on the BER register at the moment.  We have targets to achieve and year-on-year growth in the BER assessor community within the climate action plan.  I will invite my colleague, Dara Stewart, who runs that part of the organisation to comment on the BER assessors.</p></speech>

In 2021, we increased the domestic assessor registration by 89, which was an increase of 17%.  In the first quarter of 2022, we increased that figure by 28 domestic assessors.  We will continue to look at increasing the number of registered assessors over the coming year.</p></speech>

They are published and available on our public register, comprising approximately 600 assessors.  There will be a relatively small number - I estimate it is approximately 50 - who may publish a small number of assessments on an ongoing basis.  That is their choice.  We have sufficient capacity, however, to scale up quickly and add new assessors.  It is a matter for each assessor to decide how much work they take on in meeting the registration requirements on an ongoing basis.  We have sufficient capacity in the system.</p></speech>

My final question, for Mr. Armstrong, is on the local authority retrofit programme.  I am aware that local authorities had a concern that there were cost overruns which were not being addressed when the authorities went back to the Department.  I do not know if Mr. Paul Benson is with the Department group today but I believe the Department has issued a directive indicating that the amounts allocated for each future piece of retrofit work have been increased but that local authorities will not be reimbursed retrospectively for work that has been done.  Does Mr. Armstrong have any update on that issue?</p></speech>

With regard to retrospective works, my understanding is that these would have been covered by the previous circular.  I can check that and get back to the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

In some local authorities we are looking at an overrun in the order of approximately &euro;700,000.  Local authority staff and officials will quickly lose the appetite for a scheme if they have to find money for to cover things like that.</p></speech>

When this policy on the SEAI grants was launched by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, the figures were prepared in October and based on the retrofit of a house costing &euro;50,000.  At that time, a grant of &euro;23,500 was available.  Since then there has been a 38% increase in the cost of materials and labour, which means the value of the grant has fallen to &euro;2,500 based on the &euro;50,000 cost when the grants were launched.  In other words, the grant has been absorbed by the increase in the cost of materials and labour.  The cost then goes back to the home owner again.</p> <p>  Most of the retrofits have been done on a city rather than county basis.  This comes down to labour, numbers and business.  If I can get ten houses in a row, it will be viable for me to do those houses and it becomes a business.  People are entitled to do that.  That becomes a problem, however, when it is a one-off retrofit because there are transport and labour costs and the cost of getting labour to the site.  It is more costly to retrofit a house in the countryside.  </p> <p>  Existing planning permissions allow only one heat energy source, for example, solar panels or a heat pump, to be installed.  I am aware that this is changing.</p> <p>  I want people to change to better heated homes but I also want to make it affordable for them.  At the moment, speaking as a person in construction, the workforce is not available.  </p> <p>  I asked the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to introduce a provision for early leavers, those who would like to leave school early.  I asked that  students in fifth year or transition year doing the leaving certificate applied could doe one base year of an apprenticeship in fifth or sixth year.  This would allow them to get on the ladder before they leave school.  It would encourage students to stay in school and get a basic education, while giving them the skills they will need when they leave school because they will have already started an apprenticeship.  It would also help with the retrofitting of houses into the future.</p> <p>  If I want to have my windows or insulation upgraded, there is a preliminary cost when one goes through the SEAI.  Some contractors are coming out and putting in the preliminary costs on each item that they price.  It is not based on the whole house.  If someone tells a contractor they want external insulation, there will be a preliminary cost involved in that work, which is a base cost on SEAI.  If that person comes back to the contractor and says they want the attic done as well, a preliminary cost will also be raised for that work.  There should be just one preliminary cost for the whole house.  Otherwise, all of the funding goes into preliminary costs.</p> <p>  We need to sell a package.  If we can sell a package with one preliminary cost, it will mean we can have the work done cheaper because the preliminary start-up costs on any building cover insurance, scaffolding or whatever else is needed.  If we can give a package where people can do the whole retrofit with one preliminary cost, it would mean one part of the house would be done at a cost that would otherwise be eaten up in fees.  That is what we need to look at.</p> <p>  There are companies doing one thing at a time.  They are telling people to do one thing now and this will help them on their way.  Getting as much done as possible with one preliminary cost should be encouraged.  That is one issue I want addressed because I have seen this practice everywhere.</p><p>I know the companies have been given a rate so they can train up people on BER, which is a good way of doing it and it helps to upskill people, especially younger people who have come out of college and want to do this.  It is a good way forward.</p><p> The main thing we want is to get people to upgrade the energy in their houses.  At the moment, there are still grants available for oil burners through SEAI grants, which I welcome.  If someone has an old burner that is not burning efficiently, until they can get their house retrofitted, at least they have something to bring down the emissions within the house.</p><p> From the point of view of total tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions per dwelling over ten years, kerosene is 68 tonnes, air source heat pump is 53 tonnes, wood pellets is 15 tonnes, bioliquid blend is 52 tonnes, bioliquid blend B50K is 40 tonnes and pure bioliquid is 10 tonnes.  These are figures on energy ratings that point us to what we can do to improve houses even if they are on different systems.</p><p> Outside of the city areas, we have a big problem with ESB because we get knocked out maybe two or three times a year.  If people do not have ESB and are completely reliant on heat pumps or solar, how do they heat their house?  Something has to run the pumps so how do we address that going forward?</p></speech>

The Deputy raises some very pertinent observations about the costs of one-off housing and the impact this can have on infrastructure, transport and so on.  We might get to answer those questions if anybody wishes to comment briefly.  In fact, I do not think we are going to have time.</p></speech>

I will go through a few of them rapid-fire and we can go through them again at another time, if he likes.</p> <p>  With regard to the grants no longer matching the cost of heating systems, one of the very important initiatives that was introduced in the range of measures that was brought in back in February was about closing the gap between the oil boiler and the heat pump to try to not have people able to use that as an excuse, as much as anything else.  We want to be able to convince them that this is the right technology for them but also to make it affordable for them.  In terms of the partial grants, that gap has been narrowed.</p> <p>  With regard to the workforce and training, that is going to be a huge challenge and the Deputy has put forward quite a creative solution in terms of the school leavers.  I know this is a very important issue for the Minister, Deputy Harris, at the moment in terms of giving school leavers and people later on in their career the options.  It is not all about college.  One of the important initiatives is that when people go to the CAO website now, it lets them know about the types of options in terms of apprenticeships.</p> <p>  To give specific numbers on the training places that our colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are putting on this year, as Mr. Byrne mentioned earlier, there is &euro;17 million under the green skills action programme and that will double the places in upskilling and reskilling to 4,500.  There was some very positive news on apprenticeships as well last year.</p></speech>

That will stop that kind of recurring preliminary cost-type issue but, at the same time, we want to make sure that people who could not do it all in one go have the option to do it in a step-by-step manner.  It is obviously more cost-effective to do it all in one go but the affordability issue that has been mentioned by Deputy Flaherty will be an impediment to some people doing it all in one go.  One of the principles of the national retrofit plan is universality.  We want to have a solution for every consumer cohort and homeowner type.  For that reason, we are still allowing both, but there absolutely is an option for a one-stop shop to come in and do the whole house all in one go, project managed from end to end to ensure quality and take people through the grant and administration process.</p></speech>

I will have to interrupt him there.  I call Senator Fitzpatrick.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.960" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022042800002#E01300"><p>I thank all of the witnesses for attending the committee today.  The updating of the directive is something we are all supportive of and renovating existing housing stock is probably the most sustainable way to increase our housing stock.  Combined with the &euro;20 billion Housing for All and &euro;8 billion for retrofitting, there is clearly a very strong commitment from the Government to do everything that can be done to increase the energy efficiency of our built environment.  That is for all of the obvious reasons, such as warmer homes and more affordable homes, as well as local employment and the environmental benefits.  I say all of that just to reinforce how important is the work that the Department and SEAI are doing and how it important it is for our country and society generally.  I welcome and support that.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, I will have to leave the meeting as I have another meeting that I have to go to, so no disrespect is intended and I apologise in advance.</p> <p>  I am based in Dublin Central.  The social housing retrofitting that has been done by Dublin City Council has made a huge impact in terms of the quality of life of people living in my constituency.  The retrofitting of homes in Cabra and other parts of the constituency has changed the quality of people's lives, so it is very welcome.  The new developments that are being delivered under Housing for All at Dominick Street, Se&aacute;n Foster Place, St. Bricins and the net-zero housing are fantastic and are really changing how people are living in the city.</p> <p>  I have two questions, although they are not so much questions for the witnesses but simply to put them on the radar.  With the local authorities - Dublin City Council is mine but this would go for the others too - it is very important that while there are issues and we all know there are massive challenges in terms of meeting our housing need and in terms of renovations and our environmental targets, we need to continue to encourage and support them to be ambitious about tackling the existing built housing stock.  I am thinking of flats in Dublin Central like those at Henrietta House, Greek Street flats, St. Michan&rsquo;s and Constitution Hill.  They are there and they are built, but far too many of them are not up to standard and they need to be brought up to standard.  I would encourage the Department and the SEAI, with the local authorities, and Dublin City Council in particular, to push that agenda and encourage them to be ambitious about it.</p> <p>  Over the last ten years, Dublin City Council did have a bit of a false start.  I presume Deputy Flaherty was referring to Longford when he said the local authority there feels it has cost overruns and so it is going to draw back.  We cannot allow that to happen with our local authorities.  We hope to work with local authorities to ensure they continue to be ambitious.  The changes and the improvements that can be delivered are enormous in terms of people's real daily lives but also in a broader sense.</p> <p>  The other issue I want to bring up is private homes.  The SEAI is doing great work and I commend it on supporting a number of groups in the city, with citizen activation, citizens taking ownership and educating themselves and sharing their experience, and all of that is very important.  It was said there are five one-stop shops operating already, which is great.  How long do the witnesses think it is going to take to get to a full complement of one-stop shops?  I appreciate our challenges but they might give us some indication.</p> <p>  In terms of the low interest rate loans, how will they work, how will people access them and, most critically, how soon do the witnesses think people will be able to access them?  I would appreciate answers to those questions.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for her positive comments, which I very much appreciate.  I would share her view that it is a very positive thing that we are doing.</p><p> In terms of the question asking the full complement of the one-stop shops, we have five registered, we have 15 more in the process and we have a target this year of 20.  To give a kind of a non-answer, we do not have a full complement because there is no upper limit.  What we want to do is attract as many companies as the market can sustain not just in Dublin but in regionally-based parts of the country as well.  We have relatively strict criteria to get in to ensure that we have the quality piece and a company is capable of doing this work.  Importantly, although there are five one-stop shops they all work directly with the contractor community.  People have the idea that there are only five companies that do this but they all feed into various contractors around the country so all have a national presence.  While they might not exactly have direct employees in Cork they will work with contractors who are based in Cork and things like that.  From that perspective, the actual number may be unclear.  </p></speech>

There is no upper limit.  We will take as many as we can get in.  My colleague, Mr. Deegan, will respond to the question about the loan guarantee scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.967" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Deegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022042800002#F00400"><p>In terms of when the loan guarantee scheme will become available and what it is about, the Government is working with the Department of Finance, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to put in place a loan guarantee scheme that will reduce the risk for financial institutions to give out loans for retrofit projects which will, in turn, reduce the interest rate that homeowners must pay and make retrofitting more affordable.  The scheme is under development and meetings are ongoing.  In fact, an EIB delegation came here to attend meetings yesterday and today.</p> <p>  In the coming weeks we will reach the very important milestone of a pre-qualification call whereby financial institutions express an interest in it, give a high-level overview of it and narrow the field a little in terms of the number of financial institutions so we will know how many people are interested, and we can get data from them that will inform the loan guarantee model.</p> <p>  When will the scheme be available on the market?  We are aiming for quarter 3 of this year.  We think it is going to be a very important initiative for the people who draw down partial grants.  We fully accept that the grant schemes are very generous by international standards but if one is doing a very deep retrofit there is still a big financial impediment and an upfront cost barrier.  We believe that in future people will supplement a partial grant with some of their savings, and for those who need extra from the loans then they will be available through financial institutions like banks and credit unions.    </p></speech>

In the first round I will stick to the recast issue and I have specific questions for Mr. Armstrong on his Department's observations from last December.  I will ask more general questions if there is a second round of questions.</p> <p>  One of my concerns about the observations made by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is that throughout the Department supports the intentions of the review.  The Department then seeks a whole series of exemptions or exceptionalities which, if they are accepted at an EU level, undermine some of the intentions.  I am keen to give Mr. Armstrong an opportunity to clarify the logic, rationale and, in some cases, the criteria against which the Department seeks some of these flexibilities.  I have five observations and I will go trough them quickly to give him as much time as possible to respond.</p> <p>  I refer to the observation on Article 2(2)(O), emissions buildings.  Again, the Department says it supports the objective but states "where technically feasible" at the end of the section.  Please outline what "where technically feasible" means.  In practical terms who determines or against what criteria would technical feasibility be decided?  I ask so that we can fully understand the matter.</p> <p>  On Article 2(19), deep renovation, the Department is not just looking for "where technically feasible" but also "economically and functionally feasible", which is an even broader potential set of opt-outs for a very important provision.  Please outline what is meant by "economically and functionally feasible" and the criteria used?  When determining whether something is economically feasible is an assessment done on the economic feasibility of not doing it or the longer term economic cost, and is one married against the other?  </p> <p>  With respect to Article 2(23), there is a series of suggested exemptions with respect to whole-of-lifecycle emissions.  My reading of the comment, and I could have misinterpreted it, is that it gives more priority to the operational emissions rather than the embodied emissions because the operational ones are a larger component.  The problem as we know, given what Mr. Armstrong outlined at the start about the increase in residential building, is embodied carbon will become a much larger feature of our overall carbon emissions and at present it is 10% across all categories.  Have I misinterpreted or has he given greater privilege to the operational over the embodied?  If so, why?  If not, and I have misunderstood, will he please clarify?</p> <p>  In terms of observations on Article 7(12), there is a series of exemption requests on dates, so on 2027 and 2030, where buildings are already designed or commencements have started.  Is there a concern that if one does not try, even at that late stage, to apply some of the higher standards that they will have to be done anyway?  I ask as it is more expensive to retrofit them after the fact in five, ten or 15 years time than introduce at least some level of inconvenience for builders and developers at that point.</p> <p>  I am greatly concerned about Article 9(1) in respect of minimum energy performance standards.  There is a general request made for additional flexibility for the private rental sector.  We know that in many cases the energy efficiency of the private rental sector is very low.  We know that is where we have a heavy concentration of lower-income families with higher levels of energy poverty.  Therefore, should we be encouraging too much flexibility in the private rental sector?  Clearly, we do not want to do anything that further disrupts supply but if the trade-off is poor energy efficiency and, therefore, more negative impacts over the longer term on fuel poverty then that is not a good trade-off.  Is there not a better way to deal with the challenge?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.971" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Armstrong" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022042800002#F00800"><p>The Department is very supportive of the EPBD.  Ireland has been exemplary in its implementation of the EPBD over the last 20 years.  We have a lot of experience in transposing the legislation, writing the technical guidance and setting performance standards that work.</p> <p>  This is a draft EPBD.  When we review the articles we will examine them so that we can implement them in the most effective way to achieve the greatest level of ambition possible.  There is absolutely no intent to undermine or detract from the ambition of the EPBD.  Any observations are totally about implementing it in the most effective way.  I reiterate that this is a draft directive.  The Commission has asked member states for their feedback and we give our feedback in the spirit of effective implementation.</p> <p>  With regard to the specific issues that have been raised, the first concerned Article 2(2) and zero-emission buildings.  There is a provision in Article 2(2) that a renewable energy community scheme will meet the renewables requirement for on-site electricity.  We are very supportive of renewable energy community schemes.  From the point of view of implementing that at a building level, when one applies the calculation methodology it is impossible to know whether the electricity used in the building has come from a renewable energy community scheme or a fossil-fuel generated scheme.</p> <p>  In terms of a solution, the following was introduced a little over 15 years ago in the UK whereby renewable energy community schemes would be recognised.  The only way that it was physically possible to know that the electricity came from a renewable energy scheme was to put in separate lines direct from the renewable energy community scheme to the building.  We are supportive and want that to happen.  As we are not sure how this can physically happen we have suggested the insertion of the phrase "where technically feasible" in order to provide for it but not to require it from member states because we would have no way to implement it if it was implemented in the form that has been proposed.</p><p> With regard to deep retrofit, as the Deputy will be very well aware, the housing stock is complex and diverse and has been there for hundreds of years.  We have traditional buildings, buildings of architectural value, buildings that were built prior to regulations and different methods of construction.  The building physics that apply the operation of those buildings varies depending on when they were constructed.  Where we have traditional buildings that were built before the 1940s, and some built after that period, the transfer of moisture is important.  The walls of those buildings need to be allowed to breathe.  If we set performance requirements that require people to place modern insulation on the external or internal surface of those buildings, that can prevent the walls from breathing which can result in condensation, mould growth and health damage to the people who occupy those buildings.  The directive has not been nuanced enough to take account of that.</p><p> The term "where technically functional and economically feasible" came from the 2010 directive.  It is a term we took from the 2010 directive and used in the past with regard to major renovations.  We suggested to the Commission that because there are technical risks in traditional buildings, when deep retrofits are being carried out we need to ensure they are technical, economically and functionally feasible.  The Commission produces recommendations on what constitutes technically, economically and functionally feasible and we refer to those guidelines.  In the 2010 directive, we found they were not detailed enough and we have had to go further and provide more detailed definitions in the technical guidance documents.  Alternatively, we will carry out an assessment as part of the development of the technical guidance documents, determine what is and is not a safe level for a building and provide that in the technical guidance document.  That is how we work with the directive to aid its implementation.  The objective is to achieve the most effective implementation of the requirements and bring all of the dwellings to the most ambitious, safe and practical level they can achieve.</p></speech>

The SEAI was thorough in its response to questions on the retrofitting grant.  Dr. Byrne instilled a lot of confidence in members that it is being rolled out very well.  It is important we have that confidence.</p> <p>  I do not know whether the witnesses watched or read the reports on our meeting earlier this week with the Irish Green Building Council and Dr. Kinnane from UCD, who I understand the SEAI has commissioned to do some research.  Ms Josefina Lindblom of the Commission spoke to the committee on Tuesday.  It was a very interesting three-hour session of good back and forth on a subject that was quite new to many of us.  The reporting of it was quite unfair.  I would not say what was reported was misreported, but the reports were perhaps incomplete and somewhat unbalanced.  It would leave people with the impression the retrofit plan was not going well and there was not good auditing when in fact there is.  The very reason Dr. Kinnane made these points was he had been commissioned by the SEAI in a very appropriate way to find out where the gaps are and to continuously improve the system.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to a big piece of the EPBD that is coming down the tracks, namely the life cycle cost analysis and the assess and report aspect.  I understand 2030 is the year it will be introduced.  I have a view that is something we should try to get ahead of and not wait.  As Mr. Armstrong said, Ireland is an exemplar in the roll-out and implementation of the original EPBD and should get ahead of the recasting of the EPBD as soon as possible.  Other countries are doing that.</p> <p>  In a committee meeting, there was frequent mention of the value of existing buildings, the importance of renovations and understanding the embodied carbon in existing buildings, some of which are 30 years old while others are 200 years old.  There is a vast stock of buildings that have embodied carbon in them.  Everybody here would agree we should do everything we can to address that.  However, there seems to be a gap in our regulatory regime.  It is perhaps easy to demolish buildings and build new ones on greenfield sites.  It is a planning question.  Is the Department considering regulatory steps to reduce the number of demolitions and building from scratch in the country?  It is something we can address sooner rather than later.  We do not need to wait to find out what the embodied carbon in all of these buildings is.  We know this is the right thing to do.  I ask Mr. Armstrong to be as brief as he can.  I have one other question.</p></speech>

It is about the reuse of town centres and compact urban growth.  As the committee will be aware, compact urban growth is a key objective of Housing for All and the national planning framework.  The Department has specific actions in Housing for All to address vacant housing.  There is a new local authority led programme to help local authorities buy or purchase vacant homes that can then be sold and ensure homes do not lie vacant.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns initiative will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of 2,000 serviced sites attract people to build-----</p></speech>

When somebody applies to a local authority for planning and states they want to knock down a building and build a new one, that is a problem.  If we are not valuing the embodied carbon that is in those buildings, it will be easy for a local authority to allow a building to be knocked down and the construction of a new building to proceed.  Are we considering that?  We should begin to value the embodied carbon in existing buildings.  There are all kinds of good reasons to do so, including heritage as well as climate.  Is the Department considering any steps to introduce regulations to prevent unnecessary demolition?</p></speech>

There are working groups working on that and a series of actions in the climate action plan to address embodied carbon in buildings and put in place frameworks to calculate embodied carbon.  Initially, these frameworks normally target new buildings, but they can equally be applied to existing buildings.  That would have to be developed as part of those frameworks and methodologies.  It would be a matter of capturing it in the proposed framework for embodied carbon.</p></speech>

I refer to quality control on the BER and assessment side and the renovation and deep retrofitting side.  Are there mechanisms and systems to ensure they are in place?  The reports following our recent committee meeting dented confidence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.980" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022042800002#H00100"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments.  We would share his take on the situation.  We believe there is quality and confidence in the system.  At the start of the process, there is a code of practice in place.  Along with the SEAI, we wrote S.R. 54, which is the standard for retrofitting in Ireland.  Before you get anywhere near a building, we have codified quality standards.  We also work directly and closely with contractors to ensure they are suitably qualified.  For example, to participate in the solar PV scheme, the contractor must be a registered electrical installer and must also undertake a solar PV installation design course.  Before we go out to the market, we are assessing the contractors.  In the context of the newly launched one-stop shop services, OSSS, some of the criticism might, perhaps, have been that we were slow, but that was because we were really focusing on the quality and the capabilities to deliver at the right level.  We then move to doing the work, the other side of which involves looking at the assurances afterwards.  We have a comprehensive inspection process within the SEAI.  Last year, for example, we undertook over 4,000 inspections on buildings.  Our focus is not so much on the after-effects, but on building confidence from the start so that we can minimise at the other end.  We are very assured that we have the systems in place.</p> <p>  I will counter and make the point that given the scale of what we are doing, things will go wrong.  That is part of life, but we have the systems and structures in place.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties with Housing for All is its commitment to exempt construction demolition from landfill waste levies.  From an environmental point of view and in terms of the embodied carbon, that is a major mistake.  It is hugely problematic.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for being here and for their contributions.  I want to follow up with the SEAI on some of the issues raised by Deputy Leddin, including the 4,000 inspections on buildings.  In terms of the works taking place, what percentage does that represent?  For example, is that a once-off inspection and how thorough is the inspection?</p></speech>

In many cases, it is a once-off inspection, but where issues are identified, the contractor may be required to do re-works that may trigger a follow-up inspection.</p></speech>

We completed in the region of 15,000 homes last year.  The level of inspection depends on the number of applications on the particular grant scheme.  New contractors under the scheme would be subject to higher levels of inspection, although we bring them along with us in terms of training them in regard to the way we do things.  For pretty much all of our main schemes, we have a suite of highly experienced contractors who have been working on those schemes for many years.  They would be inspected but not very often.</p></speech>

In terms of the contribution from Dr. Oliver Kinnane from the school of architecture, planning and environmental policy in University College Dublin, UCD, to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action this week and those findings, when one looks at what has happened in Ireland in terms of building control, building defects and the figure of possibly &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion that the State will have to pay out to remedy pyrite, mica, fire safety defects and other building defects, we do not, unfortunately, have a good track record in building works regulation and that has been hugely costly for individuals and the general public.  I appreciate that the SEAI sought that input.  Is it looking at further independent evaluation?  In what way is it dealing with those findings?</p></speech>

We work with various Departments, including the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Environment, Climate and Communications to identify projects that we want to research.  This particular call was around the operational performance of these buildings.  That study looked at a very small sample in terms of the fabric.  As part of that call, a request was made for more funding to do bigger research projects.  We recently issued the call for this year's funding.  We seek this information in order that we can ask the right questions.  We want these buildings to perform.  We feed in the research information.</p> <p>  Another comment that was made was around the performance of heat pumps.  We have learned from that research and fed it into our grant schemes, in that we make the contractors do correct designs in terms of their buildings.  Part of that study was around the weather data that are used for determining the performance of the heat pumps.  We adjust the performance of the heat pump based on Irish weather data in the BER system.  We have already implemented some of that study and we are either working on or doing additional research on other parts of it and feeding that in to the methodologies and calculations.</p></speech>

My next question is for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage representatives.  I appreciate that they are from the climate action policy unit and, as such, building control may not be their main area.  All of this relates to building control issues.  Is the Department looking at making improvements in the regulatory framework in terms of all building works, including retrofitting, the statute of limitations and company law, to ensure that directors of companies found to be responsible for serious breaches can be held to account, and the establishment of a national building control authority along the lines of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland?  What is the Department's view on these matters?  We have a disastrous track record in this area.  We cannot assume that because there is lots of good will and good work is being done, as we have heard, things will definitely be different with retrofitting.</p></speech>

We are currently bringing through the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 so we are dealing with similar questions at another forum.  A lot of these issues would have been raised there.  There is an ongoing reform programme of building control.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are bringing through the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 at the moment.  While the categories of registration have yet to be defined, it is intended that retrofit will be one of those categories.  The Minister has committed to consideration being given to the establishment of a national building standards regulator.</p></speech>

As much as politicians would love to be in two places at once, we have not yet mastered it.  I have read all of the opening statements.  I thank all of the witnesses for their presence and all of the information they have provided.  I have a number of questions, which I will get straight to as I have only seven minutes in which to put questions and get answers.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Deegan.  In regard to the skills shortage, which is already an issue in terms of the one-stop shop and the SEAI grant, what plans are in place to overcome it?  I was encouraged to hear in Mr. Deegan's opening statement that this year we are seeking to do 27,000 more home energy upgrades.  Are we on track in that regard?  The new low-cost loan scheme for retrofitting is welcome.  How will it work for older people who, from a loan perspective, are not attractive candidates for the banks?  Have we factored that in?</p> <p>  My next question is to Mr. Armstrong.  In regard to electric vehicle, or EV, charging points and the infrastructure around them, an issue that comes up again and again is the need for EV charging infrastructure at apartment blocks from a planning perspective but also from a retrospective perspective in regard to existing apartment blocks.  How do we incentivise the delivery of EV charging points to make the switch to electric possible for apartment dwellers?</p><p>From 2025, the minimum BER for rented properties comes with the caveat "where feasible".  That is how I feel about it as well.  I would hate to slow down progress in the creation of new rental properties for people.  I am thinking in particular of homes that may become available under the fair deal scheme.  Where older people are availing of the scheme, the Government has announced plans to reduce the amount of rental income that will go towards their fair deal care in a bid to incentivise more older people to put their homes up for rent, but I am conscious that many of these homes may not be BER fit for purpose.  I noted in Dr. Byrne's opening statement the mention of a reclassification of the BER.  Will he elaborate?</p><p> I hope I have left the witnesses enough time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.999" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Deegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022042800002#J00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  She raised three matters, the first of which was the skills shortage.  The national retrofit plan addresses skills and standards in the workforce, which also speaks to Deputy O'Callaghan's point.  One of the first actions under that pillar was quantifying the number of people that we needed.  There are approximately 4,000 people in the retrofit workforce at the moment, but we need to increase that number rapidly to 17,000 within two or three years.  The allocation provided to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeships will be crucial.  There is a near doubling of places to 4,500 for upskilling and reskilling.  This will mean that new entrants and existing workers in the sector can train up quickly.  People will not necessarily have to go through four-year apprenticeships.</p> <p>  Regarding the loan scheme, particularly as it relates to older people, loans will be provided through financial institutions, which will need to follow their due diligence processes just as they would for any other loan.  That is an important point to make.  Regarding universality and ensuring that we have supports for all those who need them, a high percentage of older people are entitled to some welfare payments that in turn entitle them to free upgrades under the warmer homes scheme.  There may be a requirement for other options.  The health benefits that accrue from retrofits would be beneficial for older people and we are keen to keep people out of nursing care and in their homes in their own communities for as long as possible.  The approach that we are taking to the loan scheme is about getting it up and running and operating through financial institutions later this year.  We hope to make it a more affordable proposition for people.  The terms will not be defined, so if the older person believes that he or she can repay a loan within a shorter period that was also suitable for the bank's purposes, that would be possible.</p> <p>  There will be a significant increase in output this year.  Does my colleague, Dr. Byrne, wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

As of this morning, we have received just under 13,000 applications, which is 65% of last year's total of just under 20,000 applications.  There is a lag between application and delivery, but we have delivered just under 5,000 homes across all of the SEAI's schemes, not just the OSSS.  We are on track, but that is always a relative discussion.  We could be doing something different in a week's time, but we are making good progress.</p> <p>  The Deputy's final question was on BER classifications.  I might ask my colleague, Mr. Hughes, to address that.</p></speech>

Currently, it goes from A1, A2 and A3 all the way to G.  It will be simplified to run from A to G.  A high-performance building today will still be a high-performance building in the future.  A zero-emissions building will be A and G will be the 15% of poor-rated buildings, with an equal division across the other classifications.</p></speech>

In 2021, we introduced new regulations requiring residential apartment buildings with more than ten parking spaces to install EV charging infrastructure for each parking space.  This requirement also applies to major renovations to apartment buildings with more than ten parking spaces.  It is planned to extend it this year to all dwellings with a parking space.</p></speech>

The Department of Transport is the lead Department on the existing EV infrastructure charging strategy.  An EV infrastructure charging strategy is out for consultation at the moment.  According to an update from the Department of Transport in respect of existing apartment blocks, work is being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments.  The Department of Transport is working closely with the SEAI and expects the scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p></speech>

Cork City Council has approximately 11,000 social housing units.  Those units where my father lives - Harbour View Road in Knocknaheeny - were retrofitted two years ago.  The units at Allen Square and Wolfe Tone Street in my constituency were retrofitted over the past four years.  It has been a tremendous success.  The people living in those units have told me that their energy bills have reduced by 50%.  At Allen Square, they have solar panels on their roofs, so they have hot water whenever they need it.  At Mary Aikenhead Place, though, which is the terrace just beyond it, there are similar council properties built at a similar time and they have not been retrofitted because there is no money to do so.  Residents there are paying double for electricity, their houses are cold and damp and they do not have hot water.</p> <p>  Will there be a set standard for the retrofitting of local authority housing and will that transfer over to private homes?  I have been contacted by a retired couple living in Fairhill who applied for a grant to retrofit their privately owned house.  They could not get the retrofit done because there was a shortfall of &euro;8,000, but the person on the other side of the road - both are corner terraced houses that were originally local authority housing before being purchased by the tenants - could afford the &euro;8,000 to retrofit and insulate.  This shows the inadequacies.  We have people who want to do the right thing - retrofit, ensure energy efficiency and reduce their energy usage and bills - but the gap for many is unaffordable.</p> <p>  Will all local authorities be expected to carry out retrofitting to a set standard?</p></speech>

In the circulars from last year and this year on the energy efficiency retrofit programme for local authority dwellings, the BER standard is being set at B2.  The grant funding provided is based on achieving that B2.  The target is to retrofit 40% of suitable local authority dwellings that are not at B2 standard by 2030.</p></speech>

Most of the people living at Mary Aikenhead Place, Noonan Road and the like are in properties that are 70, 80 or 90 years old, freezing and damp.</p><p>The carbon tax is to be imposed on these people on 1 May.  We are looking at achieving 40% retrofitting of local authority housing so with Cork City Council, that would be 4,500 houses.  What happens to the other 6,500 houses?  Will the people in them have to pay the tax for years?  Retrofitting is a very good initiative and we all agree on that.  The issue is the timeline and it must be done more quickly.</p><p> I know much of the private work is contracted and even much of the local authority work is given to contractors.  This needs to be brought back to local authorities with designated teams funded by central government to carry out this work and speed up the process.  Is a 40% figure for 2030 realistic or is it good enough for what we are trying to accomplish when it comes to trying to reduce energy usage?  We are trying to save the planet and one minute we have people telling us we are not doing enough but this plan is not ambitious enough for what we must achieve.  Does Mr. Armstrong agree or disagree?</p></speech>

There is ambition in this plan.  When we speak of local authority housing and the 40% figure, there are 136,000 local authority dwellings in total.  From 2013 to the end of 2021, 75,000 of those units had some level of shallow retrofitting.</p></speech>

I raised the question with the Minister in the Chamber and he gave me that figure.  Some of those cases were just the provision of attic insulation.  The windows in the house may have been single-glazed aluminium and we might have been better taking the roof off the house.  That is if we do not do the windows or insulate the walls, either with external or pumped insulation.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told me the figures and I said it was not good enough to fit one door or window in a house that is cold, damp and 80 years old.  It is a waste of time if we do not retrofit the houses properly.</p> <p>  This is not a criticism of the Department because what it is doing is really important.  I just want the work done properly and a complete retrofit is the way forward.  I did not mean to interrupt but the Minister gave that reply about a month ago and I said the same to him.  Where I come from in Gurranabraher the houses are 80 or 90 years old.  That is in Farranree, Churchfield and Noonan's Road.  These people do not have years to be waiting and their houses are cold now.</p></speech>

The more advanced standard was introduced in 2021 and that is a B2 BER rating.  The target is for 40% of dwellings to achieve that more advanced standard.  Of those 136,000, because they are new dwellings built to advanced building regulations since 2008, 36,000 are already at a B2 level.  We have a further 36,000 that we want to bring to a B2 level by 2030.  We have 75,000 units where we have done shallow retrofits.  That is how we describe it and it typically comprises attic insulation or cavity wall insulation.  All dwellings will see some level of retrofit.  The newer dwellings and the 40% that will have been retrofitted will be at the B2 level or better in 2030.</p></speech>

That means there are 100,000 units not at that standard.  If we are looking to get 36,000 of those done between now and 2030, which is eight years away, there will be 64,000 houses that will not be retrofitted in the next eight years.  We have been speaking about climate change and global warming.  We are talking about reducing energy usage.  The State owns those 64,000 properties that will not be touched for at least eight years and maybe longer.</p></speech>

Some people may be able to afford retrofitting but others will not.  There will be a two-tier system where the people with funding and resources will see reduced energy costs and warmer homes but people with smaller incomes and who are more vulnerable will have colder homes and higher energy bills.  That is counter-intuitive.  We would probably drive people on the edge of poverty into poverty.</p> <p>  I have another point.</p></speech>

The climate action ambition we have now should have started more earnestly ten or 20 years ago.  We have a plan in place now with a commitment and funding.  It is important not to lose sight of that.  I am sure future Governments will commit to the aim as well and everybody will work together to ensure we achieve the target collectively.  I have a couple of questions.  I did not put Deputy Gould on a timer but I gave him quite a bit of time.</p></speech>

When we speak about energy efficiency in buildings, we concentrate on emissions and energy usage.  We quantify the energy and its cost.  Much of the time we do not focus the discussion on the benefits that accrue to people who live in energy-efficient buildings, including health benefits and a better quality of life.  There is also the creation of a building stock for future generations to purchase and for people to grow up in that would be sustainable and affordable.  It would ensure future generations could have healthy and clean homes in which to live.  It is something we lose in this debate some of the time.  We concentrate a great deal on science and engineering but there are people behind this as well.</p> <p>  To follow up a point Deputy Gould started, we know good targets are being met in the warmer homes scheme and good targets will be met in the local authority retrofitting.  I assume we are dealing with people in the lowest quality housing first and the people most at risk of fuel poverty.  Mr. Armstrong mentioned a figure of 60,000 and not all of those would be of a poor energy standard because they may have been built recently.  It is important to recognise that.</p> <p>  I know from frequent discussions that some people think the grant system is great but where will they get &euro;24,000 or &euro;25,000 to do the job?  Has the Department produced a ready reckoner so people can see what is required for a four-bedroom or three-bedroom semi-detached house or a detached house?  It would indicate the average energy usage for the house every year, the annual cost, and with a 20-year low-cost loan to get the work done, it would work out the weekly or monthly cost or benefit.  It would also take in health and quality of life benefits.  Everybody wants a better future and quality of life and health for their children who are being brought up in these houses.  Has that been done?  Perhaps it is a question for the SEAI witnesses.</p></speech>

To be honest, we have not done it in that way.  There are people out there like BERWOW, which looks at BER calculations.  It is a really good point and suggestion but one of our real difficulties is that there is an objective and amorphous thing - a building - and there are also people, and how people use the building can vary wildly as well.  It is therefore quite difficult to get into that ready reckoner space.  Perhaps Ms Coyle will comment.</p></speech>

One of the projects concerned operational energy and how people operate their buildings.  The BER rating is a comparative asset rating and it compares like-for-like buildings, with similar occupancy or profiles in terms of temperatures.  Some of the studies indicate that different people operate their buildings differently.  There could be one teenager in a house, for example, or there could be five teenagers in that house and the energy use would be different.</p><p>We have just launched a new tool on the SEAI website.  We have also done recent projects on internal environmental quality, the impact of retrofitting buildings and the benefits of that.  The tool on our website takes many of the learnings from that research.  It is available.  One can go into the tool and state that one's home currently has a D rating, for example, or the tool will make an assumption in respect of a BER rating.  It will show the benefit in terms of one's internal environment and the comfort and air quality within one's home.  One can input the number of occupants in the home.  It will inform people and provide running costs.  That is all based on some of the research projects we mentioned earlier.  It will provide a comparison between a D-rated home and a B2-rated one, for example.  It will outline that if one retrofits one's home, comfort and energy use will be improved, bills will be reduced and so on.</p></speech>

Should one clad the walls, insulate the attic or replace the windows?  The one-stop shops provide great information for such people.  What impact will this have on people living in the house during the construction stage?  Will they have to move out?  I presume that if one is doing external cladding, roof insulation, heat pumps, solar panels or windows, there is no necessity to move out of the house.  If a house has suspended timber floors, is there a requirement to do anything with the voids underneath to get up to an A2 rating?</p></speech>

One may wish to reduce draughts but one does not necessarily have to retrofit the timber floor to achieve an A-rated home.  One could achieve the rating through external wall insulation, a heat pump and so on.</p></speech>

It is a bit of a misnomer.  We should be clear that some people match the energy upgrading with an overall renovation of the home and that is a separate category.  One should not have to move out of the home to get to a B2 rating.</p></speech>

Many people are not aware of that.  They can be surprised and shocked by the energy consumption of certain household appliances and how much energy those appliances use.  Our guests are probably familiar with energy monitors, which were brought out some years ago.  They are very easy to fit.  A device that looks like a clothes peg goes onto the internal cable and that will give a readout of the energy used in kilowatts, carbon emissions and, most important for many people, in cent or euro per minute or hour.  That is probably one of the best things we could roll out to people so they can actually see and realise how much an electric shower, dishwasher or washing machine costs to run.  Does SEAI provide that?  Is it something it has ever promoted or launched?  It relates to energy awareness.</p></speech>

We previously gave out energy monitors as promotional material.  Obviously, we are in the middle of an energy crisis and we are considering what response we can make to improve the general knowledge of the issue referred to by the Chairman, that is, the energy usage of various household appliances and what they actually cost to use.  We are looking to roll out further information towards sustainable energy communities in terms of bringing that awareness to people.  I understand an information campaign will start today or tomorrow.  I know people are sometimes pilloried with messages to take shorter showers and things like that, but showers do actually use a hell of a lot of energy.  Even the energy consumption resulting from leaving televisions and chargers plugged in overnight, although small, does add up.</p></speech>

It makes people ask why 3 kWh of electricity is being used in the house at that moment and wonder what has been left on or who is using it.  The information is there for people rather than lecturing them on what the costs are or telling them not to do certain things.  I am out of time but I will have more questions.</p></speech>

To recap quickly, one of the questions related to the Department's observation on Article 2(23).  Was there more of a focus on the operational rather than embodied carbon, if I understood it right?  If so, was that a weakness?</p> <p>  My second question was in respect of the Department's comments on Article 7 and the various exemptions for buildings pre-2027 and -2030.  Ultimately, we will have to go back to those buildings at some stage.  They might not be captured now.</p> <p>  Probably the most important of the three questions relates to the observation of the Department on Article 9, the minimum energy performance standards, MEPS, and the impact on rental supply.  I have a particular concern in this regard.  Deputy Higgins made a good point in the sense that we want to make sure we have adequate supply but we also want to make sure it is of an adequate standard.  I ask Mr. Armstrong to speak more to the concern that was mentioned in respect of rental accommodation.</p> <p>  If I may throw in an additional question for Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Deegan that kind of ties in nicely, the committee is holding several separate hearings on the issue of embodied carbon, particularly with a view to future increased public and private residential construction and in the context of the sectoral emissions reductions targets that will be legally binding from this year on.  What preparations are being undertaken in the Departments of Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Deegan specifically in respect of how we ensure our public housing output this year, next year and thereafter, but also in how we regulate and encourage the private sector to start reducing its embodied carbon?  For good reason, all of our conversations to date have tended to focus on the operation and energy efficiency, and that is really good.  However, we also know from research the Irish Green Building Council produced recently that even as we get our operational emissions in the built environment down, we will see significant increases in embodied carbon across the built environment if we do not grasp the nettle quickly in terms of what we can do there.  If both Departments can speak to that at the end, that would be great.  The SEAI got off lightly today from me.</p></speech>

There is no intention to emphasise one over the other.  We are aware that quite often on the databases that are currently available the certification for the embodied carbon in construction products is grid to gate because that includes the manufacturer of the product where the embodied carbon is.  The whole life cycle, however, means that the embodied emissions are added to the operational emissions to get the total emissions.  Obviously, the------</p></speech>

The directive states that the certificate should display the whole life greenhouse gas emissions.  We will be happy to work with the directive.  We want to implement it in the most effective way.  That observation was made because our understanding is that most embodied carbon assessments are grid to gate at the moment rather than cradle to end of life.  It is just to give that option if in the context of what is already certified.</p> <p>  As regards buildings in 2027 and 2030, this is the transition arrangement that applies to every new building that is being constructed.  If a new building is being designed and constructed and the walls have been built and insulated and the renewables on the roof have been designed and purchased but then a regulation comes out, it is impractical and cost-ineffective and has significant schedule impacts to go back and redesign the building and make all those adjustments to achieve the new standard.  There has to be a transition arrangement for certain buildings.</p><p>It has to apply to buildings which are commencing construction, buildings in mid-construction and buildings which are close to completion.  One has to take account that they have been built at the old standard and it is not possible during the middle of a construction process to go back and redesign the building.</p></speech>

Of course, it is not that one would not have some transitional arrangement, but if the transitional arrangement is too broad or too blunt, there is the risk of incurring greater charges at a later point in time, if at a later point in time our descendents after we are long gone are having a conversation about how to retrofit those buildings.  A commencement does not necessarily mean much work has been done.  Likewise, the fact that a building has been designed does not mean that under certain circumstances a modest amendment to that design without necessarily changing the planning permission could not be incorporated.  It just seems to be that this is the date and that is it, rather than something a little more sophisticated given that there is not just the imposition of additional costs and inconvenience to the construction at that point but, for example, for future occupants if they had to retrofit or if the State has to pay at that later stage.  Does Mr. Armstrong understand the point I am making?</p></speech>

It is a variation and a change in a contract.  It is a delay and a cost and it has schedule impact.</p> <p>  What we found in the past is that depending on the impact of the change in regulation, we can change the transition arrangement.  If it is a very significant change in regulation, especially in the non-residential sector, we found that two years might be needed if we are talking about wall thickness and the thickness of insulation in walls.  If it is a minor amendment, sometimes we reduce the transition arrangement to one year or six months.  If it is something that happens at the very end, sometimes it can be shorter than that.  We adjust the transition arrangements depending on the impact of the regulation.  The only point we made when we suggested that amendment is that there must be some provision for a transition arrangement, and that is not in the directive at present.  If it is not provided for in the directive, it will lead to severe and major contractual problems.  It has been done previously so I believe it needs to be provided now.</p> <p>  Regarding MEPS, the point there is where feasible.

Some 25% of households in Dublin are renters and 20% of households across the State are renters.  There is a heavy concentration of lower income families with poor BER ratings and higher energy poverty.  I am not arguing that we do anything that reduces rental supply because our private rental sector is currently shrinking, but in many of these debates it appears to be the one area where it is going to be the most difficult to bring those buildings up to standard.  I am approaching this with all the caution with which Mr. Armstrong is approaching it.  I just wonder if his concern there could also be orientated towards what else we could do to encourage, incentivise or ensure that they are brought up to those minimum standards rather than excluding them for fear that it might lead to a loss of rental supply, which appears to be the implication of the wording of his document.</p></speech>

Our first question is: has the EU Commission, in drafting this directive, considered the impact of minimum BERs on the supply of housing and is it suggesting any supports to address that?  That was our question to the Commission.  However, nationally, we intend to do a study on this to understand the impact, what types of dwellings will be impacted, what is the cost and what is the profile of the occupants of those dwellings.  We are developing that study and we want to do that analysis.  Then it is about implementation and implementing it in the most effective and just way, taking account of the just transition.  We have put the question to the Commission, but we will do a study on that at national level as well.</p></speech>

It was not Mr. Armstrong, but there were some that the other witnesses did not get to answer.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point on the narrative in the public domain, that people will have to move out of the house for the deep retrofit.  That might refer back to the pilot scheme from the previous Government, which was very generous in terms of the amount of money that was available.  People did root-and-branch work.  It was more than retrofit.  I saw houses with the roof taken off and floors dug up and so forth.  It led to an impression that this work had to be done to carry out a deep retrofit.  That is not the case and I believe you are correct, Chairman, that we need to get that message out.</p> <p>  I do not know how much time we have but I would like to hear more about the national building renovation plan which Mr. Deegan mentioned in his opening statement.  It sounds very interesting.  I do not know much about it but perhaps he could talk about it for a minute or two.</p> <p>  Deputy Higgins got away with talking about electric vehicles, so perhaps I could talk about cycling.  When building new buildings, part of the life cycle analysis is how one gets to and from the buildings.  As much as possible, especially in line with our objectives of compact growth, we should be encouraging people to engage in active travel and walk and cycle.  One of the weaknesses in our housing development is that we are not putting in good quality cycling facilities.  Often, there are the very basic Sheffield stands in the basement of an apartment building.  There is a far higher standard.  We should be looking towards a secure and sheltered standard.  Across all social housing, every new social home should have very good cycle facilities to encourage the occupants to choose cycling over driving if they can.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Hughes about the harmonisation.  He said an A-rated building will still be an A-rated building, but will a C-rated building still be a C-rated building?  If I heard him correctly, the most energy efficient building in the new recast BER is still going to be as energy efficient, but as one goes down the bands, there will probably be a mismatch so what is now rated C might become perhaps a B or a D.  Could he address that?  People will be interested to know.  If they think they have a B-rated home now and under the new system it might become a C, they might be disappointed, but we should be very clear about it.  Is it correct that the whole life cycle emissions will be on the BER?  Perhaps he will address that too.</p></speech>

The existing directive has a requirement for the long-term renovation strategy which includes an overview of the national building stock, policies and actions to stimulate cost-effective deep renovation and a range of other areas.  It is very prescriptive in terms of what must be included.  That sets a very high level for non-residential and residential buildings and how we are going to achieve our targets for 2030, 2040 and 2050.  The proposal in the new directive is that the first plan would be submitted by the middle of 2024.</p><p>Our last long-term renovation strategy was published in September 2020.  As I said, that was a high-level document.  The national retrofit plan makes that far more granular and translates it into time-bound action steps we need to take to meet the targets set out in the long-term renovation strategy.  The national retrofit plan is therefore a slightly more operational version of the long-term renovation strategy.  In principle, we see no difficulties with the new proposals in that regard.</p></speech>

There is a national sustainable mobility policy led by the Department of Transport.  The Department has worked closely with our Department in developing that strategy and has set out actions to promote walking and cycling.  The Department of Transport is supportive of all the provisions for additional bicycle parking in the EPBD, but the EPBD is at a building level rather than an area level.  The Departments of Transport and Housing, Local Government and Heritage support the provision of bicycle parking spaces in buildings.  I think the design of areas and of developments is part of planning policy and the national sustainable mobility policy.  I know that it is part of the objectives but I would have to come back to the Deputy with the detail of that from our planning side.</p> <p>  He mentioned one thing about the disclosures.  The directive states, "Member states shall ensure that the life-cycle Global Warming Potential ... is ... disclosed through the energy performance certificate of the building."  That is the provision in the draft directive.</p> <p>  I will let Mr. Hughes take the question about the impact on skills.</p></speech>

There is a piece of work to be done on mapping where the current energy rating scales would migrate to, from A1 and A2 all the way through to G, in the harmonised scale from 2025, that is, where an A1 rating would sit on the new scale.  That is a piece of work the SEAI will need to do, informed by what a zero-emissions building will be.  It will be A-rated on the harmonised scale.  There is also the mapping of the G-rated buildings, that is, the 15% poorest performing buildings.  They will need to be G-rated on the new scale.  There is a piece of work for the SEAI to do in that regard.</p> <p>  To add to Mr. Armstrong's comments on the life cycle, there is a piece of work under way by the European Commission on the carbon emissions associated with a building.  It has commissioned a detailed study, which is running at the moment and due to be completed in March of next year.  That is a roadmap for carbon emissions reductions across the building stock and various trajectories or actions that might be taken.  That will help inform how we calculate and display embodied carbon when that calculation methodology becomes available to us and where that information will be positioned, whether in the certificate itself or in related documents that accompany the BER certificate and advisory report.</p></speech>

That is provided for in the directive.  From a building regulations compliance perspective, it may be difficult to take account of that in energy performance because it depends on whether every house has an electric vehicle and whether it continues to have one.  Building regulations are usually based on what is physically built into the house, so that would be a challenge.  I am not saying it could not be done, but that would be the challenge with it.  What is maybe more relevant - and this is about information and communicating information - is that the directive also provides for a smart buildings indicator.  That is an indicator of how well-connected a dwelling is to its energy sources and how well it manages its energy sources.  There is a provision in the directive that a smart buildings indicator will be produced.  The idea of a battery source that can either provide transport or support one's house will definitely be taken into account in the smart buildings indicator.  That is also provided for in the directive.</p></speech>

We will probably look back at the recording of this meeting and say, "Of course, everybody is doing vehicle-to-grid now", but that might be in five, six or ten years.  It brings me back to the matter of the construction capacity we have and the number of people we have to do this work.  I am aware that the apprenticeship numbers are increasing.  What kinds of apprenticeships are we looking at?  Do they include electrical apprenticeships?  Are we looking across the range or are there certain apprenticeships we really need to focus on, whether carpentry, blocklaying or plastering, whereas electricians and plumbers-----</p></speech>

The expert group on future skills needs published a report last year identifying what the skills needs would be to support Housing for All.  It did a report on low carbon as well, but there is obviously a lot of crossover between new-build construction and retrofitting.  As for new builds, Housing for All identified that there are currently 40,000 construction workers working directly on housing, that to deliver 33,000 dwellings per year we would need 67,500 construction workers and that, by 2030, since the numbers ramp up and it is an average of 33,000 units per year, we would need 80,000 construction workers.  Then the expert group did a breakdown of that by trade and it was found to be across all trades: electricians, plumbers, plasterers, blocklayers and general operatives.  All trades needed, if not exactly to double, to increase their numbers more or less twofold.</p></speech>

There is the industry capability group, led by the Secretary General of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  That Department is focused on increasing the workforce and it is working with SOLAS.  There have been significant increases in the number of apprentices coming through the construction trades recently.  They are increasing their capacity.  They are doing awareness campaigns and working very closely with the Department of Social Protection to encourage people to work in the construction sector.  There is an industry engagement group called the construction skills sector recruitment group.  It is a collaboration between the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, SOLAS and the construction industry.  It aims not just to encourage recruitment but also to encourage young people to work in the sector and to improve gender balance and diversity.  Quite a lot of work is being done in that area.</p></speech>

Because of the target we have of 500,000 houses and more, the work will be where people live.  People will not necessarily have to travel that far for it if we are to eventually reach that target, which is encouraging.</p> <p>  I had a brief discussion with somebody the other day about heat pumps and that person asked me about storage heaters.  Are storage heaters completely gone and are they a technology of the past?  We will use electricity to power heat pumps as we scale up renewable electricity and reduce the emissions from electricity generation.  Are storage heaters of any benefit as a future source of heating a house?</p></speech>

As the grid decarbonises, they will probably come back into favour and be more favourable than, say, a boiler.  The performance of a storage heater is only about 100% efficient while the performance of a heat pump is three times that.  Heat pumps would still be more efficient than storage heaters.  That is not to say storage heaters will not have a future.  If the grid decarbonises, they may be an option for certain applications.</p></speech>

A storage heater will not deliver that.  A renewable energy system is needed in the house.  A heat pump gives that because it reclaims ambient heat and you get the renewable energy contribution in that way.  You do not get that from a storage heater by itself in the home.</p></speech>

Thanks for that.</p> <p>  There seems to be a focus on fabric first.  That seems to be the way we target the retrofitting of a home, with the wrap and the insulation.  Do we run the risk that, if we focus everything on fabric first and everyone is working on that, when we then try to fit heat pumps we have capacity pressures in doing that?  Is it possible to fit heat pumps to a home that has not had a full insulation wrap done, with the view to eventually coming back to do the insulation wrap?</p></speech>

The SEAI launched in February a heat study, with which the Chairman is probably familiar.  It looked at how we decarbonise our heating.  There was a strong focus in that on where in the continuum of fabric the heat pump should be inserted.  Much work has been done on that.  The heat study is looking at the potential opportunity from a decarbonisation perspective to put in the heat pump earlier in the process.  The SEAI has just launched the heat loss indicator, HLI, pilot scheme to look at that in practice.  We have a powerful heat study and are asking how that translates into practice on the ground.  One of the questions around the HLI will be as to where the heat pump goes in and whether it can be put in earlier.  A concern is that putting a heat pump in a home that is not adequately insulated can drive up costs.  There is a carbonisation piece and a social piece.  The heat study identified that as something we need to look at.</p></speech>

A problem with that report is it is based on the HNDA target of 33,000 on average per year.  I know Mr. Armstrong will not comment on this but I will make the point anyway for the record.  When we get to the other side of the census, get all the new inputted census data and revise the HNDA, we will see that the level of need is much higher.  The Department will not comment on that until we get the data.  There is also a strong case to say the existing data, and therefore the figure of 33,000, underestimates the number of social and affordable homes needed.  We will need far more than an average of 33,000 between now and 2026, let alone beyond that.</p> <p>  The other problem relates to a question I asked earlier, so I will come back to both Departments.  We are still talking about building houses in a traditional way and will not meet our emissions reduction targets if we continue to do that.  It is not possible.  Other countries, including in Scandinavia, as well as Britain, Poland and France, are way ahead of us in embracing the new building technologies that are low-, or in many cases, zero-carbon.  They do not use as much brick, cement, concrete or steel as we still use.  We have been told about the work of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the innovation subgroup of the construction sector working group.  I am not asking the witnesses to repeat that for the committee.  We are also aware of the work of Enterprise Ireland and others.</p> <p>  I am interested to hear from both Departments in advance of the setting of the sectoral targets, particularly the sectoral target most relevant to the work of this committee and its focus on residential housing output.  What work is ongoing in both Departments to assist the public and private sectors involved in residential development to reorientate away from the traditional, labour-intensive, inefficient and carbon-intensive building technologies to the new building technologies that we know they are and that been used?  We have been talking about doing it since Rebuilding Ireland was published in 2016.  Some companies in the country are developing this technology but on a limited scale.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses answer in simple terms for those of us trying to get our heads around how this new sectoral target will work?  Our committee has a role to play in supporting, promoting and advocating for it.  What preparation are both Departments doing to assist public and private sector housing providers to start making that transition to those newer technologies?  Deputy Leddin picked up the point and Mr. Armstrong deftly and diplomatically sidestepped it, but are we looking at changing planning regulations so that the demolition of a building has to be justified rather than it being taken as read?  Are we looking at the phasing out of high-carbon concrete or cement, given that we have the technologies to produce low-carbon cement and concrete in the country at almost the same cost?  Are we looking at changing building regulations in terms of the cap on 10 m for timber product residential developments subject to further strengthening of fire safety regulations?  What is happening in the two Departments to push that stuff along in the areas they are responsible for?  Without that, the public and private sectors, in terms of delivery mechanisms for housing, will continue building with improved energy efficiency systems but the embodied carbon will be at the same level it currently is.  What good news have the witnesses for the committee on their preparations to help the sector meet its targets on the other side of this year and next?</p></speech>

We know the built environment is responsible for approximately 30% of emissions, 10% of which is embodied carbon.  That Irish Green Building Council research is important because it shows if all the good work people here and elsewhere are doing continues to be done in terms of energy efficiency, then the carbon emissions from our energy systems and operational carbon will fall dramatically.  Meanwhile, the embodied carbon will keep going up.  That is just housing, schools, roads and hospitals.</p> <p>  It would worry me if the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's primary focus on this issue is operational.  It should be equally shared across both.  While the operational is the larger component now in the built environment, it will not be like that in five years.  Does Mr. Armstrong see the concern I have?</p></speech>

Embodied carbon is approximately 10% of emissions internationally.  When I referred to our sectoral challenges, I was talking about what is assigned under Climate Action Plan 2021.  Embodied carbon is also committed to in that plan.  Research work is being done by SEAI and pilot projects are committed to by the OPW but there is a substantive area of development in the plan</p><p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is committed to lead a task force to reduce the embodied energy in construction materials.  There is a work programme set out in the 2021 climate action plan.  It focuses on standards, construction products regulation and establishing frameworks to measure embodied carbon in buildings.  A critical path item with regard to the implementation of measuring embodied carbon in buildings is the review of the construction products regulation because that will set the standard for measuring the environmental performance of construction products.  To measure the volume of embodied carbon in a building, we need to know what the embodied carbon of each construction product that has gone into that building is and to know the embodied carbon, we need a certificate.  The rules for calculating that carbon will be defined by the construction products regulation.  A draft regulation was published for review recently.  There is a horizontal working group looking to define-----</p></speech>

I have to go through the timeline because the Deputy asked what we are doing and I must explain.  The regulation was being published and the horizontal working group is working to define the standards.  The schedule for the group to define the standards for measuring the embodied carbon is quarter 2.  In parallel with that, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is leading a task force made up of the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Environment, Climate and Communications along with SEAI.  It is identifying the standards that need to be updated.  A framework must then be put in place.  SEAI has been assigned lead responsibility for the development of that framework but it is already developed at European level.  What we need are these environmental certifications, which the Commission has committed to developing the standards for.  In its most recent proposal, the Commission also proposed that an EU database be established.  It is important that we work in parallel with the Commission.  If we decide to adopt certificates that are not in line with the construction products regulation, we will be asking industry to certify to a standard that is not necessarily the European standard and will develop a lot of certificates and build a very sophisticated system on a foundation that is not the foundation we need in a year's time.  It is a complicated area.  The EU is a critical path item but there is a task force working on it.  It is meeting this evening and we would probably have been at that meeting working on it today but-----</p></speech>

The issue is that once all that is in place, a separate piece of work must be done then in potentially changing our building and fire safety regulations and planning codes as well as introducing various incentives in procurement or the Department's four-stage approval process to make sure people use the lowest possible carbon building to produce their homes.  I know the departmental officials are overworked and are working on a lot of things but given we know there is a timeline and that some of it is not under our control because it is happening at European level, in parallel the other relevant section of the Department could ask what we are going to do with those standards when we have them.  We could start doing working through some of the preparatory work to ensure that once the standards are agreed, we do not then spend another year or two years breaking the back of the witnesses from the Department working out all sorts of detailed technical regulations.  We are behind the curve on this in terms of where residential construction is happening.  Does Mr. Armstrong recognise the question I am asking?</p></speech>

As soon as those certificates become available, we will have developed the framework and tools to take that data and develop these global warming potential declarations that will be required by the directive.  It is happening in parallel.  We are not doing this sequentially.</p></speech>

We know the development cycle, particularly for large residential developments, is five to seven years from when a site is acquired, planning permission is sought, go to tender, procurement, etc.  With each year or six-month period that passes, seven years of a development cycle of individual projects is lost.  Is Mr. Armstrong saying that in parallel with developing the certification and standards, the Department is also looking at how we operationalise those standards and certification frameworks in the planning code, building control and fire safety?  It is a really obvious one.  We can see how other jurisdictions are using really high-quality zero-carbon off-site manufactured timber products that are of the highest energy efficiency and meet the highest fire safety standards and are approximately &euro;1,000 cheaper per square metre in the delivery of good-quality apartment developments.  We cannot use those here even though that technology is available because we cannot go over 10 m.  Clearly, if we are going over 10 m with new types of building technology, we must make sure our building control and fire safety control are robust so they can certify those.  Is Mr. Armstrong saying those type of discussions are already happening or will all that only start happening once those frameworks are in place?</p></speech>

A task force is working on that.  The initial meetings are starting.  There is a European framework known as Level(s) and we expect that we would use that framework.  When the data is available from the Commission process, that will feed into that.  That process is happening.</p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question is about specific technologies-----</p></speech>

I accept and understand the argument that we must have an agreed methodology for calculating the volume of carbon in any particular building product.  The reason we want to do that is then we will know that a certain product has lower carbon than another product.  The next bit of work involves deciding how we make sure everybody uses this product.  I do not care which product it is.  For example, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and I met with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently and discussed public procurement.  I said that if they were agreeing their procurement rules for contractors delivering social housing, for example, once those frameworks Mr. Armstrong is talking about are agreed, we want to ensure that if I am putting in a tender for building 500 local authority homes and am using the lowest possible carbon building materials, I get an advantage in the tendering process because we want to ensure we are incentivising the lowest carbon building in public housing.  I do not mean to be in any way harsh on Mr. Armstrong but along with that timeline that he rightly outlined must take place to agree those methodologies, certifications and frameworks, is the Department in parallel preparing to ensure that when all this is in place, that stuff is the stuff that gets used so that the social homes that are built in two years are near zero-carbon social homes?  How we do ensure we do not just put PVA on them but that the embodied carbon is as low as possible because we know the building technologies are there and the certifications will be in?</p><p>That is really to do with the planning, building control and fire safety sections in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

Once the framework is in place, it creates a recognised methodology to compare different materials.  Once it is established as a Government methodology, that is available to the procurement or specification process to use and to specify performances.</p></speech>

There is nothing to say that once that methodology is in place, the planning system could not be revised to privilege certain types of building materials.  I do not mean individual building products but products that have a certain embodied carbon level.  There is no reason that could not be done.  We do not do it currently.</p></speech>

This is the way it has happened in Denmark and some other member states.  Initially, public sector buildings declare their embodied carbon performance.  Then there will be some capacity building.  It would possibly be required for public sector projects.  Eventually, performance requirements would be introduced that buildings would have to achieve.  One has to have the methodology and a project database and build the capacity in the system.  Designers need to know how to use these tools.  All manufacturers must have certificates for their products.  That capacity has to be developed through voluntary certificates and procurement processes and then through regulatory disclosures and regulatory performance requirements.</p></speech>

We were discussing last night, even at the planning stage, having to look at the carbon impact of what is constructed.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin covered many of the questions I was going to ask.  That definitely incentivises technological advancements as well.  The methodology Deputy &Oacute; Broin was talking about of off-site construction has other advantages aside from the lack of waste.  One gets perfect fitting, draft-proof buildings out of it.  It is indoor work for many people.  It is a hell of a lot easier than working on site.</p></speech>

We developed the BER methodology which we then used to set the performance requirements for buildings.  We then advanced the performance requirements for buildings.  As we advanced the performance requirements for buildings, we saw the technologies change.  The walls got wider, we went to triple glazing, we improved our ventilation system and we introduced different types of renewables.  However, we have to have the performance methodology.</p></speech>

Those homes will contribute significantly to emissions outputs.  This is in no way to show a criticism of anything Mr. Armstrong has said and the information he gives to committee is always very helpful to us, but there is an opportunity now to do this as expeditiously as possible without in any way compromising the quality of the standards.  There is a frustration out there because, as far back as 2016, Government policy had indicated it wanted to start doing this.  We have been talking about modern methods of construction and modular development in terms of Government policy for quite a long time but we are still building homes with almost the same level of embodied carbon as we were five years ago.  From everything Mr. Armstrong has said, none of which I am criticising, my concern is that we could be here, if we are all still lucky enough to be elected, in 2026, at the end of this phase of the Government's housing plan, without a wild lot having changed in terms of how we construct and the materials we use for the overwhelming majority of residential units built in the State.  That is my worry.</p></speech>

One of the challenges to the building industry will be that some of the companies and developers who are wedded to the old ways will either have to get with the programme or be displaced by new emerging companies.  If we leave it to industry, we know what will happen.</p></speech>

Despite the good work that has been done in retrofitting over the past decade or longer, we are heading into an era now of very high ambition in terms of that 500,000 homes target.  The energy grant scheme that has been introduced sends a very strong signal out to the industry and the supply chains that this is where we will go in the next decade and further.  Will the scaling up and the settling in of this plan improve the speed at which we retrofit, the number of people who go into it and the costs associated with it?  Does Mr. Armstrong expect that to be the trajectory of this?  Does Mr. Deegan want to take that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Deegan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022042800002#Q03200"><p>I can take that and Dr. Byrne might come in afterwards.  Part of what we are doing with the retrofit plan is stimulating innovation.  Schemes such as the community energy grant scheme have innovation as their objective.  That scheme and the national home energy upgrade scheme facilitate aggregation and bringing projects together.  Whole-street and whole-area retrofits were alluded to earlier, of which we would like to see and encourage much more.</p><p> There is also is the opportunity for off-site manufacture in the area of retrofit as well as in new build.  This is used in other countries and we would like to see it here.  We would really like to see the level of certainty and ambition that the Government has now given stimulating home-grown industries to create more jobs, not just in the delivery of house-to-house retrofits but also in the technology.  We are seeing that with some of the heating technology manufacturers.  They have seen the signals that have been given and are switching from fossil fuel-based technology heating systems to renewable ones.</p><p> As scale builds up, that will also help with cost.  It is likely that it will just counteract the extreme inflation we are seeing in the market that is in many ways driven by external rather than internal factors.  As more people become qualified and expertise increases, specialisation begins.  There was a discussion earlier about the expert group on future skills needs for the new-build sector.  That touched on the retrofit sector but another full report was done on retrofit.  Skills for Zero Carbon, as the report is titled, provided a skill set-by-skill set consideration for each type of person and quantified these.  The report has gone to SOLAS and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  They are now working to ensure that, as we increase the ramp rates in activity, there is a match between the skills requirements and the people who can actually deliver that activity.</p><p> While there is a great deal of focus on apprenticeships, including new ones, which will be absolutely crucial, we cannot rely on these alone because it will take four years for those going into apprenticeships now to become fully qualified.  It is about reskilling existing plumbers to enable them to convert to installing heat pumps.  We need reskilling and retraining of people in that area.  Much like for the new construction sector, it is across the board for the apprenticeship and skills types.  The Skills for Zero Carbon report published in November of last year goes into considerable on this.  That is a crucial first point.</p><p> With regard to the retrofit plan, the four pillars are financing and funding, skills, driving demand and, to a lesser extent, governance.  These pillars must go in parallel because we pouring lots of money into a broken system that does not have enough people to deliver it will simply increase the price.  If there is not enough demand, we will be training up a large number of people who will end up just sitting there.  Demand, supply and finance must all run in parallel.</p><p> We also need to do this very urgently because our targets for 2030 and beyond are so ambitious.  That is why the comprehensive and coherent approach we are taking with the retrofit plan takes those issues in hand and systematically addresses of them, one by one.  That is for this year and it is not the answer to all of the questions, as we would be the first to say.  No other country in the world, that we have found at any rate, has the same level of ambition.  Others will probably follow us but retrofitting 30% of the housing stock to the level we are talking about is certainly among the most ambitious target of any country in the world.  </p><p> We will need to continue to evaluate our approach, measure performance, adapt and see what the new barriers are.  As we address the previous barriers, we will address the new ones as we identify them, in consultation with stakeholders and the sector.</p></speech>

I will make a couple points, some of which the Chairman touched on.  We are talking about retrofit but in any market that one plays in, once the sector sees that there is a market that is stable and growing, people tend to participate in it.</p> <p>  On the retrofit side, we have given clear market signals right out to 2030 - we have really signalled, to a large extent, right out to 2050 - in respect of what we are going to do.  When we hit the target in 2030 we will not stop because we will have the other two thirds to complete by 2050.  As such, we will be at this for some time.  As well as giving market signals, there are also the budgets that have been allocated towards this programme.  We are, therefore, giving two very strong signals to the market for people to get involved.</p> <p>  We are seeing that in the one-stop office shop registration where we have the obvious candidates which have been involved in the sector but we have also seen quite a few companies leaning into this and saying they see something here.  Some very big companies are looking into this because they are seeing retrofit as a long-term, more stable proposition - I would not use the term "slow burner" - than some of the more cyclical parts of the housing sector.</p> <p>  The other point, which I believe the Chairman touched upon - Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue certainly did - is that wherever there are homes, there are homes to be retrofitted.  There is a great positive there for regional areas.  A large chunk of the building will not be stuck in our urban centres.  There is an opportunity for younger people to get involved in training.  Not only that but rather than finding themselves having to drive to Dublin, Cork, Galway or wherever, they will be able to have a long-term stable career in retrofitting and live in whatever part of the country they want. </p> <p>  My colleague talked about technological change.  At a general level, the rate of technological change in the building sector is no different from the rate of change across all other sectors, for example, medical diagnostics and computers.  Even today, I am seeing across various spectrums new technologies coming in from mainland Europe for retrofitting or, for example, coating odd buildings that are not normal in respect of retrofitting.  What we are doing today and what we will be doing in three or ten years' time will be quite different.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Deputies Higgins and Niamh Smyth.</p><p>Before we start, I have a few comments to make.  This committee has been tasked with examining the issues surrounding international surrogacy, in particular the rights, interests and welfare of the children born through international surrogacy, the rights, interests and welfare of surrogate mothers, the rights, interests and obligations of intending parents in future international surrogacy arrangements, and the rights, interests and obligations of intending parents of existing children who have already been born through international surrogacy.  Nobody in this room or looking in this morning online would understate the challenge of the task that we have been set as a committee.  The issue of international surrogacy is legally complex.  It is a socially complex and emotionally complex issue.  There are many strongly held views about this topic and I believe that each of us has much to learn about the issue in general.</p><p>Our task as a committee is especially challenging because we have only three months in which to complete it.  However, I believe that, as parliamentarians, we are privileged to be in a position to undertake this task and to grapple with an issue that many other countries have failed to address, but with that privilege comes a responsibility.  Not only do we have a responsibility to thoroughly examine the issue, we have a responsibility to deal with this issue in a respectful manner.  I would ask members to be mindful of the fact that many of the witnesses who we have invited in as a committee have been on very difficult and long journeys to get to this point.  I ask, therefore, that our questioning be done in a respectful way and without causing hurt.  I also ask that members treat each other with respect.  I will not stand over name-calling or religious references in the chamber.  I will also not allow, due to statutory prohibition, the discussion of matters in a public forum that arose from private meetings.  I remind members that, as Cathaoirleach, I am the sole judge of order, that is, whether it is me, as Chair, or someone acting in the role of Chair.  I thank Deputy Funchion for standing in for me last week.</p><p>Notwithstanding all of these challenges, I am confident that by working together we can produce a strong and robust set of recommendations for Government's consideration.  I believe that each of us wants to do that as I believe that each of us on this committee does not wish to see the <i>status quo</i>continue.  We have two months remaining in which to complete our report.  I look forward to working with each of the members over those two months in order to facilitate a successful completion of the report and the task we have been set.  I thank the members.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Lydia Bracken, assistant dean for equality, diversity and inclusion in the faculty of arts, humanities and social sciences of the University of Limerick, who will be joining us via Teams, and the representatives from Irish Gay Dads, Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore and Mr. Shane Lennon, whom I thank for attending.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have a note on housekeeping matters and another on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p>For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm prior to making his or her contribution that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I wish to remind everyone that masks should continue to be worn throughout the meeting by all present and should only be removed when speaking.</p><p> I invite Dr. Bracken to make her opening statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the committee for the opportunity to share my views on international surrogacy and the particular issues faced by same-sex couples who engage in this process.</p> <p>  Ireland has made progress in recent years in recognising the rights of children who are raised by LGBTQI+ parents but a number of gaps remain.  In research that I conducted with LGBT Ireland in 2021, 53% of the LGBTQI+ parent families captured by the research were not fully recognised under Irish law, which means that both parents were not recognised as legal parents.  Similarly, in more than half of the families the two parents were not recognised as joint legal guardians of their children.  The research indicates that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which regulates the area of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, embraces a variety of new and non-traditional family forms.  However, many other families fall outside of its parentage provisions.  This leads to a situation where legal recognition of family relationships in LGBTQI+ parent families is dependent on the mode of conception of the child, which is how the child was conceived, and as a result many families cannot secure full legal recognition.</p> <p>  In my research, 13% of total respondents to the survey indicated that one or more of their children were born through surrogacy.  All of these respondents were male and parenting with their male partner.  Due to the absence of surrogacy legislation, only one of the fathers was legally recognised as a parent in each family.</p> <p>  In my research, no female couple reported that they had engaged in surrogacy but it is likely that some female couples engage in this process.  Instead, in my research, DAHR was the most common pathway to parentage among female couples.  However, in only 50% of families were both of the parents legally recognised.  This was due to the fact that a number of DAHR approaches are omitted from the 2015 Act. Perhaps of most relevance to this committee is the omission of DAHR that is undertaken abroad.  If the procedure takes place outside of the State, the parentage provisions in the 2015 Act do not apply and instead parentage is allocated in the same way as any other conception.  This also occurs where the child is conceived by DAHR in an Irish fertility clinic but born outside of the State.  Other pathways that are omitted from the 2015 Act are non-clinical DAHR procedures and retrospective procedures where a known donor was used.  Given that this committee will examine the question of retrospective recognition of parentage in surrogacy, it will be important to ensure that any legislative response is consistent with the DAHR legislation.  This will require amendments to the 2015 Act because at present children born through some DAHR methods are legally disadvantaged based on their method of conception when compared with other children born through DAHR.  Also, many children of LGBTQI+ parents are legally disadvantaged when compared with the children of married opposite-sex couples.</p> <p>  In international surrogacy, the issues experienced by same-sex couples are broadly similar to those experienced by opposite-sex couples.  However, same-sex couples have more limited options in terms of where they can access international surrogacy as some foreign jurisdictions are only open to married opposite-sex couples.</p> <p>  Ireland cannot regulate surrogacy that is undertaken abroad and it cannot control the ethical or human rights framework that is adopted in another jurisdiction.  It can control the recognition or establishment of legal parentage for the purpose of Irish law.  In doing so, the key question should be whether the law and practice in the country where the surrogacy took place provides ethical safeguards that are at least equivalent to those provided in domestic law but not necessarily identical to the Irish framework. </p> <p>  There are a number of provisions of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 that are problematic in their current form and I have detailed some of the issues in my accompanying briefing document.  While some of these issues are more relevant in the context of domestic surrogacy, it is necessary to consider these as it seems likely, based on the experience of other jurisdictions, that an overly restrictive or poorly defined domestic framework for surrogacy will deter intending parents from engaging in the domestic process and instead encourage them to engage in international surrogacy.</p> <p>  To accommodate the diversity of families that exist in Ireland in 2022 there is a need to think about different ways to conceptualise family relationships.  In surrogacy, the law should avoid an overly rigid approach in its regulation of family relationships.  The must remain flexible to ensure that the best interests of the child can be assessed and secured on an individualised basis.</p></speech>

First, the organisation was created to give gay men who were interested in becoming parents, or those who are parents already, the opportunity to exchange ideas, information, experiences and build friendships.  Second, the options for Irish based gay male couples who wish to have a child through surrogacy are very limited.  Typically, our members become parents through gestational surrogacy in the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  What is life like for a gay male parent?  Personally, I do not feel that there is one difference in how we parent compared with any other family.  Like all parents, the well-being of our children is everything.  My husband, S&eacute;amus, and I literally build the plan for each day around our three children who are called Mary, Se&aacute;n and Anne.  We put their needs and wants at the centre of everything that we do.  We think of our children as the three most special people on this planet.  They are considerate, kind and vibrant little people who carry giddy smiles and have imaginations that can turn any object into the most advanced aeroplane or doll's house.</p> <p>  Socially, Ireland is a great country in which to live as a gay dad.  When S&eacute;amus and I bring our children to the local shopping centre or park people often approach us to say hello.  Our experience of such encounters has been 100% positive.  We have never encountered inappropriate questions, rude comments, labelling or stereotyping.  That is not just a Dublin thing.  I grew up along the border of Tipperary and Offaly and I will never forget the night of our first visit home following the birth of our children, Se&aacute;n and Mary.  We sat at my sister's kitchen table and we were surrounded by family, friends and neighbours, many of whom are quite elderly, and each of them with presents, knitted goods and food.  All of them were there to celebrate the arrival of our two babies.  I believe that this goodwill that we enjoy is not unique to me or my family.  Let us remember that when the constitutional convention was called to discuss the idea of giving Irish citizens an opportunity to vote on same-sex marriage, an additional vote was taken on changing the laws around parenting to equally include the children of gay and lesbian families.</p><p>Eighty-one of the 100 delegates present that day voted in support of this motion.  The Irish people are very surprised to learn, when we explain it, that the legislation families like us need has yet to be passed.</p><p> As I outlined last week, this lack of legislation affects our ability to parent and protect our children in many areas such as accessing education, welfare supports, medical treatment etc.  We have outlined these issues in detail within our written submission. Therefore, I will not revisit them today.  The above issues, however, pale into insignificance when it is considered what might happen to a child, if his or her biological and legal father were to pass away.  Can the committee members imagine being in this situation, as the surviving non-recognised parent?  You have just lost your husband and now you have to spend time focusing on how you are going to keep custody of your children.  While, of course, that thought does not guide me in my everyday life, it does sometimes come into my mind.  When that happens, I just freeze.</p><p> I would like to highlight the core elements of the surrogacy model for which Irish Gay Dads advocate.  These elements include, first, ensuring all children are treated equally in the eyes of the Irish law, regardless of the method of their conception, pregnancy or birth.  Second, we focus on prioritising the well-being of surrogate mothers. We want to ensure they are provided with access to independent medical, legal and psychological supports before making any decisions to proceed, while ensuring their bodily autonomy at all times.  Third, we want to ensure children born through surrogacy have access to information regarding their genetic and gestational origins.  Fourth, we need to ensure the intended parents are treated equally by providing pre-birth determination in relation to parental rights.  Finally, we wish the State to provide retrospective legal recognition of the children who have already born through international surrogacy.   We feel this is Ireland&rsquo;s opportunity to be a world leader, to recognise the diverse and evolving nature of modern families, and to legislate appropriately.  I ask the committee members to please use the positions they have been given to act on behalf of the parents, families and surrogates we represent and all those same-sex female couples who have thus far been omitted from the Children and Family Relationships Act.  I thank the committee members for their time.</p></speech>

It is an honour and privilege to have the opportunity to speak with the committee today on behalf of Irish Gay Dads.  I sit here with the committee today quite literally as a result of modern family planning, for I myself was born by IVF.  In fact, I was one of the first children in Ireland to be born via IVF.  Growing up, I and my brother knew how wanted we were and the struggles faced by our parents to conceive.  Our mother would routinely tell us how, in her mind, her life really only began when she had children.  After nearly ten years of failed pregnancies, miscarriages and near death, my parents welcomed me into this world.  Therefore, as we celebrate 35 years since the first treatment took place in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, marking the beginning of the creation of tens of thousands of families throughout the country, I feel it quite apt to be speaking to the committee today as we debate the need to legislate the next progressive steps in Irish family planning.</p> <p>  My husband, Carlos, and I met some 12 years ago, and from day one we discussed our desire to have a family.  In 2015, the same-sex marriage referendum created the first opportunity for our relationship to be formally recognised in Irish society and for us to be considered a family unit under Irish law.  We married in 2018, thus creating the first foundation of our family.  Since then, we have moved to create a life that could support our ambition to grow our family.  It is an innate human desire to want to have a family, to raise a child and to create a higher meaning in one&rsquo;s life.  This innate desire does not go away.  It is not selective to only some people but to us all, no matter our fertility, physical ability or sexuality.</p> <p>  Article 41 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann sets out that it is my fundamental right as an Irish citizen and as a married person to make my own decisions when undertaking matters in relation to family planning.  If marriage is the foundation to our family in our legal system, how can the same legal system not support the growth of my family?  Without legislation to enable me to create a family, I am in a dichotomy of paying to be part of an Irish society that does not allow me to reap the benefits of same.  How is it right that, in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners, I am equal, the same as my friends and neighbours, but when it comes to my fundamental right to grow my family, I am prohibited?</p> <p>  Irish relationships and families are no longer being created in the traditional chronological order of yesterday, when one would meet someone, marry, buy a home and create a family.  Men and women are meeting later in life and coupling later.  More and more women are entering the workforce and focusing on their careers, as is their right.  The new chronological order of creating a family is multifaceted.  Thus, we are only going to see an increasing number of the population looking to assisted human reproduction, AHR, solutions in creating families.  This includes international surrogacy.</p> <p>  The AHR Bill is, in my opinion, the single greatest advancement in Irish family planning since the creation of the State.  It would be a travesty not to include international surrogacy in this historic Bill.  I implore the committee to take action to make sure the vast majority of families created via surrogacy are not left behind and are not left to be second-class citizens in their own country.</p></speech>

I know how difficult it is, but it is so important for us to hear their experiences so that we can take them into account as we move forward.  I thank them for that.  I will now move on to the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chair and I thank our witnesses.  I have specific questions for each of them, so I will go into that.</p> <p>  Dr. Bracken has published extensively in this area and I am a proud owner of two of her books.  I have two points to raise with her, the first of which is the position of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, decision, particularly the one in France.  In that regard, it is an advisory opinion.  What is its standing in the Irish context?  Is it open to this committee to recommend that we ban international surrogacy because of the commercial element to it or is it open to this committee not to provide a pathway for parental recognition of the second parent?  Is a second parent in this State entitled now to take a case against Ireland on the basis of the failure to create that legal parental relationship?  Is that open to a person in this State to take that case against Ireland?  My personal contention would be that the failure to implement a framework is akin to burying our heads in the sand.</p> <p>  The second issue concerns parentage order versus guardianship.  On some of the sanctions, we have talked with Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony about a carrot-and-stick approach and trying to get people to engage in domestic surrogacy and to incentivise that, but that international surrogacy will occur.  In that, there may be implied issues or difficulties.  One of the issues that hang over us is that we would not award parentage orders in a situation where maybe all of the boxes are not ticked.  Instead, it would be mere guardianship.  However, the point of parental orders is that they are akin to adoption and so sever the obligations and duties on the person who gave birth as surrogate mother in these instances.  Therefore, if we merely employ guardianship, then we have the difficulty that she remains with all of those obligations in Irish law.  Does Dr. Bracken have any suggestions or thoughts of what would be a sanction or a penalisation on that?</p> <p>  Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon are very welcome.  I am very grateful for their extremely valuable experience and their sharing with us the failure of the Legislature.</p><p>It would be shameful if we continued to fail families formed via surrogacy.</p><p> A significant point from Mr. Kenny Moore last week and Mr. Lennon today comes from their sharing of the fact that when gay couples meet, they have the same conversations as everybody else about whether they will have children together.  I am not sure that everybody considers how that innate desire to have a child is not dependent on sexuality or gender but it is about wanting to nurture.  It is something in the human spirit that wants to do that.</p><p> Last week, Mr. Kenny Moore spoke extensively about the pre-pregnancy position and depths into which the Canadian system goes.  This relates to the due diligence and high standards employed and the submission is extensive.  Point No. 4 goes into evaluating destinations, providers, clinics and agencies and ensuring consent, so perhaps he could elaborate on that.  I will hold off on other questions until the second round.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  She asked about the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR.  The case law from the European Court of Human Rights is primarily Mennesson <i>v</i>. France, which essentially established that where there is a genetic relationship between an intending father and the child and where that father is also listed on the foreign birth certificate as the legal father, an obligation arises to legally recognise that relationship on the basis that it would be a violation of the child's right to private life if it was not recognised within domestic law.  That kind of set the initial standard for what types of relationships need to be recognised.<br/><br/>It was followed in 2019 by an advisory opinion on gestational surrogacy, which again was issued to France in a case concerning the same Mennesson family.  Although the father was recognised in the case, the intended mother had not been recognised initially at least.  The question was whether that relationship also needed to be recognised.  The advisory opinion set out that in order to vindicate the rights of the children, the relationship between the children and the intending mother, where she is listed on the birth certificate in a position where she is married to the intending father, who has already been recognised for the purpose of domestic law, another duty of recognition arises based on consideration of the rights of the child.<br/><br/>The status of the advisory opinion is that it is not binding and it is an optional mechanism that states can enter into in getting guidance and advice in how the ECHR case law might operate.  However, I have published on this and given the opinion that it establishes the standards that the court would adhere to.  If a case was to be brought against Ireland on this matter, it is quite likely, based on the standards set in the advisory opinion, that we would be found lacking because we do not currently have a mechanism that would recognise the relationship between an intending mother and the child in the way the advisory opinion requires us to do.  Something like guardianship does not meet the standard because it is not a permanent relationship and it does not have the same status as that of legal parentage.  On the question of whether we could ever prohibit surrogacy, we could not do that based on the jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights because we have the obligation to recognise certain parent-child relationships in order to vindicate the rights of children.  I hope that answers the question on ECHR case law.<br/><br/>The Senator mentioned parental orders and guardianship and referred to &quot;sanctions&quot;.  It is probably not the most accurate description of what it would be.  It would essentially be the fallback position if parentage cannot be recognised for whatever reason.  In the proposal I have put forward in the briefing document provided to the committee, I have suggested that we should ultimately get to a position whereby parentage established on a foreign birth certificate would be recognised in Ireland, whether it is by way of a parental order being recognised or some other, possibly administrative, mechanism to recognise that parentage unless it is fundamentally contrary to Irish public policy.  When we are determining what public policy means in the context of surrogacy, we need to establish an ethical framework for surrogacy within Ireland and we would determine any cases by reference to that or if it would be in the best interests of the child to deny that recognition.<br/><br/>If parentage cannot be established for whatever reason, we must put in place a mechanism that does not penalise the child.  Allowing guardianship to be awarded at least accommodates the child's rights in that regard.  Based on ECHR case law, a genetic relationship would need to be recognised regardless of whether the procedure falls outside the agreed ethical framework.  We must consider the child's rights in that regard.  Ultimately, in a particular case the decision must come down to what is in the best interests of the child and whether guardianship or parentage would be most suitable in that regard.  That is what I see as the kind of fallback position.  It really takes a case-by-case or individualised approach to ensure the best interests of each individual child are being maintained within the process.  I hope that answers the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about evaluating a destination and as a gay man, there are not many destinations available to me.  The United Kingdom is one and there is also the United States of America and Canada.  I have chosen to look at Canada for several reasons.  I wanted to align to the guidelines issued by the Department of Justice to people undertaking international surrogacy.  I am also considering the welfare of a surrogate mother, ourselves and the child who will be created.  It is important to understand all those elements.  There are also legal entities available there.  In the Canadian example, every step of the process is legalised and managed by registered third parties, whether they are IVF clinics or agency staff taking care of surrogate mothers.  The rights of everyone are very clearly stated from beginning to the end.  It is why we are talking to the committee today because that is what everyone wants.  Nobody wants to work in a grey space and the easiest way for us to have a child is still very complicated.  Normal people are doing this.  They do not have legal minds or backgrounds and they may not have a medical background.  They just want to be a parent.</p> <p>  One of the main aspects I have considered is ensuring the surrogate mother has, I suppose, means to live outside any reimbursement made to her.  The whole process should be welfare-focused and everybody should be taken care of, getting independent legal and psychological advice, with emotional support available throughout.  That is the only way I would feel comfortable about doing anything.  It is about protecting the surrogate mother, who is giving an enormous gift in doing what she does.  The reward is never financial for anyone.  A surrogate mother might do this because she knows people who have gone through IVF or fertility issues.  Her heart is in the right place for doing it.</p> <p>  These are some of the key pieces.  It is helpful for the surrogate mothers to know that because of the surrounding legislation, they would not be obliged to have any kind of legal relationship with the child.  They do not want to have that.  The intending parents, which are me and my husband in my case, want that obligation and legal process in place for us.  We want to be legally recognised, having both that gift and the obligation.  We do this knowing that when we return to Ireland, we have worked to some framework that we can present to the courts.</p><p>Does Senator Seery Kearney want Mr. Kenny Moore to come in on that?</p></speech>

We had met with Mr. Kenny Moore.  We have all seen that getting proper legislation and a proper framework for everybody is very important.  I have listened to their stories.  They are hard because families are affected by this.  Having read the stories of Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon, I feel we need to get this legislation done as soon as possible.  That is the main thing for me.  It is so important.  Every child is equal.  They go to school together and play together.  That has to be and is what we are absolutely committed to doing.</p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney is on top of her brief on this and has asked many of the questions I was going to ask.  Mr. Kenny Moore spoke about his lovely children and we spoke about birth certificates.  Travel documents have to be a huge issue.  We see how trying to get birth certificates for children at present is an absolute nightmare.  The witnesses might get back to me on that one.</p> <p>  Many of my questions about the different areas were answered.  The US, Canada and England were spoken about.  Mr. Lennon is going through surrogacy in Canada.  I wish him the best.  It is unfortunate that we do not have a proper framework and legislation here but I will give Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon my full support.  I thank them very much.</p></speech>

That must also retrospectively cover children already born.  With regard to travel documents, Mr. Lennon and I are here to represent parents who primarily access surrogacy through Canada, the United States and the UK.  As the process is covered by legislation in Canada and the United States and everybody's rights and responsibilities are clearly defined, the parents can apply on behalf of their child when it is born for a passport from those two countries.</p> <p>  A newborn child can return home from the UK on the basis of its birth certificate because of the travel arrangements between Ireland the UK.  Provided the parents carry appropriate travel documents, they can come back to Ireland with their newborn baby on the basis of the child having a birth certificate.  What happens when the child gets back here to Ireland?  That is where it gets tough because there is no legislation unlike in the three destinations I have mentioned.</p> <p>  If the parents wish to apply for an Irish passport for their child, the application will proceed on the basis of the father having a genetic link to his child and he will become the applicant.  The surrogate mother, if the application is made before the declaration of parentage has been applied for by the father in the Irish courts, will also have to sign the passport application.  That causes significant complexity.</p> <p>  As Mr. Lennon alluded to, surrogate mothers in our experience enter these agreements and arrangements with full consent.  They know exactly what they are being asked to do by the intended parents and what they wish to do for them.  They do not want to be the mother of these children or to have legal responsibility for them.  They want that to be applied to the intended parents.  When they are asked to sign passport documents, it often causes them anxiety because it suddenly seems the State is coming back to them to say they are the mothers.</p> <p>  When the application is made here for an Irish passport, it has to come from the biological dad.  If the declaration of parentage has not gone through the court system, which is often the case because it can take a long time, the surrogate mother will be required to co-sign that application.  She will be contacted by the Passport Office in order to verify that she has signed the application.  She is the second applicant.</p></speech>

She has obviously spent much of her career on this subject.  She is the author of two books.  I will ask a question about her book, <i>Same-Sex Parenting and the Best Interests Principle</i>.  Chapter 6 of this book examines the allocation of parentage in cases of surrogacy.  The chapter seeks to identify a way to regulate surrogacy that adheres to the best interests principle and balances the interests and needs of all stakeholders in the process.  It is suggested that the intention-based model of surrogacy which is facilitated through a pre-conception allocation of parenting satisfies the requirement of the best interests principle.  Will Dr. Bracken explain that to us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#E01100"><p>The Senator's question was on the pre-conception model of parentage and why I believe that is the most appropriate way forward.  Chapter 6 of the book the Senator mentioned focuses on domestic surrogacy.  I support a pre-conception allocation of parentage in the context of domestic surrogacy.  However, in the context of international surrogacy, a post-birth transfer of parentage is probably most appropriate.  I can talk about that later if that is of interest.</p> <p>  The pre-conception approach to domestic surrogacy is the best way forward because it balances the rights of everyone.  A post-birth transfer of parentage in a domestic context means that when a child is born, the intending parents do not have the legal rights and responsibilities that they need to care for the child, despite the fact that they will take physical care of the child very soon after the birth.  Instead, typically, the surrogate mother is regarded as the legal mother upon the birth of the child which means she has the rights and responsibilities for making all of the decisions for that child until the time a parental order is made.  This is the proposed way that parentage would be transferred in the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  It means that if the child needs medical treatment very soon after birth, the surrogate would probably need to consent to that rather than the intending parents.  That can place the surrogate in the very uncomfortable position of having to make this kind of legal decision on behalf of the child.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 proposed there would be a transfer of guardianship to the intending parents by way of a statutory declaration with the surrogate after the birth of the child.  That can alleviate some of those difficulties but it seems there would still be a delay in terms of the intending parents getting the legal rights and responsibilities they need to undertake the caring role.</p> <p>  It also creates difficulties for the surrogate by being regarded as the legal parent.  Perhaps it places her in a vulnerable position.</p><p>Under the 2017 general scheme, it was possible for either a surrogate or the intending parents to make the application for the parental order, which would ultimately transfer parentage to the intending parents.  Under the 2022 Bill, only the intending parents can make that application, which is unusual because in the rare situation where the intending parents fail to make the application, the surrogate seems to have no recourse other than placing the child for adoption.  For all those reasons, a model that allocates parental responsibilities based on the intentions of everyone involved, which is that the intended parents will raise the child, and having that become effective at the time the child is born balances the rights of everyone in the way I mentioned.  It ensures the child is legally integrated into their family from the moment of birth, that the intending parents have all the legal tools they need to undertake the caring role and that, at a time when they are busy caring for their newborn baby, they do not have to go back to court in order to facilitate the transfer of parentage.  In that way it balances the rights of all participants, in the domestic context at least.</p></speech>

It is important that we have a central body that can disseminate information on all aspects of AHR and take on various other obligations set out in the Bill, including licensing and so on.  The dissemination of information is important so that everyone in the country is aware of what the AHR legislation says.  It is a 136-page Bill so having accessible information from an authoritative source within the country is important.  Having a central authority would be beneficial going forward and many countries have such authorities in place.  For example, in the UK there is a Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which does important work on setting the regulations in relation to various types of fertility treatment.</p></speech>

I was touched by his statements last week.  Of all the witnesses here, I was most touched by his contribution, by the relationship he has with the surrogate mother, by the relationship he encourages with the surrogate mother and by how he agreed to allow the birth mother to be on the birth cert.  I am heartened to hear he agrees with that.  There are many roads to parenthood and, as long as children are loved, cared for and feel secure, that is all that matters.  He heard my statement last week and, unfortunately, a lot of exploitation goes on in this road to parenthood.  How can we regulate against bad actors?  We can make rules in this country but how can we protect surrogate mothers in other jurisdictions that are not covered by that legislation and where the mother is not protected by our legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#F00500"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  In relation to my comments last week on the birth cert, in our case the surrogate mother is listed on our children's birth certs.  That is because they were born on the UK where parental rights cannot be transferred until after the child is born and, therefore, the surrogate is legally obliged to be placed on the birth cert.  As a couple who had children through the UK, we could not go through the parental order process that exists there.  In order to do so, you have to be a resident, passport holder, citizen, etc. and we were none of those.  That is the primary reason the surrogate is listed on the birth cert.  Going forward, we ask members to consider that when surrogacy is the method of conception, the standard birth cert issued to the child would list the intended parents but that, if you wish to include the surrogate, it could be done through the long form of the birth cert, so the child can see clearly the method of conception and gestation.</p> <p>  I note the Senator's point about the level of exploitation.  We all agree that legislation is the way to prevent exploitation.  I dispute that it is extensive.  I do not believe that to be the case.  We in Irish Gay Dads work primarily through the United States, Canada and the UK, where the surrogacy model is extremely well established and has been in existence for over 30 years.  Natalie Gamble, a legal expert from the UK, was before this committee two weeks ago talking about the fact she has handled 1,500 cases and come across about three or four that caused issues.</p> <p>  I dispute that the level of exploitation is extensive but I will address the point on bad actors.  All of us, when we dream of having a child, want that child's birth story to be as perfect as possible.  We want every party to the agreement to be acknowledged, included and protected.  As I mentioned last week, no matter how much you regulate medicine or any sector, there will always be bad actors.  All you can do is put together a stringent framework to ensure that every party enters into the agreement freely, gives consent and gets appropriate legal support and appropriate independent medical support, and that every party, including the intended parents, the egg donor and the surrogate, gets psychological support so there is no doubt in anybody's mind about what is about to happen, how it will happen or what the process will look like.</p> <p>  There has to be, as the Senator touched on in her questions to Dr. Bracken, an oversight body that regulates all the players.  It would be the AHRA in Ireland and equivalent bodies in other locations.  Anybody who participates in a surrogacy agreement, whether a clinic, a legal person or a medical person, has to be regulated and approved by that body.  They are the safeguards.  Not legislating will increase the possibility for bad actors; legislating is the way to lock it down to the maximum extent.</p></speech>

That should be her right.  I think we are in agreement about that.  It is about protecting her interests so she understands from the beginning, before any medical or IVF process starts, that everyone is clear and understanding of the agreement that she is choosing to carry a child on behalf of a couple.  That couple will often want a lifetime relationship between that woman and the child, not as a parent or with parental responsibility but as someone significant in that child's life.  Everyone would want that.</p><p>The ethical safeguards are those regulated, independent organisations such as lawyers, State agencies and psychological counselling, and that should be done throughout.</p></speech>

Forgive me if I am doubling up on questions; I was attending another committee meeting earlier.  In her research, Dr. Bracken states that both parents were legally recognised in only 50% of the families.  She also said there were omissions from the 2015 Act.  I would like to be clear in my head that in 50% of cases both parents are recognised and in the other 50% they are not.  This sliding scale of family legal recognition is unacceptable.  Will Dr. Bracken explain to me as a layperson how 50% of the families would get that recognition and 50% did not?  The omissions in the 2015 Act mean we have legislated for differences.  How will this affect the retrospective route to parentage?  If there is time, I will contribute again.</p></speech>

In the research I undertook with LGBT Ireland last year we were looking at the structure of LGBTQI+ parent families and their routes to legal recognition.  The families that were recognised, where there were two legal parents, had gone through a route to parentage that is recognised under the 2015 Act.  Essentially, there are two main ways in which that can happen.  If a family has their child after the commencement of the Act on 4 May 2020, there is a pathway to parentage that allows for two parents - they could be the opposite sex or the same sex - to be jointly recognised as legal parents provided they have used a fertility clinic within Ireland and all of the relevant consents and declarations and so on have been given.  Provided they meet all of those criteria, on the birth of the child both of the parents are legally recognised as parents as per their preconception intention.<br/><br/>There is another primary route to parentage that recognises the retrospective parentage for children who were conceived prior to the commencement of the legislation, that is, before 4 May 2020.  There is a retrospective route available to some families if they had their child before 4 May 2020 and they meet various other criteria, one of which is where a gamete donor was used who was unknown and remains unknown to the families.  In order to get that retrospective recognition of parentage the family cannot have used a known donor.  If families meet the criteria, they can be recognised and some 50% of families were recognised.  Unfortunately, many other families fell outside of the criteria for various reasons, one of which being that they had used a known donor.  Having prioritised their child's right to identity, they cannot achieve retrospective recognition.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the legislation does not cover DAHR that is undertaken abroad, even if the child is subsequently born in Ireland, or <i>vice versa</i>.  If the parent had DAHR treatment in Ireland and the child was born in another country, that again falls outside of the recognition.  Those are the main ways in which families fall outside of the legislation.  Also, if the family did not use a fertility clinic, they would fall outside of the legislation.  That might be referred to as a non-clinical procedure or an at-home procedure.  If the family had their child through that form of DAHR, they are not covered by the legislation either.  Those are the primary omissions in respect of the legislation.</p></speech>

Dr. Bracken spoke about the incredible amalgamation of different pathways to becoming mammies and daddies.  It varies from couple to couple, country to country, person to person and case to case.  How best can the State help the witnesses, as parents, to become parents and move through the ethical surrogacy we want?  We all want the best-case scenario, as Dr. Bracken outlined, and that identity.  Parents who opt to have that identity known are almost being penalised for doing so.  Should we extend the regulatory authority to become an information service?  Is there a best-case information service in any other jurisdiction?  Is there somewhere we can look to?  What kind of information would be most beneficial for intending parents, such as the witnesses, who are on that pathway to international surrogacy?</p> <p>  I also have a general question with regard to the pathway and the lack of recognition prior to birth.  Mr. Kenny Moore told a lovely story about bringing his twins home and his family surrounding his newborn twins.  At that stage, those children had two daddies but legally they had no parents, in a way.  Practically, how did that make Mr. Kenny Moore feel?  How best can we change that, respecting the birth mother and her rights to bodily autonomy and to change her mind and the witnesses' right to be the parents they want to be in the grey area of birth and moving from the birth mother to the new parents?  I am sorry if that is all very jumbled.</p></speech>

I am very new to this.  In three weeks' time I will be starting my IVF treatment.  I understand the Senator's question was how best can the State help or support citizens in understanding.  It does not need to be very complicated in the sense that most people searching or googling information will go to sites such as Citizens Information for everything.  Right now, there is information there for people to understand.  For anyone going through this process, it does not matter if we regulate it to the nth degree.  It will always be slightly complicated, simply because there are so many parties involved.  It is not just about two people.  It is important to have a go-to source of information, whether that is the Department of Health or Citizens Information, that is very clear about what is the green pathway to surrogacy, domestically or internationally.  Perhaps the regulator should be a point of reference rather than people having to email or call it to ask these questions.  Citizens Information would be a great source for everyone to have that.  It very clearly sets out the different steps because it really is a multi-step process.  IVF is at the core of it and it was brilliant to be able to talk about this today.  The Bill will catapult family planning for all Irish people.  People will need assisted human reproduction information and assistance more and more as we move forward in life.</p><p>It would be good to have a clear framework such that a regular person could understand the steps they need to take and follow.</p><p> The Senator asked whether there was a similar model in other countries.  While my husband and I looked at the US system also, the Canadian ministry of health makes clear the requirements that need to be met and the steps one has to take through surrogacy.  It is stated in clear language that anyone could understand.</p></speech>

For context, we represent parents who have had children through three locations, namely, the United States, Canada and the UK.  In the United States and Canada, because of the presence of legislation, as soon as the child has been born the intended parents are considered the legal parents, whether they are an opposite-sex couple or a same-sex couple.  That means they have the right, within the hospital setting, to make all decisions regarding the welfare of the child, such as what postnatal checks can be done, what blood tests can be carried out and so on.</p> <p>  In the UK, the situation is the same as in Ireland.  The woman who gives birth is the legal mother and, therefore, she has to make all those decisions.  That is the experience we had, whereby our children were born in the UK.  I might talk a little about the emotional side of that and how it all feels.  For the surrogate mother in our case, and for most surrogate mothers, it is a pretty difficult stage.  They will have just given birth and will be recovering from that, they will have intended that the intended parents would be the parents of the child, and they will then be drawn into a process where they will have to make decisions about the child and how he or she will be treated in hospital.  Even if those decisions are very standard ones, such as whether a vitamin K injection can be given or whether a blood sample can be taken, it still puts the surrogate mother in a position in which she never wanted to be.  Imagine how complicated it then gets if the child has additional needs and needs to stay in hospital for a period.  Potentially, the surrogate mother, even though she might be ready to go home, would be forced to stay in the hospital to be present with the child and to meet the legal obligations.  That is not right for the surrogate mother.</p> <p>  From our perspective, having been in that situation, it deflates your bubble somewhat.  You will be on this incredible high, as anybody who has experienced the arrival of one's child will know, and now you are being sidestepped.  The nurses and doctors will be very busy and might say they cannot really talk to anyone except the surrogate mother, who can give that consent.  It does not feel good.  We knew all this in advance, having taken legal advice before we went to the UK so we knew what we were signing up for, but nonetheless, when it happens, it impacts on you and on how you feel about your position as a parent.  One of my colleagues from Irish Families Through Surrogacy mentioned at last week's meeting that she felt like a bit of an actor sometimes as a parent.  What I have described is a prime example of how you can made to feel like an actor.</p> <p>  As for what the State can do when you get back to Ireland in order to help you feel recognised, it can make the process as accessible as possible, that is, making the declaration of parentage as accessible and quick as possible and allowing for it to apply to both parents, not just the genetic one.  As Mr. Lennon mentioned, it could be that certain locations and providers would be put on a green list, and if the process looks as though it has taken place properly and there are affidavits to declare that, perhaps the process could be short-circuited to allow the declaration of parentage to be proceed much faster than it currently does.</p></speech>

My first questions are for Dr. Bracken, regarding children in Ireland who have been born through surrogacy.  She mentioned them in her document.  Will she expand on our responsibilities to them as legislators?  The issue has gone on too long.  A whole bunch of children are not recognised and that is not right, and we need to act on it.  How does she foresee that playing out?</p> <p>  I have become fixated on the issue of pre-birth, post-birth or at-birth parentage.  I will put my cards on table, as I have done since the start, and state my belief that the pre-birth model is the best one.  Dr. Bracken stated that for international surrogacy, the best of the three is post birth but did she mean at-birth?  For all the various reasons we consistently hear relating to potential medical issues and who will take responsibility for that, there are many difficulties in respect of post-birth parentage.  I think that if there were a good system that operated correctly, the pre-birth model would be the way forward.</p> <p>  I might follow up with questions for Mr. Lennon and Mr. Kenny Moore.  I greatly appreciate our guests being here and sharing their personal stories, and I wish the best of luck to Mr. Lennon on his journey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#H00400"><p>Regarding children who have already been born through surrogacy, I would strongly argue that issue needs to be prioritised in the legislation.  Many children living in Ireland have been born through surrogacy and their family relationships are not recognised at present.  They are left in the really undesirable position of not having a permanent legal relationship with both of their parents, so that absolutely needs to be addressed.  I have proposed a model similar to that in sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which allows for retrospective declarations of parentage to be made in cases of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, that were undertaken prior to the commencement of the legislation.  Something similar in the case of necessary adoptions could be used successfully in the context of children who have been born through surrogacy.  That would allow the intending parents to apply to court for this declaration of parentage to recognise either of the intending parents, or perhaps both of them, who are not at that point recognised as legal parents, provided certain proofs are given to the court.  This appears to be a relatively straightforward process in the context of DAHR, so I would argue it should also be a very simple process for surrogacy in respect of surrogacy that has already taken place.  As we have the model for it within sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of the Children and Family Relationships Act, that is the model I would propose for the retrospective recognition of parentage.</p> <p>  As for the pre-birth or post-birth recognition of parentage, I draw a distinction between domestic surrogacy, which can be facilitated through the pre-conception approach, and international surrogacy, for which a post-birth approval process makes sense, simply on the basis it would be difficult for the State to sanction in advance parentage that has been established through a procedure undertaken abroad.  That is not to say it could not happen, and perhaps an application during the pregnancy would be possible, but the post-birth transfer of parentage in international surrogacy would allow the Irish courts to check that certain ethical safeguards have been adhered to throughout the pregnancy, up to the birth of the child.  It is not a perfect system by any means, given it means that when the child has been born, for the purposes of Irish law he or she may not have that legal recognition in respect of the relationship with the intending parents.  Nevertheless, what I have proposed is that where the intending parents have both been listed on the foreign birth certificate, we might have something of a fast-track application process in Ireland, whereby they could obtain a parental order recognising both of them as legal parents, and the application would be granted unless it were fundamentally contrary to an agreed ethical framework for surrogacy within Ireland.  Having a post-birth judicial process would allow for scrutiny of the ethical standards to ensure we maintain the integrity of the ethical framework and ensure that recognition is based on it.  Moreover, it would allow for consideration of the best interests of the child in that process.  That is primarily why I believe a post-birth process in regard to the international arrangement would be the more appropriate way forward but in the case of domestic surrogacy, I would support a pre-conception transfer of parentage.</p></speech>

If we had more time, I would ask her further questions because I imagine that what she outlined would leave people in limbo in the context of medical decisions and so on post birth.  Would there be any way of going down the pre-birth route but with a guarantee that if something were to go wrong, perhaps in the first few months, that could be changed?  Unfortunately, we do not have time to go into all this but I wanted to put it out there.</p><p>A lot of complications arise if agreements are to be post-birth.  We would still be stuck in the same kind of situation we are currently in, a situation we are trying to move away from.  I will ask about the Canadian situation.  I heard Senator Seery Kearney ask about it earlier.  It was one of my questions because I have been looking into that area as well.  Mr. Kenny Moore mentioned it last week and when he came before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Does he have any additional information on that?  He also made a point about potentially having a surrogate listed on the long form birth certificate.  Does he see that as an optional process because I am conscious that many surrogates would not actually want to be on the birth certificate and do not see that role for themselves?</p></speech>

They would be able to provide far more information.  My experience of the Canadian system is as somebody who tried to have a child through the Canadian system and failed for unknown reasons.  Those solicitors will be better placed to give the Deputy more insight than I could.</p> <p>  With regard to the long form of the birth certificate, the Deputy asks a good question.  What happens in the United States and Canada is that the couple, as the intended parents and regardless of their gender, have the option to be listed on the birth certificate when the child is born.  The surrogate does not need to appear on the birth certificate.  As I have mentioned, in the UK, the surrogate must appear on the birth certificate.  She is the legal mother at the point of birth and, therefore, must be listed on the birth certificate.  We encourage our members to discuss every aspect of a surrogacy journey with their surrogate prior to commencement.  If it is required by local law that an agreement be made, that agreement should be made.  If that is not required, as is the case in the UK, we still encourage our members to make some form of agreement and to discuss with the surrogate what will happen when it comes to the issuing of a birth certificate.  Regardless of what is available in Canada and the United States, when they go there, most couples will ask the surrogate to be named on the birth certificate simply because, when they come back to Ireland, a birth certificate that lists two men as the parents will not work for Irish institutions such as the Passport Office.</p></speech>

Of course, if the option is there to include the details on the long form of the birth certificate, that should be another aspect of the discussion between the intended parents and the surrogate.  Clearly, it is better if the surrogate is willing to be a participant in that and to have her name listed on the birth certificate.  The current reason for listing a surrogate mother on a birth certificate issued in the United States or Canada is simply that it makes life easier for the parents when coming back to Ireland if it looks like a normal birth certificate.</p></speech>

My first question is for Dr. Bracken.  With regard to pre-birth and post-birth agreements, what is included?  Is it only parentage?  If it is a post-birth agreement, does that ever conflict with any health decisions that need to be made during labour if, for example, something goes wrong or if there is a threat to the woman's life?  What is actually included in a pre-birth or post-birth agreement?  Does the woman's life still have protection if something awful were to happen?  Does the agreement affect that in any way, shape or form?</p> <p>  Obviously, the pathway to parentage is the preferred option but have there ever been other mechanisms in law used to give temporary rights with regard to consent for medical care?  The first thing that comes to mind would be care orders, although that would be an overreach.  Have any other mechanisms within the law been explored in the interim while the parental orders are being assessed to deal with that two-year wait before giving the other intended parents the right to consent in respect of education, medical care or passports?  Those are my two questions for Dr. Bracken.  I will then come to Mr. Lennon and Mr. Kenny Moore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#J00600"><p>I thank the Senator for her question.  On the different protections under a pre-conception or post-birth model, that is really a question for the Irish Legislature to decide.  If it decides to adopt a pre-conception approach, we can decide what the ethical standards within that approach will be.  Similarly, we can decide the standards that would apply under a post-birth approach.  If you look around the world, you will see that different standards apply under different systems, depending on the choices that have been made.  However, under a pre-conception model, the same ethical standards would apply as would apply under a post-birth model.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, as currently drafted, is very clear that the surrogate always retains bodily integrity throughout the pregnancy and makes the choices during the pregnancy.  Regardless of whether a pre-conception or post-conception approach is adopted, that would remain.  It is up to the Legislature to decide what the ethical safeguards are.</p> <p>  With regard to other measures that might be taken, as I mentioned a moment ago there is a proposal in the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill that guardianship could be granted to the intending parents at some point after the birth of the child by way of a statutory agreement with the surrogate, although I should say that is within the domestic surrogacy model.  As written, it seems that would be possible before a parental order is issued in the case of surrogacy.  There would therefore be some decision-making capacity.  There is a difficulty in that there would necessarily be a time lag before guardianship could transferred through the statutory declaration with the surrogate, which does not address the vulnerability issue we would be concerned about when the child is born.  That is certainly something that is proposed within the Bill.</p></speech>

I do not know if there has been an instance of this in Ireland yet or if we are speaking hypothetically, but what would that situation mean for a child?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#J00800"><p>I thank Senator Ruane for her question.  Let me explain how I understand that situation would work legally from my perspective as a non-legal person.  When the child returns to the State, whether the parents are a same-sex couple or an opposite-sex couple, the child does not really have any legal parent here in the State because the State recognises the surrogate mother as the automatic legal parent at the birth of the child.  The biological dad is not automatically recognised by the State at the point of birth.  He must therefore make an application for a declaration of parentage to establish his rights as a legal parent.  Assuming that application is successful and he becomes a parent, as we discussed last week, the other parent, whether a female or a male, is nobody in the child's life for the first two years.  He or she must apply for guardianship.</p> <p>  To touch on the Senator's question as to what happens if something were to happen to the legal father, who is now resident in the State, and if he were to die, the situation would be that the child would then be in the State being cared for by a guardian but the child would still have a legal parent, that is, the surrogate mother, who is living somewhere else.  We do not yet know how the State would react in that situation.  The rights of the legal parent, the surrogate mother, could potentially trump the rights of the guardian.  Has there been a case of this nature?  There was a case before the courts a number of months ago in which a legal father who had a child with his partner through surrogacy made an application because he had a terminal illness.  The guardianship application could not proceed because the child had not yet reached the age of two.  The case centred around establishing the right of the intended mother to apply for guardianship early and discussing what would happen to the child.  I do not know whether a ruling has been delivered in that case.  If the legal parent dies, the family is in a really precarious position because the child is now being cared for by a guardian but there is somebody outside the State who has higher authority, that is, the legal mother.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests.  It was wonderful to hear from all of them and their opening statements were good and insightful.  Like my colleagues I wish Shane and Carlos the very best over the coming weeks and months as they begin their journey.  As everyone will attest it is a nerve-wracking road to parenthood so I wish them the best of luck over the coming months.</p> <p>  Beginning with Dr. Bracken, I wish to go back to the ethical framework she spoke about and that Gear&oacute;id and Shane also addressed.  Dr. Bracken was talking about an oversight body that will ensure the appropriate standards are maintained and that in the other country the legal, medical and psychological standards are maintained.  How can we as a State ensure another country is upholding those?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#K00700"><p>We cannot control the laws of another country and we should not attempt to say we can.  What we can do is control the recognition or the establishment of legal parentage at home.  In doing so we can base our recognition of it on an equivalence of ethical standards.  That encourages any intending parents who are setting out on their surrogacy journey to first check to ensure everything they are doing will adhere to that ethical framework.  The AHR authority will have a role in that as well by disseminating information about what an ethical surrogacy looks like so anyone who is even contemplating taking on the surrogacy journey would know in advance what ethical standards need to be adhered to.  There would also need to be legal advice put in place before any surrogacy is entered into so the intending parents can know what needs to be adhered to in order for the recognition to be granted once the child comes home again.</p> <p>  On the ethical standards, I do not think we can require that the ethical standards here be identical to those in place in another country but we can ensure an equivalence of ethical standards and in doing so, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we need to rely on a human rights framework for that, namely, something that prioritises the human rights of all participants in the surrogacy.  For the surrogate, we need to ensure there is free and informed consent, that there are balanced power dynamics between a surrogate and the intending parents and that there are protections for the right to bodily integrity.  We need to ensure protection for the rights of the child and then also for the intending parents.  If a gamete donor has been used there must be protection for his or her rights as well.  By having, as I proposed, a post-birth judicial process that allows for those ethical standards to be checked and for the best interests of the child to be determined, then we can ensure any surrogacy undertaken by an Irish citizen will meet agreed ethical standards as we have set them in Ireland.</p></speech>

Instead, it would really be advice for intending parents.  It would necessarily need to be very reactive and something that can change as standards change.  We would need to be constantly monitoring the standards in place in other countries in order to give the relevant advice.  Ultimately, the check would take place on a post-birth basis through the courts.  I believe that to be the most appropriate way forward but certainly the regulatory authority has a role in disseminating information about where ethical standards might be better met and what the intending parents need to look out for when they are entering into their surrogacy agreement.</p></speech>

I do not want us to inadvertently create another limbo for people such that there is one list of countries that allow you to be fast-tracked here and that is all great but there is another set of people, children and families that went to other countries and they are suddenly in a limbo now.

If they want to come back to Ireland for a holiday or move home permanently they should not be disadvantaged based on where they were living at the time if surrogacy was legal and lawful in that country and they availed of that process.  That is why it needs to be done on a case-by-case basis as opposed to having lists.  That is my personal view on that.</p></speech>

On the declaration of parentage and the post-birth or pre-birth transfer of parentage, as the committee is examining international surrogacy, is this an issue that is outside our scope because we in Ireland do not have the ability to dictate whether another country looks at parentage post-birth or pre-birth?  In the situation we were talking about, a woman is just after giving birth and there is a newborn baby there.  We cannot really say we see these two guys as the legal parents therefore the hospital in Canada, the UK or wherever has to recognise them, or can we?</p></speech>

Thus, the Senator is correct in saying even if we in Ireland decided that upon the birth of the children the intending parents are the legal parents it would completely depend on where the child has actually been born as to whether the parents in that country are recognised as legal parents at the time and if the child needed immediate medical treatment in that country who would be able to consent to it.  We cannot control those particular decisions.  It probably becomes relevant when issuing the travel documentation for the child to come back home again.  Again, there are ways to address that to ensure the child gets home safely and then the determination can be made about the recognition of parentage.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Bracken for answering that.</p> <p>  I have a final question.</p><p>The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, which is dealing with many other assisted human reproduction issues, is a health related Bill.  Dr. Bracken spoke at the start of her presentation about how the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 has created two different tiers of parents - some who are recognised under the Act and some who are not - and then there is a situation with surrogacy parents where there are significant legal gaps.  Would the issue of international surrogacy and all the ancillary issues not be best addressed in a justice-based Bill rather than a health-based Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#L00200"><p>It is really a matter for the Legislature as to what form the Bill takes.  I only want to see the provisions in place, regardless of where they sit.  I would not like to see another Bill being proposed at this stage.  International surrogacy needs to be dealt with in the existing Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  There is a danger that if it is pushed into another piece of legislation, it would be merely pushed down the line and would not happen for several years when there are a number of children who have already been born through surrogacy internationally and children will continue to be born through surrogacy internationally, the vindication of whose rights cannot be delayed any further.  If we are to address international surrogacy, it needs to be done in the current Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.</p> <p>  I suppose I am quite sceptical about the timelines on the basis of what happened with the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  It was enacted in 2015 but not commenced for a further five years because, first, there were typographical errors and they needed amendments by amending legislation, and then more errors were identified so that there was more amending legislation meaning that it was a five-year delay ultimately.  We cannot have another five-year delay in terms of addressing international surrogacy or any other aspect of assisted human reproduction.</p> <p>  We also cannot look at international surrogacy in a vacuum.  It needs to be consistent with the other provisions in relation to domestic surrogacy and with our current regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction.  It needs to be addressed in one comprehensive piece of legislation and it needs to be done as soon as possible but in a way that ensures that all of the relevant aspects are addressed.</p></speech>

When Dr. Bracken talked about how we could not adjudicate on entire jurisdictions and it should be it on a case-by-case basis, is there an option or a model whereby we accredit particular entities or clinics because we determine that they follow a particular ethical pathway and that we have some level of oversight of how they operate?  Is that an alternative model that would work?</p></speech>

If I am allowed, I would like to have time to think about that.  I am not sure how that would operate practically but if the Chairman allows, I will provide a written response to that point.  I do not have an immediate answer that comes to mind and it is something that I would need to give thought to before I give an answer on it.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Bracken.</p> <p>  I thank each of our witnesses for coming in today.  Each time we have these conversations, it further cements the fact that we cannot keep going with the system that we have.

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  I remind everyone that masks should continue to be worn throughout the meeting by all present and should only be removed when speaking.</p> <p>  I call on Ms O'Keeffe to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am a principal officer in the civil justice legislation function of the Department of Justice.  I am joined by Mr. Andrew Munro, assistant secretary, who has responsibility for civil justice policy and legislation.<br/><br/>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  Section 7 of the Act, which makes provision for Irish citizenship by descent, is applicable to children born outside Ireland through international surrogacy arrangements.  Section 7(1) provides that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen or would if alive have been an Irish citizen.  Section 7(3) provides that subsection (1) shall not confer Irish citizenship on a person born outside the island of Ireland whose Irish citizen parent was also born outside the island of Ireland, unless the person&rsquo;s birth is registered in the foreign births register, kept by the Department of Foreign Affairs under section 27 of the Act.  This requirement does not apply where the Irish citizen parent was abroad in the public service at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth.  Where a person&rsquo;s birth is registered in the foreign births register, the person&rsquo;s Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration, not from the date when the person was born.<br/><br/>Section 11 of the 1956 Act provides for citizenship of children adopted by Irish citizens, with effect from the date an adoption order is made or the date on which an intercountry adoption effected outside the State is recognised under the Adoption Act 2010.<br/><br/>In 2012, a guidance document was published on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel documents issues in relation to children born outside the State as a result of surrogacy arrangements.  The guidance document was agreed by an interdepartmental group on surrogacy, comprising the Departments of Justice, Health, Children, Foreign Affairs, and Social Protection, and the Office of the Attorney General.  The guidance document provides information to people who intend to enter surrogacy arrangements outside the State on the practical and legal considerations arising under Irish law where the intending parents intend to bring the child to live with them in the State.  The guidance document gives information on how legal parentage is established, how citizenship may be established, the information required for travel documents to issue for the child and the undertakings required to be given by the intending parents before travel documents are issued.<br/><br/>Under Irish law, the genetic father of a child born through surrogacy may apply for a declaration of parentage in respect of the child under the Status of Children Act 1987.  If the declaration of parentage is granted, the father will apply for guardianship under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  An Irish citizen genetic father will also, in most cases, apply for an order under section 14(3) of the Passports Act 2008, directing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may issue passports to the child without the consent of the birth mother until the child reaches the age of 18 years.<br/><br/>The Department of Justice is aware that issues regarding entitlement to Irish citizenship have arisen in relation to children born outside the State through surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction, where the Irish citizen intending parent is neither the birth mother nor the genetic father of the child.<br/><br/>There are some judicial review applications before the courts at present arising from passport applications made for children born outside the State through surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction and which involve issues relating to entitlement to Irish citizenship by descent under section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  The Supreme Court has recently determined that it will hear a leapfrog appeal on the question of the interpretation of section 7(1) of the 1956 Act in relation to entitlement to citizenship by descent in the context of surrogacy.  This issue arose in the High Court case of A, B and C <i>v</i>. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As these matters are currently before the courts, it would be inappropriate for the Department to comment further on them at this time.<br/><br/>I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mrs. &Uacute;na Fannon, head of the policy and legal unit of the passport service, and Mr. Trevor Redmond, legal counsellor in the Department.  The Department of Foreign Affairs welcomes the opportunity to address the joint committee this morning.</p> <p>  The Department receives a significant and increasing number of requests for passports and consular services from Irish citizens who have entered into international surrogacy arrangements.  The Department is often the first State body encountered by Irish intending parents in their surrogacy journey as they seek to return to Ireland with a child following its birth overseas.  The role of the Department in these cases concerns the processing of applications for travel documents for children born through international surrogacy arrangements and also providing consular assistance as necessary in the country of birth.  </p> <p>  Our embassies and consulates provide consular assistance and are the main points of contact from the Department for Irish intending parents who are applying for an emergency travel certificate, ETC.  The passport service in Dublin prioritises the review of the ETC applications and approves the issuance of the ETC, which is then issued by the local embassy or consulate.</p> <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for the issue of passports and other travel documents to Irish citizens under the Passports Act 2008, as amended.  The 2008 Act clearly sets out the criteria for issuance of a passport to a child, including that the child must be an Irish citizen and that the guardians of the child consent to the issue of the passport.  In addition, section 15 of the 2008 Act specifically provides for the issuance of ETCs.</p> <p>  An ETC is not a passport but, rather, a temporary travel document for one-time use.</p><p>An ETC is valid for such period as the Minister considers appropriate to enable the person to undertake the journey in respect of which it is issued, generally within 72 hours.  An ETC includes a photo of the child, their details and the details of their intended travel.</p><p> In the absence of a specific legal framework for children born through international surrogacy, a guidance document, which was published by the then Department of Justice and Equality in 2012, provides guidance as to the principles that will be applied by the Irish authorities when considering whether a child is an Irish citizen and who the child's legal parents and guardians are for the purposes of dealing with applications for travel documents.  The guidance document was agreed by an interdepartmental group on surrogacy, which was comprised of the then Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Social Protection, and the Office of the Attorney General.  Among other things, the guidance document outlines the information required in order for a travel document to issue for the child.</p><p> In applying the guidance document of the Department of Justice and the Passports Act 2008, as amended, an approach to the processing of ETC applications has developed in consultation with the interdepartmental group on surrogacy.  The following is the general approach.</p><p> In order for an ETC to issue for a child born through international surrogacy, the Minister must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is or may be an Irish citizen.  For a child born outside Ireland through surrogacy, this is typically based on their genetic link to an Irish citizen father.  In addition, the ETC application must be made by a parent or guardian of the child and the guardian or guardians of the child must consent to the issuance of the travel document.  When a child is born through a surrogacy arrangement, under Irish law the surrogate mother is the legal mother of the child.  If she is married then the surrogate mother's husband is presumed, by law, to be the father of the child.  Therefore, the husband will also, along with the surrogate mother, be the joint guardian of the child.</p><p> The documents required in such ETC applications relate to: the child; the Irish citizen genetic father; the surrogate mother; if the surrogate mother is married, her husband; and DNA evidence from a satisfactory source demonstrating that the Irish citizen intended father is the genetic father of the child.  A list of the documentary requirements has been shared with the committee and we are happy to answer any questions on them.</p><p> A number of key documents include: the child's birth certificate; a written undertaking from the Irish intended father that states he will notify his local health centre of the child's presence within two working days of their arrival in Ireland, and that he will apply to the Irish courts for a declaration of parentage and a guardianship order for the child; as well as an affidavit sworn by the surrogate mother in her native language consenting to the taking of DNA samples, the issuing of a travel document for the child and to the genetic father being made a guardian.  The affidavit should also state her marital status and confirmation that she has received independent legal advice.</p><p> With regard to the verification of documents, public documents issued in the country where the birth takes place must have an apostille certificate.  Affidavits and official documents that are provided in a language other than English must be accompanied by a notarised translation with an apostille certificate.</p><p> An apostille is an official government-issued certificate added to documents verifying the signature or seal or both of a public officer on a public document.  This means that the document will be recognised and accepted when presented in another country that has acceded to The Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents.</p><p> An apostille is issued by the designated competent authority of the State from which the document originates.  In Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for issuing apostille certificates on Irish public documents.  The requirement for documents and translations to be apostilled in the emergency travel certificate process allows for further verification that the documents are genuine, and means that the passport service can be satisfied that they are authentic.  Given the number of documents required, the process of gathering them can be lengthy.  The passport service takes very seriously its obligation to uphold the integrity of the process in order to protect all parties, including the child and surrogate mother.  The rights of the child are of paramount consideration.</p><p> Furthermore, our officials in overseas missions are obliged to comply with local law as well as with Irish law.  The Department will not facilitate the unlawful movement of children across national boundaries.  In jurisdictions where an international surrogacy case has not been encountered by the Department before, the Department seeks local legal advice to seek to ensure that it acts in compliance with local law.  This means that the ETC application process can be complex and time consuming.  The Department of Justice guidance document flags that commissioning adults intending to apply for a travel document for a child should plan for the possibility of the child having to remain in the country of birth until it has been established whether a travel document can be issued.   While we endeavour to deal with all applications as promptly and efficiently as possible, the Department can give no guarantee, before the birth of a child, that he or she will be regarded as an Irish citizen or that the intended father will be regarded as a parent or guardian of that child and, therefore, that a passport or other travel document can be provided for the child.</p><p> When intending parents contact us in advance of a child's birth we direct them to the Department of Justice guidance document, and advise them to ensure that they have both Irish and local legal advice.  We also advise them of the documentary requirements for a travel document application, and of the need to remain in the country of birth until it has been established whether a travel document can be issued.</p><p> The Department advises the HSE when the written undertakings, as set out in the Department of Justice guidance document, have been given by the intended father.  The Department also notifies border control that an ETC has been issued in respect of a child travelling to Ireland.  When the Irish court proceedings referenced in the intended father's written undertakings are complete, a court order is, typically, issued which relates to a declaration of parentage, guardianship and custody.  The court order will also, typically, dispense with the consent of the surrogate mother and, where applicable, her husband to the issuing of a passport to the child, and to the issuing of all travel documentation until the child reaches majority.  At this point, a father can submit a passport application for their child to the Passport Service.</p><p> The Department welcomes the work of this committee and hopes that its recommendations will bring greater clarity, and certainty, to the current travel document application process for children born outside the State through surrogacy, as well as to Irish intending parents.  In the meantime, we will continue to assist families going through this process.  We would welcome any questions members might have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1225" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#N00300"><p>This exchange is an unusual experience for me, and almost triggering for me, listening to the process being explored by officials, having gone through the process myself.</p> <p>  I wish to thank the officials for their extraordinary dedication, integrity and support that has been given throughout all of the years, and exceptionally so in the last number of months.  As evidence of that I have text messages from Department officials that were sent as early as 6 a.m. and as late as 1.30 a.m. on one Sunday morning.  They have shown extraordinary dedication to Irish citizens and prospective Irish citizens.  Mrs. Fannon was at the heart of it all.  I do not know how many emails that there have been at this stage but at the heart of all of that has been an extraordinary amount of work done by her and all of the officials.  I thank all of them.  The interdepartmental surrogacy group has worked extraordinarily hard over the last month in trying to deal with what is an unprecedented situation, particularly in terms of Ukraine.</p> <p>  What the officials have set out for us is quite onerous and detailed.  The standard which parents or intended parents - they are parents to me - bringing home their child has to reach in terms of documentary and DNA evidence is very high.  All that is set out in a document provided by the Department of Justice as long as ten years ago in 2012.  The document was done by the Department officials and in conjunction with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter.  There are other finer details that I feel are important enough to be drawn out today.  I refer to the fact that the DNA evidence is not just a matter of doing a quick swab and placing that in an envelope.  The test is done by the Ormond Quay Paternity Services, which is a court recognised organisation in Ireland, and its standard of proof is accepted by the Irish courts in all sorts of paternity matters.  Also, the DNA evidence must be taken in the presence of an embassy official and a doctor who has been nominated by the embassy.  Therefore, a person cannot just run to any old doctor and pull them in.  The embassy must approve the doctor.  Everything is done in a transparent fashion.  Also, the surrogate mother must be present.  In recent weeks, we have had discussions about that, given we have people inside and outside of the Ukraine.  It is important that the public hears about the fastidious level of detail that is required.</p><p>When one arrives home in Ireland, the first thing one does is contact the public health nurse to register the baby.  Then one gets one's solicitor to issue proceedings because one has given an undertaking to do that.  Then one arrives into court and the Judiciary looks through one's documentation.  The fact that an emergency travel certificate was issued almost means, in and of itself, that a standard of proof has been reached.  In a sense, the witnesses are like gatekeepers, although I do not want to undermine the role of the Judiciary in this.  This has been vetted by people in the country in which the baby was born, departmental officials who are very experienced and then there is judicial oversight, before any of the orders that Ms O'Keeffe referred to so well are made.</p><p> Part of me just wants the witnesses to confirm what I have said.  By the time one has that emergency travel certificate in one's hand when coming home, a lot of work has gone into proving the bona fides.  One of the things that has been explained over the past few weeks is that the presence of the surrogate mother with the embassy official is, in itself, ensuring consent.  The point in all of that is that the intended mother is a bystander to all of this.  There is a delicacy and a sadness in that when one is a bystander to something so precious.

We have implemented quite a robust process.  It is absolutely the case that embassy officials do attend the DNA test where they get to meet the surrogate mother, which is just another safeguard.  The surrogate mother is met by an embassy official and that helps us in approving the emergency travel certificate application.  I would say, however, that the role of the Department is only to approve the emergency travel certificate at that point.  The intending parents have to go through a very robust judicial process on their return.</p></speech>

My own team in the passport service are very familiar with documentation from certain countries where international surrogacy is very popular with Irish couples.  We have quite a lot of experience in certain jurisdictions and have a very good knowledge of the documents that are presented to us.</p></speech>

We have embryological standards and we touched on that a little at our last meeting.  We know that embryos that were created in Ireland can be sent out to clinics abroad.  Those clinics have been confirmed by the likes of the Rotunda Hospital or other medical organisations in Ireland and then a baby is born.  If a predetermined genetic link could be established it would provide further assurance.  I am not in any way undermining the assurance provided by the documentation but there is a precariousness there in terms of a failed DNA test.  Guarantees cannot be given because nothing is known until the DNA result comes back.  That email is an extraordinary email to get and it gives one a huge sense of relief.  The issue is that a baby is born and if something could happen prior to that which would be of assistance in terms of the integrity and the safeguarding of the baby, that would be good.</p></speech>

The baby has been born by the time we are involved in the process.</p></speech>

My first question is for Ms O'Keeffe.  The orders of reference for this committee say that we should ensure safeguards against the sale, trafficking and exploitation of children.  How does she think this is best achieved?  My second question relates to the authenticity of the DNA and the testing of same in this country.  What happens if the surrogate mother cannot be present?  What happens in that case?</p> <p>  My next question is for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Muiris O'Connor from the Department of Health told this committee on 7 April that the domestic prohibition on commercial surrogacy is predominantly based on ethical considerations relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved, as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.  Does the Department of Foreign Affairs share this concern and if so, why?</p></speech>

Processes that have been put in place by the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to the emergency travel certificate.  Guidance documents were prepared by an interdepartmental group and published in 2012, including guidance on what is required when a declaration of parentage application is made to the courts.  The steps, processes and documentation required have been laid out and the purpose of all of that is to ensure the necessary safeguards for surrogate mothers and for children and to minimise, as far as possible, any risk of child trafficking or undesirable practices.  That is the purpose of all of these procedures and safeguards.  The aim is to ensure as far as possible that the documentation is in order.  My colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs mentioned the stringent DNA testing that is required at the emergency travel certificate stage.  That DNA evidence is also required to be presented to the court when an application for a declaration of parentage is made.  Under the current legal framework, there as many safeguards as we can reasonably put in place.</p></speech>

The process we follow, as has been mentioned, is very robust in order to ensure that all parties are safeguarded in the process.  We would not deal with policy in relation to the process; we are simply facilitators of the issuance of a travel document.  Our primary concern is to make sure that all parties are safeguarded and that is achieved through the robustness of the process that is followed.</p></speech>

I do not think we have ever encountered that scenario, but we would look at cases on a case-by-case basis.  As it has never been encountered, I cannot answer how that would be dealt with.</p></speech>

There are jurisdictions where the child can get a passport locally in the country in which the child is born, and this may arise in such cases.  In terms of our process, however, the consent of the surrogate mother, and her husband if necessary, is crucial to the process.</p></speech>

The process we follow means meeting all the parties involved, including that the surrogate mother attend for the DNA, that she seek her own legal advice and various other steps.

We heard from the previous witnesses, particularly Mr. Kenny Moore.  He spoke about passports in America and Canada, coming back here, the difference and how we learn.  That was a major issue for me.  The other issue is the timescale.  This is all technical and we are learning from this.  My biggest fear, and I have learned this through politics and life, as I believe all of us have, is that when one is dealing with three or four different Departments, it is an absolute nightmare.  One is going from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Justice to the Department of Health and to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  While there is no question that everybody is doing their best, it becomes a huge issue.  One Department will take a lead on this and another Department will take a lead on that.  Then one is in a situation where unless it is led by one particular area, it just does not work.  I have found over the years with different issues that it becomes a major barrier.  One Department will blame another Department regarding the timescale while another will say the person filled the form wrongly or that it does not go to that Department or it is all online.  It does not work.</p> <p>  For us and the Government to succeed on this legislation we must have one Department to lead it, be it the Department of Justice, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or whatever.  What do the witnesses see as their biggest hurdles when they are trying to work within the remits of different Departments?  Sometimes when one is dealing with Departments, one probably does not know who one is dealing with because people come and go and switch and swap.  I always find that to be an issue.  I believe we need to have a designated two or three people who can lead this.  There must be a specific area where anybody who wants that information is able to get it quite quickly.  Dealing with passports and other information is very sensitive.  We are dealing with very sensitive information here.  We are dealing with people's lives and how they are affected.  That is my biggest concern with this.</p> <p>  We must make sure we all work together on this.  There has been delay over the years.  One thing I have learned from meeting the witnesses over recent weeks is that their stories are heartbreaking.  They want the system right.  They want to be able to have legislation from which they can work.  They do not want to do anything wrong.  They just want to have a system that fits and is right, and we are not delivering on that.  We are failing badly here.  Those are my concerns from today, and perhaps the witnesses can respond to me.  Again, I know everybody is doing the best they can within their Departments, but when it happens that one is dealing with so many Departments, it just does not work.  There were a few questions there if the representatives of the different Departments wish to take them.</p></speech>

For us, we are dealing with the international element of the surrogacy and that is our primary focus.  While we would welcome legislation that would streamline the process for us, there is always going to be an element for us whereby we have to abide by local law.  That adds a different nuance for us.  While a streamlined process domestically would certainly be of benefit, it would not be possible for the process also to work for every country to which a family may go.  When we get a family going to a country we have not dealt with before, that can take longer because we need to establish what the local law is in that country and tweak the process to fit where necessary.  We would absolutely welcome a streamlined process, but there are always going to be challenges for our Department in that regard.</p></speech>

It is very serious, and this legislation is crucial.  We all have spoken about a three-month time limit here, but it does not seem possible with all the different Departments and how we can perhaps try to get one source that can lead on it.  Then at least we will know and work with that area.  I thank Ms Byrne but I have concerns about that.</p></speech>

There are elements of the law under different Departments, but the machine we have for resolving that is the Government.  It acts collectively under Article 28.  In the decision it took earlier this year when it put forward the proposal to establish the committee, it was very clear that all Departments concerned - the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Justice - would listen to what the committee said and bring forward whatever necessary reforms were required, and that the Department of Health in its assisted human reproduction Bill would take account of the recommendations of the committee.  We have a machine, imperfect and all as it may be, for bringing 18 Departments together to a collective view.  That is the constitutional position and that is where we will go.  The key thing is if the committee can identify the challenges and good solutions there, the Government will reflect on that and seek to implement the solutions that are identified.</p></speech>

In fairness to all the witnesses, in their remits they are experts in their particular fields.  Where would they see for us as legislators, who are trying to get this fairness and legislation through, the biggest challenges within the different Departments or even within their own remit?  Timing is a big issue for us.</p></speech>

I think they are outlined in the paper.  The Deputy has heard from the other witnesses about the challenges they meet and the challenges intending parents come up against.  We are discussing one element of it here, which is the safeguards that must be put in place.  That is identified in the paper.  It is really about the fundamentals of ensuring the rights of the children, the surrogate mother and the intending parents are protected.  Resolving that is looking for risks and asking how to counteract them.  For example, we have DNA tests to ensure the person is the genetic father of the child.  It is those safeguards and what one is trying to guard against.  Senator Keogan spoke about trafficking.  It is the necessary things one needs to guard against there.  Unfortunately, one ends up with regulatory steps.  However, if we can identify if there are ways of improving that, I am certainly open to that.</p></speech>

As one guest said, words matter.  I have learned we have to be mindful as legislators that we have proper wording and communication.  Communication is the key.  How we communicate as legislators, and how the Departments communicate, matters.  In that way, people will believe the system is a good one and will want to ensure it works.</p></speech>

Deputy Murnane O'Connor spoke about challenges, and we have been given a significant challenge of trying to navigate our way through a very complex issue.  We can do that only by means of cross-party support and cross-departmental collaboration.  I thank our guests for all they are doing to achieve that.</p> <p>  The main message I have taken from this meeting is that the Departments will not facilitate the unlawful movement of children across borders and that emergency travel certificates will be issued only where there is reasonable cause to believe a child is or may be an Irish citizen.  That is important from a safeguarding perspective, as well as when it comes to affording rights to both the child and his or her family.  Our guests outlined the robust processes that are in place to prevent, insofar as possible, child trafficking, and referred to the stringent DNA testing at that emergency travel certificate stage.  Have there ever been failures in this regard?  Are there any cases we need to examine?  I hope there are not, but I would certainly love to hear there are not.</p> <p>  What changes to streamlined processes could be introduced to remove as much stress as possible for families?  Are bilateral agreements in place, and if not, could they be, with frequently used countries to minimise that stress for both the surrogate and the expectant parents where possible?  Are there ways to speed it up and streamline it while ensuring that all the safeguards our guests eloquently outlined will remain in place to protect the child and all the parties involved?</p></speech>

DNA tests, for example, are very important to ensure there is a link.  To move away from surrogacy for a moment, in the case of any good service a state tries to provide, there will always be people who try to abuse it.  For instance, social welfare is fantastic for supporting people and transferring income, but a small proportion will try to abuse any system.  Unfortunately, we have seen cases where the intended parents were exploited abroad by, as I referred to at the previous meeting, bad actors.</p></speech>

DNA tests were very important in one of the cases.  It is about ensuring that for whatever we want to enshrine in legislation, it will have those safeguards such that the rights of surrogates will be protected, that they are giving their consent and that there is not any sort of undue economic exploitation.  The risks are there to see in regard to the safeguards we have in place.</p></speech>

We can rely on the governance arrangements in the other countries to be robust, but where that cannot be done or where the governance arrangements are not robust, we would have concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1266" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Trevor Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#Q01300"><p>To expand on that, there have been one or two cases, as Mr. Munro said, and we will not go into the details of them.  As a general comment, the safeguards build on the legal framework that exists, and I think the committee has heard evidence in that regard.  The guidelines that were developed in 2012 build on the existing legislative framework and there is a limit to what can be done within that, which is what we work within.</p> <p>  As has been said, the requirements of the guidelines are quite stringent, but they reflect what can be done in the context of the existing legislation.  Of course, the guidelines are not based in legislation and are not statutory, so we apply them in that context.  If there were a difficult case whereby someone did not wish to adhere to the guidelines, that would put our Department in particular in a difficult position.  That is why, if this is to be regulated, we would see the benefit in regulation that brought greater clarity to the requirements, whereby people would know that in advance and the safeguards would be clear from the outset.</p> <p>  I am not aware of any bilateral agreement but it would depend on the existing policy.  I could certainly foresee possibilities and I think the committee has heard proposals in this regard.  If front-loaded, pre-surrogacy arrangements were being entered into and if there were a framework, that would assist our Department in the context of working with new countries, for example.  As has been mentioned, that would pose particular difficulties.</p></speech>

Like Senator Seery Kearney, I acknowledge the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in particular, over recent weeks.  It has been very difficult.  I acknowledge also Senator Seery Kearney, given that some of us who were navigating this issue for the first time were on the phone just as often to her.  She was always available.  We are dealing with families in very difficult circumstances and so much care and sensitivity has always been given.</p> <p>  My first question follows on from what Dr. Redmond said regarding there being a set of guidelines, not least in the context of the pre-birth, post-birth or at-birth transfer of parentage.  I am focusing quite a bit on that because I think it will form the crux of the wider issue to a certain extent.  Would a pre-birth parentage model make circumstances easier?  Of course, nobody could have envisaged what was going to happen in Ukraine, but would such a model have made some of those situations easier or more straightforward, or would it not really change anything?  Would the Department of Justice's goal remain the same?</p> <p>  When representatives of the Department of Justice last appeared before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, we asked about potential models people have seen internationally that might be considered good practice.  I do not know whether our guests have looked at any other models since the previous occasion, or perhaps they heard some of what was said about the Canadian model in the earlier session.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs deals with many countries.  Are there other systems or examples that work well?</p></speech>

We have a certain role and outward-facing experience but the policy is not with us, so we do not look at the models in that sense.  We would defer to others on that.</p> <p>  As regards the experiences we have had to date, we can say from the perspective of our Department that a prearrangement process that brings legal certainty would be a benefit to us.  That is just from the perspective of our Department; it is not to say it should be the policy.  It is just one factor the committee may wish to bear in mind.</p></speech>

Are there practical examples of how it would be easier or better for Dr. Redmond's Department?  I understand that he is speaking only on behalf of his Department.</p></speech>

It does put pressure on the Department and seek that.  The law in those countries might be unclear.  If one is dealing with a country where surrogacy is unregulated, one might receive legal advice that has ambiguities.  In that context, the Department is occasionally in a difficult position.  For example, if there was a regulatory agency in Ireland that was responsible for looking at jurisdictions and providing advice, that may take a burden off the Department of Foreign Affairs in the context of those situations where there is potentially short notice.  That may be of benefit to us.</p></speech>

We are not aware of any country that has found a specific model or legislative framework.  To the best of my knowledge, most countries deal with it in their existing family law framework.  Adoption in particular has been used as a route to parentage in international surrogacy cases, particularly in European jurisdictions.</p> <p>  As regards a pre-birth or post-birth model, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill provides for a two-step process in respect of surrogacy taking place in Ireland, consisting of the pre-conception stage and then the post-birth parental order.  A pre-birth approval may not be sufficient, but that is getting into questions of policy.</p></speech>

We had a resident embassy there, so applications were taking approximately three to six weeks to be processed following the birth of the child.  There are several documents that cannot be put together until the child is born.  We are also dependent on the authorities in Ukraine, or any other relevant country, their processes and how long they take.  It was taking approximately three to six weeks after the baby was born in that jurisdiction.  As we mentioned, if it is a new jurisdiction where we have not previously had an ECT application, it can take considerable time to put the process in place and ensure all the documents meet our standards.  It is important that parents engage in the process early.  We often only hear about the birth after the fact.   The parents may be in-country and waiting for the baby but we may not hear about it until after the fact.  I know the parents get legal advice locally and here in Ireland, as they ought and as we advise, but they should do a lot of research into what is involved, speak to others who have been through the process, be aware of what is involved and be prepared for the level of paperwork and the time it might take.  Some parents are not aware of what is involved once the baby is born.  From our point of view, it would help to manage the work on our side if parents were fully aware of the situation.</p></speech>

Some of them kind of tie in with the questions Deputy Higgins asked in respect of citizenship.  I refer to situations where the biological intended father is not an Irish citizen but the other intended parent is.  Obviously, that has to go into a process.  What happens in a situation such as that if the parents plan to come back to Ireland but the biological parent is not a citizen?</p></speech>

As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are aware of those kinds of issues.  They mainly arise in cases where the family is resident outside Ireland, though there have also been cases involving Irish residents.  There is a case ongoing before the courts in respect of the interpretation of the citizenship legislation in the context of those kinds of situations.  I cannot say anything more at present because the case is to be heard before the Supreme Court later this year.</p></speech>

Am I correct that a surrogate mother, as the legally recognised mother of the child, is the guardian under Irish law but if she is married, her husband is joint guardian?  That does not naturally transpose in Irish law, however, in the context of gay dads and the guardianship automatically assigning to the other non-biological intended parent.  A non-biological husband of a surrogate has full guardianship but that does not happen in the other direction.  Can that be fixed?  What am I missing in the logic there?  Why does the husband of the surrogate have more guardianship rights than the intended parents do?</p></speech>

Under the Status of Children Act, there is a presumption that in the case of an opposite-sex married couple whose marriage is subsisting and who have not separated, the husband is the father of a child born to a wife.  That applies to children born or conceived in any manner.  This presumption has been in law for a long time.  As a married father, the husband is automatically a guardian.  In order to displace that presumption, one must have recourse to the application for the declaration of parentage.</p><p>When the genetic father makes the application and is granted that declaration of parentage, the presumption then ceases to apply in relation to the husband of the surrogate mother so he is no longer the guardian.  The genetic father will be.  One of the orders he will get is he will be appointed the guardian of the child.</p></speech>

Should there be a register of intention so people are not waiting until after the fact?  It is a long procedure for people making these decisions.  Rather than a Department begin overwhelmed or coming in after the fact, should there be a register of intention so a process can begin in the interim until the legitimate process happens post birth?</p></speech>

Since commencement of the Children and Family Relationships Act, where a donor-conceived child is born and all the procedures of the Act have been complied with, the second parent can be registered as parent immediately.  The presumption that has for a long time applied in relation to opposite-sex couples is there for the reasons my colleague has explained.  It may be more difficult in a same-sex couple situation where the question of the biological possibility comes into play.  In the case of a same-sex male couple, a woman who is not a member of the couple had to give birth to the child.  There may be issues in terms of what can logically and legally be presumed.</p></speech>

The discussion we have had has been interesting.  I will touch on the issue Senator Ruane raised.  I practised for a long number of years as a family solicitor and came across the presumption of parentage.  When a woman is married, has formed a new relationship and has a child with a new partner, she needs her husband to rebut the presumption that he is the father.  That often happens but I have come across cases where the husband is no longer contactable or, in abusive situations, refuses to do it.  It has created a lot of problems for women trying to register the birth of their children or get medical cards and PPS numbers.  It is a big issue so we need to deal with it.  It would help with the issue of international surrogacy as well.</p> <p>  On the emergency travel certificate, what happens if the intending parent who is an Irish citizen is not the biological parent?  Do they default to some other country?  If they are living in this country but, let us say, in a gay relationship and the biological father is from outside the EU and has not yet been naturalised as an Irish citizen, does the child automatically get a passport of the country of the biological father?</p></speech>

It would be difficult to answer that question because it depends on the legislation in the country.  If there is no biological link, the child would not be an Irish citizen through the biological link and, therefore, we would not be in a position to issue a travel document to the child.  Whether a document issues from the other country is down to the legislation in that country.</p></speech>

Are we depending on Brazil to issue a travel document for that child to come back to live in Ireland?</p></speech>

Let us say an Irish citizen and a Brazilian citizen are married and living in Ireland.  The Brazilian man has not yet naturalised as an Irish citizen but the couple have a child and the man is the biological father.  The family is established in Ireland and intends to live in Ireland.  Are we relying on a third country to issue a travel document?  Is that the current situation?</p></speech>

There is a lot of work going on in the Department to deal with the backlog in the citizenship area.  It was affected by Covid.  We have modified procedures to try to rely less on the transfer of hard copy papers to try to speed things up.  The Senator will appreciate the immigration side of the Department is under considerable pressure at present from the temporary protection measures put in place with 25,000 people coming in from Ukraine.  There has also been an increase in international protection applications.  The immigration operations side of the Department is under considerable pressure.  We are conscious of the need to address all of these backlogs.</p></speech>

Let us imagine for a moment a delay in the naturalisation process of one intended non-biological parent.  Under the guardianship process of the other intended non-biological parent would the child have automatic citizenship?  Would this be the case if the biological father was still going through the naturalisation process but the parentage of the other non-biological parent was processed first?  Would the child be afforded citizenship on the basis of the non-biological intended parent being processed afterwards?</p></speech>

I am not aware of any case where this has occurred.  When I said there had been cases previously it was more where the parent was not a citizen and, therefore, the child had no entitlement.  There have been cases of this but not where it has been affected through a delay in the parent acquiring citizenship, through naturalisation or any other method.</p></speech>

If a non-biological intending parent is an Irish citizen then guardianship is not enough to confer citizenship on the child.  Legal parentage is what is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.1319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#T00600"><p>Something that has come out of all of this is that women who need to pursue surrogacy as single women do not have an option to do so in this situation because there is no way to create citizenship even though she may be the biological mother and there is a donor father.  Single intended mothers and same-sex female couples have the same issue.  They cannot avail of surrogacy for these reasons.  It is important to highlight this.</p> <p>  With regard to the presumption of parentage, Ormond Quay Paternity Services issued a report in 2008.  The service does not deal only with surrogacy; it does DNA for all of our court's family law services.  The report found that in 35% of its parentage testing in cases going through the Irish courts the person who thought he was the father was not the father.  This is natural outside of surrogacy and IVF.  Yet people who go through infertility issues in the State, and who have the minefield and journey of infertility issues are robustly tested for good reason and I am not for one minute saying we should undermine this.  They go through all of this hassle and proving themselves and they can come back to Ireland and not have a legal relationship with the child.  We have this double standard.  It is not the fault of anybody here.</p> <p>  I heard what was said about communication.  In defence, I have to say that in recent months the witnesses, the people behind them and the Office of the Attorney General have found themselves with unprecedented situations of surrogacies that should have happened in Ukraine, had the Russians not been so awful, and babies being born outside of this.  They have had to react at very short notice, although we do try to plan or know the dates but sometimes babies come early and catch everybody by surprise.  There has been extraordinary communication and extraordinary work and support.  I hear all that has been said and I know-----</p></speech>

I stand over that when people are dealing with a lot of Departments, a lead Department is needed.  This is across everything no matter what area it is in.

In the previous session we spoke about how to ensure there is an ethical process in place.  The models we looked at would not be viable to assess entire jurisdictions.  Perhaps it was to be done more on a case-by-case basis.  There is a middle option whereby there is potential for assessing particular clinics to state they follow certain guidelines and that we as a State are comfortably with the ethical processes they have put in place.  What are the comments of the witnesses on this?  Do they see this as a practical solution?  Is it feasible?  What do they think about how we in this State can somehow accredit a process in another jurisdiction?</p></speech>

We are able to regulate health services here because we have enforcement and inspection.  Without mechanisms of enforcement and inspection I do not know how we would be assured of the standards of services abroad or even who would be in a position to do it.  Would it be the Medical Council or CORU?  It is quite a challenge to regulate standards in other countries.  In the European Union it is normally done through equivalence arrangements with somebody at the top and the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union.  There are also international conventions, such as with adoption.  It is quite difficult to see how the State would regulate private entities in another jurisdiction.  It would be quite challenging.</p></speech>
