Deputies Hourigan and Verona Murphy have sent their apologies.</p> <p>  To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, I ask that all those in attendance wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  The service requests that individuals continue to wear face coverings when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others and to be respectful of other people's physical space.  The public health advice should be heeded.</p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament. </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Paul Southern, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we engage with the Department of Justice and officials from the Prison Service to examine the 2020 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 24, Justice, and Vote 21, Prisons.  As per the committee's request, the Department has provided it with a copy of the independent review of voluntary mess committees in Irish prisons, which the committee may wish to examine during the engagement.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials: Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service; Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice; Ms Oonagh Buckley, deputy Secretary General; Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, assistant secretary; Mr. Seamus Clifford, assistant director; and Mr. Fergal Black, director of care and rehabilitation at the Irish Prison Service.  We are also joined by Ms Marianne Nolan, principal officer for the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. </p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The witnesses are all very welcome.  I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#A00700"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of &euro;399 million in 2020.  This was a reduction of &euro;140 million, or 26%, on the prior year.  The main reason for the reduction in the level of expenditure on the Vote was the transfer of responsibility for certain services to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth following the formation of the Government.  This included the transfer out of responsibility for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers.  However, the processing of asylum applications remains the responsibility of the Department of Justice.</p> <p>  The Data Protection Commission was also established as a new Vote in 2020.  Previously, the commission was funded from the Justice Vote.</p> <p>  Expenditure under the justice Vote in 2020 was distributed across five programmes.  The biggest expenditure programme relates to the range of services that together address the strategic objective to "provide a safe and secure Ireland".  In 2020, the total spend for that programme was &euro;207 million.  This was up almost &euro;27 million, or 15%, year-on-year.  The largest component of this spending related to criminal legal aid, which totalled just over &euro;62 million in 2020.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion relating to the appropriation account for Vote 24.  However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control regarding material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2020.</p> <p>  I also drew attention to the payment of an EU fine by the Department.  The fine, in the amount of &euro;2 million, was imposed due to delayed transposition by Ireland of an EU directive relating to money laundering and terrorist financing.</p> <p>  The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of Justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21.  While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.</p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 21 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;401 million.  Around two thirds of the expenditure, totalling &euro;271 million, relates to pay.  The remainder is spread across a range of areas, including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchases, education and services for prisoners, and other operating costs. </p> <p>  Note 6.5 to the appropriation account provides an update as at September 2021 on progress made by the Prison Service in its arrangements for the operation of staff voluntary mess committees in the larger prisons.  The note outlines that governance arrangements have been reviewed and written agreements have been put in place between the committees and the Prison Service.</p><p>I understand that the Accounting Officer has provided further detailed information about the operation of the committees in recent correspondence.</p><p> I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account for Vote 21.  However, I drew attention in my report on the audit to the basis of the valuation of land at Thornton Hall.  While the land was valued by the Valuation Office at &euro;2.7 million in 2020, the Prison Service continued to carry the assets at Thornton on the statement of financial position at the historic cost of &euro;49.3 million.  This was in contrast to the valuation method applied for all other land and building assets.  In my opinion, the exceptional accounting treatment of the assets at Thornton Hall was not warranted.</p><p> I also drew attention to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts operating in 2020 for the supply of goods and services to the Prison Service.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms McPhillips.  As detailed in the letter of invitation, there will be five minutes for her opening statement.  I understand Ms McPhillips wishes to share her time with Ms McCaffrey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh McPhillips" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#B00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to meet with the committee in relation to the 2020 Justice and Prisons Votes.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office for their work on this.  The Chairman has introduced the team.  With his permission, I will share my time with Ms McCaffrey.</p> <p>  Vote 24, the justice Vote, is one of six in the Vote group and covers a wide remit of activity, both in the Department and a number of agencies in the justice sector.  In 2020, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, there were five expenditure programmes with 50 individual subheads.  The Vote structure was realigned substantially in 2021 to take account of the Department&rsquo;s major restructuring and the 2020 transfer of our integration and equality responsibilities to the expanded Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  These changes have rationalised the Vote&rsquo;s structure and reduced the number of programmes from five to two - criminal justice and civil justice.</p> <p>  Any review of 2020 must take account of the pandemic and, like the rest of the world, managing the impact of Covid-19 on our staff and business has been a central focus at all levels in the Department and the whole justice sector ever since, perhaps nowhere more so than in the prisons, which the director general will speak to shortly.  The management of the pandemic in the Department has been led by the management board and the Covid-19 response management group, supported by our specialist occupational health and safety unit.  This work included ensuring business continuity for the public services we provide, introducing remote working, onboarding more than 700 new staff over the past two years and safeguarding and supporting all our colleagues, including those serving abroad and those who had to remain in the workplace in front-line and public-facing roles.</p> <p>  Our criminal and civil governance teams communicated regularly and consistently with our 25 agencies to support them in responding dynamically and safely to the evolving public health restrictions.  It is a credit to the professionalism and commitment of the whole organisation that, working together, we succeeded in doing this and much more through the last two years.</p> <p>  There was also a significant impact on specific areas of the business.  The legislative teams supported colleagues in the Department of Health in drafting legislation and regulations, including the necessary Garda powers.  The restrictions on international travel and checks on people arriving into the State meant many dynamic changes for staff of the border management unit at Dublin Airport, including supporting mandatory hotel quarantine.  The pandemic impacted the provision of immigration services to our customers, necessitating the temporary extension of immigration permissions through 2020 and 2021.</p> <p>  Innovations were also introduced, including the first ever online citizenship ceremony in 2020 and more followed in 2021.  Under the Department&rsquo;s IT strategy, we are investing in developing much-needed digital systems, but the prolonged need to either restrict or stagger staff attendance in offices increased processing times, particularly in some high-volume immigration areas.  This situation improved as restrictions lifted and staff could return to offices.  We took the opportunity to re-engineer and streamline processes and this has been having a positive effect in recent months.</p> <p>  Members will appreciate that the recent essential work to welcome and process the refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine has necessitated the redeployment of experienced officials to staff the one-stop shop and reception centre.  This currently operates from 8 a.m. to approximately 4 a.m., seven days a week, at Dublin Airport, as well as at offices in Cork, Limerick and Rosslare to facilitate those arriving through other ports of entry.  This whole-of-government operation has received and processed over 25,000 people under the EU's temporary protection directive over the last two months.  The compassion and professionalism of colleagues involved is a great credit to them and reflects the response of the whole country to Ukraine.</p> <p>  Returning to Covid, as the country entered the first lockdown in March 2020, the Department was acutely aware of the huge difficulties and fear that restricting people&rsquo;s movement could bring to those at risk of domestic abuse.  Colleagues quickly developed and implemented an inter-agency plan, including the Still Here public awareness campaign.  This was a collaboration with front-line services in the public sector and in civil society in order to reassure victims that the practical supports they needed would still be available.  Additional financial supports were provided to front-line NGO partners and measures were put in place across the sector, including through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Operation Faoiseamh.  The Judiciary and the Courts Service also prioritised domestic abuse cases and provided for remote hearings for protection orders where necessary.  The Irish Prison Service risk-assessed those being released from prisons and the Legal Aid Board established a helpline to provide prompt legal advice and legal representation in court where needed.  The success of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s community engagement and policing strategy through the pandemic has rightly been recognised and I know the committee also recently heard from the Policing Authority about its important oversight work, which has had significant value in maintaining public trust.</p> <p>  There are a large number of agencies in this Vote but I want to mention in particular Forensic Science Ireland, as its long-planned, state-of-the-art laboratory HQ is nearing the final stages of construction.  I am pleased to report that despite the impact of the restrictions on construction activities in the earlier phases of the project, the lab is now on-track for completion this year within its budget of &euro;99.5 million.  This new facility will be one of the most sophisticated pieces of public infrastructure ever constructed in this country and will provide the hard-working staff of Forensic Science Ireland, with a high-spec, purpose-built facility, achieving the highest standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage.  It represents a very significant investment in our criminal justice system and the future of the Forensic Science Ireland.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to Ms McCaffrey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caron McCaffrey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#B00400"><p>As the Secretary General has outlined, it has been a truly remarkable and challenging period for communities across the globe and Covid- 19 has also had a major impact on the Irish Prison Service as we sought to keep all those who live and work in our prisons safe.  As a service, we have proven to be adaptable, flexible, resilient and highly innovative and our staff have embraced the challenges presented to us by the pandemic with professionalism and dedication.</p> <p>  The year 2020 saw the introduction of new and innovative methods of service delivery, including the delivery of teleservices for chaplaincy and psychology; maintaining links with family and friends virtually using video link technology; the introduction of electronic money transfer systems in partnership with An Post; and the introduction of in-cell telephones to help prisoners keep in contact with their loved ones and to support their mental health.  As a result, we were able to face down the challenges of Covid-19 and continue to provide the best possible level of service to prisoners in our care and to their families.  In early 2021, it became clear to all of us that living with Covid-19 was going to be a reality for some time.  Many of these new systems introduced in response to Covid-19 have now become essential tools for the delivery of prisoner services and for supporting prisoners, and have been permanently retained as we have moved into a less restricted environment.</p> <p>  Preventing the spread of infection into prisons and keeping those in our care safe did have an impact on expenditure and on the costs of providing prisoner services in 2020, with additional costs relating to the purchase of personal protective equipment for staff and prisoners, additional infection control costs, and healthcare and specialist cleaning supply costs.  This was necessary expenditure to mitigate against the risk posed by the virus and our infection control measures were central in our success in effectively managing the threat posed by Covid-19 in a prison setting.</p> <p>  In 2020, additional funding was provided to the Irish Prison Service under the Government economic stimulus package.  This allowed for a number of important projects to be advanced, such as building roof repairs, CCTV and security system upgrades, nationwide carbon reduction LED lighting replacement and upgrades to fire alarms.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges presented by Covid-19 since 2020, the Irish Prison Service has continued to deliver on the strategic actions set out in our current strategic plan, including our programme of prison modernisation.  Despite the impact on the construction sector due to the closure of construction sites at certain times, significant progress was made during 2020 on the capital development project at Limerick Prison.  Work on the project has continued in 2021 and 2022 and the project remains within budget and is expected to be completed later this year.  The project will provide quality accommodation for prisoners and enhanced services, and will provide an additional 90 male prison spaces and 22 additional female prison spaces.</p> <p>  Over the lifetime of our strategy, we have continued to implement a programme of reform within our service.  We continue to work closely with our key stakeholders to enhance the supports available for prisoners, including supporting prisoners on their transition from prison back into their communities.  As we emerge from this global pandemic, work is now turning to the development of a new strategic plan for our service through which we will build on recent reforms and take account of our experiences and learning from the past two years.</p> <p>  I can go into further detail as the members require.</p></speech>

It has been a very difficult time for everyone, given the role of the Garda, the Prison Service and the Department.  I thank them for all the work that was done over that difficult period.</p> <p>  On the issue of capital projects, Ms McPhillips referred to the roll-out of the Forensic Science Ireland's laboratory headquarters, which is on time and will remain within cost.  I understand the project will cost &euro;99.5 million.  Does that include fully kitting out the facility and having it fully operational?  When is the project likely to be finalised?</p> <p>  During the transition of evidence from one facility to another, the chain of evidence cannot be broken.  How is that planned to be dealt with to ensure there are no gaps in the transition period?  Has that been planned for?  Over what time period will that take place?  What level of planning has gone into that at this stage?</p></speech>

A lot of planning has gone into that.  The project is well advanced.  It is 79% complete at this stage.  The building is watertight.  A reasonable amount of it has been kitted out.  There were 235 people on-site at the building in February, which I thought was a fascinating number.  It is a massive project.</p> <p>  There is a detailed transition plan.  The move will start in the third quarter of this year.  The building will be handed over from the contractor in or around August, we hope.  Then, from August until the end of the year, there will be a detailed transition to move the existing operation out, as well as the accreditations which are necessary for each part of the system.  Obviously, all the scientific end of it has to be accredited to the international standard.  There will therefore be a certain amount of dual use of the existing laboratory in the Phoenix Park and then the transition to the new one.  The director, Chris Enright, and the staff of the laboratory are absolutely-----</p></speech>

It will not be accredited until the end of the year - roughly December.  It is hard to be exactly precise about that because it will be necessary to wait for the accreditation.</p></speech>

In my constituency, for instance, we had a project which went on for eight years.  A huge amount of additional money had to be paid by the Department as a result of that delay.</p></speech>

Contracts were signed and an issue then arose about whether to proceed with the contract.  Full interest was paid on the purchase price for a period of, I think, six years.  Interest of six years was paid.  It was one of those projects.</p> <p>  I wonder about the mechanism in place for projects from start to finish.  The Office of Public Works is involved in some of these projects.  There is also the issue of buildings which are no longer being used, for instance, we had problems with many old Garda stations.  The issues then arises of the existing building housing the forensic science laboratory.  What is the process for dealing with projects from start to finish?  In view of the fact that building costs are changing by the day, is there a need to have a process in place so that decisions are made in a timely manner, rather than waiting for two or three years for a decision to be taken?  It should be taken from start to finish.</p></speech>

In terms of capital projects generally, we are guided by the public spending code, which is our bible in these things.  We have to follow all the requirements in the public spending code.  We rely to a great extent on OPW in relation to acquiring sites and the verification of whether a site is a suitable and meets all the requirements of the particular project.  The different agencies in the Department have slightly different approaches to these things.  The Courts Service has a huge capital programme.  The Accounting Officer for the Courts Service is responsible for that.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a big capital programme, as do the prisons, and the Garda Commissioner is the accounting officer for that.</p></speech>

In that case, contracts were sent to the Office of the Chief State solicitor and the OPW to sign off on them.  There was a gap of two years between the contracts being sent and being signed.

Contracts are important and the devil is in the detail, so it is necessary to go through that.</p> <p>  In terms of us doing a review of the whole capital piece, what we did in preparation for the national development plan, NDP, was look across the whole sector to see what the needs were.  Then we looked at what budget we would get and what we could do.  However, we rely on the OPW a lot in relation to those matters.</p></speech>

We hope to get the report from the justice committee on it.  In terms of the projects, the Deputy is absolutely right that there will be a real implementation challenge and a huge number of regulations to be made once the legislation is done.  On the preparatory work to implement the measures, there is a huge amount of change involved for the oversight bodies in particular, but also for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department itself.  We have an implementation project.  I will ask Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan to come in on this because it is under his remit.  We have approximately seven individual projects, one of which is in relation to GSOC and the changes that will be needed there.  We are doing a review of how the process will operate.

We have a team established solely to look after its implementation.  Ever before the legislation is fully enacted, we have already commenced the work in scoping out what will need to be done under each of the seven or eight projects, the number of which will depend on how we decide to break it out.  All of the agencies will be involved in that.  At some point, we will need to get external advice to tease out the implementation details and make sure the whole thing fits together because all of the different parts in intersect with each other.  We need to make sure they are all properly lined out.</p> <p>  Even as we are hopefully moving through the Oireachtas with the enactment of the legislation, as things may emerge from detailed implementation planning, we will be able to bring that back to the Oireachtas and explain how this or that is going to work out or maybe some tweaks need to be made here or there.

In the 2021 appropriation account, which has just been finalised, the land will be reflected at the current valuation of &euro;6.5 million.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if this has been flagged to other State agencies.  At various times in the past five or six years, we have had discussions with Fingal County Council, IDA Ireland and, since its establishment, the Land Development Agency on a number of occasions.  There is interest in it but we regard it as a strategic State asset.  As the Deputy said, it is fully serviced and quite close to Dublin Airport.  We definitely have a strategic interest in a portion of the site from a criminal justice perspective but we would be open to discussions on the rest of the site.  We have signalled that to the relevant agencies.  The Land Development Agency, in particular, is keeping it as an option.  I will yield to the experts on this, and their view is it would not be suitable for housing but it may be suitable for decanting other strategic infrastructure from other areas.  They are keeping that under review but it is more of a long-term consideration.</p></speech>

In 2020 there were 2,399 cases in total of compensation claims pending against the Department, with 1,855 of those relating to in-cell sanitation.  What is the up-to-date position on that?

Significant progress has been made on concluding those claims.  There have been 2,773 claims received, of which 2,040 are concluded.  I suppose the contingent liability that the State Claims Agency put against that scheme was quite high at over &euro;30 million but the expectation now is the scheme will be concluded at around &euro;15 million.  There are specific caps in place for compensation and there are also caps in place regarding legal fees that can be paid.</p></speech>

My understanding is the hepatitis C treatment programme takes approximately 12 weeks.  Is there a detailed programme in place in each of the prisons to provide that care to prisoners while they are in prison?

It is more prevalent among the prisoner population due to issues related to addiction, high-risk behaviour and some people's inability to access services.  The HSE has a national programme and over 5,000 patients in the State are now being treated with highly effective direct acting antiviral drugs for hepatitis C.  Professor Aidan McCormick, the HSE clinical lead for the hepatitis C programme, has engaged directly with us and is committed to giving access to all communities, including prisoners, and that is very important for us.</p> <p>  We now have a process in place with the HSE and pilot projects will be rolled out in Cork and Limerick prisons in the first instance to ensure we can provide a robust and comprehensive hepatitis C programme, similar to what is happening in the community, and where this can lead to a point where the condition is curable for people entering prison.  During the course of this year the programme will roll out in the two prisons and be extended.</p></speech>

I do not have much time.  I would like to touch on the ongoing debacle relating to and the set of debacles that resulted in the killing of Shane O'Farrell in 2011.  In 2019, a scoping inquiry was established instead of the full public inquiry that both Houses of the Oireachtas had unanimously called for.  Considering that it is now 2022, and I assume that the witnesses will not be able to give us any sense of when that the scoping inquiry will be concluded, does the Department accept that scoping inquiries in respect of matters such as that to which I refer are not an appropriate way to provide answers?  Does it also accept that the scoping inquiry in this case has become just another blockage for the family of Shane O'Farrell and for those of us who want to find out precisely how his tragic death was allowed to happen?</p></speech>

That includes a new contract management system to allow us to start planning at the earliest possible stage for a contract to be awarded.  We have a comprehensive corporate procurement plan.  We have engaged external professional procurement consultants to assist us in ensuring we are fully compliant.</p> <p>  In 2020, the deputy and Comptroller and Auditor General appointed 16 contracts to a total value of &euro;15.15 million, where contracts were rolled over.  That compares with 26 such contracts in 2019 so there has been an improvement.  The value in 2019 was &euro;18.5 million so our figures are going in the right direction.</p> <p>  Of those 16 contracts, five involved the Office of Government Procurement.  I can inform the Deputy that all of those contracts are now in place.  Eleven cases were being managed by the Irish Prison Service and I can assure the Deputy that all of those contracts are now in place, with the exception of one which is currently out to tender for a value of &euro;93,000.  I can also inform the Deputy that we continue to make improvements in this regard.  The value of our non-compliant procurement radically reduced in 2021 to &euro;5.6 million.  So far this year, only two contracts are non-compliant.  It is an area of particular focus for the prison service and we have made good progress in that regard.</p></speech>

Are any of the contracts under Vote 21 or Vote 24 long running?  Are any of them contracts that have been in place for more than five years?  I know Ms McCaffrey said some of those contracts have been put out to tender, which is good and probably best practice, but have any of those contracts been rolling for more than five years?</p></speech>

The Probation Service is one of our many agencies but it is a particularly successful one in terms of what it does.  I might ask Mr. O'Sullivan, who looks after governance of the criminal agencies, to come in but we have a governance agreement in place that is fully compliant.  Mr. O'Sullivan may wish to expand on that.</p></speech>

We also have an annual performance delivery agreement.  Under those arrangements, we meet the head of the Probation Service at least twice a year and back that up with a constant stream of regular informal engagement and support.  In fact, the Minister met the Probation Service and senior team on-site in the past week or so and had a very good engagement.  We obviously set targets and the resource allocations, and work closely with the Probation Service to consider where it is going strategically in the coming years.</p> <p>  There are also service level agreements for the provision of ICT and financial services.  The Probation Service relies on the Department for a lot of those central support services.</p></speech>

I will come back to the Deputy in a moment.  The top offences referred to the service in 2020 related to drugs offences.  Approximately 75% of referrals related to drugs offences, theft, assault, public order, road traffic and burglary.  The number of offenders dealt with in the community in 2020 was 15,500.  The figure for 2021 was 15,400.  Some 9,300 probation reports were completed for court in 2020 and 10,000 were completed in 2021.  That shows a considerable volume of business.</p></speech>

I am struck by the number of claims that have been made by prisoners for injury and other actions involving prisoners.  There are 445 claims of that kind and more than &euro;2 million has been awarded in compensation.  There are 107 civil claims for injuries received while on duty and other issues involving prison staff, which is a high number.  There are 110 claims through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal arising out of injuries received by prison staff.  Have our guests the figures for recent years that we could use as a comparison?  Has that trend increased?  The number of prisoner claims seems high.  Have those numbers increased or decreased?</p></speech>

I will follow up on that point.  As I mentioned earlier, many of the claims by prisoners relate to in-cell sanitation.  We have received a significant number of in-cell sanitation claims and they account for many of the claims made by prisoners.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, our staff do become injured on duty.  There are some slips, trips and falls but it is obviously a difficult environment.  Our staff are required to break up altercations between prisoners and become injured while doing so.  They are also, unfortunately, assaulted from time to time.  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is a specific scheme to deal with prison officers who have been-----</p></speech>

I have many questions about prisons.  The Joint Committee on Justice recently spoke to Ms McCaffrey and Mr. Black.  It is good to see them again.</p> <p>  Much of what we have been talking about relates to the costs and benefits of the rehabilitation programmes and the emphasis on the rehabilitation of prisoners with a particular focus on libraries, education and access to education.  The spending review for 2021, the Review of the Programme of Work and Training in the Irish Prison Service, was produced by Ms Caroline Finn.</p><p>It states it does not represent the official views of the Department or Minister for Justice, so I am not sure what its status is.  Will Ms McCaffrey clarify its status?</p></speech>

We want to ensure that what we are doing at a prison level is aligned to what is happening within the employment market.  We put that forward as a spending review so that we could learn and improve our work training activities.</p></speech>

The second key finding states: &ldquo;Approximately 30% of the prison population take part in Work and Training at any given time, though this is not the only structured activity available in prisons.&rdquo;  That figure seems low.  Is it a fair reflection?</p></speech>

Within a prison, you may go to school for the day or you may go to work and training.  In some cases, you may go to school in the morning and to work and training in the afternoon.  Obviously, from a Prison Service perspective, we encourage as many prisoners as we can to participate in work, training and education.  There has been an impact because of Covid, unfortunately, but we are now back at a stage where our workshops and education facilities are operating at maximum capacity.  One of the core functions of the Prison Service is to help people gain an educational qualification or a work training qualification so that they are much more employable on release.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, because of Covid, we had to reduce the number of people in our workshops to ensure social distancing, but we are certainly now back to ensuring our workshops and schools have as many prisoners as can possibly be held within a work training activity or classroom.</p></speech>

I am concerned about equal access for all prisoners to those programmes, and prisoners on protection in particular.  What proportion of prisoners on protection have access to education, training and work?</p></speech>

The majority of prisoners self-declare that they require protection; it is not a regime imposed on them by the Prison Service.  It is much more difficult for people to access education and work training under those circumstances.  However, we make every effort to ensure they have access to activities.  In certain prisons, schools would be open on certain mornings or afternoons for protection prisoners.  Similarly, teachers in some prisons go to protection landings to ensure those prisoners can engage in education.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point Ms McCaffrey made about self-declaration, but the State is paying for these prisoners to be in prison and it is part of the prison rules, and of the Nelson Mandela Rules, that people should have access to education and training.  That is a key part of the strategy.</p></speech>

One of the critical things we did earlier in the Covid pandemic was to introduce in-cell learning and a blended model.  That is something we are working hard to build on.  I might ask my colleague-----</p></speech>

There is a cost to that and to providing the digital tools that are necessary for it.  The Prison Service could come under criticism at a later stage for having invested in the sorts of digital tools, such as tablets and so on, that would be necessary to deliver that and I do not think it should be criticised for that.  I am trying to pre-empt that criticism.  A consistent recommendation in the report of the Inspector of Prisons is that digital tools such as tablets be made available to prisoners in order that interaction can take place with education facilities outside the prisons to ameliorate some of the difficulties we are talking about.</p></speech>

We are planning a trip, along with some of our colleagues from the Department, to look at what has been done there and to see if we can build on what we have done during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I certainly believe a central focus of our new strategy will be on ensuring the tools are available to prisoners within their cells.</p></speech>

This issue arises in the context of the different programmes for prisons&rsquo; officers, whether they relate to regime management plans or the organisation of the prisons more generally.  The library seems to be the first facility to go every time, with the additional gym instructor being cancelled.  Access to education is always the first thing to be removed.  On our recent visit, we talked about staff being occupied by court visits and so on.  That is a necessary part of the process and it would not be a solution to have remote hearings only, and perhaps the courts should come to the prisons if there is an overwhelming issue in that regard.  Are the regime management plans, following lockdown and from now on, task specific or office specific?  For example, are staff attached specifically to committals or to the library?  Is there an opportunity for enhanced efficiency?  If, for example, committals take up only a part of the day, could that person then be assigned to a different task, such as opening the library again?</p></speech>

Regrettably, there are unpredictable draws on staff and that has an impact on the services.  The purpose of the regime management plan is to give as much predictability as we can to services so that they know in advance that they are not going to be in a position to do face-to-face work and can plan their administrative work around it.  Some of the difficulties with closures of libraries earlier in the Covid pandemic were infection control issues, such as the sharing and cleaning of books, and that constituted a significant part of the closures.  I might ask my colleague-----</p></speech>

Maintaining all the services is a difficulty because, as the director general pointed out, there is a draw on staff to carry out necessary court escorts and so on.  We have also had to assign staff temporarily to Covid duties over recent years.  I am reassured by the Minister, as recently as yesterday, having made clear that in order to address this systemic problem, she wishes to seek to secure, through the Estimates process this year, additional resources for the Prison Service.  From my perspective, that should ensure we will be able to provide psychology, education and work training services on a more optimal basis because it is a challenge to maintain them all daily.</p></speech>

What oversight does the Department of Justice have of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report on design and performance indicators in policing?  What work is being done in this area?</p></speech>

Those are very exacting performance meetings every month.  They assist with where the Garda is at, what is going on and where it needs to get to.  I might ask Mr. O'Sullivan to expand on this if it is okay because he oversees the governance side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#H00200"><p>I will just make a few additional comments.  We have worked very closely as part of developing our performance arrangements with all the agencies to integrate the work we are doing around performance targets and KPIs with the work the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Revised Estimates volume.  As the committee knows, in the Revised Estimates volume each Vote appears alongside key outputs and public service activities and measurements.  We now ensure what we are engaging with the agency on is lined up to what is appearing in that so there is a clear link between the money that has been voted and the type of indicators being provided.</p> <p>  Performance targets in the area of policing are obviously a complex area.  There is clearly a long way to go and I think all the agencies will accept that.  The other thing to say is there are other important actors in the oversight environment for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, principally the Policing Authority which through the annual policing plan engages with the Commissioner and his senior team around their targets under the policing plan and also holds them to exacting account.  It takes part in the monthly resource meeting the Secretary General has referred to.  Ourselves, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely on managing wider resource issues and what kind of impacts there are.  It is internationally recognised as an area where there is more work to be done and obviously ensuring we do not skew activity by putting in indicators that are easy to measure but are not necessarily what communities want.  A lot of it goes beyond numbers.  The Garda has done much work around assessing community confidence in its services and sometimes that is at least as important as whether or not a particular number of incidents is reported or whatever.  There is an awful lot of work in the space but more to do.</p></speech>

On the mechanisms in place for the Department, if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not meet its performance indicators, what type of procedures are in place, or how is that being dealt with?</p></speech>

However, more generally, what you have is an iterative process, and this is something the Policing Authority would speak to as well, where you are working through the issue and asking the organisation to go back and review what it is doing to try to reach the target or maybe identify why the target has not been met and what are the factors.  Usually there are a lot of external factors that would impact on levels of activity so there is kind of an iterative process rather than a command and control one.  At the end of the day, the Commissioner remains accountable and responsible for the performance reports and we work through the issues with them as they arise.</p></speech>

The Garda is the envy of its counterparts worldwide as a growing service, both with respect to sworn members and also civilians.  There is lots more expertise in the Garda staff cohort as well.  The growth of that is really important.  Digital and IT is an important area from our point of view to get the best value, to ensure the staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the best tools available to them and to combat the growth in ever more sophisticated cybercrime, etc., but also just ordinary crime.  Every element of crime has a digital element to it now and garda&iacute; need the tools to combat that.</p></speech>

That related to the fourth anti-money laundering directive.  There was a gap in between the time it was transposed.  The Commission had instituted legal proceeding and we ended up with a fine.  We have done a lot of work on our transposition of EU measures generally but on that one, a fine of &euro;2 million was paid to the Commission in 2020 due to the delayed transposition of the directive.  It referred to a period between July 2017 and December 2019 that related to the enactment of both the primary and secondary legislation for that directive.  I should add there are two more directives since.  It is an ever-evolving area and we are constantly trying to keep up to date on money laundering.  It is a difficult area and one the EU is very active in.</p></speech>

It was an area where some significant issues arose in recent years, especially during Covid-19.  I would certainly like to have a look at what the Department has to say about non-compliance.</p> <p>  Turning to the D&oacute;chas Centre during Covid-19, two reports were carried out but they have not been published.  The most recent response I received to a parliamentary question stated that, "based on legal advice received by my Department, it is not proposed to publish the report at this time".  Somebody said the Prison Service did an exceptional job in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  One of these reports concerns Covid-19 and the experience in the D&oacute;chas Centre.  I cannot understand why that report would not be published.  It should be published.  Ms McPhillips might tell us what is meant by &ldquo;at this time&rdquo;?  The other report may or may not be linked to the original report.  We would need to see it to evaluate that aspect.  Is it intended, at some point, to publish these reports?  What is the impediment to publishing a report relating to Covid-19?</p></speech>

There is also a separate process that I cannot go into.  Between all that, the strong legal advice is that we cannot publish these reports at this time.  We are examining them to see if there may be elements we can publish, because we do want this information in the public domain.  We also want to implement the recommendations.  We are not, however, in a position to publish the report at this time based on the legal advice.</p></speech>

Moving on to Thornton Hall, the new valuation for the site is &euro;6.2 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to the valuation of &euro;2.7 million.  In this context, there is the land itself, but also the significant development of a road and lighting at the site, which means it is now fully serviced.  That is my understanding.  Can Ms McPhillips provide the methodology to explain the variance between the &euro;2.7 million and &euro;6.2 million valuations?  We already know there is a significant issue regarding the historical cost of the site.  What is the methodology?  How are the valuations so different?</p></speech>

We get expert valuation people to do it.  In 2015, it was valued at &euro;2.4 million.  It was then valued in 2020 at &euro;2.7 million.  Probably because of Covid-19, but I am only speculating in this regard, that was a paper-based, desk exercise.  It did seem to us to be a reasonable valuation in respect of the increase in land values between 2015 and 2017.  On foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s views on this issue, we sought a further valuation and that was &euro;6.7 million.</p></speech>

Our interest is in roughly 40 acres.  The remainder of the site is available for development by the State.  We flagged this in 2015 and 2016 to Fingal County Council and we had a detailed discussion about the site's proximity, or lack thereof, to Ashbourne.  The council feels it is outside their zones in respect of being suitable for housing, and I yield to the experts on this matter.  The land is a little bit distant from both those things.  We also flagged the availability of the land to the IDA, which has looked at it several times.  More recently, when the LDA was established, we flagged the availability of land with that organisation as well and we have had discussions in this regard.  Ms McCaffrey and I met with representatives of the LDA in recent weeks to discuss this issue.  Additionally, in the context of the war in Ukraine, we have also flagged the availability of the site.  If the land is not suitable for housing, and again other people will decide the suitability in this regard, then it may also not be suitable for modular housing in the context of the refugee crisis either.  The site is, however, suitable for other developments.</p></speech>

The consultants who supported us to do the transformation were EY, but the Department very much led the process.  That was completed at the time.  Elements of the Department were unaffected by that process and we always knew we would have to return to them.  The immigration area is one of them.

This committee had requested an investigation into voluntary mess committees in prisons.  Our inquiries arose following protected disclosures from a whistleblower.  I will direct my questions to Ms. McPhillips from the Department first.  Was that whistleblower, Noel McGree, directly engaged in the course of this report?</p></speech>

Those funds should have come under staff development.  I have actually abolished the prisoner assistance programme fund, PAPF.  It was based on the profits generated from our tuck shops.  The money was primarily spent to address prisoner hardship, on prisoner programmes and to support our community return and community support programmes.  I was of the view that selling items in the tuck shop as an economic activity was not really what the Prison Service is about.  It is a service to prisoners.  We have changed the manner in which our tuck shops operate and, instead of selling at recommended retail prices, we now sell products at cost plus 5%.  The programmes that were previously supported by that fund now receive Exchequer funding.  We received Exchequer funding for prisoner programmes and to support the community support and community return programmes.  However, we continue to sell tobacco at cost price.  That generates enough money to allow governors to support prisoners who find themselves in economic hardship.</p></speech>

It is money collected to reimburse the costs of the meals provided.  This is not public money that we are talking about.  I think the Deputy is referring to a staff recognition event that took place in Mountjoy Prison, for which the mess committee, from its own funds, purchased a small amount of alcohol.  I would clarify that the mess in Mountjoy Prison is not within the confines of the prison.  It is outside the prison, just inside the main gate.  I will further clarify that there is not a provision in the Civil Service code that prohibits alcohol being consumed at an event.  I can clarify that there is certainly no alcohol being consumed within our prisons.  This was a specific staff recognition event that took place outside of work hours and the moneys involved were the staff's own moneys, not voted or public moneys.</p></speech>

There is an initial disclosure, or perhaps multiple disclosures, depending on the circumstances.  First of all, they are assessed.  They are then investigated by an external concern.  These issues may sometimes morph into or may be factors in more wide-ranging systemic examinations that the Department does or causes to be done of specific issues.  In that instance, there may not be the read-across from the initial process around the discloser's own concerns into the bigger issue.  However, obviously, the issues are taken into account.</p></speech>

Obviously, sometimes the information they provide is good and sometimes it is not.  I understand that prison is a very challenging environment and staff are dealing with very challenging situations at times and all of that.  However, prisons would have a high level of autonomy and Ms McPhillips outlined that in her briefing notes, which I read yesterday.  I would be aware of that from Portlaoise and Midlands Prison, which is just up the road from me.  Some whistleblowers seem to go through the consequences of the whistleblowing - I suppose I could phrase it that way.  For some whistleblowers who I have spoken to, the turn of events since and the outworking of the cases would confirm that they suffered enormously.</p></speech>

We cannot have a situation where staff that come forward are bullied, browbeaten or forced out of their job.  We cannot have situations such as that.  That has happened, unfortunately.  I will not name any specific cases.  There is one case that I am aware of and have followed very carefully.  The consequences for that person and her family have been absolutely enormous.  The Prison Service has a duty of care.  It is not like a lot of other jobs.  It is not like being on a building site or working in here or in an office.  It is different.  I just would make that point to Ms McPhillips and Ms McCaffrey.  Going forward, we have to do these things differently.</p></speech>

We have identified 112 acres of the site as available for future development and we are looking to maintain 40 acres, as the Secretary General mentioned earlier.  We have very limited availability to build on the existing footprint of the prison estate.  We are putting a new wing on Limerick Prison at the moment.  There is potential for wings to be added to some of our existing prisons, should capital money allow, but we do not have any land on which we would be on a position to build a larger prison and I suppose we-----</p></speech>

One of the issues that has bedevilled Mountjoy Prison, and one of the reasons we wanted to move to greenfield site, is the issue of drugs being thrown over the yards and its proximity to the canals.  Certainly, that remains a problem.  Many of our prisons are inner-city prisons.  The greenfield site offers an especially secure location for the construction of any new prison.</p></speech>

I think prisons did an incredible job, especially in the first wave, of protecting prisoners and staff in overcrowded congregated settings from what could have been an absolute catastrophe.  It came at a significant price, however, and there is an opportunity to learn from that.  It is clear from going through all the reports of the Inspector of Prisons that prisoners reported very significant information about how not to get Covid but much less information about what to do if they had it and how that was to be managed.  There was a significant mental health impact from the isolation that was necessary, especially in the first wave, including the missing of family visits.  There is an opportunity there.</p> <p>  I would like to refer to the staff survey that was done in 2021 by the Office of the Inspector of Prisons.  The staff recommended in-cell telephones and video calls to improve relationships with family members and to improve mental health.  This would have obvious benefits for education and training and access to mental health supports, which is a big problem irrespective of Covid.  That recommendation came from the staff.  Sometimes one is criticised for providing services to prisoners, but this is a staff recommendation.  I want to amplify it from the staff survey.</p> <p>  There is an ongoing concern about the mental health impact of the current quarantine experience.  Ms McPhillips is aware of that but I want to flag it to her because it will come back.  These things can come back in many different ways from a cost perspective to the State.  In terms of the directions that were possible under the Act, it was July 2021 before a direction was given.  However, the sunset side of things is not clear with regard to unlocking and unwinding the restrictions on exercise and so on.  Ms McPhillips is aware of that also but these are the difficulties.</p> <p>  We spoke in great detail about D&oacute;chas at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, but the overcrowding in D&oacute;chas and the refurbishment that is necessary are very significant.  There is an ongoing problem about the profile of people there with overwhelming addiction, mental health and welfare issues, many of whom should not be there but need to be in supported facilities.  I am not sure where the Department is moving and whether sufficient departmental priority is being given to being able to move to that.  We have gone through it in detail at the justice committee but I just wanted to highlight it here again.</p> <p>  Deputies have talked about the cost to the State of the slopping-out cases.  It was &euro;1.5 million in compensation and another &euro;500,000 in legal costs for in-cell sanitation for 2020 and 2019.  It comes with the overcrowding problem.  In the Inspector of Prisons report on Arbour Hill, one can see the effect of a doubled-up bunk being in a single cell with a toilet, with no screen between the toilet and the lower bunk.  Prisoners report trying to use the toilet on the landing for each other's dignity.  These are ongoing very visible and obvious problems that have to be addressed, especially where there are not separate sanitation options.</p> <p>  With regard to the priority areas under the regime management plan, RMP, there will be work on training as an essential service.  That will be prioritised.</p> <p>  I want to leave prisons for a second.  The money laundering directive came from the EU in 2015.  Ms McPhillips said there was a difficulty between July 2017 and 2019 in the transposition of it.  Will she clarify that?  It was a 2015 directive.  It should have been implemented by 2017.</p></speech>

This is a very significant event for us.  This is the only time the State has been fined in the case of a measure which we were responsible for implementing.  It is very complex legislation.

As the Secretary General said, it was part of an overall suite of measures, including perhaps other EU measures which had more pressing timelines even at that point.  The other complication in this instance was that the State fell foul of a change in European Commission practice in regard to the enforcement penalties beginning in January 2017.  Previously, where a member state had remedied the infringement by the time the case came to court, the Commission would not seek a fine.  The Commission changed its practice so that by the time this came to court - and this is not an excuse obviously but the context-----</p></speech>

We would have been aware of that but I appreciate the point.</p> <p>  I will go back to Ms McPhillips who made a comment earlier that caused me concern so I want to make sure I understand what she means.  She said that we are constantly keeping up with money laundering directives, and that there were subsequent directives.  That phrase "constantly keeping up" raises a very large flag for me.  Given what we are seeing with Russia, the difficulties throughout Europe and our own exposure even though it is very small going by those figures from the Department of Finance, I do not like that phrase from Ms McPhillips.  Would she like to clarify or explain what she means?</p></speech>

It is a constant iteration and the EU will continue to iterate it and we want it to because we have to keep on top of this.</p></speech>

The ODCE was to be replaced by the Corporate Enforcement Agency.  The expectation was that would happen in January.

What role did the Department have in the MOU?  Has it been signed at this stage?  When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was in recently, we were told it would be within weeks.  A huge level of frustration was expressed when it was discovered in FOI.  We are seeing cases, for example, the FAI case.  People are wondering where it is.

We took that away to make sure we have the learnings for the future, but also to look at what we can do now to support people with their mental health.  We are looking at group psychology sessions to support people because of the impact of isolation and quarantine, which were absolutely necessary in the context of Covid outbreaks within the prisons but which, regrettably, were quite impactful on people.  We are very attuned to that.</p></speech>

The oversight elements that are in place at the moment in all the agencies have been added individually over the years.  GSOC was created in approximately 2006 and the Policing Authority in around 2015, so they are piecemeal.  The intention of the Bill is to make that coherent.  It does not make it much simpler, but it makes the processes more coherent.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there is a community-based project in Dublin and one in Tipperary, but it does not seem to be widespread throughout the State.

As I recall, Judge Mary Martin promoted this approach a decade ago.  It is acknowledged that it is a successful approach to reparation, which is very important for victims, but also in moving people away from reoffending.  Why can the process not be accelerated?  Ms McCaffrey has a problem with prison space and people have to be doubled up in cells that are not suitable.  It would be better if the cells where there is slopping out were empty and we did not have prisoners in them.  Most people would agree with that, but because of the pressure for space within the Prison Service, with approximately 3,500 prisoners, people are being committed to prison who will reoffend.  Why are more programmes of restorative justice not being rolled out?  It is a benefit, even if we only look at it from a financial position.  That is one concern, but reducing crime and antisocial activity and improving community safety should be the big considerations.  Why is this process not being driven on more quickly across the State?</p></speech>

A review of penal policy is nearing completion at the moment and that will set out the guiding principles for our priorities.  Restorative justice is one of those priorities and a sparing approach to the use of imprisonment.  Prison is a sanction of last resort.  You are quite right, Chair, about the need to invest in restorative justice on a consistent basis in terms of its application across the country.  Announcing it, as we said earlier-----</p></speech>

It is frustrating.  People are being sent to prison and while I am not advocating locking people up and throwing away the key, the system does not allow for reparation for victims.  I recall one case where an individual had robbed four or five different households and they got a number of weeks in prison and then they came out.</p><p>I remember totting up the amount of money stolen as this detail came out in the court case.  Surely it would have been better for the person to repay the money and make reparations to the victims.  If the people who had been burgled or assaulted received some compensation from the perpetrator or if there had to have been a restorative justice element of some kind, that would have been better.  This has been proven internationally and everyone in the Garda up to the Garda Commissioner knows it.  While I do not want to misrepresent him, my understanding is the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, wants it.  Senior garda&iacute; at all levels believe this is the way to go.

It is absolutely vital in addressing criminality and addressing people's behaviours, surfacing the issue that has caused the criminality in the first place.

My understanding is there was a particular issue with prisoners needing to be taken from Cork Prison to an outpatient clinic in Cork University Hospital for their care.  I had understood it was proposed that all treatment would take place within prisons rather than having to incur the additional cost of taking prisoners to a medical facility.  What is the proposed programme for hepatitis C?  As it is a 12-week programme, it is an ideal opportunity.  There will be significant long-term savings in the cost of medical treatment.</p> <p>  What is the proposal for the old prison in Cork?  Obviously, there is a maintenance cost associated with a facility not being used.  What are the plans for that property now?</p></speech>

The intention is that the treatment plan will be devised over an eight-week period and, as the Deputy points out, it will be extremely cost effective in the management of hepatitis C.  Based on our discussions with Professor Aiden McCormick, the lead for the national hepatitis C treatment programme, the intention is to have a particular tailored programme for people in prison.  The Deputy is quite right.  One of the difficulties that bedevils us is we have a population of people in custody whose health status does not compare favourably with the general community.  Therefore, taking them out to external secondary services for tertiary care is very costly in terms of the resources we need to assign, in terms of drawing staff away from prison.  We are very anxious to develop any clinical services we can provide within the prison.  This is one of the services we feel we can pilot successfully, it is hoped in Cork and Limerick, and extend nationally subsequently in a very cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

Our intention is to have both pilots operational this year in Cork and Limerick.

We have had this operational through a collaboration between Mountjoy clinical staff, our staff, and the Mater Hospital on an interim basis for a number of years.

Essentially, we just need to agree with our colleagues in the HSE on the treatment plan that will be rolled out for prisoners in those prisons.  We ensure the prisoners who require treatment receive that treatment.  We evaluate the effectiveness of it in the context of clinical care and in the context of the savings that will accrue both to the prison service in terms of escorts and to the HSE in terms of clogging up its services.  I would hope that, early next year, we would seek to roll it out to all our prisons.</p></speech>

When we constructed the new prison on the site of Cork Prison, we decommissioned the old prison, so we are not maintaining that building.  The accommodation in Cork Prison was the worst quality of accommodation we had within the estate before it was replaced.  It had a very limited regime of activities.  The new prison has been built and the old one has been decommissioned.  We have not moved to demolish it because demolition would cost several million euro.  It is quite expensive to demolish a building.  It remains decommissioned, but obviously it is a site that could potentially be used in the future by the Prison Service.</p></speech>

All of the attendant services are available on site.  We have a school.  We have work training activities.  There are no plans in the short term for future development on the Mountjoy site.  We spent some money recently on the training unit, which is also on the Mountjoy site.  We had closed it in 2017 to repurpose it as an older persons' unit.  Unfortunately, just as it was finished in December 2019, Covid hit and we did not think it was the right decision to put all our vulnerable elderly prisoners in that accommodation.  We are moving now towards its reopening.  That has been fully refurbished and decorated.</p></speech>

There were certain scenarios that could be accommodated and some that could not.  However, I acknowledge the work of the Prison Service in engaging with both families and public representatives in that regard.  That is good news about Mountjoy and the D&oacute;chas centre.</p> <p>  Turning to Vote 24, I have a number of questions on different headings and I will ask them in the time I have remaining.  Subhead D3 is social disadvantage measures, and there was an underspend of nearly &euro;1 million.  Some of that was obviously down to Covid-19 but it also refers to certain projects for youth justice not being fully drawn down in 2020, related to the delays in establishing new projects.  How are we getting on with that at this point?</p></speech>

They are activated again.  In fact, the budget for youth justice and the youth diversion projects for 2022 has an increase of over &euro;6 million, so there is a huge amount of work going on there.  They are fully firing now.</p></speech>

Again, no more than with the policing, security and community safety Bill, there is a detailed project implementation plan relating to the establishment of the regulator.  It is a very complex project and complex regulation so there is a lot of work going into that.  A team is working on it at present.</p></speech>

The next two matters are linked.  They are the funding for prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence as well as funding for services for victims of crime.

That excess arose due to the roll-out of the Still Here campaign.  We also increased the grants available to the front-line partners we have in this space.  Between the Still Here campaign for awareness raising and the increased provision for front-line services, there was approximately &euro;400,000 extra spent in 2020.</p></speech>

First, I have a brief question.  In 2020, an issue under the remit of the Department of Justice that came to my attention is funding for the coroner's court.  I understand there has been some difficulty with the discharge of bodies, particularly in areas where there is high population.  Outside of Dublin and other areas of the country this is the remit of the local authorities, but it is the remit of the Department of Justice as it pertains to Dublin.  What measures has the Department been undertaking to deal with that issue in the context, of course, of it being a deeply personal issue for many people?  In Ireland we have an important tradition where the death and funeral process is very swift in comparison to what might be the case in the United Kingdom where it takes weeks.  It is quite important from a cultural standpoint.  I will open with that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh McPhillips" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#R02400"><p>The Deputy is correct.  Something we were very conscious of at the beginning of the pandemic was the potential and the great unknown about how this would all play out.  We established a dedicated team in March-April 2020 in respect of coroners and the pathology services generally.  Obviously, the Office of the State Pathologist is under the Department.  The pathologists in hospitals are under the HSE, so there can be quite a complicated provision there.  I will ask Ms Buckley to comment on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.496" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Buckley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#R02500"><p>There are challenges around this and they became particularly difficult during the pandemic because of the Covid-19 precautions that had to be brought to bear.  Dublin also became the recipient of a lot of bodies where Covid-19 precautions had to take place so it took a bigger hit nationally, if I can put it that way, which was really unfortunate.  As the Deputy said, one is always conscious of the families involved.  One thing involved here is that Covid-19 deaths are natural deaths so unless there was another reason for a post-mortem they would not necessarily have undergone that.</p> <p>  The other issue with this, and the Secretary General has mentioned this a few times, is that there are very specialist skills associated with doing post-mortems and so forth.  It is constantly a challenge to recruit and have those skills in place to facilitate the mortuary service.  The other issue is that some hospitals offer the service and depending on whether the hospitals are in a position to offer the service, that can increase or decrease the pressure on the Dublin mortuary.  We had quite a significant issue in the last few weeks where a couple of hospitals had to stand down, for reasons pertaining to themselves, and the mortuary then took the hit.  At one point, we were up to a delay of two weeks in post-mortems.  I am pleased to tell the Deputy that as of yesterday, when I was briefed on the matter, we had only nine post-mortems outstanding.  Effectively, there is currently no backlog of post-mortems in the Dublin mortuary.</p> <p>  We have a specialist unit now that is concentrating on the coronial service and the mortuary service.  A feature of the justice plan for this year is that we intend to look at the overall structure of the system to see how it needs to be structured for the future.  Our coronial service was last properly overhauled in 1846, so we probably need to have a look at it.  That is very much in our plans for the future.  However, at the same time, I have a dedicated and excellent team working on making sure that the current service is maintained and supporting the Dublin coroner, who is independent, in doing her important work.</p></speech>

That is good to hear.</p> <p>  I will move to a slightly more controversial matter.  As part of our briefing and with regard to the State Claims Agency, there are approximately 2,400 claims outstanding in respect court cases being brought against the Irish Prison Service.  Am I right that approximately &euro;3.1 million was paid out in compensation in respect of claims by prisoners in 2020 and there was &euro;1.5 million in compensation and &euro;500,000 in legal costs awarded in respect of in-cell sanitation cases between 2019 and 2020?</p><p>To me, that sounds a little unusual.  I want to try to get a better understanding from the officials of what is actually going on in that particular case.  Obviously, it is quite a large amount of money relating to the Prison Service.  Will the officials give us the background if that is possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caron McCaffrey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022042800002#S00200"><p>I can assist the Deputy in that regard.  There was a case that went as far as the Supreme Court in regard to the lack of in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison.  That case was allowed on appeal and damages in the sum of &euro;7,500 were awarded.  The legal costs involved in that case were very significant.  The State Claims Agency manages these claims on behalf of the Prison Service.  In February 2020, the State Claims Agency put in place a specific scheme to address the number of claims that had been made in this respect.  To give an update on the figures, as of now 2,773 claims have been received, of which 2,040 have been concluded, so there has been very good progress in respect of that scheme.  An important point to note in regard to the scheme is that damages have been capped at a maximum of &euro;7,500.  There are three different categories or levels of compensation depending on whether a person was on a restricted regime and sharing a cell, on an open regime and sharing a cell or in their own cell.  Importantly, the legal costs have also been capped and that relates to the level of award that is granted.  The maximum legal costs that will be paid in respect of a claim is &euro;1,700 and the minimum for compensation awards at the lower end of the scheme is &euro;1,000.</p> <p>  It has been a very successful scheme.  Certainly, if we look at the legal costs that were attached to the original case that was litigated in the courts, the expenditure is far less than that.  The State Claims Agency at the beginning of the process in regard to in-cell sanitation claims put a contingent liability of &euro;37.7 million against the claims.  Now, because of the success of the scheme, it looks like the liability to the State will be in the order of &euro;15 million.  Therefore, the scheme that has been put in place has been very successful.  There has been good engagement with both plaintiffs and their solicitors and the expectation is that that scheme will be concluded, hopefully, before the end of this year.</p></speech>

Some &euro;150 million has been invested in the last ten years to put in-cell sanitation into Mountjoy, which was the biggest facility.  We now have a construction project in Limerick which will eliminate the small number who continue to not have access to an in-cell toilet.  A significant amount of progress has been made.</p></speech>

I want to make one final point.  The pandemic obviously brought about an enormous change in the requirements of policing in Ireland and the work the Department had to do in order to adjust to facilitate that.  One observation is that I felt there was a significant rise in the level of substance use by younger members of society in Ireland, which is extraordinarily concerning to me, particularly when it comes to the use of what we would consider class A drugs, such as cocaine, among young members of society.  I am hearing about a lot of usage by teenagers and this has been reported to me through my constituency office.  This is extremely concerning.</p> <p>  I want to put on record that this is something we need to try to get some degree of control over.  I do not wish to put across the position that this can be eliminated and, obviously, it cannot be.  However, it is the case, unfortunately, that drug use is rampant in Ireland, particularly among younger members of society.  While that is a topic of much debate, when it comes to more serious drugs it is a huge concern.  The Department has to try to find more useful ways and, instead of trying to put people in prison, to try to guide young people away from substance abuse and drug use.  It needs to find more proactive ways of getting people off the streets and away from dealing drugs.  That is very important.  We need to re-evaluate this through education programmes, rather than the stick approach, which, unfortunately, is not working.</p> <p>  Garda&iacute; are under immense pressure and finding it very difficult to deal with gang-related crime, which has been an issue in Ireland over a long number of years.  I want to make the point to the Department, the Secretary General, the assistant secretary general and all of the officials here that we have a lot of work to do to prevent people from ending up in prison and in situations of addiction.  Unfortunately, from what I have seen and what I have heard through my office, this is a huge problem that is going to have huge knock-on consequences for people's mental health and the growth and development of young people in Ireland in general.</p></speech>

The Department is a very active participant in the national drugs strategy that is led by the Department of Health.  That health-led approach is something we are very committed to and the Garda probably outlined to the committee its increased use of the adult caution scheme in regard to this, rather than criminalising people.  Obviously, garda&iacute; enforce this area very strictly in regard to large-scale importation and so forth.  They have had a lot of success over the last couple of years and I am sure recent events will help to support that.

There are nine counties, including Laois and Offaly, that do not have even a single bed, despite all of the attendant difficulties which public representatives and others come across.  What is the current situation with the budget?  Am I correct to say there are only 140 beds in the State?  That is very low.</p></speech>

There is a view under the Istanbul Convention as to how many beds, what distance and all that kind of thing.  When it comes down to the practice, it is not 100% as straightforward as that.  I agree there is an under-provision at the moment and we will be working on that.  We are committed to making a huge difference on this.</p></speech>

When victims of domestic violence leave, often taking children with them, they are sent 60 or 70 miles away across two or three counties to a refuge.  Their children are taken away from schools, from social workers and, very importantly, from family support, the GP and all other services.  It creates chaos, and that is the only way I can describe it.  It is making it difficult for people to leave those situations.  Even in genuine cases of domestic violence, unfortunately, victims often make their way back, hoping things will change.  There is always that hope.</p></speech>

Offaly has a different plan, by the way, although I do not want to go into it in detail.  Offaly has a plan that involves three locations and it is trying to operate a different system for domestic violence.  That is the plan going forward and it has been shared with me.  Nonetheless, we badly need one refuge for the two counties of Laois and Offaly.</p></speech>

The third is from Inland Fisheries Ireland, as well as the 2020 financial statements.  It is a clear audit opinion.  The fourth is that of Legal Aid Board.  It is a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control relating to the level of resourcing of internal audit and to non-compliance with procurement rules.  The fifth is the Public Trustee for Ireland, which is a function established under the Land Act of 1903.</p><p>It concerns the 2021 financial statements, and there is a clear audit opinion.

The responses to my questions on the Shane O'Farrell case were very frustrating.  The Secretary General of the Department of Justice indicated a number of times that she could not comment on the questions I was asking because, if I am correct, a statutory inquiry was ongoing.  There is no statutory inquiry; there is a scoping inquiry that has no statutory powers whatsoever.  The Secretary General indicated on a number of occasions that she would provide some written responses, but this committee should have a view on expenditure on trying to find ways to avoid delivering a public inquiry into this matter that is obviously necessary.  In the follow-up correspondence, will the secretariat make that point and ask for full information?  Will it also ask the Department, following on from the completion of the scoping inquiry, which we hope will be sooner rather than later, to give the timeframe it envisages if a public inquiry is initiated?  What is the timeframe for the establishment of such an inquiry?</p></speech>

I do not buy that.  The questions will be on the record.  The Secretary General indicated on a number of occasions that she may provide a note of the matter.  As well as asking for the information, we should point out that the scoping inquiry should not be a reason not to answer the questions.  Second, could we get a view from the Secretary General on the timeframe for establishing a public inquiry if one is to be established?</p></speech>

Correspondence group B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up on meetings of this committee.  No. 1147B, from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, dated 24 March 2022, provides information requested by the committee regarding remuneration for the CEO of Horse Racing Ireland.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.  Before opening the matter to the floor, I will address the next flagged because the two are related.</p> <p>  No. 1149B, from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 25 March 2022, also provides information requested by the committee regarding the remuneration of the new CEO of Horse Racing Ireland.  Is it agreed to note and publish it?  Agreed.  These items were flagged by Deputy Carthy and me.</p></speech>

It appears to me that the justification for a salary above the scale previously set down was justified from a business case presented by Horse Racing Ireland itself.  The new CEO was appointed before the new salary was approved.  I would love to know what would have happened if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had not approved the new salary.  Would the CEO have stepped down?  If not, there would have been no need for the increased salary in the first place.  It is public money.  I do not know whether we can secure a route to assert whether the salary was justified and necessary and represented value for money.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General could point us in the direction we need to go to seek clarification.  I am aware representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be before us shortly.  Perhaps that is the best avenue but I am open to direction.</p></speech>

Did NewERA advise on recruiting or was it just on the salary?</p> <p>  Another issue arose over a car that was declined.  I believe this pertains to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need to make inquiries into what transpired.  A salary is one thing but an overall package is entirely different.  What happened?  It is a bit too open-ended for my liking.</p> <p>  The second last paragraph on the second page of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform states that, in line with the statutory remit referenced, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine sought an independent assessment by NewERA of the remuneration proposed by Horse Racing Ireland.  Following its assessment of the proposal of Horse Racing Ireland, NewERA recommended that the proposed salary of &euro;190,773 be approved.  It appears that the basis for this seems to have been the salary of the outgoing person and that there is established custom and practice in relation to that.  That actually raises another issue, concerning, for example, the salary scales of the Secretaries General and the deviation.  Is what I am referring to a standard now?  The response is coming from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Where there is a deviation, is it now going to be the basis for why a salary should commence at a particular level, that of the previous incumbent?  For example, if the Secretary General of the Department of Health moved out of that role and somebody else moved in, would that person&rsquo;s salary represent the standard set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  I would like some clarification on that.</p></speech>

As I said, there are then other questions because the appointment had been made prior to the formal approval being granted.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly said, these decisions can subsequently be used as justification for future decisions, so it is important we pursue this issue to find out how exactly we arrived at this point.  It does not appear to be the type of robust analysis we would expect of NewERA.</p></speech>

Regarding the car, I think what was applied for was a car allowance, which, effectively, would be a payment made to the chief executive as part of his or her salary, and there would be benefit-in-kind taxation of the allowance, but that was declined.  What was agreed was that a company car would be provided, presumably on the basis that this person would be travelling around to racecourses and so on.  That was that aspect of it.</p> <p>  NewERA is part of the NTMA and has a specific focus to advise Departments on commercial State bodies and issues that arise in that regard.  Its role, therefore, was to examine the case that was made regarding the salary and to express a view on it.  Because NewERA is part of the NTMA, it has a role that can be examined by the committee when it has the NTMA before it to explore a little more what it does, the nature of the advice it gives, how it arrives at its conclusions and so on.</p> <p>  Finally, my understanding is that when a pay level is determined, it is determined in relation to the post and not in relation to the individual.  The example given was the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  Anybody filling that post will attract that salary.  It was not a salary determination for an individual.  Similarly, here, it was, I think, the lower salary scale that was originally approved in, let us say, 2012 or whatever.  It was never applied.  The application was, effectively, to revise the pay rate for the role to the higher level.  That was agreed, or at least recommended, by NewERA and approved by the Ministers.</p></speech>

I wanted to flag this correspondence, particularly because it relates to previous correspondence and engagement with RT&Eacute;, specifically No. R1198B from the Department of Social Protection.  It is about bogus self-employment and RTE workers' cases.  I do not feel the Department of Social Protection's related correspondence adequately addresses our question as to why it cannot provide interim updates on the outcomes of those cases where a decision has not been reached.  That is very clear in its correspondence.  I suspect it might relate to the fact that it has been reported that RT&Eacute; is appealing those decisions that have gone against it to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  I would see that as a way of delaying justice for those concerned by up to six months.  From our engagements with RT&Eacute; and the reports in the media, I still find it bizarre that RT&Eacute; has committed to back pay of up to only four years and-----</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; has committed to back pay of up to only four years and nothing at all in respect of holiday pay or pension contributions.  I do not see how it could get away with that.  I know the Chairman has referred to the other correspondence, but could we write to both the Department of Social Protection and RT&Eacute; to ask them both whether RT&Eacute; has appealed every single case that went against it or just a handful of cases?  We should have been getting those interim updates because there seems to be a lack of understanding that RT&Eacute; exploited these workers.  I for one would not accept Ms Forbes's assertion that this is a legacy issue because RT&Eacute; continues to deny these workers their entitlements by unnecessarily prolonging the process.  My big fear is that if these cases end up in court, I have no doubt but that a future director general of RT&Eacute; will tell a future Committee of Public Accounts that spiralling legal costs are a legacy matter.  That may well be Ms Forbes's legacy.  Can we write to both and ask-----</p></speech>

I know databases go out of date if one does not continue to populate them but is there a role for retrieving some of the information that was there?  It was very well used.

An additional line of inquiry might be to ask the Central Statistics Office what its data source for the non-profit sector will be in the absence of Benefacts.

This relates to the second-hand car market.  There is a world of difference between second-hand electric vehicles and other second-hand vehicles.  If one buys a second-hand petrol car with 60,000 miles on the clock, one will have a rough idea of the lifespan of the car but if one buys an electric vehicle, the battery is the issue.  It is very expensive to replace.  It seems that targets are being set at national level in the context of our climate obligations but it is then stated that it is a market function.  Maybe the committee should write to the Department of Finance regarding the vehicle registration tax, VRT, implications in respect of second-hand electric vehicles.  There will be implications in that regard in the context of reaching our targets and the policy.  That will obviously have an implication in the context of fines and all sorts of things.</p></speech>

One could have this crazy scenario in order to avoid any questions on a particular line of expenditure that one would simply move it to another Department and then no historical questions can be asked because the new Department says that was historical and the old one says it can no longer answer questions in relation to that because it has moved.</p> <p>  It appears that these issues of emergency accommodation are arising all the time.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in the new Department that is dealing with these areas, confirmed in the D&aacute;il today that the catering firm Aramark has been given a contract to provide meals to Ukrainian refugees and that there has been no procurement process employed at all.  That raises a red flag to me.  Every time there is an emergency and there are poor people in difficulty someone manages to make a lot of money out of it and there are always question marks in respect of the process employed.</p> <p>  In respect of this correspondence, I suggest that we write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requesting whether or not it has evaluated this move on the part of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and whether it has a view on this contract.  We should seek from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the full details of the contract - the timeframe, the money involved and the safeguards that have been put in place.</p> <p>  It strikes me that it is never a set of local catering companies that get these contracts.  It is always huge corporations and in this instance, one that has had a lot of question marks with regard to previous ones.</p></speech>

The proposed action is to note and publish it and to forward the Department's response, along with the correspondence that gave rise to it, which was R0947, to the Joint Committee on Health for its information and any action it may deem appropriate.

I note the Department had made specific reference to legislation by Deputies O'Rourke and Cullinane that would seek to address the issue.  I suggest the most appropriate follow-up by this committee might be to refer it to the Joint Committee on Health.</p></speech>

I completely understand Deputy Munster's frustration and the frustration of the employees who have waited a very long time.  It is not only a question of recognising the other issues, such as holiday and other entitlements and backdating some of what was found.  I am not sure the Scope section, at the same time, can give us an interim report.  They are pretty much saying that they are not going to.</p></speech>

I have seen some of the work that they have done previously.</p> <p>  We would not benefit from a piecemeal approach.  On proper updates, I am comfortable with what they are proposing here in terms of that particular Department's role in this because it is a serious review.  If it was coming from Revenue, that would be the view we would take as well.</p> <p>  I completely understand the frustrations in relation to how RT&Eacute; is handling the situation.

I propose that the committee write to both RT&Eacute; and the Department of Social Protection to ask has RT&Eacute; appealed every case that went against it or is it only a handful of cases where there are technical issues or whatever.  It would be interesting to know from both because the Department's response might be related to the fact that RT&Eacute; is appealing and prolonging shamefully the issue for the workers.  It would be no harm writing to both to find that out.</p></speech>

I suggest that we seek that clarification as to whether the case of each person who is employed by RT&Eacute; on a contract basis was examined.</p></speech>

First, I find the position of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, on this matter utterly lacking in substance of explanation.  They told us in December that they would be ready to start installing the CCTVs in January, the beginning of the new season, and that was New Year's Day.</p><p>It was stated that it would take six weeks.  Now we are informed that it could take almost six months.  That is another four or five months.  That beggars belief, particularly when we think of the benefits that CCTV monitoring would have for the industry and, more importantly, those tasked with regulating it.  We cannot help but wonder why there is delay after delay.  It raises more questions than answers.  It is very frustrating that each time we ask for an update, we are told it is happening.  It is being kicked further and further down the road, however.  I ask that we request a further update by June.  I hope I am proved wrong, but I suspect the board will kick this further down the road for reasons best known to itself at this stage.</p></speech>

Can we ask the Department of Health what has been expended to date, including on the design?  We have been waiting since 2018.  There was the Mulvey report.  There are very serious concerns about ownership and control of the national maternity hospital.

I raised it with the Garda Commissioner, and I raised it again this morning with regard to the memorandum of understanding.  Can we ask it for an update on whether the memorandum of understanding has been signed?  There is an impediment to the establishment of the new corporate enforcement agency as a consequence of not having this.  It has been given extra powers but Garda resources are critical.  This was one of the fault lines when we were debating the legislation.  Can we get an update on this?</p></speech>

In the letter I set out that the committee would write to the Department of Health to request further information on the proposed appointment or secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan to Trinity College and that the information would include how the decision was made, who made the decision, who was involved in the decision-making, what was the expected salary and expenses and what were the total expenses in terms of offices and any secretarial backup or anything else.  It would also include the total cost involved for the Department over the period of five years and what official processes and guidelines the Department has transfers and secondments.  Since the matter became one of public interest, the issue of processes and guidelines to which the Department operates is crucial.  I am not clear about it and I do not know whether anybody else on the committee is clear about it.  It is important that we do this.  If the committee agrees we will request it from the Department of Health.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The Department will come before the committee in the near future and that will also provide an opportunity.</p> <p>  No other items of correspondence have been flagged for consideration.</p> <p>  With regard to our work programme, the following engagements are confirmed for May.  We will have the Department of Finance on 5 May, University of Limerick on 12 May, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May and, as I mentioned, the Department of Health on 26 May.  I will set out some proposals for June and then open the floor to members.  As 2 June falls in a non-sitting week, the next available date is 9 June.  I propose that we schedule a meeting with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on that date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

It is on the work programme and responsibility for direct provision now resides with that Department.</p> <p>  I also propose that we schedule an engagement with the National Pediatric Hospital Development Board in June, with representatives from the Department of Health.  The board was last before the committee in July last year when we examined its 2019 financial statements.  Is it agreed that we schedule this engagement?  Agreed.  It is very frustrating that we are denied the information we need.</p> <p>  Before Easter, we agreed to examine local government oversight and accountability.  I suggest that we also look at this in June.  With the agreement of members we will consider how we might approach this when we meet next.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have had some discussion about who we want to come before the committee.  There are a number of parties.</p> <p>  Other bodies on the work programme include the Department of Education regarding the special report on education and training boards.  There is also the Central Bank and Revenue Commissioners on the outstanding chapter on assessment and collection of insurance compensation fund levies.  There is also Horse Racing Ireland and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board.</p><p>If there are any other matters members wish to raise, they can put them forward now or at the next meeting.  As usual, we will run it through like that.  Members can let the clerk know.  If there are any specific issues regarding any of the groups coming in over the next month, members can let the clerk know so we can put them on the agenda and notify the guests of them.</p><p> That concludes consideration of the work programme for today.  The last item on the public agenda for today is any other business.  Does any member wish to raise anything?</p></speech>

We did not receive any response.  We wrote again on 8 April and that question was put again.  I propose that we write again requesting that information.  I remind the committee that this information related to the waiving of the substantial increase in salary allocated to the post.  A public statement was made by the Secretary General on his appointment to the role on a permanent basis that he was waiving that portion of his salary.  The public and this committee have a right to know for how long that took place, bearing in mind that whatever portion he did not take was available to the Department for other purposes.  I propose that, following the meeting, we write again and continue to seek that information.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Deputies Higgins and Niamh Smyth.</p><p>Before we start, I have a few comments to make.  This committee has been tasked with examining the issues surrounding international surrogacy, in particular the rights, interests and welfare of the children born through international surrogacy, the rights, interests and welfare of surrogate mothers, the rights, interests and obligations of intending parents in future international surrogacy arrangements, and the rights, interests and obligations of intending parents of existing children who have already been born through international surrogacy.  Nobody in this room or looking in this morning online would understate the challenge of the task that we have been set as a committee.  The issue of international surrogacy is legally complex.  It is a socially complex and emotionally complex issue.  There are many strongly held views about this topic and I believe that each of us has much to learn about the issue in general.</p><p>Our task as a committee is especially challenging because we have only three months in which to complete it.  However, I believe that, as parliamentarians, we are privileged to be in a position to undertake this task and to grapple with an issue that many other countries have failed to address, but with that privilege comes a responsibility.  Not only do we have a responsibility to thoroughly examine the issue, we have a responsibility to deal with this issue in a respectful manner.  I would ask members to be mindful of the fact that many of the witnesses who we have invited in as a committee have been on very difficult and long journeys to get to this point.  I ask, therefore, that our questioning be done in a respectful way and without causing hurt.  I also ask that members treat each other with respect.  I will not stand over name-calling or religious references in the chamber.  I will also not allow, due to statutory prohibition, the discussion of matters in a public forum that arose from private meetings.  I remind members that, as Cathaoirleach, I am the sole judge of order, that is, whether it is me, as Chair, or someone acting in the role of Chair.  I thank Deputy Funchion for standing in for me last week.</p><p>Notwithstanding all of these challenges, I am confident that by working together we can produce a strong and robust set of recommendations for Government's consideration.  I believe that each of us wants to do that as I believe that each of us on this committee does not wish to see the <i>status quo</i>continue.  We have two months remaining in which to complete our report.  I look forward to working with each of the members over those two months in order to facilitate a successful completion of the report and the task we have been set.  I thank the members.</p></speech>

In the first we will look at the particular issues faced by same sex couples, both male and female, in entering international surrogacy arrangements and achieving parental recognition.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Lydia Bracken, assistant dean for equality, diversity and inclusion in the faculty of arts, humanities and social sciences of the University of Limerick, who will be joining us via Teams, and the representatives from Irish Gay Dads, Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore and Mr. Shane Lennon, whom I thank for attending.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I have a note on housekeeping matters and another on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p>For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm prior to making his or her contribution that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I wish to remind everyone that masks should continue to be worn throughout the meeting by all present and should only be removed when speaking.</p><p> I invite Dr. Bracken to make her opening statement. </p></speech>

In research that I conducted with LGBT Ireland in 2021, 53% of the LGBTQI+ parent families captured by the research were not fully recognised under Irish law, which means that both parents were not recognised as legal parents.  Similarly, in more than half of the families the two parents were not recognised as joint legal guardians of their children.  The research indicates that the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which regulates the area of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, embraces a variety of new and non-traditional family forms.  However, many other families fall outside of its parentage provisions.  This leads to a situation where legal recognition of family relationships in LGBTQI+ parent families is dependent on the mode of conception of the child, which is how the child was conceived, and as a result many families cannot secure full legal recognition.</p> <p>  In my research, 13% of total respondents to the survey indicated that one or more of their children were born through surrogacy.  All of these respondents were male and parenting with their male partner.  Due to the absence of surrogacy legislation, only one of the fathers was legally recognised as a parent in each family.</p> <p>  In my research, no female couple reported that they had engaged in surrogacy but it is likely that some female couples engage in this process.  Instead, in my research, DAHR was the most common pathway to parentage among female couples.  However, in only 50% of families were both of the parents legally recognised.  This was due to the fact that a number of DAHR approaches are omitted from the 2015 Act. Perhaps of most relevance to this committee is the omission of DAHR that is undertaken abroad.  If the procedure takes place outside of the State, the parentage provisions in the 2015 Act do not apply and instead parentage is allocated in the same way as any other conception.  This also occurs where the child is conceived by DAHR in an Irish fertility clinic but born outside of the State.  Other pathways that are omitted from the 2015 Act are non-clinical DAHR procedures and retrospective procedures where a known donor was used.  Given that this committee will examine the question of retrospective recognition of parentage in surrogacy, it will be important to ensure that any legislative response is consistent with the DAHR legislation.  This will require amendments to the 2015 Act because at present children born through some DAHR methods are legally disadvantaged based on their method of conception when compared with other children born through DAHR.  Also, many children of LGBTQI+ parents are legally disadvantaged when compared with the children of married opposite-sex couples.</p> <p>  In international surrogacy, the issues experienced by same-sex couples are broadly similar to those experienced by opposite-sex couples.  However, same-sex couples have more limited options in terms of where they can access international surrogacy as some foreign jurisdictions are only open to married opposite-sex couples.</p> <p>  Ireland cannot regulate surrogacy that is undertaken abroad and it cannot control the ethical or human rights framework that is adopted in another jurisdiction.  It can control the recognition or establishment of legal parentage for the purpose of Irish law.  In doing so, the key question should be whether the law and practice in the country where the surrogacy took place provides ethical safeguards that are at least equivalent to those provided in domestic law but not necessarily identical to the Irish framework. </p> <p>  There are a number of provisions of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 that are problematic in their current form and I have detailed some of the issues in my accompanying briefing document.  While some of these issues are more relevant in the context of domestic surrogacy, it is necessary to consider these as it seems likely, based on the experience of other jurisdictions, that an overly restrictive or poorly defined domestic framework for surrogacy will deter intending parents from engaging in the domestic process and instead encourage them to engage in international surrogacy.</p> <p>  To accommodate the diversity of families that exist in Ireland in 2022 there is a need to think about different ways to conceptualise family relationships.  In surrogacy, the law should avoid an overly rigid approach in its regulation of family relationships.  The must remain flexible to ensure that the best interests of the child can be assessed and secured on an individualised basis.</p></speech>

First, the organisation was created to give gay men who were interested in becoming parents, or those who are parents already, the opportunity to exchange ideas, information, experiences and build friendships.  Second, the options for Irish based gay male couples who wish to have a child through surrogacy are very limited.  Typically, our members become parents through gestational surrogacy in the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  What is life like for a gay male parent?  Personally, I do not feel that there is one difference in how we parent compared with any other family.  Like all parents, the well-being of our children is everything.  My husband, S&eacute;amus, and I literally build the plan for each day around our three children who are called Mary, Se&aacute;n and Anne.  We put their needs and wants at the centre of everything that we do.  We think of our children as the three most special people on this planet.  They are considerate, kind and vibrant little people who carry giddy smiles and have imaginations that can turn any object into the most advanced aeroplane or doll's house.</p> <p>  Socially, Ireland is a great country in which to live as a gay dad.  When S&eacute;amus and I bring our children to the local shopping centre or park people often approach us to say hello.  Our experience of such encounters has been 100% positive.  We have never encountered inappropriate questions, rude comments, labelling or stereotyping.  That is not just a Dublin thing.  I grew up along the border of Tipperary and Offaly and I will never forget the night of our first visit home following the birth of our children, Se&aacute;n and Mary.  We sat at my sister's kitchen table and we were surrounded by family, friends and neighbours, many of whom are quite elderly, and each of them with presents, knitted goods and food.  All of them were there to celebrate the arrival of our two babies.  I believe that this goodwill that we enjoy is not unique to me or my family.  Let us remember that when the constitutional convention was called to discuss the idea of giving Irish citizens an opportunity to vote on same-sex marriage, an additional vote was taken on changing the laws around parenting to equally include the children of gay and lesbian families.</p><p>Eighty-one of the 100 delegates present that day voted in support of this motion.  The Irish people are very surprised to learn, when we explain it, that the legislation families like us need has yet to be passed.</p><p> As I outlined last week, this lack of legislation affects our ability to parent and protect our children in many areas such as accessing education, welfare supports, medical treatment etc.  We have outlined these issues in detail within our written submission. Therefore, I will not revisit them today.  The above issues, however, pale into insignificance when it is considered what might happen to a child, if his or her biological and legal father were to pass away.  Can the committee members imagine being in this situation, as the surviving non-recognised parent?  You have just lost your husband and now you have to spend time focusing on how you are going to keep custody of your children.  While, of course, that thought does not guide me in my everyday life, it does sometimes come into my mind.  When that happens, I just freeze.</p><p> I would like to highlight the core elements of the surrogacy model for which Irish Gay Dads advocate.  These elements include, first, ensuring all children are treated equally in the eyes of the Irish law, regardless of the method of their conception, pregnancy or birth.  Second, we focus on prioritising the well-being of surrogate mothers. We want to ensure they are provided with access to independent medical, legal and psychological supports before making any decisions to proceed, while ensuring their bodily autonomy at all times.  Third, we want to ensure children born through surrogacy have access to information regarding their genetic and gestational origins.  Fourth, we need to ensure the intended parents are treated equally by providing pre-birth determination in relation to parental rights.  Finally, we wish the State to provide retrospective legal recognition of the children who have already born through international surrogacy.   We feel this is Ireland&rsquo;s opportunity to be a world leader, to recognise the diverse and evolving nature of modern families, and to legislate appropriately.  I ask the committee members to please use the positions they have been given to act on behalf of the parents, families and surrogates we represent and all those same-sex female couples who have thus far been omitted from the Children and Family Relationships Act.  I thank the committee members for their time.</p></speech>

It is an honour and privilege to have the opportunity to speak with the committee today on behalf of Irish Gay Dads.  I sit here with the committee today quite literally as a result of modern family planning, for I myself was born by IVF.  In fact, I was one of the first children in Ireland to be born via IVF.  Growing up, I and my brother knew how wanted we were and the struggles faced by our parents to conceive.  Our mother would routinely tell us how, in her mind, her life really only began when she had children.  After nearly ten years of failed pregnancies, miscarriages and near death, my parents welcomed me into this world.  Therefore, as we celebrate 35 years since the first treatment took place in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, marking the beginning of the creation of tens of thousands of families throughout the country, I feel it quite apt to be speaking to the committee today as we debate the need to legislate the next progressive steps in Irish family planning.</p> <p>  My husband, Carlos, and I met some 12 years ago, and from day one we discussed our desire to have a family.  In 2015, the same-sex marriage referendum created the first opportunity for our relationship to be formally recognised in Irish society and for us to be considered a family unit under Irish law.  We married in 2018, thus creating the first foundation of our family.  Since then, we have moved to create a life that could support our ambition to grow our family.  It is an innate human desire to want to have a family, to raise a child and to create a higher meaning in one&rsquo;s life.  This innate desire does not go away.  It is not selective to only some people but to us all, no matter our fertility, physical ability or sexuality.</p> <p>  Article 41 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann sets out that it is my fundamental right as an Irish citizen and as a married person to make my own decisions when undertaking matters in relation to family planning.  If marriage is the foundation to our family in our legal system, how can the same legal system not support the growth of my family?  Without legislation to enable me to create a family, I am in a dichotomy of paying to be part of an Irish society that does not allow me to reap the benefits of same.  How is it right that, in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners, I am equal, the same as my friends and neighbours, but when it comes to my fundamental right to grow my family, I am prohibited?</p> <p>  Irish relationships and families are no longer being created in the traditional chronological order of yesterday, when one would meet someone, marry, buy a home and create a family.  Men and women are meeting later in life and coupling later.  More and more women are entering the workforce and focusing on their careers, as is their right.  The new chronological order of creating a family is multifaceted.  Thus, we are only going to see an increasing number of the population looking to assisted human reproduction, AHR, solutions in creating families.  This includes international surrogacy.</p> <p>  The AHR Bill is, in my opinion, the single greatest advancement in Irish family planning since the creation of the State.  It would be a travesty not to include international surrogacy in this historic Bill.  I implore the committee to take action to make sure the vast majority of families created via surrogacy are not left behind and are not left to be second-class citizens in their own country.</p></speech>

I have specific questions for each of them, so I will go into that.</p> <p>  Dr. Bracken has published extensively in this area and I am a proud owner of two of her books.  I have two points to raise with her, the first of which is the position of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, decision, particularly the one in France.  In that regard, it is an advisory opinion.  What is its standing in the Irish context?  Is it open to this committee to recommend that we ban international surrogacy because of the commercial element to it or is it open to this committee not to provide a pathway for parental recognition of the second parent?  Is a second parent in this State entitled now to take a case against Ireland on the basis of the failure to create that legal parental relationship?  Is that open to a person in this State to take that case against Ireland?  My personal contention would be that the failure to implement a framework is akin to burying our heads in the sand.</p> <p>  The second issue concerns parentage order versus guardianship.  On some of the sanctions, we have talked with Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony about a carrot-and-stick approach and trying to get people to engage in domestic surrogacy and to incentivise that, but that international surrogacy will occur.  In that, there may be implied issues or difficulties.  One of the issues that hang over us is that we would not award parentage orders in a situation where maybe all of the boxes are not ticked.  Instead, it would be mere guardianship.  However, the point of parental orders is that they are akin to adoption and so sever the obligations and duties on the person who gave birth as surrogate mother in these instances.  Therefore, if we merely employ guardianship, then we have the difficulty that she remains with all of those obligations in Irish law.  Does Dr. Bracken have any suggestions or thoughts of what would be a sanction or a penalisation on that?</p> <p>  Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon are very welcome.  I am very grateful for their extremely valuable experience and their sharing with us the failure of the Legislature.</p><p>It would be shameful if we continued to fail families formed via surrogacy.</p><p> A significant point from Mr. Kenny Moore last week and Mr. Lennon today comes from their sharing of the fact that when gay couples meet, they have the same conversations as everybody else about whether they will have children together.  I am not sure that everybody considers how that innate desire to have a child is not dependent on sexuality or gender but it is about wanting to nurture.  It is something in the human spirit that wants to do that.</p><p> Last week, Mr. Kenny Moore spoke extensively about the pre-pregnancy position and depths into which the Canadian system goes.  This relates to the due diligence and high standards employed and the submission is extensive.  Point No. 4 goes into evaluating destinations, providers, clinics and agencies and ensuring consent, so perhaps he could elaborate on that.  I will hold off on other questions until the second round.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.666" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions.  She asked about the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR.  The case law from the European Court of Human Rights is primarily Mennesson <i>v</i>. France, which essentially established that where there is a genetic relationship between an intending father and the child and where that father is also listed on the foreign birth certificate as the legal father, an obligation arises to legally recognise that relationship on the basis that it would be a violation of the child's right to private life if it was not recognised within domestic law.  That kind of set the initial standard for what types of relationships need to be recognised.<br/><br/>It was followed in 2019 by an advisory opinion on gestational surrogacy, which again was issued to France in a case concerning the same Mennesson family.  Although the father was recognised in the case, the intended mother had not been recognised initially at least.  The question was whether that relationship also needed to be recognised.  The advisory opinion set out that in order to vindicate the rights of the children, the relationship between the children and the intending mother, where she is listed on the birth certificate in a position where she is married to the intending father, who has already been recognised for the purpose of domestic law, another duty of recognition arises based on consideration of the rights of the child.<br/><br/>The status of the advisory opinion is that it is not binding and it is an optional mechanism that states can enter into in getting guidance and advice in how the ECHR case law might operate.  However, I have published on this and given the opinion that it establishes the standards that the court would adhere to.  If a case was to be brought against Ireland on this matter, it is quite likely, based on the standards set in the advisory opinion, that we would be found lacking because we do not currently have a mechanism that would recognise the relationship between an intending mother and the child in the way the advisory opinion requires us to do.  Something like guardianship does not meet the standard because it is not a permanent relationship and it does not have the same status as that of legal parentage.  On the question of whether we could ever prohibit surrogacy, we could not do that based on the jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights because we have the obligation to recognise certain parent-child relationships in order to vindicate the rights of children.  I hope that answers the question on ECHR case law.<br/><br/>The Senator mentioned parental orders and guardianship and referred to &quot;sanctions&quot;.  It is probably not the most accurate description of what it would be.  It would essentially be the fallback position if parentage cannot be recognised for whatever reason.  In the proposal I have put forward in the briefing document provided to the committee, I have suggested that we should ultimately get to a position whereby parentage established on a foreign birth certificate would be recognised in Ireland, whether it is by way of a parental order being recognised or some other, possibly administrative, mechanism to recognise that parentage unless it is fundamentally contrary to Irish public policy.  When we are determining what public policy means in the context of surrogacy, we need to establish an ethical framework for surrogacy within Ireland and we would determine any cases by reference to that or if it would be in the best interests of the child to deny that recognition.<br/><br/>If parentage cannot be established for whatever reason, we must put in place a mechanism that does not penalise the child.  Allowing guardianship to be awarded at least accommodates the child's rights in that regard.  Based on ECHR case law, a genetic relationship would need to be recognised regardless of whether the procedure falls outside the agreed ethical framework.  We must consider the child's rights in that regard.  Ultimately, in a particular case the decision must come down to what is in the best interests of the child and whether guardianship or parentage would be most suitable in that regard.  That is what I see as the kind of fallback position.  It really takes a case-by-case or individualised approach to ensure the best interests of each individual child are being maintained within the process.  I hope that answers the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about evaluating a destination and as a gay man, there are not many destinations available to me.  The United Kingdom is one and there is also the United States of America and Canada.  I have chosen to look at Canada for several reasons.  I wanted to align to the guidelines issued by the Department of Justice to people undertaking international surrogacy.  I am also considering the welfare of a surrogate mother, ourselves and the child who will be created.  It is important to understand all those elements.  There are also legal entities available there.  In the Canadian example, every step of the process is legalised and managed by registered third parties, whether they are IVF clinics or agency staff taking care of surrogate mothers.  The rights of everyone are very clearly stated from beginning to the end.  It is why we are talking to the committee today because that is what everyone wants.  Nobody wants to work in a grey space and the easiest way for us to have a child is still very complicated.  Normal people are doing this.  They do not have legal minds or backgrounds and they may not have a medical background.  They just want to be a parent.</p> <p>  One of the main aspects I have considered is ensuring the surrogate mother has, I suppose, means to live outside any reimbursement made to her.  The whole process should be welfare-focused and everybody should be taken care of, getting independent legal and psychological advice, with emotional support available throughout.  That is the only way I would feel comfortable about doing anything.  It is about protecting the surrogate mother, who is giving an enormous gift in doing what she does.  The reward is never financial for anyone.  A surrogate mother might do this because she knows people who have gone through IVF or fertility issues.  Her heart is in the right place for doing it.</p> <p>  These are some of the key pieces.  It is helpful for the surrogate mothers to know that because of the surrounding legislation, they would not be obliged to have any kind of legal relationship with the child.  They do not want to have that.  The intending parents, which are me and my husband in my case, want that obligation and legal process in place for us.  We want to be legally recognised, having both that gift and the obligation.  We do this knowing that when we return to Ireland, we have worked to some framework that we can present to the courts.</p><p>Does Senator Seery Kearney want Mr. Kenny Moore to come in on that?</p></speech>

We had met with Mr. Kenny Moore.  We have all seen that getting proper legislation and a proper framework for everybody is very important.  I have listened to their stories.  They are hard because families are affected by this.  Having read the stories of Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon, I feel we need to get this legislation done as soon as possible.  That is the main thing for me.  It is so important.  Every child is equal.  They go to school together and play together.  That has to be and is what we are absolutely committed to doing.</p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney is on top of her brief on this and has asked many of the questions I was going to ask.  Mr. Kenny Moore spoke about his lovely children and we spoke about birth certificates.  Travel documents have to be a huge issue.  We see how trying to get birth certificates for children at present is an absolute nightmare.  The witnesses might get back to me on that one.</p> <p>  Many of my questions about the different areas were answered.  The US, Canada and England were spoken about.  Mr. Lennon is going through surrogacy in Canada.  I wish him the best.  It is unfortunate that we do not have a proper framework and legislation here but I will give Mr. Kenny Moore and Mr. Lennon my full support.  I thank them very much.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#E00400"><p>I echo the Deputy's point that legislation is needed as soon as possible.  That must also retrospectively cover children already born.  With regard to travel documents, Mr. Lennon and I are here to represent parents who primarily access surrogacy through Canada, the United States and the UK.  As the process is covered by legislation in Canada and the United States and everybody's rights and responsibilities are clearly defined, the parents can apply on behalf of their child when it is born for a passport from those two countries.</p> <p>  A newborn child can return home from the UK on the basis of its birth certificate because of the travel arrangements between Ireland the UK.  Provided the parents carry appropriate travel documents, they can come back to Ireland with their newborn baby on the basis of the child having a birth certificate.  What happens when the child gets back here to Ireland?  That is where it gets tough because there is no legislation unlike in the three destinations I have mentioned.</p> <p>  If the parents wish to apply for an Irish passport for their child, the application will proceed on the basis of the father having a genetic link to his child and he will become the applicant.  The surrogate mother, if the application is made before the declaration of parentage has been applied for by the father in the Irish courts, will also have to sign the passport application.  That causes significant complexity.</p> <p>  As Mr. Lennon alluded to, surrogate mothers in our experience enter these agreements and arrangements with full consent.  They know exactly what they are being asked to do by the intended parents and what they wish to do for them.  They do not want to be the mother of these children or to have legal responsibility for them.  They want that to be applied to the intended parents.  When they are asked to sign passport documents, it often causes them anxiety because it suddenly seems the State is coming back to them to say they are the mothers.</p> <p>  When the application is made here for an Irish passport, it has to come from the biological dad.  If the declaration of parentage has not gone through the court system, which is often the case because it can take a long time, the surrogate mother will be required to co-sign that application.  She will be contacted by the Passport Office in order to verify that she has signed the application.  She is the second applicant.</p></speech>

She has obviously spent much of her career on this subject.  She is the author of two books.  I will ask a question about her book, <i>Same-Sex Parenting and the Best Interests Principle</i>.  Chapter 6 of this book examines the allocation of parentage in cases of surrogacy.  The chapter seeks to identify a way to regulate surrogacy that adheres to the best interests principle and balances the interests and needs of all stakeholders in the process.  It is suggested that the intention-based model of surrogacy which is facilitated through a pre-conception allocation of parenting satisfies the requirement of the best interests principle.  Will Dr. Bracken explain that to us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#E01100"><p>The Senator's question was on the pre-conception model of parentage and why I believe that is the most appropriate way forward.  Chapter 6 of the book the Senator mentioned focuses on domestic surrogacy.  I support a pre-conception allocation of parentage in the context of domestic surrogacy.  However, in the context of international surrogacy, a post-birth transfer of parentage is probably most appropriate.  I can talk about that later if that is of interest.</p> <p>  The pre-conception approach to domestic surrogacy is the best way forward because it balances the rights of everyone.  A post-birth transfer of parentage in a domestic context means that when a child is born, the intending parents do not have the legal rights and responsibilities that they need to care for the child, despite the fact that they will take physical care of the child very soon after the birth.  Instead, typically, the surrogate mother is regarded as the legal mother upon the birth of the child which means she has the rights and responsibilities for making all of the decisions for that child until the time a parental order is made.  This is the proposed way that parentage would be transferred in the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  It means that if the child needs medical treatment very soon after birth, the surrogate would probably need to consent to that rather than the intending parents.  That can place the surrogate in the very uncomfortable position of having to make this kind of legal decision on behalf of the child.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 proposed there would be a transfer of guardianship to the intending parents by way of a statutory declaration with the surrogate after the birth of the child.  That can alleviate some of those difficulties but it seems there would still be a delay in terms of the intending parents getting the legal rights and responsibilities they need to undertake the caring role.</p> <p>  It also creates difficulties for the surrogate by being regarded as the legal parent.  Perhaps it places her in a vulnerable position.</p><p>Under the 2017 general scheme, it was possible for either a surrogate or the intending parents to make the application for the parental order, which would ultimately transfer parentage to the intending parents.  Under the 2022 Bill, only the intending parents can make that application, which is unusual because in the rare situation where the intending parents fail to make the application, the surrogate seems to have no recourse other than placing the child for adoption.  For all those reasons, a model that allocates parental responsibilities based on the intentions of everyone involved, which is that the intended parents will raise the child, and having that become effective at the time the child is born balances the rights of everyone in the way I mentioned.  It ensures the child is legally integrated into their family from the moment of birth, that the intending parents have all the legal tools they need to undertake the caring role and that, at a time when they are busy caring for their newborn baby, they do not have to go back to court in order to facilitate the transfer of parentage.  In that way it balances the rights of all participants, in the domestic context at least.</p></speech>

Would she like to see that implemented in this country?  An AHR federal authority was established in Canada with duties similar to what we are proposing in this country.  It got abolished in 2013, I think for budgetary reasons.  How does Dr. Bracken feel about having a regulatory authority in this country in relation to surrogacy?</p></speech>

It is important that we have a central body that can disseminate information on all aspects of AHR and take on various other obligations set out in the Bill, including licensing and so on.  The dissemination of information is important so that everyone in the country is aware of what the AHR legislation says.  It is a 136-page Bill so having accessible information from an authoritative source within the country is important.  Having a central authority would be beneficial going forward and many countries have such authorities in place.  For example, in the UK there is a Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which does important work on setting the regulations in relation to various types of fertility treatment.</p></speech>

I was touched by his statements last week.  Of all the witnesses here, I was most touched by his contribution, by the relationship he has with the surrogate mother, by the relationship he encourages with the surrogate mother and by how he agreed to allow the birth mother to be on the birth cert.  I am heartened to hear he agrees with that.  There are many roads to parenthood and, as long as children are loved, cared for and feel secure, that is all that matters.  He heard my statement last week and, unfortunately, a lot of exploitation goes on in this road to parenthood.  How can we regulate against bad actors?  We can make rules in this country but how can we protect surrogate mothers in other jurisdictions that are not covered by that legislation and where the mother is not protected by our legislation?</p></speech>

In relation to my comments last week on the birth cert, in our case the surrogate mother is listed on our children's birth certs.  That is because they were born on the UK where parental rights cannot be transferred until after the child is born and, therefore, the surrogate is legally obliged to be placed on the birth cert.  As a couple who had children through the UK, we could not go through the parental order process that exists there.  In order to do so, you have to be a resident, passport holder, citizen, etc. and we were none of those.  That is the primary reason the surrogate is listed on the birth cert.  Going forward, we ask members to consider that when surrogacy is the method of conception, the standard birth cert issued to the child would list the intended parents but that, if you wish to include the surrogate, it could be done through the long form of the birth cert, so the child can see clearly the method of conception and gestation.</p> <p>  I note the Senator's point about the level of exploitation.  We all agree that legislation is the way to prevent exploitation.  I dispute that it is extensive.  I do not believe that to be the case.  We in Irish Gay Dads work primarily through the United States, Canada and the UK, where the surrogacy model is extremely well established and has been in existence for over 30 years.  Natalie Gamble, a legal expert from the UK, was before this committee two weeks ago talking about the fact she has handled 1,500 cases and come across about three or four that caused issues.</p> <p>  I dispute that the level of exploitation is extensive but I will address the point on bad actors.  All of us, when we dream of having a child, want that child's birth story to be as perfect as possible.  We want every party to the agreement to be acknowledged, included and protected.  As I mentioned last week, no matter how much you regulate medicine or any sector, there will always be bad actors.  All you can do is put together a stringent framework to ensure that every party enters into the agreement freely, gives consent and gets appropriate legal support and appropriate independent medical support, and that every party, including the intended parents, the egg donor and the surrogate, gets psychological support so there is no doubt in anybody's mind about what is about to happen, how it will happen or what the process will look like.</p> <p>  There has to be, as the Senator touched on in her questions to Dr. Bracken, an oversight body that regulates all the players.  It would be the AHRA in Ireland and equivalent bodies in other locations.  Anybody who participates in a surrogacy agreement, whether a clinic, a legal person or a medical person, has to be regulated and approved by that body.  They are the safeguards.  Not legislating will increase the possibility for bad actors; legislating is the way to lock it down to the maximum extent.</p></speech>

That should be her right.  I think we are in agreement about that.  It is about protecting her interests so she understands from the beginning, before any medical or IVF process starts, that everyone is clear and understanding of the agreement that she is choosing to carry a child on behalf of a couple.  That couple will often want a lifetime relationship between that woman and the child, not as a parent or with parental responsibility but as someone significant in that child's life.  Everyone would want that.</p><p>The ethical safeguards are those regulated, independent organisations such as lawyers, State agencies and psychological counselling, and that should be done throughout.</p></speech>

Forgive me if I am doubling up on questions; I was attending another committee meeting earlier.  In her research, Dr. Bracken states that both parents were legally recognised in only 50% of the families.  She also said there were omissions from the 2015 Act.  I would like to be clear in my head that in 50% of cases both parents are recognised and in the other 50% they are not.  This sliding scale of family legal recognition is unacceptable.  Will Dr. Bracken explain to me as a layperson how 50% of the families would get that recognition and 50% did not?  The omissions in the 2015 Act mean we have legislated for differences.  How will this affect the retrospective route to parentage?  If there is time, I will contribute again.</p></speech>

In the research I undertook with LGBT Ireland last year we were looking at the structure of LGBTQI+ parent families and their routes to legal recognition.  The families that were recognised, where there were two legal parents, had gone through a route to parentage that is recognised under the 2015 Act.  Essentially, there are two main ways in which that can happen.  If a family has their child after the commencement of the Act on 4 May 2020, there is a pathway to parentage that allows for two parents - they could be the opposite sex or the same sex - to be jointly recognised as legal parents provided they have used a fertility clinic within Ireland and all of the relevant consents and declarations and so on have been given.  Provided they meet all of those criteria, on the birth of the child both of the parents are legally recognised as parents as per their preconception intention.<br/><br/>There is another primary route to parentage that recognises the retrospective parentage for children who were conceived prior to the commencement of the legislation, that is, before 4 May 2020.  There is a retrospective route available to some families if they had their child before 4 May 2020 and they meet various other criteria, one of which is where a gamete donor was used who was unknown and remains unknown to the families.  In order to get that retrospective recognition of parentage the family cannot have used a known donor.  If families meet the criteria, they can be recognised and some 50% of families were recognised.  Unfortunately, many other families fell outside of the criteria for various reasons, one of which being that they had used a known donor.  Having prioritised their child's right to identity, they cannot achieve retrospective recognition.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the legislation does not cover DAHR that is undertaken abroad, even if the child is subsequently born in Ireland, or <i>vice versa</i>.  If the parent had DAHR treatment in Ireland and the child was born in another country, that again falls outside of the recognition.  Those are the main ways in which families fall outside of the legislation.  Also, if the family did not use a fertility clinic, they would fall outside of the legislation.  That might be referred to as a non-clinical procedure or an at-home procedure.  If the family had their child through that form of DAHR, they are not covered by the legislation either.  Those are the primary omissions in respect of the legislation.</p></speech>

Dr. Bracken spoke about the incredible amalgamation of different pathways to becoming mammies and daddies.  It varies from couple to couple, country to country, person to person and case to case.  How best can the State help the witnesses, as parents, to become parents and move through the ethical surrogacy we want?  We all want the best-case scenario, as Dr. Bracken outlined, and that identity.  Parents who opt to have that identity known are almost being penalised for doing so.  Should we extend the regulatory authority to become an information service?  Is there a best-case information service in any other jurisdiction?  Is there somewhere we can look to?  What kind of information would be most beneficial for intending parents, such as the witnesses, who are on that pathway to international surrogacy?</p> <p>  I also have a general question with regard to the pathway and the lack of recognition prior to birth.  Mr. Kenny Moore told a lovely story about bringing his twins home and his family surrounding his newborn twins.  At that stage, those children had two daddies but legally they had no parents, in a way.  Practically, how did that make Mr. Kenny Moore feel?  How best can we change that, respecting the birth mother and her rights to bodily autonomy and to change her mind and the witnesses' right to be the parents they want to be in the grey area of birth and moving from the birth mother to the new parents?  I am sorry if that is all very jumbled.</p></speech>

I am very new to this.  In three weeks' time I will be starting my IVF treatment.  I understand the Senator's question was how best can the State help or support citizens in understanding.  It does not need to be very complicated in the sense that most people searching or googling information will go to sites such as Citizens Information for everything.  Right now, there is information there for people to understand.  For anyone going through this process, it does not matter if we regulate it to the nth degree.  It will always be slightly complicated, simply because there are so many parties involved.  It is not just about two people.  It is important to have a go-to source of information, whether that is the Department of Health or Citizens Information, that is very clear about what is the green pathway to surrogacy, domestically or internationally.  Perhaps the regulator should be a point of reference rather than people having to email or call it to ask these questions.  Citizens Information would be a great source for everyone to have that.  It very clearly sets out the different steps because it really is a multi-step process.  IVF is at the core of it and it was brilliant to be able to talk about this today.  The Bill will catapult family planning for all Irish people.  People will need assisted human reproduction information and assistance more and more as we move forward in life.</p><p>It would be good to have a clear framework such that a regular person could understand the steps they need to take and follow.</p><p> The Senator asked whether there was a similar model in other countries.  While my husband and I looked at the US system also, the Canadian ministry of health makes clear the requirements that need to be met and the steps one has to take through surrogacy.  It is stated in clear language that anyone could understand.</p></speech>

For context, we represent parents who have had children through three locations, namely, the United States, Canada and the UK.  In the United States and Canada, because of the presence of legislation, as soon as the child has been born the intended parents are considered the legal parents, whether they are an opposite-sex couple or a same-sex couple.  That means they have the right, within the hospital setting, to make all decisions regarding the welfare of the child, such as what postnatal checks can be done, what blood tests can be carried out and so on.</p> <p>  In the UK, the situation is the same as in Ireland.  The woman who gives birth is the legal mother and, therefore, she has to make all those decisions.  That is the experience we had, whereby our children were born in the UK.  I might talk a little about the emotional side of that and how it all feels.  For the surrogate mother in our case, and for most surrogate mothers, it is a pretty difficult stage.  They will have just given birth and will be recovering from that, they will have intended that the intended parents would be the parents of the child, and they will then be drawn into a process where they will have to make decisions about the child and how he or she will be treated in hospital.  Even if those decisions are very standard ones, such as whether a vitamin K injection can be given or whether a blood sample can be taken, it still puts the surrogate mother in a position in which she never wanted to be.  Imagine how complicated it then gets if the child has additional needs and needs to stay in hospital for a period.  Potentially, the surrogate mother, even though she might be ready to go home, would be forced to stay in the hospital to be present with the child and to meet the legal obligations.  That is not right for the surrogate mother.</p> <p>  From our perspective, having been in that situation, it deflates your bubble somewhat.  You will be on this incredible high, as anybody who has experienced the arrival of one's child will know, and now you are being sidestepped.  The nurses and doctors will be very busy and might say they cannot really talk to anyone except the surrogate mother, who can give that consent.  It does not feel good.  We knew all this in advance, having taken legal advice before we went to the UK so we knew what we were signing up for, but nonetheless, when it happens, it impacts on you and on how you feel about your position as a parent.  One of my colleagues from Irish Families Through Surrogacy mentioned at last week's meeting that she felt like a bit of an actor sometimes as a parent.  What I have described is a prime example of how you can made to feel like an actor.</p> <p>  As for what the State can do when you get back to Ireland in order to help you feel recognised, it can make the process as accessible as possible, that is, making the declaration of parentage as accessible and quick as possible and allowing for it to apply to both parents, not just the genetic one.  As Mr. Lennon mentioned, it could be that certain locations and providers would be put on a green list, and if the process looks as though it has taken place properly and there are affidavits to declare that, perhaps the process could be short-circuited to allow the declaration of parentage to be proceed much faster than it currently does.</p></speech>

My first questions are for Dr. Bracken, regarding children in Ireland who have been born through surrogacy.  She mentioned them in her document.  Will she expand on our responsibilities to them as legislators?  The issue has gone on too long.  A whole bunch of children are not recognised and that is not right, and we need to act on it.  How does she foresee that playing out?</p> <p>  I have become fixated on the issue of pre-birth, post-birth or at-birth parentage.  I will put my cards on table, as I have done since the start, and state my belief that the pre-birth model is the best one.  Dr. Bracken stated that for international surrogacy, the best of the three is post birth but did she mean at-birth?  For all the various reasons we consistently hear relating to potential medical issues and who will take responsibility for that, there are many difficulties in respect of post-birth parentage.  I think that if there were a good system that operated correctly, the pre-birth model would be the way forward.</p> <p>  I might follow up with questions for Mr. Lennon and Mr. Kenny Moore.  I greatly appreciate our guests being here and sharing their personal stories, and I wish the best of luck to Mr. Lennon on his journey.</p></speech>

Many children living in Ireland have been born through surrogacy and their family relationships are not recognised at present.  They are left in the really undesirable position of not having a permanent legal relationship with both of their parents, so that absolutely needs to be addressed.  I have proposed a model similar to that in sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of the Children and Family Relationships Act, which allows for retrospective declarations of parentage to be made in cases of donor-assisted human reproduction, DAHR, that were undertaken prior to the commencement of the legislation.  Something similar in the case of necessary adoptions could be used successfully in the context of children who have been born through surrogacy.  That would allow the intending parents to apply to court for this declaration of parentage to recognise either of the intending parents, or perhaps both of them, who are not at that point recognised as legal parents, provided certain proofs are given to the court.  This appears to be a relatively straightforward process in the context of DAHR, so I would argue it should also be a very simple process for surrogacy in respect of surrogacy that has already taken place.  As we have the model for it within sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of the Children and Family Relationships Act, that is the model I would propose for the retrospective recognition of parentage.</p> <p>  As for the pre-birth or post-birth recognition of parentage, I draw a distinction between domestic surrogacy, which can be facilitated through the pre-conception approach, and international surrogacy, for which a post-birth approval process makes sense, simply on the basis it would be difficult for the State to sanction in advance parentage that has been established through a procedure undertaken abroad.  That is not to say it could not happen, and perhaps an application during the pregnancy would be possible, but the post-birth transfer of parentage in international surrogacy would allow the Irish courts to check that certain ethical safeguards have been adhered to throughout the pregnancy, up to the birth of the child.  It is not a perfect system by any means, given it means that when the child has been born, for the purposes of Irish law he or she may not have that legal recognition in respect of the relationship with the intending parents.  Nevertheless, what I have proposed is that where the intending parents have both been listed on the foreign birth certificate, we might have something of a fast-track application process in Ireland, whereby they could obtain a parental order recognising both of them as legal parents, and the application would be granted unless it were fundamentally contrary to an agreed ethical framework for surrogacy within Ireland.  Having a post-birth judicial process would allow for scrutiny of the ethical standards to ensure we maintain the integrity of the ethical framework and ensure that recognition is based on it.  Moreover, it would allow for consideration of the best interests of the child in that process.  That is primarily why I believe a post-birth process in regard to the international arrangement would be the more appropriate way forward but in the case of domestic surrogacy, I would support a pre-conception transfer of parentage.</p></speech>

If we had more time, I would ask her further questions because I imagine that what she outlined would leave people in limbo in the context of medical decisions and so on post birth.  Would there be any way of going down the pre-birth route but with a guarantee that if something were to go wrong, perhaps in the first few months, that could be changed?  Unfortunately, we do not have time to go into all this but I wanted to put it out there.</p><p>A lot of complications arise if agreements are to be post-birth.  We would still be stuck in the same kind of situation we are currently in, a situation we are trying to move away from.  I will ask about the Canadian situation.  I heard Senator Seery Kearney ask about it earlier.  It was one of my questions because I have been looking into that area as well.  Mr. Kenny Moore mentioned it last week and when he came before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Does he have any additional information on that?  He also made a point about potentially having a surrogate listed on the long form birth certificate.  Does he see that as an optional process because I am conscious that many surrogates would not actually want to be on the birth certificate and do not see that role for themselves?</p></speech>

They would be able to provide far more information.  My experience of the Canadian system is as somebody who tried to have a child through the Canadian system and failed for unknown reasons.  Those solicitors will be better placed to give the Deputy more insight than I could.</p> <p>  With regard to the long form of the birth certificate, the Deputy asks a good question.  What happens in the United States and Canada is that the couple, as the intended parents and regardless of their gender, have the option to be listed on the birth certificate when the child is born.  The surrogate does not need to appear on the birth certificate.  As I have mentioned, in the UK, the surrogate must appear on the birth certificate.  She is the legal mother at the point of birth and, therefore, must be listed on the birth certificate.  We encourage our members to discuss every aspect of a surrogacy journey with their surrogate prior to commencement.  If it is required by local law that an agreement be made, that agreement should be made.  If that is not required, as is the case in the UK, we still encourage our members to make some form of agreement and to discuss with the surrogate what will happen when it comes to the issuing of a birth certificate.  Regardless of what is available in Canada and the United States, when they go there, most couples will ask the surrogate to be named on the birth certificate simply because, when they come back to Ireland, a birth certificate that lists two men as the parents will not work for Irish institutions such as the Passport Office.</p></speech>

Of course, if the option is there to include the details on the long form of the birth certificate, that should be another aspect of the discussion between the intended parents and the surrogate.  Clearly, it is better if the surrogate is willing to be a participant in that and to have her name listed on the birth certificate.  The current reason for listing a surrogate mother on a birth certificate issued in the United States or Canada is simply that it makes life easier for the parents when coming back to Ireland if it looks like a normal birth certificate.</p></speech>

My first question is for Dr. Bracken.  With regard to pre-birth and post-birth agreements, what is included?  Is it only parentage?  If it is a post-birth agreement, does that ever conflict with any health decisions that need to be made during labour if, for example, something goes wrong or if there is a threat to the woman's life?  What is actually included in a pre-birth or post-birth agreement?  Does the woman's life still have protection if something awful were to happen?  Does the agreement affect that in any way, shape or form?</p> <p>  Obviously, the pathway to parentage is the preferred option but have there ever been other mechanisms in law used to give temporary rights with regard to consent for medical care?  The first thing that comes to mind would be care orders, although that would be an overreach.  Have any other mechanisms within the law been explored in the interim while the parental orders are being assessed to deal with that two-year wait before giving the other intended parents the right to consent in respect of education, medical care or passports?  Those are my two questions for Dr. Bracken.  I will then come to Mr. Lennon and Mr. Kenny Moore.</p></speech>

On the different protections under a pre-conception or post-birth model, that is really a question for the Irish Legislature to decide.  If it decides to adopt a pre-conception approach, we can decide what the ethical standards within that approach will be.  Similarly, we can decide the standards that would apply under a post-birth approach.  If you look around the world, you will see that different standards apply under different systems, depending on the choices that have been made.  However, under a pre-conception model, the same ethical standards would apply as would apply under a post-birth model.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, as currently drafted, is very clear that the surrogate always retains bodily integrity throughout the pregnancy and makes the choices during the pregnancy.  Regardless of whether a pre-conception or post-conception approach is adopted, that would remain.  It is up to the Legislature to decide what the ethical safeguards are.</p> <p>  With regard to other measures that might be taken, as I mentioned a moment ago there is a proposal in the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill that guardianship could be granted to the intending parents at some point after the birth of the child by way of a statutory agreement with the surrogate, although I should say that is within the domestic surrogacy model.  As written, it seems that would be possible before a parental order is issued in the case of surrogacy.  There would therefore be some decision-making capacity.  There is a difficulty in that there would necessarily be a time lag before guardianship could transferred through the statutory declaration with the surrogate, which does not address the vulnerability issue we would be concerned about when the child is born.  That is certainly something that is proposed within the Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gear&oacute;id Kenny Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#J00800"><p>I thank Senator Ruane for her question.  Let me explain how I understand that situation would work legally from my perspective as a non-legal person.  When the child returns to the State, whether the parents are a same-sex couple or an opposite-sex couple, the child does not really have any legal parent here in the State because the State recognises the surrogate mother as the automatic legal parent at the birth of the child.  The biological dad is not automatically recognised by the State at the point of birth.  He must therefore make an application for a declaration of parentage to establish his rights as a legal parent.  Assuming that application is successful and he becomes a parent, as we discussed last week, the other parent, whether a female or a male, is nobody in the child's life for the first two years.  He or she must apply for guardianship.</p> <p>  To touch on the Senator's question as to what happens if something were to happen to the legal father, who is now resident in the State, and if he were to die, the situation would be that the child would then be in the State being cared for by a guardian but the child would still have a legal parent, that is, the surrogate mother, who is living somewhere else.  We do not yet know how the State would react in that situation.  The rights of the legal parent, the surrogate mother, could potentially trump the rights of the guardian.  Has there been a case of this nature?  There was a case before the courts a number of months ago in which a legal father who had a child with his partner through surrogacy made an application because he had a terminal illness.  The guardianship application could not proceed because the child had not yet reached the age of two.  The case centred around establishing the right of the intended mother to apply for guardianship early and discussing what would happen to the child.  I do not know whether a ruling has been delivered in that case.  If the legal parent dies, the family is in a really precarious position because the child is now being cared for by a guardian but there is somebody outside the State who has higher authority, that is, the legal mother.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests.  It was wonderful to hear from all of them and their opening statements were good and insightful.  Like my colleagues I wish Shane and Carlos the very best over the coming weeks and months as they begin their journey.  As everyone will attest it is a nerve-wracking road to parenthood so I wish them the best of luck over the coming months.</p> <p>  Beginning with Dr. Bracken, I wish to go back to the ethical framework she spoke about and that Gear&oacute;id and Shane also addressed.  Dr. Bracken was talking about an oversight body that will ensure the appropriate standards are maintained and that in the other country the legal, medical and psychological standards are maintained.  How can we as a State ensure another country is upholding those?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.716" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#K00700"><p>We cannot control the laws of another country and we should not attempt to say we can.  What we can do is control the recognition or the establishment of legal parentage at home.  In doing so we can base our recognition of it on an equivalence of ethical standards.  That encourages any intending parents who are setting out on their surrogacy journey to first check to ensure everything they are doing will adhere to that ethical framework.  The AHR authority will have a role in that as well by disseminating information about what an ethical surrogacy looks like so anyone who is even contemplating taking on the surrogacy journey would know in advance what ethical standards need to be adhered to.  There would also need to be legal advice put in place before any surrogacy is entered into so the intending parents can know what needs to be adhered to in order for the recognition to be granted once the child comes home again.</p> <p>  On the ethical standards, I do not think we can require that the ethical standards here be identical to those in place in another country but we can ensure an equivalence of ethical standards and in doing so, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we need to rely on a human rights framework for that, namely, something that prioritises the human rights of all participants in the surrogacy.  For the surrogate, we need to ensure there is free and informed consent, that there are balanced power dynamics between a surrogate and the intending parents and that there are protections for the right to bodily integrity.  We need to ensure protection for the rights of the child and then also for the intending parents.  If a gamete donor has been used there must be protection for his or her rights as well.  By having, as I proposed, a post-birth judicial process that allows for those ethical standards to be checked and for the best interests of the child to be determined, then we can ensure any surrogacy undertaken by an Irish citizen will meet agreed ethical standards as we have set them in Ireland.</p></speech>

Is the regulator certifying these standards are definitely being met there or is it that from what we can gather, these are the best countries to go to?</p></speech>

Instead, it would really be advice for intending parents.  It would necessarily need to be very reactive and something that can change as standards change.  We would need to be constantly monitoring the standards in place in other countries in order to give the relevant advice.  Ultimately, the check would take place on a post-birth basis through the courts.  I believe that to be the most appropriate way forward but certainly the regulatory authority has a role in disseminating information about where ethical standards might be better met and what the intending parents need to look out for when they are entering into their surrogacy agreement.</p></speech>

I just wanted to see exactly what Dr. Bracken was proposing because there was reference made to a kind of "green list" and a fast-track system for people who went to certain countries.  The point of view I am coming from is we have many people in a limbo at the moment.  I do not want us to inadvertently create another limbo for people such that there is one list of countries that allow you to be fast-tracked here and that is all great but there is another set of people, children and families that went to other countries and they are suddenly in a limbo now.  That is not what Dr. Bracken is proposing.</p></speech>

I am fully in agreement with the Senator.  We should not say all these countries are bad and all these ones are good.  Instead, we need to look at each individual arrangement to see if certain ethical safeguards have been put in place.  That is what we should base our model of recognition on.</p></speech>

The law commissions for England and Wales have proposed a green list so perhaps that is where that suggestion has been made.  A more individualised approach needs to be taken to ensure each individual surrogacy arrangement meets the best interests of children and certain ethical standards.</p></speech>

If they want to come back to Ireland for a holiday or move home permanently they should not be disadvantaged based on where they were living at the time if surrogacy was legal and lawful in that country and they availed of that process.  That is why it needs to be done on a case-by-case basis as opposed to having lists.  That is my personal view on that.</p></speech>

On the declaration of parentage and the post-birth or pre-birth transfer of parentage, as the committee is examining international surrogacy, is this an issue that is outside our scope because we in Ireland do not have the ability to dictate whether another country looks at parentage post-birth or pre-birth?  In the situation we were talking about, a woman is just after giving birth and there is a newborn baby there.  We cannot really say we see these two guys as the legal parents therefore the hospital in Canada, the UK or wherever has to recognise them, or can we?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.730" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#K02100"><p>The determination of parentage for the purpose of Irish law would not be recognised in Canada.  Thus, the Senator is correct in saying even if we in Ireland decided that upon the birth of the children the intending parents are the legal parents it would completely depend on where the child has actually been born as to whether the parents in that country are recognised as legal parents at the time and if the child needed immediate medical treatment in that country who would be able to consent to it.  We cannot control those particular decisions.  It probably becomes relevant when issuing the travel documentation for the child to come back home again.  Again, there are ways to address that to ensure the child gets home safely and then the determination can be made about the recognition of parentage.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Bracken for answering that.</p> <p>  I have a final question.</p><p>The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, which is dealing with many other assisted human reproduction issues, is a health related Bill.  Dr. Bracken spoke at the start of her presentation about how the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 has created two different tiers of parents - some who are recognised under the Act and some who are not - and then there is a situation with surrogacy parents where there are significant legal gaps.  Would the issue of international surrogacy and all the ancillary issues not be best addressed in a justice-based Bill rather than a health-based Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lydia Bracken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#L00200"><p>It is really a matter for the Legislature as to what form the Bill takes.  I only want to see the provisions in place, regardless of where they sit.  I would not like to see another Bill being proposed at this stage.  International surrogacy needs to be dealt with in the existing Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  There is a danger that if it is pushed into another piece of legislation, it would be merely pushed down the line and would not happen for several years when there are a number of children who have already been born through surrogacy internationally and children will continue to be born through surrogacy internationally, the vindication of whose rights cannot be delayed any further.  If we are to address international surrogacy, it needs to be done in the current Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.</p> <p>  I suppose I am quite sceptical about the timelines on the basis of what happened with the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.  It was enacted in 2015 but not commenced for a further five years because, first, there were typographical errors and they needed amendments by amending legislation, and then more errors were identified so that there was more amending legislation meaning that it was a five-year delay ultimately.  We cannot have another five-year delay in terms of addressing international surrogacy or any other aspect of assisted human reproduction.</p> <p>  We also cannot look at international surrogacy in a vacuum.  It needs to be consistent with the other provisions in relation to domestic surrogacy and with our current regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction.  It needs to be addressed in one comprehensive piece of legislation and it needs to be done as soon as possible but in a way that ensures that all of the relevant aspects are addressed.</p></speech>

When Dr. Bracken talked about how we could not adjudicate on entire jurisdictions and it should be it on a case-by-case basis, is there an option or a model whereby we accredit particular entities or clinics because we determine that they follow a particular ethical pathway and that we have some level of oversight of how they operate?  Is that an alternative model that would work?</p></speech>

Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  I remind everyone that masks should continue to be worn throughout the meeting by all present and should only be removed when speaking.</p> <p>  I call on Ms O'Keeffe to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am a principal officer in the civil justice legislation function of the Department of Justice.  I am joined by Mr. Andrew Munro, assistant secretary, who has responsibility for civil justice policy and legislation.<br/><br/>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  Section 7 of the Act, which makes provision for Irish citizenship by descent, is applicable to children born outside Ireland through international surrogacy arrangements.  Section 7(1) provides that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen or would if alive have been an Irish citizen.  Section 7(3) provides that subsection (1) shall not confer Irish citizenship on a person born outside the island of Ireland whose Irish citizen parent was also born outside the island of Ireland, unless the person&rsquo;s birth is registered in the foreign births register, kept by the Department of Foreign Affairs under section 27 of the Act.  This requirement does not apply where the Irish citizen parent was abroad in the public service at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth.  Where a person&rsquo;s birth is registered in the foreign births register, the person&rsquo;s Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration, not from the date when the person was born.<br/><br/>Section 11 of the 1956 Act provides for citizenship of children adopted by Irish citizens, with effect from the date an adoption order is made or the date on which an intercountry adoption effected outside the State is recognised under the Adoption Act 2010.<br/><br/>In 2012, a guidance document was published on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel documents issues in relation to children born outside the State as a result of surrogacy arrangements.  The guidance document was agreed by an interdepartmental group on surrogacy, comprising the Departments of Justice, Health, Children, Foreign Affairs, and Social Protection, and the Office of the Attorney General.  The guidance document provides information to people who intend to enter surrogacy arrangements outside the State on the practical and legal considerations arising under Irish law where the intending parents intend to bring the child to live with them in the State.  The guidance document gives information on how legal parentage is established, how citizenship may be established, the information required for travel documents to issue for the child and the undertakings required to be given by the intending parents before travel documents are issued.<br/><br/>Under Irish law, the genetic father of a child born through surrogacy may apply for a declaration of parentage in respect of the child under the Status of Children Act 1987.  If the declaration of parentage is granted, the father will apply for guardianship under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  An Irish citizen genetic father will also, in most cases, apply for an order under section 14(3) of the Passports Act 2008, directing that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may issue passports to the child without the consent of the birth mother until the child reaches the age of 18 years.<br/><br/>The Department of Justice is aware that issues regarding entitlement to Irish citizenship have arisen in relation to children born outside the State through surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction, where the Irish citizen intending parent is neither the birth mother nor the genetic father of the child.<br/><br/>There are some judicial review applications before the courts at present arising from passport applications made for children born outside the State through surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction and which involve issues relating to entitlement to Irish citizenship by descent under section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  The Supreme Court has recently determined that it will hear a leapfrog appeal on the question of the interpretation of section 7(1) of the 1956 Act in relation to entitlement to citizenship by descent in the context of surrogacy.  This issue arose in the High Court case of A, B and C <i>v</i>. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As these matters are currently before the courts, it would be inappropriate for the Department to comment further on them at this time.<br/><br/>I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobhan Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#M00300"><p>I am the director of the passport service at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mrs. &Uacute;na Fannon, head of the policy and legal unit of the passport service, and Mr. Trevor Redmond, legal counsellor in the Department.  The Department of Foreign Affairs welcomes the opportunity to address the joint committee this morning.</p> <p>  The Department receives a significant and increasing number of requests for passports and consular services from Irish citizens who have entered into international surrogacy arrangements.  The Department is often the first State body encountered by Irish intending parents in their surrogacy journey as they seek to return to Ireland with a child following its birth overseas.  The role of the Department in these cases concerns the processing of applications for travel documents for children born through international surrogacy arrangements and also providing consular assistance as necessary in the country of birth.  </p> <p>  Our embassies and consulates provide consular assistance and are the main points of contact from the Department for Irish intending parents who are applying for an emergency travel certificate, ETC.  The passport service in Dublin prioritises the review of the ETC applications and approves the issuance of the ETC, which is then issued by the local embassy or consulate.</p> <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for the issue of passports and other travel documents to Irish citizens under the Passports Act 2008, as amended.  The 2008 Act clearly sets out the criteria for issuance of a passport to a child, including that the child must be an Irish citizen and that the guardians of the child consent to the issue of the passport.  In addition, section 15 of the 2008 Act specifically provides for the issuance of ETCs.</p> <p>  An ETC is not a passport but, rather, a temporary travel document for one-time use.</p><p>An ETC is valid for such period as the Minister considers appropriate to enable the person to undertake the journey in respect of which it is issued, generally within 72 hours.  An ETC includes a photo of the child, their details and the details of their intended travel.</p><p> In the absence of a specific legal framework for children born through international surrogacy, a guidance document, which was published by the then Department of Justice and Equality in 2012, provides guidance as to the principles that will be applied by the Irish authorities when considering whether a child is an Irish citizen and who the child's legal parents and guardians are for the purposes of dealing with applications for travel documents.  The guidance document was agreed by an interdepartmental group on surrogacy, which was comprised of the then Departments of Justice and Equality, Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Social Protection, and the Office of the Attorney General.  Among other things, the guidance document outlines the information required in order for a travel document to issue for the child.</p><p> In applying the guidance document of the Department of Justice and the Passports Act 2008, as amended, an approach to the processing of ETC applications has developed in consultation with the interdepartmental group on surrogacy.  The following is the general approach.</p><p> In order for an ETC to issue for a child born through international surrogacy, the Minister must be satisfied that there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is or may be an Irish citizen.  For a child born outside Ireland through surrogacy, this is typically based on their genetic link to an Irish citizen father.  In addition, the ETC application must be made by a parent or guardian of the child and the guardian or guardians of the child must consent to the issuance of the travel document.  When a child is born through a surrogacy arrangement, under Irish law the surrogate mother is the legal mother of the child.  If she is married then the surrogate mother's husband is presumed, by law, to be the father of the child.  Therefore, the husband will also, along with the surrogate mother, be the joint guardian of the child.</p><p> The documents required in such ETC applications relate to: the child; the Irish citizen genetic father; the surrogate mother; if the surrogate mother is married, her husband; and DNA evidence from a satisfactory source demonstrating that the Irish citizen intended father is the genetic father of the child.  A list of the documentary requirements has been shared with the committee and we are happy to answer any questions on them.</p><p> A number of key documents include: the child's birth certificate; a written undertaking from the Irish intended father that states he will notify his local health centre of the child's presence within two working days of their arrival in Ireland, and that he will apply to the Irish courts for a declaration of parentage and a guardianship order for the child; as well as an affidavit sworn by the surrogate mother in her native language consenting to the taking of DNA samples, the issuing of a travel document for the child and to the genetic father being made a guardian.  The affidavit should also state her marital status and confirmation that she has received independent legal advice.</p><p> With regard to the verification of documents, public documents issued in the country where the birth takes place must have an apostille certificate.  Affidavits and official documents that are provided in a language other than English must be accompanied by a notarised translation with an apostille certificate.</p><p> An apostille is an official government-issued certificate added to documents verifying the signature or seal or both of a public officer on a public document.  This means that the document will be recognised and accepted when presented in another country that has acceded to The Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents.</p><p> An apostille is issued by the designated competent authority of the State from which the document originates.  In Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for issuing apostille certificates on Irish public documents.  The requirement for documents and translations to be apostilled in the emergency travel certificate process allows for further verification that the documents are genuine, and means that the passport service can be satisfied that they are authentic.  Given the number of documents required, the process of gathering them can be lengthy.  The passport service takes very seriously its obligation to uphold the integrity of the process in order to protect all parties, including the child and surrogate mother.  The rights of the child are of paramount consideration.</p><p> Furthermore, our officials in overseas missions are obliged to comply with local law as well as with Irish law.  The Department will not facilitate the unlawful movement of children across national boundaries.  In jurisdictions where an international surrogacy case has not been encountered by the Department before, the Department seeks local legal advice to seek to ensure that it acts in compliance with local law.  This means that the ETC application process can be complex and time consuming.  The Department of Justice guidance document flags that commissioning adults intending to apply for a travel document for a child should plan for the possibility of the child having to remain in the country of birth until it has been established whether a travel document can be issued.   While we endeavour to deal with all applications as promptly and efficiently as possible, the Department can give no guarantee, before the birth of a child, that he or she will be regarded as an Irish citizen or that the intended father will be regarded as a parent or guardian of that child and, therefore, that a passport or other travel document can be provided for the child.</p><p> When intending parents contact us in advance of a child's birth we direct them to the Department of Justice guidance document, and advise them to ensure that they have both Irish and local legal advice.  We also advise them of the documentary requirements for a travel document application, and of the need to remain in the country of birth until it has been established whether a travel document can be issued.</p><p> The Department advises the HSE when the written undertakings, as set out in the Department of Justice guidance document, have been given by the intended father.  The Department also notifies border control that an ETC has been issued in respect of a child travelling to Ireland.  When the Irish court proceedings referenced in the intended father's written undertakings are complete, a court order is, typically, issued which relates to a declaration of parentage, guardianship and custody.  The court order will also, typically, dispense with the consent of the surrogate mother and, where applicable, her husband to the issuing of a passport to the child, and to the issuing of all travel documentation until the child reaches majority.  At this point, a father can submit a passport application for their child to the Passport Service.</p><p> The Department welcomes the work of this committee and hopes that its recommendations will bring greater clarity, and certainty, to the current travel document application process for children born outside the State through surrogacy, as well as to Irish intending parents.  In the meantime, we will continue to assist families going through this process.  We would welcome any questions members might have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.748" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#N00300"><p>This exchange is an unusual experience for me, and almost triggering for me, listening to the process being explored by officials, having gone through the process myself.</p> <p>  I wish to thank the officials for their extraordinary dedication, integrity and support that has been given throughout all of the years, and exceptionally so in the last number of months.  As evidence of that I have text messages from Department officials that were sent as early as 6 a.m. and as late as 1.30 a.m. on one Sunday morning.  They have shown extraordinary dedication to Irish citizens and prospective Irish citizens.  Mrs. Fannon was at the heart of it all.  I do not know how many emails that there have been at this stage but at the heart of all of that has been an extraordinary amount of work done by her and all of the officials.  I thank all of them.  The interdepartmental surrogacy group has worked extraordinarily hard over the last month in trying to deal with what is an unprecedented situation, particularly in terms of Ukraine.</p> <p>  What the officials have set out for us is quite onerous and detailed.  The standard which parents or intended parents - they are parents to me - bringing home their child has to reach in terms of documentary and DNA evidence is very high.  All that is set out in a document provided by the Department of Justice as long as ten years ago in 2012.  The document was done by the Department officials and in conjunction with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter.  There are other finer details that I feel are important enough to be drawn out today.  I refer to the fact that the DNA evidence is not just a matter of doing a quick swab and placing that in an envelope.  The test is done by the Ormond Quay Paternity Services, which is a court recognised organisation in Ireland, and its standard of proof is accepted by the Irish courts in all sorts of paternity matters.  Also, the DNA evidence must be taken in the presence of an embassy official and a doctor who has been nominated by the embassy.  Therefore, a person cannot just run to any old doctor and pull them in.  The embassy must approve the doctor.  Everything is done in a transparent fashion.  Also, the surrogate mother must be present.  In recent weeks, we have had discussions about that, given we have people inside and outside of the Ukraine.  It is important that the public hears about the fastidious level of detail that is required.</p><p>When one arrives home in Ireland, the first thing one does is contact the public health nurse to register the baby.  Then one gets one's solicitor to issue proceedings because one has given an undertaking to do that.  Then one arrives into court and the Judiciary looks through one's documentation.  The fact that an emergency travel certificate was issued almost means, in and of itself, that a standard of proof has been reached.  In a sense, the witnesses are like gatekeepers, although I do not want to undermine the role of the Judiciary in this.  This has been vetted by people in the country in which the baby was born, departmental officials who are very experienced and then there is judicial oversight, before any of the orders that Ms O'Keeffe referred to so well are made.</p><p> Part of me just wants the witnesses to confirm what I have said.  By the time one has that emergency travel certificate in one's hand when coming home, a lot of work has gone into proving the bona fides.  One of the things that has been explained over the past few weeks is that the presence of the surrogate mother with the embassy official is, in itself, ensuring consent.  The point in all of that is that the intended mother is a bystander to all of this.  There is a delicacy and a sadness in that when one is a bystander to something so precious.  I invite the witnesses to comment on or confirm that before I move on.</p></speech>

We have implemented quite a robust process.  It is absolutely the case that embassy officials do attend the DNA test where they get to meet the surrogate mother, which is just another safeguard.  The surrogate mother is met by an embassy official and that helps us in approving the emergency travel certificate application.  I would say, however, that the role of the Department is only to approve the emergency travel certificate at that point.  The intending parents have to go through a very robust judicial process on their return.</p></speech>

My own team in the passport service are very familiar with documentation from certain countries where international surrogacy is very popular with Irish couples.  We have quite a lot of experience in certain jurisdictions and have a very good knowledge of the documents that are presented to us.</p></speech>

We have embryological standards and we touched on that a little at our last meeting.  We know that embryos that were created in Ireland can be sent out to clinics abroad.  Those clinics have been confirmed by the likes of the Rotunda Hospital or other medical organisations in Ireland and then a baby is born.  If a predetermined genetic link could be established it would provide further assurance.  I am not in any way undermining the assurance provided by the documentation but there is a precariousness there in terms of a failed DNA test.  Guarantees cannot be given because nothing is known until the DNA result comes back.  That email is an extraordinary email to get and it gives one a huge sense of relief.  The issue is that a baby is born and if something could happen prior to that which would be of assistance in terms of the integrity and the safeguarding of the baby, that would be good.</p></speech>

The baby has been born by the time we are involved in the process.</p></speech>

My first question is for Ms O'Keeffe.  The orders of reference for this committee say that we should ensure safeguards against the sale, trafficking and exploitation of children.  How does she think this is best achieved?  My second question relates to the authenticity of the DNA and the testing of same in this country.  What happens if the surrogate mother cannot be present?  What happens in that case?</p> <p>  My next question is for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Muiris O'Connor from the Department of Health told this committee on 7 April that the domestic prohibition on commercial surrogacy is predominantly based on ethical considerations relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved, as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.  Does the Department of Foreign Affairs share this concern and if so, why?</p></speech>

Processes that have been put in place by the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to the emergency travel certificate.  Guidance documents were prepared by an interdepartmental group and published in 2012, including guidance on what is required when a declaration of parentage application is made to the courts.  The steps, processes and documentation required have been laid out and the purpose of all of that is to ensure the necessary safeguards for surrogate mothers and for children and to minimise, as far as possible, any risk of child trafficking or undesirable practices.  That is the purpose of all of these procedures and safeguards.  The aim is to ensure as far as possible that the documentation is in order.  My colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs mentioned the stringent DNA testing that is required at the emergency travel certificate stage.  That DNA evidence is also required to be presented to the court when an application for a declaration of parentage is made.  Under the current legal framework, there as many safeguards as we can reasonably put in place.</p></speech>

The process we follow, as has been mentioned, is very robust in order to ensure that all parties are safeguarded in the process.  We would not deal with policy in relation to the process; we are simply facilitators of the issuance of a travel document.  Our primary concern is to make sure that all parties are safeguarded and that is achieved through the robustness of the process that is followed.</p></speech>

There are jurisdictions where the child can get a passport locally in the country in which the child is born, and this may arise in such cases.  In terms of our process, however, the consent of the surrogate mother, and her husband if necessary, is crucial to the process.</p></speech>

We heard from the previous witnesses, particularly Mr. Kenny Moore.  He spoke about passports in America and Canada, coming back here, the difference and how we learn.  That was a major issue for me.  The other issue is the timescale.  This is all technical and we are learning from this.  My biggest fear, and I have learned this through politics and life, as I believe all of us have, is that when one is dealing with three or four different Departments, it is an absolute nightmare.  One is going from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Justice to the Department of Health and to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  While there is no question that everybody is doing their best, it becomes a huge issue.  One Department will take a lead on this and another Department will take a lead on that.  Then one is in a situation where unless it is led by one particular area, it just does not work.  I have found over the years with different issues that it becomes a major barrier.  One Department will blame another Department regarding the timescale while another will say the person filled the form wrongly or that it does not go to that Department or it is all online.  It does not work.</p> <p>  For us and the Government to succeed on this legislation we must have one Department to lead it, be it the Department of Justice, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or whatever.  What do the witnesses see as their biggest hurdles when they are trying to work within the remits of different Departments?  Sometimes when one is dealing with Departments, one probably does not know who one is dealing with because people come and go and switch and swap.  I always find that to be an issue.  I believe we need to have a designated two or three people who can lead this.  There must be a specific area where anybody who wants that information is able to get it quite quickly.  Dealing with passports and other information is very sensitive.  We are dealing with very sensitive information here.  We are dealing with people's lives and how they are affected.  That is my biggest concern with this.</p> <p>  We must make sure we all work together on this.  There has been delay over the years.  One thing I have learned from meeting the witnesses over recent weeks is that their stories are heartbreaking.  They want the system right.  They want to be able to have legislation from which they can work.  They do not want to do anything wrong.  They just want to have a system that fits and is right, and we are not delivering on that.  We are failing badly here.  Those are my concerns from today, and perhaps the witnesses can respond to me.  Again, I know everybody is doing the best they can within their Departments, but when it happens that one is dealing with so many Departments, it just does not work.  There were a few questions there if the representatives of the different Departments wish to take them.</p></speech>

For us, we are dealing with the international element of the surrogacy and that is our primary focus.  While we would welcome legislation that would streamline the process for us, there is always going to be an element for us whereby we have to abide by local law.  That adds a different nuance for us.  While a streamlined process domestically would certainly be of benefit, it would not be possible for the process also to work for every country to which a family may go.  When we get a family going to a country we have not dealt with before, that can take longer because we need to establish what the local law is in that country and tweak the process to fit where necessary.  We would absolutely welcome a streamlined process, but there are always going to be challenges for our Department in that regard.</p></speech>

It is very serious, and this legislation is crucial.  We all have spoken about a three-month time limit here, but it does not seem possible with all the different Departments and how we can perhaps try to get one source that can lead on it.  Then at least we will know and work with that area.  I thank Ms Byrne but I have concerns about that.</p></speech>

There are elements of the law under different Departments, but the machine we have for resolving that is the Government.  It acts collectively under Article 28.  In the decision it took earlier this year when it put forward the proposal to establish the committee, it was very clear that all Departments concerned - the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Justice - would listen to what the committee said and bring forward whatever necessary reforms were required, and that the Department of Health in its assisted human reproduction Bill would take account of the recommendations of the committee.  We have a machine, imperfect and all as it may be, for bringing 18 Departments together to a collective view.  That is the constitutional position and that is where we will go.  The key thing is if the committee can identify the challenges and good solutions there, the Government will reflect on that and seek to implement the solutions that are identified.</p></speech>

In fairness to all the witnesses, in their remits they are experts in their particular fields.  Where would they see for us as legislators, who are trying to get this fairness and legislation through, the biggest challenges within the different Departments or even within their own remit?  Timing is a big issue for us.</p></speech>

I think they are outlined in the paper.  The Deputy has heard from the other witnesses about the challenges they meet and the challenges intending parents come up against.  We are discussing one element of it here, which is the safeguards that must be put in place.  That is identified in the paper.  It is really about the fundamentals of ensuring the rights of the children, the surrogate mother and the intending parents are protected.  Resolving that is looking for risks and asking how to counteract them.  For example, we have DNA tests to ensure the person is the genetic father of the child.  It is those safeguards and what one is trying to guard against.  Senator Keogan spoke about trafficking.  It is the necessary things one needs to guard against there.  Unfortunately, one ends up with regulatory steps.  However, if we can identify if there are ways of improving that, I am certainly open to that.</p></speech>

As one guest said, words matter.  I have learned we have to be mindful as legislators that we have proper wording and communication.  Communication is the key.  How we communicate as legislators, and how the Departments communicate, matters.  In that way, people will believe the system is a good one and will want to ensure it works.</p></speech>

Deputy Murnane O'Connor spoke about challenges, and we have been given a significant challenge of trying to navigate our way through a very complex issue.  We can do that only by means of cross-party support and cross-departmental collaboration.  I thank our guests for all they are doing to achieve that.</p> <p>  The main message I have taken from this meeting is that the Departments will not facilitate the unlawful movement of children across borders and that emergency travel certificates will be issued only where there is reasonable cause to believe a child is or may be an Irish citizen.  That is important from a safeguarding perspective, as well as when it comes to affording rights to both the child and his or her family.  Our guests outlined the robust processes that are in place to prevent, insofar as possible, child trafficking, and referred to the stringent DNA testing at that emergency travel certificate stage.  Have there ever been failures in this regard?  Are there any cases we need to examine?  I hope there are not, but I would certainly love to hear there are not.</p> <p>  What changes to streamlined processes could be introduced to remove as much stress as possible for families?  Are bilateral agreements in place, and if not, could they be, with frequently used countries to minimise that stress for both the surrogate and the expectant parents where possible?  Are there ways to speed it up and streamline it while ensuring that all the safeguards our guests eloquently outlined will remain in place to protect the child and all the parties involved?</p></speech>

To do anything outside of that, I would have to refer to my justice colleagues on the citizenship element.  Our role is to establish that the child is an Irish citizen and our process is very much underpinned by our own legislation.</p></speech>

DNA tests, for example, are very important to ensure there is a link.  To move away from surrogacy for a moment, in the case of any good service a state tries to provide, there will always be people who try to abuse it.  For instance, social welfare is fantastic for supporting people and transferring income, but a small proportion will try to abuse any system.  Unfortunately, we have seen cases where the intended parents were exploited abroad by, as I referred to at the previous meeting, bad actors.</p></speech>

DNA tests were very important in one of the cases.  It is about ensuring that for whatever we want to enshrine in legislation, it will have those safeguards such that the rights of surrogates will be protected, that they are giving their consent and that there is not any sort of undue economic exploitation.  The risks are there to see in regard to the safeguards we have in place.</p></speech>

We can rely on the governance arrangements in the other countries to be robust, but where that cannot be done or where the governance arrangements are not robust, we would have concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-28a.789" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Trevor Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ISS2022042800002#Q01300"><p>To expand on that, there have been one or two cases, as Mr. Munro said, and we will not go into the details of them.  As a general comment, the safeguards build on the legal framework that exists, and I think the committee has heard evidence in that regard.  The guidelines that were developed in 2012 build on the existing legislative framework and there is a limit to what can be done within that, which is what we work within.</p> <p>  As has been said, the requirements of the guidelines are quite stringent, but they reflect what can be done in the context of the existing legislation.  Of course, the guidelines are not based in legislation and are not statutory, so we apply them in that context.  If there were a difficult case whereby someone did not wish to adhere to the guidelines, that would put our Department in particular in a difficult position.  That is why, if this is to be regulated, we would see the benefit in regulation that brought greater clarity to the requirements, whereby people would know that in advance and the safeguards would be clear from the outset.</p> <p>  I am not aware of any bilateral agreement but it would depend on the existing policy.  I could certainly foresee possibilities and I think the committee has heard proposals in this regard.  If front-loaded, pre-surrogacy arrangements were being entered into and if there were a framework, that would assist our Department in the context of working with new countries, for example.  As has been mentioned, that would pose particular difficulties.</p></speech>

Like Senator Seery Kearney, I acknowledge the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in particular, over recent weeks.  It has been very difficult.  I acknowledge also Senator Seery Kearney, given that some of us who were navigating this issue for the first time were on the phone just as often to her.  She was always available.  We are dealing with families in very difficult circumstances and so much care and sensitivity has always been given.</p> <p>  My first question follows on from what Dr. Redmond said regarding there being a set of guidelines, not least in the context of the pre-birth, post-birth or at-birth transfer of parentage.  I am focusing quite a bit on that because I think it will form the crux of the wider issue to a certain extent.  Would a pre-birth parentage model make circumstances easier?  Of course, nobody could have envisaged what was going to happen in Ukraine, but would such a model have made some of those situations easier or more straightforward, or would it not really change anything?  Would the Department of Justice's goal remain the same?</p> <p>  When representatives of the Department of Justice last appeared before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, we asked about potential models people have seen internationally that might be considered good practice.  I do not know whether our guests have looked at any other models since the previous occasion, or perhaps they heard some of what was said about the Canadian model in the earlier session.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs deals with many countries.  Are there other systems or examples that work well?</p></speech>

We have a certain role and outward-facing experience but the policy is not with us, so we do not look at the models in that sense.  We would defer to others on that.</p> <p>  As regards the experiences we have had to date, we can say from the perspective of our Department that a prearrangement process that brings legal certainty would be a benefit to us.  That is just from the perspective of our Department; it is not to say it should be the policy.  It is just one factor the committee may wish to bear in mind.</p></speech>

Are there practical examples of how it would be easier or better for Dr. Redmond's Department?  I understand that he is speaking only on behalf of his Department.</p></speech>

It does put pressure on the Department and seek that.  The law in those countries might be unclear.  If one is dealing with a country where surrogacy is unregulated, one might receive legal advice that has ambiguities.  In that context, the Department is occasionally in a difficult position.  For example, if there was a regulatory agency in Ireland that was responsible for looking at jurisdictions and providing advice, that may take a burden off the Department of Foreign Affairs in the context of those situations where there is potentially short notice.  That may be of benefit to us.</p></speech>

We are not aware of any country that has found a specific model or legislative framework.  To the best of my knowledge, most countries deal with it in their existing family law framework.  Adoption in particular has been used as a route to parentage in international surrogacy cases, particularly in European jurisdictions.</p> <p>  As regards a pre-birth or post-birth model, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill provides for a two-step process in respect of surrogacy taking place in Ireland, consisting of the pre-conception stage and then the post-birth parental order.  A pre-birth approval may not be sufficient, but that is getting into questions of policy.</p></speech>

We had a resident embassy there, so applications were taking approximately three to six weeks to be processed following the birth of the child.  There are several documents that cannot be put together until the child is born.  We are also dependent on the authorities in Ukraine, or any other relevant country, their processes and how long they take.  It was taking approximately three to six weeks after the baby was born in that jurisdiction.  As we mentioned, if it is a new jurisdiction where we have not previously had an ECT application, it can take considerable time to put the process in place and ensure all the documents meet our standards.  It is important that parents engage in the process early.  We often only hear about the birth after the fact.   The parents may be in-country and waiting for the baby but we may not hear about it until after the fact.  I know the parents get legal advice locally and here in Ireland, as they ought and as we advise, but they should do a lot of research into what is involved, speak to others who have been through the process, be aware of what is involved and be prepared for the level of paperwork and the time it might take.  Some parents are not aware of what is involved once the baby is born.  From our point of view, it would help to manage the work on our side if parents were fully aware of the situation.</p></speech>

Some of them kind of tie in with the questions Deputy Higgins asked in respect of citizenship.  I refer to situations where the biological intended father is not an Irish citizen but the other intended parent is.  Obviously, that has to go into a process.  What happens in a situation such as that if the parents plan to come back to Ireland but the biological parent is not a citizen?</p></speech>

As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are aware of those kinds of issues.  They mainly arise in cases where the family is resident outside Ireland, though there have also been cases involving Irish residents.  There is a case ongoing before the courts in respect of the interpretation of the citizenship legislation in the context of those kinds of situations.  I cannot say anything more at present because the case is to be heard before the Supreme Court later this year.</p></speech>

Am I correct that a surrogate mother, as the legally recognised mother of the child, is the guardian under Irish law but if she is married, her husband is joint guardian?  That does not naturally transpose in Irish law, however, in the context of gay dads and the guardianship automatically assigning to the other non-biological intended parent.  A non-biological husband of a surrogate has full guardianship but that does not happen in the other direction.  Can that be fixed?  What am I missing in the logic there?  Why does the husband of the surrogate have more guardianship rights than the intended parents do?</p></speech>

Under the Status of Children Act, there is a presumption that in the case of an opposite-sex married couple whose marriage is subsisting and who have not separated, the husband is the father of a child born to a wife.  That applies to children born or conceived in any manner.  This presumption has been in law for a long time.  As a married father, the husband is automatically a guardian.  In order to displace that presumption, one must have recourse to the application for the declaration of parentage.</p><p>When the genetic father makes the application and is granted that declaration of parentage, the presumption then ceases to apply in relation to the husband of the surrogate mother so he is no longer the guardian.  The genetic father will be.  One of the orders he will get is he will be appointed the guardian of the child.</p></speech>

Since commencement of the Children and Family Relationships Act, where a donor-conceived child is born and all the procedures of the Act have been complied with, the second parent can be registered as parent immediately.  The presumption that has for a long time applied in relation to opposite-sex couples is there for the reasons my colleague has explained.  It may be more difficult in a same-sex couple situation where the question of the biological possibility comes into play.  In the case of a same-sex male couple, a woman who is not a member of the couple had to give birth to the child.  There may be issues in terms of what can logically and legally be presumed.</p></speech>

The discussion we have had has been interesting.  I will touch on the issue Senator Ruane raised.  I practised for a long number of years as a family solicitor and came across the presumption of parentage.  When a woman is married, has formed a new relationship and has a child with a new partner, she needs her husband to rebut the presumption that he is the father.  That often happens but I have come across cases where the husband is no longer contactable or, in abusive situations, refuses to do it.  It has created a lot of problems for women trying to register the birth of their children or get medical cards and PPS numbers.  It is a big issue so we need to deal with it.  It would help with the issue of international surrogacy as well.</p> <p>  On the emergency travel certificate, what happens if the intending parent who is an Irish citizen is not the biological parent?  Do they default to some other country?  If they are living in this country but, let us say, in a gay relationship and the biological father is from outside the EU and has not yet been naturalised as an Irish citizen, does the child automatically get a passport of the country of the biological father?</p></speech>

It would be difficult to answer that question because it depends on the legislation in the country.  If there is no biological link, the child would not be an Irish citizen through the biological link and, therefore, we would not be in a position to issue a travel document to the child.  Whether a document issues from the other country is down to the legislation in that country.</p></speech>

Single intended mothers and same-sex female couples have the same issue.  They cannot avail of surrogacy for these reasons.  It is important to highlight this.</p> <p>  With regard to the presumption of parentage, Ormond Quay Paternity Services issued a report in 2008.  The service does not deal only with surrogacy; it does DNA for all of our court's family law services.  The report found that in 35% of its parentage testing in cases going through the Irish courts the person who thought he was the father was not the father.  This is natural outside of surrogacy and IVF.  Yet people who go through infertility issues in the State, and who have the minefield and journey of infertility issues are robustly tested for good reason and I am not for one minute saying we should undermine this.  They go through all of this hassle and proving themselves and they can come back to Ireland and not have a legal relationship with the child.  We have this double standard.  It is not the fault of anybody here.</p> <p>  I heard what was said about communication.  In defence, I have to say that in recent months the witnesses, the people behind them and the Office of the Attorney General have found themselves with unprecedented situations of surrogacies that should have happened in Ukraine, had the Russians not been so awful, and babies being born outside of this.  They have had to react at very short notice, although we do try to plan or know the dates but sometimes babies come early and catch everybody by surprise.  There has been extraordinary communication and extraordinary work and support.  I hear all that has been said and I know-----</p></speech>

I hope this will be part of the legislation.  Everyone is doing their best and that is not in question.  I stand over that when people are dealing with a lot of Departments, a lead Department is needed.  This is across everything no matter what area it is in.  This is where I was coming from, just to clarify.</p></speech>

In the previous session we spoke about how to ensure there is an ethical process in place.  The models we looked at would not be viable to assess entire jurisdictions.  Perhaps it was to be done more on a case-by-case basis.  There is a middle option whereby there is potential for assessing particular clinics to state they follow certain guidelines and that we as a State are comfortably with the ethical processes they have put in place.  What are the comments of the witnesses on this?  Do they see this as a practical solution?  Is it feasible?  What do they think about how we in this State can somehow accredit a process in another jurisdiction?</p></speech>

We are able to regulate health services here because we have enforcement and inspection.  Without mechanisms of enforcement and inspection I do not know how we would be assured of the standards of services abroad or even who would be in a position to do it.  Would it be the Medical Council or CORU?  It is quite a challenge to regulate standards in other countries.  In the European Union it is normally done through equivalence arrangements with somebody at the top and the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union.  There are also international conventions, such as with adoption.  It is quite difficult to see how the State would regulate private entities in another jurisdiction.  It would be quite challenging.</p></speech>

There is already some level of accreditation of a medical process in a different jurisdiction.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

Maybe there is a way of that knowledge finding itself into the regulatory authority as a pool of knowledge to say that these are clinics.  We could not legally stand over that advice but we could give indications.</p></speech>
