I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Colm Forde, head of the division that looks after policy and the administration of the scheme, and his colleague, Ms Rosanne Greene.  I am also joined by Mr. Eoin Ryan, the equivalent principal officer in charge of veterinary and technical aspects, and his colleague, Mr. Philip Breslin.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for giving the Department the opportunity to provide an update on developments with the bovine TB eradication scheme.  I am sure that everybody who comes in here says thanks to the committee for this opportunity, but in this case we mean it because we have a good story to tell about progress with regard to TB.</p> <p>  I will outline a brief history of where we have come from.  It is important to put everything in context.  As members may be aware, a TB eradication programme has been in operation since the 1950s.  As TB is a zoonosis - a disease of animals that can transmit to humans - the initial focus on dealing with TB in cattle was driven, in large parts, by efforts to reduce TB in the human population.  Many of us will be aware from family members that at that time TB was a scourge in the human population.  It was commonly known as consumption, or galloping consumption.  It was estimated that 12,000 people a year died from TB in Ireland in the 1900s.  It remained a serious and significant disease of people right through the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.</p> <p>  The efforts that started in the 1950s to eradicate TB largely coincided with efforts to deal with TB in the human population.  Not only was TB a major issue in the human population from the 1920s to the 1950s, it was a significant disease in the cattle population.  When we started the scheme in the 1950s, 17% of all cattle were infected with TB.  Many cattle had the clinical signs of TB, and TB mastitis and carcase condemnations were common.  The efforts to eradicate TB coincided with efforts to deal with TB in the human population.  We must remind ourselves that Ireland is in the lucky position that TB in people is not a significant issue with the number of cases every year relatively low.  Globally TB in humans is still a significant disease.  An estimated 9 million people develop TB each year and 1.5 million people die from the disease.</p> <p>  With regard to the reasons for having a TB eradication programme, in addition to the human health benefits to controlling TB in cattle, a TB eradication programme is essential to facilitate trade in cattle and animal products.  Having a programme in place is a requirement of EU trade law.  As a State that exports more than 90% of our agricultural produce, complying with trade law is essential in supporting the incomes of Irish farm families.  Outside of EU law, and increasingly with Brexit, our focus turns to third country markets.  We are finding that in our dealings with third country markets that TB is an issue they focus on.  A recent example is our opening up of the China market to beef.  One of the stipulations in the certification of beef to China relates to the TB status of the herd.  For all of those reasons, it is important to have a good TB eradication programme in place.</p> <p>  Some graphs are included in our submission.  Figure 1 gives an indication of the scale of the progress made in reducing TB levels in cattle since the programme commenced.</p><p>In the early stages of the programme, we were dealing with high levels of TB in the population.  In the early 1960s, 150,000 reactors were being removed on an annual basis.  We made good progress in the early years.  In the 1980s and 1990s, progress stalled to a significant extent and we were bumping along at 30,000 to 40,000 reactors a year.  There was a great deal of debate as to what was causing the lack of further progress.  Over time, it became evident that the significant factor stymying any further progress was the wildlife reservoir.  It became apparent that the reservoir, namely, the badger population, was the significant factor of which we had not been aware previously.  The scientific evidence became stronger that this was the case.  To deal with that, a wildlife programme was put in place in the late 1990s focusing initially on culling badgers.  Since that programme was established, we have begun to make further significant progress on TB eradication.  It has provided a significant boost to our efforts to eradicate TB.  I will return to some figures on that in a while.  It is not a simple process; because badgers are a protected species under the Bern convention, there are strict controls in place to ensure the sustainability of the native badger population.  When we put a culling programme in place in an area, our veterinary inspectorate has to carry out an epidemiological assessment.  A licence is then issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, which limits the culling that can take place nationally to  30% of the agricultural land of Ireland.  There are limits in place to what we can do in respect of culling badgers.  Naturally, we have to comply with those strict conditions.  While these measures are important to protect the badger, it has been argued that they pose challenges in eradicating bovine TB.</p><p> However, there have been some further developments in that regard in recent years.  Following a lot of research, a BCG vaccine - the same TB vaccine as used in people, which we all received as children - has been successfully trialled on badgers in Ireland.  Significant research was done on whether the BCG vaccine could be used on badgers and the research has shown that it can be successfully.  The research concluded that vaccinating badgers in an area is not inferior to culling them.  Vaccination is more or less as good as culling as a means to deal with TB transmission from badgers to cattle.  This is a positive development, which represents a fundamental shift in our ability to move towards eradicating TB.  While we were previously limited to culling badgers on 30% of the land area, there is no such restriction with vaccination.  We will ultimately move to vaccinating the entire country.  It is a significant development and, from a badger point of view, it is a positive one.  We have done modelling work in conjunction with our colleagues in UCD which suggests that the addition of this tool will allow us, over a longer period, to think about total eradication of TB.</p><p> Since we started our badger programme in the late 1990s, the number of reactors has declined from 44,000 a year to our current levels of 16,000 to 18,000 reactors per year.  The proportion of herds affected by TB has effectively halved in that time, which represents significant progress.  However, if we are to make further progress, we must now add in some new measures to get us to the finishing line of eradication.  Our herd incidence levels are considerably lower than levels in Northern Ireland, Wales and England.  While our wildlife programme is important, it remains the case that the primary transmission route for TB is from cattle to cattle.  Our programme has extensive measures in place to address this transmission path.  Members will be familiar with them all.  Every herd in the country is required to have an annual skin test.  This is performed by private veterinary practitioners, PVPs, who have a crucial role to play in helping to achieve eradication.  Thankfully, in excess of 96% of herds in Ireland test clear on this annual test.</p><p>Another diagnostic tool that members will probably have heard of in recent years is a blood test called the gamma interferon test.  It is another useful tool that can help us in herds where infection has been identified.  It enables us to pick up animals that are likely to be harbouring TB at a slightly earlier stage of the development of the disease.  It is a useful additional tool, but it is not a silver bullet.  </p><p> We carry out other risk-based testing under the programme, including, for example, where a herd might have a TB breakdown with a certain number of reactor animals.  A contiguous programme is established in those circumstances, meaning that a programme of testing takes place in neighbouring herds.  That is another important element of the programme.  </p><p> We have spent a lot of energy and money on research in recent years.  It provides key evidence that informs any policy decisions made on the TB programme.  Last Friday, we brought together all of the TB research community in Ireland and the UK.  This work helps enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of TB and provides clues as to how we can most effectively eradicate it.  Some members will be aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has committed to eradicating TB by 2030.  When achieved, this will represent a major success for Irish agriculture, and for farmers in particular.  However, it will only be possible if the current eradication programme is enhanced and if all stakeholders support the programme.  </p><p> International experience from Australia and New Zealand has highlighted the benefits that accrue when the public and private sectors collaborate in efforts to eradicate disease.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine alone will not eradicate TB; it needs the support of all stakeholders to ultimately achieve eradication.  That has been the experience in countries such as Australia and New Zealand which have achieved eradication.  With this in mind, the Minister received Government approval when a memorandum went to Cabinet in May to establish a TB stakeholder forum with an independent chairman.  The mandate of the TB forum is to develop evidence-informed policies that can eradicate TB by 2030 while respecting the principles outlined in the national farmed animals health strategy.  This strategy was launched last year and has four overarching principles, which are working in partnership, acknowledging roles and responsibilities, reflecting costs and benefits and accepting that prevention is better than a cure.  The overarching policy guides everything we do on the animal health front at the moment.  TB falls into that category. </p><p> The Department published three consultation papers, which are available on our website, to focus on the principles relating to governance, policy options and costs and benefits to inform the TB forum's deliberations.  The first meeting of the forum took place in September, and there have been monthly meetings of the main forum since then, as well as side meetings with the various stakeholders in separate sessions.  To date, discussions have focused on governance and policy options.  Costs and benefits are scheduled to be discussed at the next forum meeting in January.  The plan is that the forum will conclude its deliberations in the first half of next year, possibly by March or April.  After that, it will make recommendations to the Minister on various policy options.  </p><p> We in the Department are convinced that eradication by 2030 is achievable, and will continue to engage with all stakeholders to realise this ambition.  Bovine TB levels in the past three years are lower than they have been since the programme started in the 1950s, with fewer farmers affected by the financial burden and the emotional stress of having their herd locked up with disease.  Figure No. 3 in the paper I have provided highlights that in many areas of the country there are very low levels of TB.  It is not a universal picture; TB is not evenly spread around the country.  There are significant parts along the west coast, including parts of Donegal, Mayo and Galway, and significant parts of Counties Waterford and Limerick that have very low levels of TB.  While the current programme has been effective in driving levels down, the science tells us that the current programme will not be enough to eradicate TB in the short or medium term.</p><p>With what we are doing at the moment and with the addition of the vaccination of badgers being spread throughout the country in the coming years the scientific models tell us that over a long period, that will eventually lead to the eradication of TB.  If we keep doing what we are doing at the moment, and perhaps do everything a bit better and a bit quicker, and add in the vaccination of badgers, we will get to the finishing line in 30 to 40 years.  However, we think we could do better than that with additional measures and we are talking to the stakeholders in the forum about what they might be.</p><p> To protect cattle from the disease and to protect farmers and farm families from the burden of a breakdown, we need to continue to do what we are doing but we also need to do more as well.  I will continue to make that point.  The Department has funded substantial research into TB in Ireland since the 1990s and we will continue to do so.  The research provides us with the evidence base that underpins our policies, and enables us to identify areas where our policies do not sufficiently address the disease risks.</p><p> We now have a good idea of what needs to be done in broad terms to lower the levels of bovine TB further and to achieve eradication in the shortest time.  We need to further reduce cattle-to-cattle transmission of the disease.  We also need to maintain effective controls on badger-to-cattle transmission of disease.  We must do more to eliminate infection from chronically affected herds.  We must also do more to protect the almost 97% of herds which do not have TB.</p><p> It is clear that the Department cannot achieve that alone.  International experience has shown that without the support of stakeholders, we will not achieve what we would like to achieve, and certainly not by 2030.  It is not always a simple matter to achieve agreement and buy-in from various stakeholder groups on such matters, as TB eradication will involve difficult choices.  Nevertheless, continuing with our current course, while sufficient to keep TB at current levels, it will not be enough to reduce disease levels further and we will need to do more.</p><p> As part of our efforts to engage with stakeholders, apart from the meetings of the forum, the farm bodies, Meat Industry Ireland, Dairy Industry Ireland, and others, my colleagues and I have spoken at seven public meetings in recent months, attended by approximately 1,000 farmers, most of whom were recently affected by TB in their herds.  We have also spoken to the various farming organisations at national and local level and at knowledge transfer events and we are happy to continue to do so.</p><p> We will shortly launch an improved communications campaign involving leaflets, videos on YouTube, and frequently asked questions, FAQs, on the website, to address some of the common concerns farmers have about the TB eradication scheme, the TB tests, and what farmers can do to reduce the risk of TB to their cattle through their own choices.  Regarding communications, what we found is that we even though we have been involved in TB eradication for a long time, and even though farmers have a test every year, it is surprising how little is known about the details of what is involved in blood testing and what happens when the reactors go to the factory.  Farmers often did not have proper information about what was involved in the tests and why their reactors did not have lesions in the factory and what that meant.  We have put a lot of work into trying to give better information to farmers about what is involved in the programme.  Even when it came to PVPs who were involved in TB testing, in some cases we found they did not have as much information about the nitty-gritty of what the blood tests involved so we put focus on that in recent times as well.</p><p> It is important to communicate to farmers that there are factors which can increase or decrease the risk of TB, and their actions can affect risk.  They are not entirely powerless.  We need to do some work to better educate them to empower them when making decisions on their farm about what they can do to decrease their risk.  For instance, herds that have had a TB breakdown are at increased risk of a further breakdown for up to ten years.  A graph in the presentation I submitted to the committee highlights that.  Once one has had TB in a herd then the risk does not disappear once the herd goes clear.  That is important when it comes to decision-making about buying and selling cattle.  There are actions that farmers in that situation can do to reduce risk and we want to support them by giving them the information and letting them make the choices that protect their cattle and thereby protect themselves and their families from the stress of a TB outbreak.  Working together with stakeholders, we are confident we can eradicate TB by 2030.  To do so will require decisions that may be difficult for some in the short term but they will yield significant long-term benefits for all.</p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  I will be happy to try to answer any questions they may wish to pose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#J00200"><p>I thank Mr. Sheahan for his informed presentation.  Before I invite members to contribute, I have a couple of questions.  I note that Mr. Sheahan never mentioned deer in his presentation.  It is every farmer's worst nightmare to be told he or she has a reactor or reactors on his or her farm, but some people would argue that in certain areas deer are a major contributory factor to TB, although Mr. Sheahan never mentioned them.  What work is being done in that regard?  Have the areas that are highlighted as being prone to TB been the same for a number of years or have the black-spot areas been eradicated to some degree?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#J00300"><p>I thank Mr. Sheahan for his presentation.  Like the Chairman, I am disappointed that there has been a presentation on TB but that there was no mention of deer and the problems they cause.  It seems to be a common theme in the Department that there is no recognition of the fact that deer can be infected with TB.  I was recently told that there where post-mortems are carried out on deer, up to 18% are shown to be infected with TB.  Some farmers in west Wicklow have stopped keeping cattle altogether because they are failing to eradicate TB, the root cause of which is deer.  Experts say the deer are infected by badgers and, therefore, they are not the source of the infection.  Nonetheless, deer often carry TB.  The deer population is increasing dramatically in line with the increase in forestry.  In my county, there have been some serious breakdowns, a significant number of which were at the edge of forests.  Telling farmers that deer do not play an important part in the spread of TB will not wash.  Our reluctance to tackle the deer population or to cull some animals will prevent us getting to grips with the problem of TB.</p> <p>  Mr. Sheahan stated, "Working together with stakeholders, we are confident we can eradicate TB by 2030.  To do so will require decisions that may be difficult for some in the short term".  Farmers are the only people in the country who have paid a significant cost as a result of TB.  Whatever decisions are taken by the Department, such as those relating to the on-farm evaluation system, the loss of animals or the severe hardship incurred at farm level, it is, unfortunately, farmers who will ultimately pay in financial terms.</p> <p>  I have serious concerns about how there seems to be a focus by the Department to say that herds that have had TB are a risk for a number of years afterwards.  That puts a black mark on herds that have been affected by TB, even though they may have had a couple of clear tests.  If I understand matters correctly, the Department is saying that a herd will have a stigma attached to it for up to ten years if it has had TB.  I have heard that farms' TB history will be shown on boards in marts.  That will mean that cattle or weanlings sold from those herds will have a reduced attractiveness for buyers and will command a lower price.  This shows that there is no confidence in the TB test because surely if a herd has passed two tests, it is clear of TB.  The Department is saying, however, that for up to ten years animals from that herd will have a greater risk.  As a farmer, I cannot get my head around or accept that.  It will incur significant costs for and impose a great deal of hardship on farmers.  I cannot see the benefit of that.</p><p> The culling of badgers has worked very well where it has been done.  This has reduced the level of TB.  If there is a successful vaccination for badgers, why do we need a cull?  Could we not get to a point where there would be a blanket vaccination of badgers?  Culling healthy badgers is a hindrance rather than a help.  If we had a vaccination process so that badgers were not transmitting the disease, we would take a large step forward.  Why can a vaccination not be more widely used?</p><p> Where there is a breakdown, the Department comes in and insists on performing the blood tests.  I agree with that principle.  Are there figures available in respect of the number of false positives relating to blood tests as compared with those involving skin tests?  I agree that blood tests will identify reactor animals quicker than skin tests but what are the figures for false positives?  Looking at the map, the Six Counties are blank.  What level of tuberculosis is there in Northern Ireland?  What regulations are there for tuberculosis there?  Are they compatible with ours?  I was president of a farming organisation before I became a Deputy.  Brucellosis had virtually been eradicated but then there was a reinfection involving animals from south Armagh and we were back to square one.  Is there a compatible level of testing in Northern Ireland?  If we do everything to an A1 standard here and there is not the same level in Northern Ireland, there will be reinfections.</p><p> I am disappointed that there is not a focus on deer and their role in transmitting the disease.  I accept that they are not the primary source of infection but, in my view and from my experience, they play a serious role in transmitting disease.  They travel a lot of the countryside and are a serious problem.  A farmer could come outside and see 40 or 50 deer eating silage out of his pit or feeding on his grass.  They drink out of the same water troughs.  We lifted water troughs in the past and it stopped badgers from getting access to water but, unfortunately, that will not help with deer, which will have access to the same water sources as herds of cattle</p><p>.  Those are the questions I would like to be answered.  These decisions will be difficult in the short term if there are financial repercussions for farmers.</p></speech>

It impacts on the entire family and represents a severe blow to the income-generating capacity of the farm and the farmer involved.  The devastation does not end inside the farm gate.  It spreads to neighbouring farmers because they are then caught up in something not of their own making and become subject to tests by virtue of their location rather than disease history.  When it happened near us, it created a sense of fear and trepidation because farmers nearby could be next.  Farmers never received replacement costs for lost animals or herds.  The dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that replacement costs will be significant and are a double-whammy for the farmer involved, who gets less for what was taken away and has bigger costs.</p> <p>  A major policy objective is to eradicate TB by 2030.  Senator Paul Daly and I come from a part of the country where this is a desirable objective for most people.  In our area, every so often we used to hear the mantra to the effect that various Government Ministers were going to drain the Shannon.  We can throw this in with the draining of the Shannon.  We have committed to draining the Shannon every year and many Deputies and Ministers won or lost their seats on that basis.</p><p>I am wondering if this is a bit like that.  When I was a young person back in 1974, with black hair, I recall this being a desirable objective at that time.  That is 44 years ago.  I hope it is achieved for everybody's sake, even from a human health perspective.  I am glad that the great work done by former Minister, Noel Browne, against the odds and against the tide as he said himself has been acknowledged by the Department.  He was one of the greatest politicians who ever stood in this place. </p><p> How much has the State invested to date in the TB eradication scheme?  We are down to 16,000 to 18,000 animals, and less than 3.5% of herds are affected.  That means that almost 97% are clear.  This is important for the export of nine out of every ten animals, which is why all the identification schemes and everything else are in place.  The number of herds has declined rapidly since the mid-1950s.  The number of animals has gone the other way.  We have a smaller number of herds with a larger number of animals.  The impact is in reverse.  </p><p> The Department used a BCG vaccine in badgers in Ireland which were the major source of the disease.  Why is the NPWS imposing a 30% limit on the usage of this?  Is there any scientific or empirical basis for that being imposed or is it just a figure that the service uses?</p><p> We all know about the epidermal or skin test, the annual rounds and the great joy of getting the word that the test is clear once the veterinary practitioner has carried out the review.  How extensively has the interferon gamma blood test been used, if it is the case that it is more succinct and precise and facilitates the earlier detection of TB?</p><p> Like my colleagues, I intended to raise the impact of deer, and whether they facilitate the spread of TB as a potential host or, at minimum, a carrier or transmitter of the disease.  Has the Department carried out any research in that context?</p><p> How sensitive is the intradermal tuberculosis test in identifying affected animals and what percentage of animals could be identified by means of a positive test when they are in uninfected?  Indeed, the reverse might also be the case, where animals may be identified as being negative but are, in fact, infected.</p><p> How many chronically infected herds are there in the country and has there been any impact on these numbers over the past five to ten years?</p><p> I studied zoonotic disease and microbacteria years ago and I have probably forgotten it all by now.  Very often, however, it can be the experience of a farmer who has a herd infected by TB and who has worked with the Department to take significant preventative steps such as a closed herd policy, a detailed disinfectant policy, increased hygiene with all of the steps that one would normally take, and yet, as Mr. Sheahan fairly said, within three, four or five years, they are infected again.  Does this window extend to a decade or more?  One can never drop one's guard, which I appreciate.  That will be part of the Department's lectures, videos, etc.  Is a peak likely again?</p><p>This is where it starts on the logarithmic table.  It is back to the usual bacterial growth or culture and then it drops off.  Is the sensitive period three years, four years or five years where one has to be so careful that one can let hardly anybody in?</p></speech>

If I forget any, I ask to be reminded of them.  I will leave the question about deer until last and ask my colleague, Mr. Eoin Ryan, to answer it.  The Chairman asked about whether black spot areas remained the same.  They change from time to time.  To provide a recent example, we had a sudden large outbreak in part of south Kerry, which had not experienced particular problems for many years.  That became a black spot area and we put a particular programme in place to deal with it.  That was a new area that had not been a problem previously.  Currently, Monaghan is the most significant large-scale problem area.  That developed relatively quickly after a four or five-year period in which it was not particularly above the national average.  Sometimes, disease flares up in an area and we put a programme in place to quash it.  Over time, the number of black spot areas has reduced as we get the overall disease levels down.</p></speech>

We have a comprehensive programme in place to deal with it and are confident the graph will go down again next year.  Deputy Cahill asked why we do not move to the blanket vaccination of badgers.  That is our plan.  In recent years, we have been culling approximately 6,000 badgers and vaccinating approximately 1,000 every year.  We will roll out vaccination gradually over the next three or four years so that at the end of that period, we will vaccinate 6,000 badgers and cull 1,000.  Over time, we plan to move away from culling, by and large, and our plan ultimately is to vaccinate every badger in the country.  However, we will still need to carry out culling in some areas in which there are particularly bad outbreaks of disease.  In general, our plan is to move to blanket vaccination of badgers.  Deputy Penrose asked why there was a 30% limit.  To clarify, there is no limit on vaccination.  We can vaccinate every badger in the country and the NPWS has no difficulty in that regard.  However, the badger is a protected species under the Bern convention, which means there is a 30% limit regarding the land area in which we can cull badgers.  We cannot exterminate the badger population.  It is as simple as that.  That is why there is a 30% limit.  The Deputy compared this to draining the River Shannon and I am sure he was not being entirely serious.</p></speech>

At that stage, brucellosis was at an all-time high and we got the same thing about people having heard it all before.  We launched a programme that year to eradicate brucellosis and there was a lot of scepticism at the time that it could not or would not be done.  We heard it was all a racket, a vets' gravy train and all that sort of nonsense.  However, a key point was, to be fair, that it was a concerted effort and it had the support of stakeholders.  All the farm bodies were fully on board, as were ICOS and the meat industry.  Everyone accepted it was the right thing to do and everyone worked together.  To everyone's surprise, we eradicated brucellosis within seven years.  Our last case of brucellosis was in 2006.  It is a prime example of what can be done when everyone pulls together.  While I am sure people have said previously that it would be great to eradicate TB, this is the first time we are making an attempt to do that.</p><p>This is the first occasion on which we have a plan and Cabinet backing.  The Department accepts that it will not eradicate TB on its own.  We simply cannot do so.  We need the support of stakeholders.  A number of difficult decisions will have to be made if we are to achieve eradication by 2030.  Everyone here is confident it can be done with the support of stakeholders.</p><p> A number of people asked how widely the gamma interferon blood test is being used.  We are now using the gamma interferon blood test in all bad breakdowns, that is, all breakdowns involving five or more reactors.  It is standard practice.  We have learned much over the years about how best to use the gamma interferon test.  We are now using it in respect of all breakdowns.  Deputy Penrose also inquired as to how many false positives there are with the blood test.  Approximately 3% give rise to false positives.  The test's level of sensitivity is 97% so there will be three false positives for every 100 animals tested.  That is why-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Sheahan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#N00500"><p>I will come to that in a moment.  I will just finish my point on the blood test.  The reason we do not use the blood test widely on the 6 million cattle in the national herd is because the false positive rate is too high to use it as a screening test.  We are now using it in all significant breakdowns.  The sensitivity is 97%.  The false positive rate is 3%.  With the skin test the false positive rate is tiny.  About one in 5,000 reactors is a false positive with the skin test.  It is very specific.  There are very few false positives.  If 5,000 are tested and there are 5,000 reactors, only one will be a false positive.  This is an important point.  The ability of the skin test to pick out infected animals is only 80%.  If there are 100 animals with TB in a pen, the skin test will pick up 80.  That is pretty good as tests go.  There is no test for any disease that will pick out 100% in humans or animals so 80% is relatively good.</p></speech>

The blood test will identify a positive before the skin test.  It allows us to get in earlier and clear out herds more quickly.</p></speech>

Neither test is perfect.  That is why if a herd has had two clear tests it does not mean the problem is solved.  The tests are not good enough.  There is nobody out there developing a test in the short term.  In the next five or ten years it is not likely that a better test will come along.  One reads about breakthroughs from time to time and new tests under development.  We would love if there was but the reality is the tests we have are pretty good as disease tests go but if there are two clear tests in a herd with a problem, unfortunately, a certain percentage of infected animals will be left behind.  We are finding that approximately 30% of herds that have had a breakdown will go down again at some stage in the future.  It is better than before.  The blood test is helping.  It is getting out more animals but a percentage of infected animals is being left behind and not being picked up.  That is why there is a risk for up to ten years associated with herds that have had a significant TB breakdown.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose asked about chronic herds.  It depends on one's definition in that regard.  We have the numbers of herds that have had six or more breakdowns.  Some herds have one breakdown and that is it, they are cleared and it does not happen again but there are some chronic herds.  Between 500 and 1,000 herds have a significant number of repeat breakdowns.  That is an area on which we will continue to focus.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the level of TB in Northern Ireland.  I do not know if we have an exact figure.  Our herd incidence rate is approximately 3.5%.  In the North it is approximately 9%.  It has a much more serious problem than we have.  The North does not have a badger culling programme.</p></speech>

Yesterday, my colleagues met officials from the North to discuss TB.  To some extent, they are currently a bit hamstrung because the assembly is not in place.  They got an independent body to produce a report on what they should be doing, but they have been a bit hamstrung in getting on and doing it because of the situation up there.  However, they are clearly very concerned.</p></speech>

Earlier, we spoke about risk.  I will provide an example.  A dairy farmer with 200 animals will have invested a considerable amount in his herd and facilities.  If he needs to buy 20 cattle, the last thing he wants to do is to buy a TB problem.  However, he is buying a pig in a poke at the moment.  He has no way of knowing if he should buy 20 cattle from Joe Blogs, Paddy Smith or whoever.  However, we have the information and know with a good degree of accuracy what his risk would be by buying from one herd as distinct from another.  The question is as follows.  Should we make that information available to a person with a dairy herd of 200 or even a herd of 50 suckler cows?  Do they have a right to know which herd represents the lowest risk?  Should we warn them that if they buy from herd A the risk of buying in a problem is X and if they buy from herd B the risk is Y.  These are some of the difficult decisions.  Obviously, if-----</p></speech>

There are two sides to the coin.  Someone who has one of the 97% of herds that are clear of TB and who has made a significant investment in that herd obviously has a vested interest in knowing the differing risks of buying animals from one herd as distinct from another.  On the other hand, a person who is selling and has had no TB in the herd for ten years would obviously not have a problem with making that fact known on a mart board or elsewhere.  However, someone who has had 16 breakdowns in the past seven years will not want that information to be made available to somebody looking to buy cattle because nobody in their right mind would want to buy animals from that person.</p></speech>

I breed suckler cows but I supply purebred bulls.  I have not had TB in my herd in the past ten years.  I farm very close to an esker, a big wildlife habitat with many badgers around so the risk is always there.  By publishing that information, if I had a reactor next year which would be the first in ten years, I might as well fold up the tent for the next ten years.  That is the reality and I am only one of many examples.  I could close the gate for the next ten years if the fact that I had a reactor is published while at the same time stating that there can be a ten-year dormant history in a herd.  It would be ten years before I would be fully clear again in the eyes of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I would be out of business.</p><p>I am one of many.

This is one of many issues we are discussing at the forum.  We are giving people the science.  The science from UCD states that if we wanted to eradicate TB in the quickest time possible, we would bring in a thing called risk-based trading, which is essentially what is done in New Zealand and what is beginning to be done in the UK, whereby one gives people the information in regard to the risk of the animals they are buying.  I accept it is very tricky.  There are two sides to the coin.  Somebody with a dairy herd that is clear will want that information but somebody who is selling cattle that have had an issue-----</p></speech>

Obviously, the suckler herd has a tighter margin.</p></speech>

As already stated, this is not a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine proposal but something that has been discussed at the TB forum.  It is one of many tricky decisions the stakeholders will have to agree on.  It is a difficult one and it is for the forum to reach consensus on it, if it can.  There may be some halfway house on the issues but it is a tricky one, with two sides to the story.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Ryan to comment on the issue relating to deer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Ryan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#P00700"><p>As Mr. Sheahan stated, there is a lot of stakeholder engagement taking place.  We have been involved in many public meetings recently and I have gone around the country with my colleagues.  There have been many public meetings and meetings with farm organisations.  The deer issue comes up repeatedly and I know the strength of feeling on it.  I will say now what I say repeatedly at these public meetings, at the bilaterals with the farm organisations and when I been interviewed by farm media on these issues, namely, there is no evidence deer play a significant role in transmitting TB to cattle in most of the country outside Wicklow.</p> <p>  I will deal with Wicklow first.  Most land in Wicklow is not farmed, farmers are not the majority landowners and there is a huge deer population.  Deputy Cahill is right that a Department-funded research project was done a few years ago and found that 16% of deer shot as part of the pilot project in Wicklow had TB and that the same strains of TB were circulating in cattle, badgers and deer in this part of Wicklow.  The Department is facilitating farmers to take action in Wicklow in this regard.  In fact, I am attending a meeting tomorrow of the Wicklow deer management committee which will be attended by farm organisations, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Coillte, the Department and local hunters.  This is facilitating farmers and hunters who want to shoot deer and reduce deer numbers.  This has been working quite well and a tender was signed off some months ago to renew it and extend it across Wicklow.</p> <p>  Outside Wicklow, there just is not the evidence that deer are playing a role in transmitting to cattle at significant levels.  I am not saying it does not happen at all but we have to try to base our policies on the evidence and the risks.  For example, in the past 18 months we have tested in our regional veterinary laboratories 74 wild deer from across the country but, outside Wicklow.  Only three of those 74 animals had TB.  When we were at the public meeting in Killarney, I was asked about this and was told there was concern that deer in Kerry were driving TB levels.  It was reassuring to be able to provide the information to farmers that of 39 wild deer tested in Kerry in the past year and a half, only one had TB.  In the meeting in Nenagh some weeks ago, people from Clare were quite concerned but we tested 16 deer from Clare recently and none had TB.  It is certainly the case that deer can get infected with TB and it is conceivable that deer can pass it to cattle.  The question is not whether it ever happens; it is whether this is a significant route of infection.</p><p>Having said that, we are happy to look at this.  Our policy is the same as it always has been but we are trying to do better at communicating it.  Where there are local concerns among farmers that deer may be a factor, as in the scenario the Deputy outlined, we are happy to test deer if farmers want to co-ordinate locally, get the deer shot and submit them to a regional veterinary laboratory.  We will test them for free and pass that information on.  We are also happy to facilitate local meetings between farmers, landowners and hunters to try to address this.  That is what we do, and that is how many of the deer that are shot come in.  This policy is on our website.  I have spoken about it several times, and the farm organisations are aware of it, but perhaps we need to do better at getting that out there.  I completely agree with the point Deputy Cahill made: there is a perception that the Department is saying it does not want to talk about deer.  We are actually happy to talk about deer but we are even happier to talk about things for which there is evidence and into which we should put our efforts.  Therefore, if evidence comes to light that there is some part of the country where deer are playing a significant role in spreading TB to cattle, we will be happy to support measures to address that.  Farmers can take steps to reduce the numbers of deer.  It is difficult for a single farmer to do so, of course.  They can shoot them and, if it is out of season, they can apply to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for a section 42 licence, but it is more effective if they co-ordinate locally across an area.  This is the approach that has been taken in Wicklow involving the farm organisations and we are happy for that approach to be taken elsewhere.  The issue just has not arisen, so again, it is not that we are saying deer never, ever pass TB to cattle, but it is the case that outside Wicklow there is no evidence deer play a significant role.  Even within Wicklow, it is not clear which species is transmitting to which.  As I said, though, I will attend a meeting tomorrow in Wicklow with the local management partnership there.  I hope that provides some information on deer.</p></speech>

I can list seven or eight instances in my county where there have been outbreaks of TB in the past year and a half to two years.  The vast majority of them are bound in forestry, and the deer are grazing the same land and drinking the same water as the cattle.  I just cannot understand the Department's contention that deer are not playing a part in transmitting the infection.  Mr. Ryan said that in Wicklow 16% of the deer were found to have TB and he quoted figures from other places.  To expect the farmers to be able to get a significant cull of deer is expecting too much.  The deer population is expanding rapidly.  There is no doubt in my mind that the deer have TB.  I think the percentage is the only thing in question.  We are talking about putting serious restrictions on farmers.  Mr. Ryan spoke about brucellosis.  Farmers went through great expense to eradicate brucellosis, between post-movement tests and pre-movement tests and all the rest.  I know wildlife can spread brucellosis, but if one contains the infection in the dairy herd or the suckler herd, in the female population, brucellosis can be controlled.  The same does not hold for TB at all.  If the deer stayed in their own habitats, it would be fine, but the deer population is expanding so rapidly that they are not staying in their own habitats and are now using the same habitats as the farm animals.  In Rossmore, County Tipperary, there were two bad outbreaks in which two herds were completely wiped out.  In Killoscully ten or 12 herds are locked up.  The farmers and I are convinced that deer are at the root of their problems.  A lot more research into the deer question will have to be carried out and there will have to be a lot more control of the population to make farmers confident in their attempts to reduce further the number of reactors.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the outbreak in Killoscully.  If people there want to shoot some deer and get them submitted to us, we will test them for free and then we can actually have some data.  I said this the other night in Nenagh.  We have said this at multiple public meetings.  If farmers are concerned, we are happy to test those deer.  That can be arranged, and there is no problem with that.</p><p>However, we cannot operate without the basis of evidence.  It is just the case that, when we tested deer outside Wicklow, we found that three out of 74 had TB.  That deer may share the same habitat as cattle does not mean they are driving infection into them.  Any mammal in the countryside can get TB.  It is entirely possible that deer may be a spillover host, in that they picked up infection from cattle, badgers or whatever.  That does not necessarily mean that they will pass it back on.</p><p> Regarding forestry, this matter was raised at our TB forum.  It was suggested by the farming organisations that Coillte should be invited as the largest landowner in the country.  It was invited and has made a positive contribution.</p><p> The Deputy's point about the perceived association between forestry clearfelling and TB outbreaks was also put to us.  We are going to do as the Deputy says and carry out some research on the matter.  Instead of saying it could be this or that, we will look to see whether there is a correlation between proximity to forestry and risk of TB.  Our feeling with much of this is that the answer will be found by examining the evidence and data and basing policy on same.  It is another example of how our increased engagement and discussion with stakeholders has borne fruit - there was a concern and we are now moving to address it.</p></speech>

From knowing those involved or living in the area, people might be familiar with specific incidents of breakdown close to forestry, but there are many farms close to forestry and perhaps the ones that are not affected by TB do not spring to mind.  The answer is to examine the issue, which is what we are doing.  We want to base what we are doing on the results of the analysis.  That is the direction we are going.</p></speech>

The question is not whether any deer in the country ever got TB and passed it to a bovine.  It is whether it happens in such a significant way that it is a factor for people to be concerned about.  It is impossible to say that it has never happened that a deer has not infected a bovine.  There is certainly evidence in Wicklow that the same strains are affecting cattle, badgers and deer.  A question arises as to whether all three are infecting one another.  Outside Wicklow, we have the data that I have explained.  We have only found three positives out of the 74 wild deer that were shot and submitted to us.  If farmers in a local area like Killoscully or so on are concerned, we are happy to test the deer in question.</p> <p>  It is entirely possible that there may be a role being played.  I am certainly not disputing that, but we want to base our control policies on the risks.  Mr. Sheahan mentioned the various risks and Deputy Cahill has himself addressed the point that it is a difficult message to hear that a herd that has had a TB breakdown is at higher risk for several years afterwards.  Just because that message is difficult, though, does not mean it is wrong to address it and say what the research bears out.  It is awkward and difficult, but it is still the case.</p> <p>  It is not all bad news.  The risk of herds breaking down has reduced from previous years.  In 1998, a herd had a 46% chance of going down within three years.  From 2012, it only had a 30% chance of going down in the next three years.  According to our preliminary data from 2015, that has slightly decreased again, although our analysis has not finished.  The risk can decrease, but we have to be driven by the findings.  I do not dispute at all that deer can infect cattle, but I do dispute that there is evidence that it plays a significant role outside Wicklow.  I am happy to look at the evidence.  As we say repeatedly, if farmers have concerns, we are happy to test those deer for free and will support local meetings on the subject.  That would not be a problem.</p></speech>

First, I have a couple of questions on the biological make-up of the animal and why, when there is TB in a herd, it is only one or two animals that are affected, following which a herd could be clear for five or six years only to be affected again.  What is the biological make-up of the animal such that if one animal is infected the entire herd does not become infected?  If a badger or deer infects an animal and it does not cross-infect the herd, the farmer can have two or three clear test results once that animal has been removed but as the badger or deer would still be around, that farmer or a neighbouring farmer could have another reactor four or five years later.  Why, when one animal is infected, does the rest of the herd not become infected?  Can the witnesses explain the reason for the sporadic infection and has the Department undertaken an analysis of the prevalence of infection in indigenous herds versus imported herds?  In other words, cattle imports that have been fattened and cattle bred here, perhaps by a dairy farmer breeding replacement heifers?  Do the witnesses have data on the countries in which TB remains an issue and to which we live export?  Have there ever been red flags raised regarding the identification of TB in a country where it was not an issue prior to it receiving exports from Ireland?  Are there countries to which we export where TB has never been an issue?  If there is, it would eliminate the badger and the deer.  If there is not, it might eliminate a lot of what has been said about the herd and the ten-year possibility of an outbreak in Irish animals, from animal to animal.</p></speech>

I welcome the departmental veterinary officials.  I could declare a vested interest, but I will not.  One of the key issues for the farming community, which I discussed approximately 12 months ago with Mr. Sheahan, is that the forum will use the ten-year history as a tool to get information out.  The general farming community is concerned about how this would impact them financially.  Will there be a financial package in place if a farmer was to have his or her herd devalued for a ten-year period?  Whether a farmer is selling weanlings or calf heifers, if that information is out there he or she would be slow to engage.  This needs to be teased out.  Has the forum identified the budget required to financially support those in the agricultural community whose herds are as good as devalued for ten years because their information is out there?  This is one of the key issues for the community.</p> <p>  A previous colleague spoke about exports.  There was an issue last year with regard to the licensing and export of calves that came from herds that were restricted for a set timeframe.  Have all those issues been cleared up and, if not, what is the situation in respect of exports as we approach the February to May export period, particularly with regard to dairy bull calves?  In my part of the world, which exports an awful lot of calves, this is a big issue.  There were issues last year in the marts in respect of those calves, and I have spoken to Mr. Sheahan about it previously.  Where are we at in regard to that issue?</p> <p>  On the two blood tests, much as this has been welcomed, there is confusion regarding the sensitivity and taking of the results.</p><p>Is there a protocol set across the entire Department?  Is it up to every individual veterinary inspector in Clonakilty or wherever to make up his or her mind when that goes into the process?  What is the protocol, if one exists?  </p><p> As for the time allocated to move reactor animals from farms, is there a strict protocol in place for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to have an animal moved within so many days?  In some situations a month has elapsed before the retesting process was restarted.  If one has spring calves then one must get bull calves moved and being obliged to wait a month before animals can be moved is not good.  The lack of capacity in factories also is a huge issue.  Will a protocol be put in place that will put pressure on the Department to move the animal within a certain number of days?  Realistically, keeping a reactor animal on a farm for 30 days is against all of the protocols but that has happened before.  I seek the views of the witnesses on the matter.</p><p> Mr. Eoin Ryan mentioned the felling of forestry.  The information I always have been given by veterinary practitioners regarding my part of the world is that when a forest is felled, the level of TB in the area will dramatically increase.  Does that information differ from the research carried out by the Department?  Has genuine research been conducted?</p><p> I want to discuss information meetings.  When a reactor is identified, the Department will call the owner of the animal to discuss issues.  How many times does the Department call outside of that circle?  Must the Department have a TB breakdown before one gets information?  What information circle has the Department put in place?  Will the Department put in place an information circle to inform farmers about what they need to do to limit these issues?  </p><p> I have farmed for 22 years.  I have only ever seen a Department official when I have had a TB breakdown, and I have broken down several times.  What is the Department's long-term focus?  Will it be part of the discussion groups?  Will it be part of the single farm payments?  Are staff members available?  Is the Department able to put the information in the public domain?  How can we convey the information?</p></speech>

I hope I do not repeat questions that have already been asked.</p> <p>  On a lighter note, Mr. Sheahan said he hoped that TB would be eradicated by 2030.  That comments strikes me as a positive one.  I am a member of the climate action committee, as are a number of my colleagues, and we would love to be able to say the same thing about the climate change targets.</p> <p>  There is a map of Ireland on the last page of the statement, called figure 3, which shows that County Monaghan and the surrounding areas are a hotspot or red spot for the incidence of TB.  It was stated that the issue had worsened in the past few years, thus causing the area to be coloured red on the map.  Has the cause been identified?  How is the infection being spread?  Is the infection passed on by badgers, cattle or whatever?</p> <p>  Cattle rustling is an issue that receives media attention from time to time.  Has the Department ever quantified what impact cattle rustling has had on the spread of disease in cattle?  Have cases been discovered whereby cattle rustling has resulted in the spread of disease? </p> <p>  On the issue of regimes in other countries, we receive beef from Argentina under a trade agreement and there is a push for more such trade.  What are the regimes like in these countries?  Let us bear in mind how much we have invested in the eradication of TB and the Department's ambition to completely eradicate it.  Has the additional cost of disease control, particularly for TB, been quantified when it comes to beef production?  </p> <p>  Aside from comparing jurisdictions, I understand TB is transmitted by airborne particles, animal to animal or human to human.</p><p>For how long after a human being has been in contact with an infected herd or animal can the infection survive?  I ask in the context of people travelling to farms outside this jurisdiction.</p><p> Deputy Penrose made reference to the statement at the end of the presentation that we can eradicate TB by 2030 but to do so will require some decisions that may be difficult for some in the short term.  What are those difficult decisions, for whom will they be difficult and at what cost?  The vaccination of so many badgers sounds like a very big undertaking.  What is the badger population in the country and how much will the vaccination programme cost?  What is involved?  Is it a question of physically catching all of the badgers?  If that is the case, it sounds like an absolutely massive undertaking.  </p></speech>

Members will be aware that we export approximately 200,000 live cattle every year, of which approximately 100,000 are calves, most of which go to Spain and the Netherlands.  Not too long ago the Netherlands had a significant outbreak of TB in calves they had imported from the UK.  As a result, they imposed an effective ban on the importation of calves from the UK.  While we always are fearful that TB would be discovered in calves we have exported to Holland, thankfully that has not happened in recent years and there are several reasons for that.  Obviously, TB in calves is a rare occurrence.  The calves that we export to the Netherlands, and to Spain to a lesser extent, are for the veal trade so the animals are slaughtered at a very young age.  Typically, we have not had issues with TB in any of our calf exports in recent years.  Similarly, the bulk of the rest of our live exports to Turkey, our weanling exports to Italy and Spain and so on, are animals for immediate slaughter or for going into feedlots and for slaughter within a couple months.  Simply from an age point of view, they are not the type of animals that develop TB.  They are slaughtered within a few months of arriving in Italy and while I am not criticising the Italian system, they do not have the same post mortem regime in place as we do.  Effectively, because they do not really have a significant TB problem, they do not have vets on the line slicing glands to look for TB like we do.  For better or for worse, we do not tend to get TB-related issues being notified to us from other countries, partly because they are not looking and partly because the animals are being slaughtered at a very young age, before they have had a chance to develop TB anyway.</p><p>Again, in the case of weanlings, they are being slaughtered at a relatively young age.  The country to which we export older cattle, including breeding heifers and dairy stock, is the UK.  As the Senator knows, if we export to somewhere like Scotland, which is free of TB, post-import testing will be carried out on Irish cattle.  Over the years we have had a number of notifications from the UK regarding animals exported from Ireland, which subsequently developed TB.  We follow up on all of those.  With regard to the UK, TB in live exports is a bit of an issue.  By and large, it has not been an issue in the other countries that make up the larger markets to which we send cattle for slaughter or for the veal trade.  That covers live exports.</p><p> The Senator made the point, which I agree with, that there is still confusion out there.  From our communications with both farmers and vets there is certainly still confusion about the precise value of the blood test, what it is about, when it should be done, and so on.  That is something on which we are working.  We have a communications strategy lined up.  For example, we will produce short YouTube videos that we can send to farmers on their phones to explain these issues.  An example might be a simple two-minute video about a farmer who had three reactors among his animals, none of whom had lesions when they went to the factory, wondering whether that means they do not have TB.  Of course it does not mean that, but we want to explain what the blood test is about.  We have plans for a series of short, two-minute videos to explain ten common issues that cause confusion among farmers and vets in respect of TB.  I agree that we have a job of work to do.  We are working on that and on improving our communications in respect of all aspects of the TB programme, because there is a bit of confusion out there about certain aspects of it.  </p><p> Going back to the point about putting notices on the boards in marts, we have probably dealt with that issue.  That is one of the issues being discussed at the TB forum.  There are two sides to the coin.  There are pros and cons.  Making the information available is good for somebody who wants to buy and keep his or her risk low, but it is not good from the point of view of somebody who has had a problem in his or her herd.  Senator Mulherin asked what the hard decisions were.  That is one of the key difficult decisions the forum is grappling with.  </p><p> From a science point of view, if we had risk-based trading, meaning that information on the risk status of the herd from which they were buying was available to a person buying cattle, it would lead us to eradication quickly.  That is the policy which is now being pursued in many other countries that still have TB problems.  In New Zealand, for example, risk-based trading is now the norm.  Every herd is categorised.  There is a simple categorisation system.  Everybody knows his or her category and nobody buys cattle without knowing the risk category of the herd from which they are buying.  If one is in the highest risk category, one is only allowed to sell animals to others in that category.  One is not allowed to sell animals to somebody who is in a low-risk category.</p></speech>

New Zealand has similar issues to ours.  Senator Mulherin asked whether vaccinating badgers is physically a big job.  Yes, we have to physically catch them and inject them.  It is a big job but we have a lot of information in respect of badgers.  At this stage we know where every single sett is in the country.  We have a map and the X and Y co-ordinates of every sett.  When it comes to culling, we have teams of departmental staff and farm relief staff in place around the country.  We have a well-oiled machine in place in respect of culling badgers.</p><p>The process of vaccinating badgers is similar.  They are captured, but they are vaccinated, microchipped and released rather than shot.  When they have been vaccinated, the vaccine works well.  Essentially, they are protected for life.  It does not have to be repeated.</p><p> Senator Daly asked a good question.  He asked why, when one animal in a herd gets TB, they do not all get it.  I might ask my colleague, Mr. Breslin, to explain the concept of genetic resistance.  In certain animals, the infection gets walled off within a certain part of the body and does not spread.  It may stay latent for some years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Breslin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#W00200"><p>The bug that causes TB - mycobacterium bovis - and all the microbacteria is that they are quite unusual as bacteria.  They grow slowly.  It can take up to 20 days for them to replicate, whereas a bug like E. coli, with which we are familiar because of the difficulties it can cause in water, can replicate in 20 minutes.  There is a certain resistance in some animals.  Through the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, sires have been identified in Ireland that confer more resistance to TB on their progeny than other sires.  That information will go into the estimated breeding values, EBVs, in the new year.  There is a resistance issue.  The immune system is constantly in a battle with TB.  Approximately half of all TB infections are conquered by the immune system for a period.  They become latent.  This phenomenon was especially recognised when TB was prevalent among people.  In the 1950s and 1960s, 50% of people in Ireland had some evidence of TB in their lungs.  In many of those cases, it was walled off and was no longer progressing.  This question of latency, whereby the immune system stops TB in its tracks for a period of time, reduces the animal's chances of being infective to other animals.</p> <p>  The first point I would make in response to the question about the sporadic nature of some TB breakdowns is that there must be a transmission point - the animal must pick up the TB from somewhere.  If many cattle are exposed to the same wildlife source - for example, if a badger contaminates some feed - the number of cattle infected could be large.  By contrast, just one or two animals grazing in a field might be contaminated.  The cattle in question will have various levels of infectiousness, which will affect their ability to infect other cattle.  There can be significant variations in animal numbers.  We get some explosive breakdowns.  Thankfully, most of our breakdowns involve just one or two animals.  That has increasingly been the case as our TB situation has improved over the years.  Just one third of our breakdowns involve three or more animals.  In such cases, there is a higher risk that TB will be spread onwards - back into badgers or back to other cattle.  Transmission is the first issue when explaining why there is such variation.  The behaviour of the bug in respect of the animal's immune system is the second issue.  In human medicine, it is recognised that certain people are super-shedders, which means they have managed to infect way more people with TB than most people who get infected.  It is thought that the same super-shedder phenomenon exists in the badger and bovine populations.</p></speech>

Senator Lombard asked about coastal areas.  We do not have any evidence to support the theory that there is a bigger problem in coastal areas.  The map we supplied shows where there are problems and it can be seen that, in general, our coastal areas are the greenest.  That is not to say that there could not be a specific issue in Courtmacsherry, County Cork.  We have not found an association with coastal areas and I would say that such areas have fewer problems.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard also asked about whether a standardised protocol applies in the use of gamma interferon.  The answer is "Yes".  It would be fair to say that if one went back a couple of years, one would find that our approach was not standardised.  We have 16 offices throughout the country and our approach previously was probably not as standardised as we might have liked.  We addressed the matter in recent years so that now, whether one is in Donegal, Courtmacsherry or wherever, and one's herd is unfortunate enough to have a TB problem, then the approach should be identical - or as to that as is humanly possible - everywhere.  There is a standardised approach in the context of when gamma interferon is used, when a contiguous programme is initiated, etc.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Green to respond to the question on communications.  She is spearheading our efforts to improve the Department's communications.  Senator Lombard asked about the removal time for animals identified as reactors.  Mr. Forde will give the facts and figures on removal times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosanne Greene" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#X00300"><p>As has been stated, much of our communication is focused on the people who have animals that have been identified as having TB.  Increasingly, we are recognising that we need to look to the 97% of people who do not have animals with TB and advise them as to how they can reduce the risk of their herds contracting the disease.</p> <p>  I will outline a number of things that we have committed to doing over the next couple of years.  First, as Mr. Sheahan mentioned, we will produce a number of short videos on how to make farms more biosecure in order to avoid the spread of TB in herds, issues relating to wildlife, badgers or whatever, issues regarding the purchase of animals and, perhaps, animals in people's herds, and whether farmers needs to look at the older animals in their herds.  In addition, increasing focus is being placed on the herds that do not have TB as well as those that do.  We will also produce a number of leaflets that will complement the videos.  There is very little information publicly available unless people consult our website.  We hope to produce some small colourful leaflets that will explain the different types of TB tests, what they mean and what the results mean.  Many of the leaflets will focus on the herds that have TB reactors and will answer questions as to why animals with outward lesions are not killed, etc.  We will highlight the biosecurity issues and what people can do to protect their herds is they do not currently have animals infected with TB.</p> <p>  We are reviewing all of the letters that we issue to farmers.  Annual letters relating to the round test issued to all farmers, not just to those who own herds that are infected with TB.  Last year, we revamped the letter into a very simple "dos and don'ts" information leaflet, which we hope is a vast improvement on what went before.  We are reviewing all of the letters in order to make them more farmer-friendly, convey clearer messages and, hopefully, give more advice to people on what they can do to protect their herds.  I have outlined some of the things that we will do in the next couple of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.96" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Forde" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#X00400"><p>Up to last year, if one wanted to find out about the TB eradication programme, the only available information on our website was our submission to the EU for co-funding.  The submission was almost 100 pages in length; it was a very dense document.  The submission used technical language that would not be understood by the average person.  Ms Greene's team developed a 20-page document, copies of which we can supply to the committee.  The document uses very friendly, common language and provides a high-level explanation of how the programme works and what we try to do.</p> <p>  The issue of reactor removal times has been raised constantly by our stakeholders.  Ideally, we would remove reactors from farms as soon as they are identified.  The major issue as to why it takes a protracted period to remove them is to allow for independent evaluation.  The latter is relatively unique to Ireland.  In the UK, there is a book evaluation.</p><p>If a farmer is unfortunate enough to suffer a breakdown, he will be told over the phone the type of animal he has and its value.  The reactor can then be removed.  In Ireland, however, if a farmer were unfortunate enough to suffer a breakdown, the local office will call him and give him the names of the valuers who operate in the county.  It takes a number of days to allow the valuer to go to the farm, look at the animals, do all the paperwork and send the farmer a valuation by post.  The farmer has then three or four days to consider the valuation and make a decision.  There is a level of to and fro to allow for the valuation process and the system allows for a second appeal valuation, if the farmer is unhappy with the valuation.  All of that process means that the average reactor removal times can take up to 20 days.  We are keen to reduce that timeframe as much as possible.  I was asked whether we had any particular commitment to do that, and we do.  There is a commitment for the Department to remove reactors within ten days after all documentation on the valuation process has been signed off by the farmer and the Department.  We are working to reduce that time and it is now down to approximately five days.  We report on that monthly and-or quarterly to the Farmers' Charter which meets in Portlaoise.</p><p> One of the key actions we have taken to reduce reactor removal times, as Mr. Michael Sheahan mentioned earlier, is the gamma interferon policy.  When there are three or more reactors in the herd, there will be follow-up blood testing to try to see if there is any more infection in the herd.  Prior to last year, the standard practice in the public service's efforts to drive efficiency and value for money for the taxpayer was to wait until all reactors had been identified and then collect all the reactors together - those initially identified through the skin test and then the ones identified separately through the blood test.  The policy we have in place in all of our regional offices now is that as soon as the skin test reactors have been identified, we go and collect them, and if there are subsequent reactors identified by a blood test, we collect them then.  The focus is on disease eradication.  That has helped to bring down the reactor removal timeframe significantly.  What we are doing to facilitate it is to change the haulier contracts we have to collect reactors.  We are employing more hauliers and they can use small vehicles.  A jeep or a pick-up truck as opposed to a lorry could collect ten or 20 reactors in a locality to justify the trip.  That is one of the things we are doing to reduce reactor removal times.  We have told all stakeholders that we are open to any other proposals which will help us to reduce that timeline further because the Senator is correct that from a disease perspective, we want to get the reactor off the farm as quickly as possible. </p></speech>

The levels of TB in Northern Ireland are higher than those in the South at just shy of 10%, while the level in the South is 3.4%.  The main difference between the programmes is that we have had a badger and wildlife control programme and we have been culling badgers and now we are back saving badgers.  For social and political reasons, perhaps the culling policy was not acceptable in Northern Ireland and they were not able to go down that path.  We have close relationships and we work closely with our northern colleagues.  As Mr. Sheahan mentioned, yesterday we had a full day meeting with our northern colleagues, whom we meet regularly and with whom we work closely.  We co-ordinate on issues such as outbreaks near the Border and we are continually working to try to improve communication on cross-Border issues.  They have a programme based on the European regulations the same as ours, so it is closely aligned to our programme.</p><p>There are some small differences in how it is applied but, substantially, it is more or less similar other than the fact that they do not have a wildlife control programme.  Also, they carry out gamma blood testing, but it is not compulsory to remove positives, so if one has an animal that tests positive on the gamma blood test, one does not have to remove it.  Recently, a substantial review was carried out of the TB strategy in Northern Ireland.  An expert stakeholder group was set up and it reviewed the programme and came up with some proposals.  There is now a TB eradication partnership.  Mr. Breslin and I were invited to speak about our programme.  The entire strategy in Northern Ireland is being reviewed and a key element of that is to bring in badger controls, meaning wildlife removals, and they also want to carry out vaccination, where appropriate.  In addition, they want to take steps to deal with the level of compensation.  There is a different context in Northern Ireland and they feel the level of compensation is too high.  The Northern Ireland Audit Office carried out at review recently along the same lines and it found that it was not good value for money in terms of state expenditure.</p><p> Their levels of TB have crept upwards but they have stabilised in the past year or so.  There is a significant challenge in that regard, as it is for us, given that we share a border and there is trade.  Any export animals have to be tested before they can be exported, so that is less of a concern, but wildlife do not respect borders and it is something we are conscious of.  We are always keen to work with, collaborate with and support our Northern colleagues where we can.  We regularly have technical visits whereby their teams come down here or our teams go up there.  We are keen to assist them in any way we can and, similarly with them.  We have had good assistance from them where necessary or appropriate.  I agree that it is not a good situation and they would be the first to acknowledge that.  The fact that they have had these significant reviews in recent months saying they need to change things speaks to that.  Unfortunately, there are political problems up there.  They do not have a Minister or a devolved Government in place.  Substantial decisions cannot be taken until those structures are in place, so it is challenge.</p></speech>

We are not aware of that being a particular risk factor in any outbreaks.</p> <p>  As regards the cause of the problems in County Monaghan, for a number of years the county was at the national average in terms of the level of disease and then it crept up and after that there was a dramatic increase over a couple of years.  We have not attributed it to one particular factor but TB is like that; it is not a disease where there is just one factor such as badgers, deer, quality of testing or whatever else.  A number of factors are usually involved.  Monaghan has a few issues.  The farms there tend to be fragmented.  Northern Ireland may also be a factor.  There was an embargo for a number of years on recruitment of staff so it is possible that in some of our offices around the country we had fewer staff than we might have liked to deal with issues.  We cannot identify one single factor and say that is what caused the graph to go up, no more than with the outbreak in Kerry at the beginning of last year.  We will probably never know.  All it might take to cause a problem in an area is for one infected animal to be bought in that has passed the test and is not showing signs of the disease and if it goes into a herd and is stressed in some way, it becomes a super shedder and sheds significant volumes of infected bacteria.  Accordingly, a large number of cattle in a herd could be infected and they could be sold to neighbouring herds before they are tested.</p><p>It is as simple as that.  A couple of heavily infected animals that have not been detected in the test can do a lot of damage before we can get on top of the problem.  Our experience in Kerry has shown that, even though we were unable to put our finger on the exact cause of the problem, once an intensified programme was put in place, the disease was clamped down on and the graph went down very quickly.  We expect that to happen in Monaghan, and I will be very surprised if, this time next year, the graph has not come down very significantly.</p></speech>

Most countries that had TB in the 1950s and 1960s put eradication programmes in place.  They did not have the complications of a wildlife issue at the time, so their programmes were, in general, successful.  The only countries within the EU with significant problems with this are Ireland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Spain has some problems, but not to the same extent, as does Italy.  France has some minor problems, but beyond that it is not a problem within the EU.</p></speech>

It is a huge problem, as anyone who has worked in those countries will be aware.  Argentina and Brazil control TB in their beef production herds by way of tests and slaughter without compensation.  There is much less social support for it there.  Those countries do not have the cap we have.  That is one of the reasons that they produce beef at a lower cost than here.  They have huge farms, but when they find an animal that tests positive for TB, they are just slaughtered.  The programmes in place there are not analogous to Ireland because it is more about protecting the production of beef there.  We are lucky in Ireland not to have still substantial production losses because of TB.  A small number of animals here get actual tuberculosis, waste away and die, but it is not common.  However, in other countries it is still a problem.  It used to be a big problem in Ireland and caused a substantial production loss.  Brazil and Argentina are not looking at TB eradication but rather at reducing the production losses.  If positives are found, they are slaughtered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Ryan" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#AA00700"><p>It is substantially less effective than our approach.  It is critical to have stakeholder buy-in in matters like this and to look at all the risks.  Even if there was buy-in from the big beef herds, there are still many smaller herds which do not want to co-operate with a programme if no compensation is provided when animals are slaughtered.</p> <p>  We are aware we are working in an international context and support links with our international colleagues.  Indeed, there is going to be a large meeting in Galway in 2020, which we are helping to organise, where all the TB programme managers from across the world will meet to discuss these issues.  The particular areas relevant to Ireland, Wales, England, Northern Ireland and France are not quite the same as those relevant to other countries, but there are large areas of cross-over.</p> <p>  This is one of the ways in which we are continually trying to make sure that we are aligned with international best practice and the latest research.  It is important to build those international links.  Canada and the United States are free of TB, and we want to make sure that does not come up in any of our trade deals.  China can have concerns, as can Australia and New Zealand.  It is important to maintain good links with those countries.  I can provide very limited information on Argentina and Brazil, but we do work in an international context.  People often ask what the TB situation is when they are looking at animals or animal products, so it is important to engage internally with our own stakeholders and farming organisations.  We also want to stay aware of our international colleagues, not just because it is nice to know what is going on but also because it has a direct relevance to making sure people have confidence in our trade.  We have to ensure that trading partners believe our programme works, and if they know us, they can have faith that it works.  That is how we are addressing that issue.</p></speech>

In the past five or six months, following the severe drought, did the Department notice a spike in the incidence of TB arising in places where farming practices have changed such that farmers are feeding livestock in fields and dropping the meal and mixture in those fields?  The Department does background research on farms that pick up TB.  Did it notice that those farms had changed their practice of feeding livestock in the past six months?</p><p> The compensation issue is the most important one.  It is all fine if the cow is there and the milk is going to the creamery, but there are many beef or suckler farmers who become locked up with phenomenal costs.  At the end of the day, compensation depends on the size and weight of the livestock unit.  No matter what way prices go, costs are involved in paying for the farm management operation.  Some farms must carry stock for longer periods if they are locked up a second time.  Compensation has become a significant issue and it is incorporated into the added costs.</p><p> On a more trivial point, Mr. Ryan mentioned that the Department had tested deer near Wicklow and he noted that some strains were more prone to TB.  Is it the same in the case of livestock?  Given the variety of lactating cows on our farms, is there a prevalence in different breeds for picking up TB more easily than others?</p><p> My colleagues raised the idea of establishing a TB forum, which we welcome.  Does the Department see itself going down the road of all-out blood testing as opposed to testing under the skin?  From what I see in my backyard, herds go down in double rather than single digits, and recently there have been very high levels of TB.  What is happening and what is causing it in an area that I thought had been cleared?</p><p> I trust that there was no repetition in my contribution.</p></speech>

On the drought, which obviously had a significant impact on many parts of the country, we have not seen any pattern that would link a change in behaviour to problems in an area or whatever.  It is often the case with TB, however, that it is only when one looks back 12 or 18 months later that one might see a pattern, but thus far we have not seen a pattern of meal-feeding practices changing the levels of TB in an area.</p> <p>  On whether there is a difference in the prevalence of TB among different cattle like that among deer, we had touched on that earlier.  In recent times, there has been quite a bit of work done on genetic resistance.  The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, can now tell us that particular lines of bulls tend to be more resistant to TB than other lines.  The ICBF and others have done work on that, and over the next couple of years it will become a larger part of the tools we use to tackle TB.  In regard to specific breeds, we would not say, for example, that the Hereford breed is more susceptible than Aberdeen Angus because we do not have any evidence of that.  There is no doubt, however, that genetics is an issue.</p></speech>

There was much discussion earlier about how we want what we are doing to be driven by data and research, and we have got value from that research, which was carried out by top-class Irish researchers.  It is an example of Teagasc doing great work.  One of the outcomes from the research was that there is more variation within breeds than between them, that is, the difference of the bull is much more important than the difference between a Holstein, a Hereford or a Limousin.  It was an important question because it is often asked whether a Limousin or Charolais, for example, is more susceptible, but the outcome was that the bull drives the susceptibility much more than breed variation.</p></speech>

While people complain and farming organisations will often make an issue of compensation, we find in practice that our valuation system works very well.  If a farmer is not happy with the valuation, he or she has the chance to appeal and a second valuation will be made.  However, the number of appeals is very low.  Approximately 3% of all valuations are appealed, with half of the appeals being taken by the Department and the other half by farmers.  It is a very low rate of appeals.  Perhaps farmers are never happy with the prices they receive at marts, but when one speaks to them privately, our experience is that the valuation system is fair.</p></speech>

We have a hardship grant which is a small amount of money to tide certain categories of farmer over the winter period where they are forced to keep extra stock.  We also have an income supplement.  This may be the only country in the world with these systems.  Certainly, they do not and are not designed to compensate a person fully for the loss of every single gallon of milk or kilo of meat, but they are unique to Ireland.</p></speech>

If one has a good dairy cow on her second lactation and is unfortunate enough to have her go down in September or October, one will definitely not receive the full value of that animal.</p></speech>

Valuations are based on the market value of the animal if it did not have TB.  In other words, if it is a second lactation cow sold in a clearance sale, the valuation is designed to reflect what the animal would make if it did not have TB.</p></speech>

We also appeal a small number when we believe it is too generous or not accurate.  While the issue is raised, we find in practice that it is not as significant as some might have someone believe.  </p> <p>  A question was also asked about blood testing.  It was probably covered earlier.  We were asked if we would be using all out blood testing instead of skin testing.  The answer is "No".  The reason we cannot or would not do it is while there are many advantages to the blood test, it produces a higher level of false positives.  If one was to test 100 cattle, one would get three false positives.  As such, it is not a test one can use in the general population of 6 million cattle as one would end up with too many false positives.  We only use it in herds where we know that there is a problem.  In these cases, we use it in addition to the skin test.  It then has the advantage of picking out infected animals not picked up by the skin test.  It picks them up at an earlier stage.  As such, it is a very useful extra tool in dealing with infected herds, but it is not a tool to use in the wider population, given the excessive number of false positives.</p></speech>

If his or her farm is locked up before October and before he or she goes to the mart, his or her cycle is upset.  He or she is carrying stock into the winter, which means extra feed and extra costs when he or she is not into that type of farming.  That is the loss I am on about.  In that situation it is no good going to the bank to look for more money.  Down the road, such a farmer could be caught by new climate change rules for stocking.  What is being put in place for such farmers?</p></speech>

Obviously, it is not and is the last thing anyone wants to see happen.</p><p>At certain times of the year, in particular, to put it mildly, it makes life very awkward for those involved in a sector that is not the most profitable in the world.  The Teagasc figures indicate that suckler cow or beef farming is not a profitable business in which to be involved in the first place.  Because of the added burden of having their farms locked up, we want to get rid of TB as quickly as possible, which is why we are committed to working with everyone to have it done by, or even before, 2030 in certain parts of the country.  I will not try to pretend that there is no hardship involved.  There is and the income supplement and the hardship grant have been designed to help to alleviate some of the associated difficulties.</p></speech>

Members probably know that we have 51 advisory offices throughout the country, down from 90 following the rationalisation programme.</p><p>We have four colleges of further education and seven research centres.  We also subvent three private colleges in Pallaskenry, Mountbellew and Gurteen.</p><p> On our finances, last year our total expenditure was approximately &euro;187 million.  We are obliged every year to match expenditure with income.  I draw the committee's attention to a somewhat unique feature of Teagasc as a non-commercial body in having a relatively large proportion of non-grant-in-aid income, amounting to some &euro;56 million in 2017.  This income comprises: various grants Teagasc receives as a result of success in competitions for research and advisory funds both at national and EU level; advisory fees paid by farmers; education fees; significant farm operations; a small amount of levies from industry; and the sale of a variety of professional services.  In 2017 Teagasc received &euro;125 million in grant-in-aid for current expenditure purposes and a further capital grant of &euro;3.15 million.  Teagasc uses, unlike many public bodies, part of our grant-in-aid to defray the cost of pensions and we have a large number of pensioners, given the age of the organisation.  The total pension Bill amounted to &euro;43 million in 2017.  If pension costs are excluded from current expenditure then non-grant-in-aid income was about 45% of the 2017 level of current expenditure.</p><p> I will now turn to performance metrics.  Teagasc, as a public body, is obliged to operate a rigorous performance and evaluation system that has several layers.  We conduct, for example, external peer reviews of all of our programmes on a regular basis including our administrative programmes.  We monitor and track key performance indicators across the organisation.  I will not go into detail, but set out in the appendices is the bottom line for us as a non-commercial body.  We look at performance on the research side and how internationally competitive we are as to publications and securing external funding for our research.  As the committee can see, there is a healthy trend shown.</p><p> On the advisory side, we have approximately 43,000 clients - this fluctuates marginally from year to year -  who paid Teagasc close to &euro;21 million in charges  in 2017.  We have about &euro;5 million from education fees.  We conduct, by way of communicating knowledge, several activities such as open days, farm walks, conferences, media communications - increasingly through the use of social media - and all of these channels are freely available to all interested parties.  We also operate a highly successful fellowship programme for the training of PhDs.  At present we have the single largest group, of about 250 students, studying for PhD level in a single subject area, which are all undertaken in partnership arrangements with national and international universities and research agencies.</p><p> I should add, Chairman - I neglected to put this in my opening statement - that we also have approximately 20 MSc students in a collaboration with UCD for the training of knowledge transfer or advisory specialists.</p><p> Finally, I draw the committee's attention to the various trends in enrolments in Teagasc colleges and at regional offices through our part-time programmes.  From 2008 until recently, the numbers exploded in our agricultural colleges.  Going back to 2014 approximately, the increase in enrolments in 2008 had been about 250% for year 1.</p><p>As the economy has begun to pick up again, these enrolments have fallen back, especially for what we call the further education students.  As the Chairman is probably aware, Teagasc partners with a number of institutes of technology in the delivery of degree programmes and with University College Dublin in the delivery of higher education programmes.  Enrolments in the higher education courses have been fairly stable.  Following the various incentives for young farmers to re-enter education enshrined in the rural development programme of the CAP, there has been a substantial increase in enrolments in part-time and distance education courses.  In fact, enrolments are now running at over three times the level that prevailed prior to the rural development programme, RDP, measures.  The demand continues to be exceptionally strong, particularly in the north east and north of the country.<br/><br/>I will make a few comments on financial management as they were raised in our annual report.  I wish to bring it to the attention of the committee that in the absence of access to borrowing facilities, Teagasc has faced significant challenges in recent years in funding working capital requirements.  This issue has become more acute as our non-grant-in-aid income has increased significantly and we might not always be paid promptly.  We have to finance the capital involved while we are waiting for payment.  Similarly, in the absence of a borrowing facility, longer term capital funding for our research and educational infrastructure is even more challenging.  Our grant-in-aid typically earmarks a relatively small amount of funding for infrastructure purposes which is only sufficient to partially cover maintenance costs and some minor capital works.  Last year, for example, the capital allocation was &euro;3.15 million.  More substantial infrastructure needs are funded as the opportunity arises through the sale of assets that are no longer programme priorities, or through once-off special capital grants from Government.  Reliance on asset sales as a funding mechanism is not a sustainable basis on which to fund ongoing infrastructure needs.  While we are always appreciative of special capital grants, the process does result in an episodic funding schedule.  This approach inhibits Teagasc&rsquo;s ability to meet its strategic investment needs on a planned and timely basis and our ability to respond rapidly to changing needs, for example climate change, is curtailed.  It is not really possible to commit to a medium-term investment plan as grant-based funding requests have to be progressed on a case-by-case basis.  Access to longer-term investment funding would be a highly welcome innovation.  We do make our case from time to time; in the budget 12 months ago we got a significant capital allocation that we had been seeking for a number of years for a food innovation hub.<br/><br/>There is reference in the statement of internal control to procurement issues and difficulties that we faced.  I assure the committee that we are making every effort to be as compliant as possible in respect of procurement practices.  Significant improvements can be reported in recent years through the recruitment of specialist staff and the establishment of robust systems of control.  It is complex in Teagasc due to the diversified range of activities and the fact that our locations are dispersed across the country.  The exceptions reported in the financial statements were brought to the attention of Teagasc itself by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are really two reasons for their occurrence, neither of which is satisfactory.  Quotes being sought from a number of local suppliers rather than advertising through <i>etenders.gov.ie</i>, as was strictly required for the amounts involved.  We are nonetheless quite satisfied that this did not adversely affect value for money given the number of quotes sought and the type of services procured.  The other reason was the extension of existing contracts for services where the requirement was being reviewed, where there were delays in the implementation of the Office of Government Procurement process or where a similar service had already been procured from that supplier.</p><p>I want to stress that while no exceptions can be tolerated, it should be noted that the exceptions amounted to tender values of &euro;1.35 million from a total amount of transactions of &euro;42 million, representing just over 3% of the total.</p></speech>

Will he elaborate on the percentage of his budget and expenditure that goes towards that area and what Teagasc's role within the whole farm safety set-up is?  How does he think it should be implemented going forward to try to reduce the number of accidents and, indeed, the number of fatalities, which do not seem to be decreasing in any manner?  Professor Boyle said at the outset that his report was based on an analysis of Teagasc's performance.  I do not believe he could be happy with performance in that particular area.  What has been spent on it?  How many dedicated employees does it have?  What is Teagasc's official role in the whole farm safety sphere?  How could it be improved going forward to meet the challenges ahead?</p></speech>

Other people appearing before this committee should do the same.  Will he give an outline of how the food innovation hub at Moorepark is going?  There is a public-private aspect to that, covering research and development.</p> <p>  On the issue of farm safety, there are 24 or 25 deaths on farms annually now.  It is far too high a number, notwithstanding the significant focus on it in recent years.  I believe Mr. John McNamara was involved in this area with Teagasc and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  Will Professor Boyle outline what Teagasc is doing in terms of trying to put a code of practice in place to prevent injuries?</p> <p>  I note that there is an issue around procurement.  I salute Teagasc as it is not a homogenous organisation.  It carries out many diverse activities, so it is very difficult to stick to the various procurement procedures that are laid down.  Exceptions are a very minuscule aspect of the entirety of its work, and Teagasc often has to act with great alacrity to ensure that it can continue with its various programmes.</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of Greenfield farm over many years, and Professor Boyle probably expects me to raise it tonight.  I know that Dr. Tom Moran, former Secretary General, produced an independent report about it.  It is a bit of a blight on the overall activities of Teagasc and its partners.  I knew there was a higher mortality rate of cows and calves than what was initially reported.  There was bound to be.  I read the report, and as a demonstration farm it provided a fairly poor example.  The situation that arose called into question the operability and advisability of housing cows and calves in outdoor facilities.  These climatic events are going to be quite regular, and there is no excuse for this ever to happen again.  I hope that we never have to revisit this issue.  I was very annoyed, and indeed a number of people, including members of the farming public, contacted me over this issue as recently as one month ago.  Even some farmers from Wicklow were very annoyed about it.  It was clearly a vulnerable system.  It is all right in New Zealand and other places, but not here.</p><p>I am critical because there was a lack of safety statements, anticipatory plans, risk assessment and hazard analysis.  It appears that nothing was done.  It has been pointed out that this has to be done.  The independent review does point to fairer management at times.  There is even a reference to adequate food reserves.  We cannot bury the facts.  They are there.  It is not just the mortality of animals, the cows and calves.  Those things happen.  We are not fools.  That happens in ordinary farming.  However, when one exposes animals to the elements, there is distress and other issues that arise from the exposure.  Everywhere else farmers were running all over the place trying to bring animals in.  They were putting animals in sheds that might not have been the best, but people were trying to make do so as to put shelter in place.  I accept there were unusual climatic events, but we have to cut out the nonsense of saying that it is a rarity because it looks like it will be commonplace now.  I will be keeping an eye on the situation.  If we have to come back to deal with this next March or April, someone will have to be brought to book.</p><p> I asked Professor Boyle about it because I know he has an interest in the area.  Anyone who has ever been involved in agriculture realises the distress that can arise with animals, including hypothermia, in such situations.  Will he outline what plans will be put in place to avoid a recurrence of the serious situation that arose in Greenfield farm last spring?  I know the weather was extreme.  I am not a fool, but I hope that never happens again.  It is inevitable that there will be animal losses.  Losses are part of farming or any activity.  However, the farm is a demonstration farm and it must be held to the highest standards.  I hope the augmented facilities take cognisance of the adverse climatic trends and events that are now prevalent in this country.</p></speech>

Recognition must be given to the work of Teagasc and how it has brought information and communications technology to farmers.  Its mandate has worked very well.  I welcome the lifting of the moratorium on recruitment.  That is long overdue.  With respect, the age of advisers and that of the management structure was increasing and it is vital to bring new blood into any organisation.  In terms of the salary levels available to Teagasc, is it able to attract the type of graduates it wants?  Are there restrictions on salary levels?  What are the guidelines, and are they creating difficulties?</p> <p>  I note that 12,000 farmers are involved in discussion groups.  I presume up to 95% of them are dairy farmers.  Significant strides could be made in the beef sector if we could get more beef farmers involved in discussion groups.  I know from personal experience that talking with one's peers is probably the best way to transfer knowledge and to see the practical advice from Teagasc implemented.</p> <p>  Could Professor Boyle give us the exact number of full-time students in agriculture colleges?  How much of a drop has there been in the past two to three years?  Teagasc has not been at the forefront of the debate on climate change and the accompanying challenges, and that has been noticeable.</p><p>There was a programme on RT&Eacute; One last night about climate change, the bio-economy and the role that agriculture must play.  While climate change is a challenge, it is also an opportunity if proper research is carried out.  The bio-economy research centre will be based in Lisheen, waste from food processing will be used and a bio-refinery will also be built next year.  There are great opportunities for us in sustainable food production, and it would be a shame if Teagasc did not have the budget to produce serious research and advice, not least at farm level.  As a committee, we visited University College Dublin and met Professor Kevin O'Connor this summer.  The research is proceeding at galloping speed, and the opportunities are virtually endless.  As farmers, we are behind the curve of other European farmers on climate change, but there are many income opportunities.  I recently spoke with a continental farmer who said his roof with its solar panels was a source of income for him, the cows were the second tier of his income, while the third tier was the slurry that the farm produced.  We have a long way to go to get onto that playing pitch, and many resources must be invested at farm level to show farmers the opportunities available.  </p><p> As well as those opportunities, there are ambitious targets to meet in regard to climate change.  Teagasc is without doubt one area where we are not up to speed.  Whatever amount of investment the Government needs for Teagasc, a case should be made for a specialised budget on climate change.  The year 2020 is coming down the tracks fast and we do not have an earthly chance of meeting the targets imposed on us by the EU.  In 2030, there will be even more strenuous targets.  There is a significant amount of work to be done, and Teagasc has a role to play at farm level.  </p><p> I do not wish to put Professor Boyle on the spot but I mentioned to him before the meeting that there is a serious issue with the age of our farming population.  The average age does not read well and it appears we are not attracting young farmers into the industry.  I have always strongly advocated that the best way to get them into the industry is to ensure a viable income for them.</p><p> I apologise for being late for the private session at the beginning of the meeting, but we need to discuss the finance Bill and the ceiling it contains for the number of incentives that young farmers can receive.  I would like to see research on what impact that will have, on how many young farmers exceed that ceiling of &euro;70,000, which was included in the finance Bill this year, and on how many stamp duty exemptions or stock relief young farmers qualify for.  It is particularly important in the dairy sector, where a young farmer might carry out some expansion, incurring many costs, and stock relief and stamp duty can be highly influential in making those kinds of decisions economically viable.  What impact will the &euro;70,000 limit have?  Attracting young farmers is important, and I suggest the committee tries to get more information from the Department in that regard.</p></speech>

He described some collaborations with the education sector through institutes of technology and University College Dublin.  Is there a defined role for Teagasc in the development of technological universities?  To what extent has Teagasc been consulted?  Would its participation be more on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, depending on the particular alliance of colleges involved?</p><p>With regard to the various education programmes and courses Teagasc rolls out for young farmers, including the green certificate, does Professor Boyle feel there is more it could do on issues pertaining to climate change?  As has been mentioned, we visited the BEACON bioeconomy research centre at UCD, which is encouraging and exciting.  There is so much potential and, clearly, technology will keep coming at us.<br/><br/>Another issue that regularly pops up here is that of the weak position of the farmer in the food supply chain.  There has been a European-wide consultation on this and measures will be taken particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>multiple retailers but no solution has been implemented yet.  How do we help our farmers add value to their products?  We have seen the case of the mushroom farmers with whom UCD is working and the development of plastic as a byproduct from dairy.  How will farmers benefit from this so they are not always crying?  This is not a derogatory term because it is true.  At present, we know the situation with regard to beef.  How can there be change for farmers regarding the prices they receive as primary producers and in the context of the bioeconomy?  Do they have to form co-operatives?  What are the means?  Has this been looked at?<br/><br/>Professor Boyle mentioned climate change and our 2025 targets.  As Deputy Cahill outlined, there is more we can do with solar panels and anaerobic digestion but no matter what is done, it is not ring-fenced.  A farmer with a tractor working off a battery is not assessed on the basis of his farm.  The benefit of that carbon reduction may go to transport.  Are we in a situation whereby as we increase the national herd and increase our food output we are bound in terms of the obligations?  We all speak about how carbon efficient we are, particularly in dairy, and nobody says we do not need to do more.  Whatever we do, if we are ramping up production there will be an increase, and if that is beyond what is envisaged for us in the 2020 and 2030 targets, do we need to renegotiate them?  We should be upfront about it and be proud of achievements in farming, considering how production has increased since the 1990s and carbon emissions have reduced.  Efforts have been made.  We need to have a conversation about it.  People have become more aware of climate change and want to be active and do something but instead of thinking they should do it themselves, they are looking at farmers and agriculture because they are the source of a significant volume of the country's greenhouse gas emissions but they do not look at the fact that we need to eat.  The positives of farming are not being acknowledged.  Realistically, where do we go with all of this?</p></speech>

To follow the two previous speakers, I was wondering what Teagasc will do with regard to the IPCC report, which informed us that the climate is warming more rapidly than had been thought.  How will the challenges facing agriculture be dealt with in our targets under Food Wise 2025?  A number of us are also members of the climate action committee and we are being told that there should be more afforestation but many farmers are concerned about tying up good quality arable land in forestry.</p><p>Has Professor Boyle looked at models from other countries that might provide a suitable solution, rather than tying up many acres with it?  It might be possible, for example, to plant 1 acre on a particular farm.</p><p> I was very interested to see that uptake in respect of the adult distance education green certificate has really increased.  Is that a particular course that was designed to be pursued online?  Over 1,000 people nationally have signed up to do it.</p></speech>

The new maps of areas of natural constraint were released in recent weeks..  A number of areas that were included on the previous occasion have been excluded.  What part can Teagasc play in an appeals process in to assist those who want to make appeals?  The maps are based on science.  My understanding is that Teagasc played a part in developing the maps based on the evidence it collected in respect of soil types over the past number of years.  What part can Teagasc play in assisting appeals when the new appeals board is set up?</p></speech>

Reference was made to the food innovation hub at Moorepark, for which we have secured planning permission.  It will probably be constructed in 18 months or so, but it is part of a process of adding value in the mainstream activities, particularly in the dairy sector.  We also recently won an Enterprise Ireland regional innovation fund grant, along with Dairygold and Cork County Council, to build an agri-tech hub at our Kilworth farm in order that we might study the whole area of precision agriculture.  There is a great deal of activity going on at Moorepark.</p> <p>  On climate change, I would love to have the committee visit Johnstown Castle.  I was somewhat disappointed that a Deputy who represents the constituency in which I live stated that Teagasc has not really made a mark in the context of tackling climate change.  I strongly disagree with that assertion.  We have not been jumping up and down on the rooftops about it but, as far as I am concerned, the only coherent set of policy proposals produced on agricultural transition, as it is known, towards a neutral carbon future, was brought forward by Teagasc.  We produced a very comprehensive document last June, A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture, in which we outlined no less that 27 specific, science-based measures which, if adopted, would enable us to substantially achieve our 2030 targets.  The Deputies are correct to say that we will not achieve our 2020 targets in any sector.  Agriculture is going to be particularly challenging as we move forward.  I agree with Senator Mulherin; I have said publicly that it is a perfectly legitimate aspiration for the agricultural sector to grow and for individual farmers to grow their businesses.  Ireland has also signed up to internationally binding obligations.  Teagasc identified different scenarios in the document to which I refer.  We have examined six different scenarios in respect of livestock numbers.  I will be happy to make the document in question available to the committee.  In fact, it is going to be discussed tomorrow at a meeting of one of the other joint committees.</p> <p>  Emissions in Irish agriculture follow livestock numbers; there is almost a direct correlation.</p><p>We have identified potential savings up to 2030 of 9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is significant in the context of a benchmark baseline of 20 megatonnes.  As far as I am concerned, we have been leading the way.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine endorsed our proposed measures and the new Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, recently did the same.  We have solved the problem on a spreadsheet and we are the only ones to have laid it out, which we can do because of our in-house expertise.  However, in spite of the weather over the past year, there is poor awareness among farmers of climate change in general and, specifically, the issue of ammonia, which I have been raising for some time.</p><p> The challenge in respect of ammonia is significant and will be difficult to address.  Action needs to be taken on awareness and farm adoption.  Teagasc research indicates that farmers who switch from using calcium ammonium nitrate as a source of nitrogen to using stabilised urea would achieve the same yield in gas production, but greenhouse gases and ammonia would be reduced.  However, it is difficult to persuade farmers to make that change.  There is currently no significant difference in the cost of the two fertilisers.  Over several years we have shown that the application of slurry using trailing shoe technology leads to a significant reduction in emissions.</p><p> The measures are available; adoption is the issue.  Although is not within our remit, it is important that policy support action in this area.  We have suggested that the next CAP be used to ensure that measures are consistent.  If the committee were to visit Johnstown Castle, members would be given a full run-down on the research.  We are expending significant resources in this area.  We must expend more in future because the measures we have identified are based on current knowledge.  The field of additives is rapidly changing.  In the past three weeks, we met representatives of three companies, which each developed a feed additive product.  Of course, the companies are optimistic about their products which must be analysed and so on.  It is a rapidly changing field in which we are investing significant resources.  The challenges will be in respect of adoption and policy to back up those measures.</p><p> Reference was made to forestry.  I previously described forestry as a get-out-of-jail clause for the agricultural sector because we estimate that 3 megatonnes or one third of the savings we have identified may come from forestry.  Thankfully, enough trees were grown over the past 30 or 40 years to get us to 2030, but if the rate of plantation is not increased, there will be a serious difficulty in 2030.  We estimate that new plantations will decline to 4,500 ha this year.  The target is approximately 8,000 ha or 8,500 ha.  The rate of plantation has fallen consistently over the past two years.  There is a significant problem in that regard.  As members will be aware, there is significant opposition to forestry in certain parts of the country.  We must convince farmers, particularly dairy farmers, that they should have an interest in trees.  There is a big opportunity to have native woodland plantations on every dairy farm in the country.  I was surprised by the significant percentage of forest area on dairy farms, but there is more potential in that regard.  It would be a fantastic gesture on behalf of the dairy sector to demonstrate its willingness to address the issue of climate change.</p><p> On renewables, we have identified the potential of energy crops and so forth.  It is limited enough in the sense that there can be a displacement of fossil fuels.  I have been a strong advocate of anaerobic digestion but the policy environment must be right.  We have built a demonstration plant in Grange, which is about to be commissioned, to illustrate to farmers how one can use the grass-based biomass to produce high-quality gas.  We have also been discussing with a number of entities how that might be developed further.  There is a great deal happening, but the policy follow through is an issue.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly referred to farm safety.  Some colleagues who are here and members of this committee were at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts when the Chairman raised the issue of farm safety.  I am sure all of us have experienced a tragedy on a farm so we are all very aware of it.  Teagasc works very closely with the Health and Safety Authority.  Our remit is to deliver advice and the authority has a different remit from ours but we have a collaboration agreement with it.  We do quite an amount of research because this is a very challenging area.  Most farmers have an awareness of the issues and hazards but  despite that, they still engage in practices that are clearly not safe.  We have carried out a great deal of research on the behaviour that motivates this type of attitude to health and safety and we have acquired many insights that can advise our advisory activity.  However, the Senator is 100% right.  If one were to use the metric of farm fatalities and, more generally, farm injury one would not be pointing to a positive trend.</p><p> We constantly try to work on this.  For example, we are appointing an additional specialist in farm health and safety.  The specialist works closely with our 260 advisers.  That is how we do it.  We deliver the messages.  At almost every farm discussion group, there is a health and safety topic, but I would be the first to say that it is clearly not working.  Sermonising and preaching are not enough.  That is the reality.  I am happy to say that there has been a welcome improvement in the number of child fatalities.  The farmyard business and the household have to be separate in my opinion.  It is a dangerous place for young people, yet we see many transgressions.  We are appointing a new specialist and we are trying to adapt the insights from research.  A number of entities, including the Department, could, in my opinion, work more closely, particularly in the context of promotional campaigns.  We should all be involved in this together.  We are involved in promoting the code of practice and we have training programmes.  Despite the massive effort the challenge has been elusive so far.  I wish I could suggest today what will make a difference.  At the same time we have long been of the view that regulation or enforcement does not work.  It is hard to put in place the level of inspectorate that is required.  I strongly believe it does not work but at the same time we must review what is happening.</p><p> Deputy Penrose raised a number of important issues that I wish to address.  With regard to the food innovation hub, we have planning permission and we hope it will be completed in 18 months or so.  It will be a very important development.  There are already approximately 14 companies in Moorepark.  They are from all over the country and some are from overseas but are doing business in Ireland.</p><p>They have stated that they want a facility on site where they can have complete confidentiality, while at the same time being in a position to use the shared resources available.  That is the strategy behind this.  It is all about providing added value.  I am not talking about a more exotic final consumer products lists, but there is a lot of valued added in food ingredients, particularly in infant formula.  We call it the smart ingredients approach.  It is probably not all that visible, but it is where the innovation lies for the producers of these products.</p><p> I want to address the issue of Greenfield farm.</p></speech>

I want to address those issues now.  We have several demonstration farms, the whole point of which is that one learns as much from the bad outcomes as the good ones.  It was in that spirit that we commissioned a report, alongside Greenfield farm.  We wanted to have experts look at this episode, so we asked Mr. Tom Moran, the former Secretary General, to chair the investigation.  We hired an international expert in the field of animal welfare under extreme conditions from the United States, and a number of other eminent people.  We also had one person from our board, who is a diary farmer.  The Deputy said that we cannot bury the findings of this report.  Teagasc has no intention of burying any findings.  I would like to think that this report provides a very candid account in which no punches are pulled in the context of the Greenfield episode.  It is a wake-up call for us, and is also a wake-up call for farmers in the context of climate change.  Colleagues who know more about the science of these things than I would say that we cannot point to the past year as evidence of climate change, but for the lay person and the average farmer it was.  The episode was unprecedented.  It was certainly the case that none of the people working on the farm on a day-to-day basis had any experience of events like that ever occurring in their lifetimes.  The lesson for me concerned adaptation.  We have to have really robust training programmes in place.  I am an <i>ex officio</i>member of the Climate Change Advisory Council, and I have been making the point that we have to simulate these conditions.  That comes across in the report, but from talking to the people involved it is clear that it was a frightening experience.<br/><br/>Teagasc is not a shareholder in Greenfield farm.  We provide top-level managerial advice, and the farm manager reports to the so-called Moorepark officer on the ground.  We are clearly not standing back from our responsibilities in terms of what is identified in the report.  From my point of view there are three things to be actions.  The governance structure lacks clarity, as became clear after the fact.  Things were going very well, and many young farmers set up farms following the model who would not have been able to set up farms otherwise.  When I called for this report I was asked to meet approximately 30 of them from all over the country.  Only one of those people was over the age of 35.  They were a fantastic bunch of individuals who were able to start up their business because of the blueprint provided at Greenfield.  They stuck at it.  The difference between those farmers and Greenfield was that as they started to make a surplus they began to invest in their facilities a bit more.</p><p>There was a dynamic component to what they were doing.  From that perspective, that element was a success.  The Deputy is 100% correct, however.  We are not going to hide anything here.  There are lessons associated with governance, and clarification is required.  We have already actioned that.  It is going to happen.</p><p> An inexcusable issue arose in the context of the health and safety statements and an arrangement needed to be put in place.  That has obviously happened after the fact.  Issues arose that will be outside our control but we will certainly be advising the board of the farm to examine the facilities.  The facilities identified in the report to be of most concern were those for the calving house.</p><p> On animal fatalities, two cows and four calves died immediately due to the adverse circumstances, and two others died shortly thereafter.  We are saying two cows and six calves comprised the total.  That is not acceptable.  Obviously, no animal death is acceptable.  In fairness, this must be considered against the background of a fairly good animal health and mortality record on the farm.  That is documented in the report.  The farm, unlike many private farms, is under the public gaze.  We have learned an awful lot from that.  I take the Deputy's point that if there is no improvement, I expect to be back here answering the legitimate questions raised.</p></speech>

It is getting bigger and bigger and there are more overheads.  Professor Boyle said the system has been adopted by a number of younger farmers.  It is great to see younger farmers getting involved in farming.  This issue is one of the main ones, and it might have been referred to earlier.  A farm not too far from my home has a model similar to the one in question, and similar issues arose during the difficult period.  There was a feeding deficit and there were animal welfare difficulties owing to the weather.  The model is cheaper to get into but the consequences-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#QQ00500"><p>One has to ask what is the New Zealand model.  One of its characteristics is scale.  I have my own views on that.  We can drive scale so far in this country but one runs into obstacles, as the farm in question did very quickly in the context of labour.  We will never replicate the scale in New Zealand.  The weather is different.  It depends on whether one is on the North Island or the South Island.  The weather on the North Island is more like that in Ireland.</p> <p>  The project laid out the business plan.  We have learned that there was not really a dynamic element in it in terms of determining when there should be a pause to decide on making a new investment and so on.  On a typical farm, that is exactly what happens.  Every young farmer is short of cash and will take risks because he or she has to.  If young farmers do not have the cash, they cannot borrow enough.  They try to build up and when they have a surplus, they say it is time to put in place creature comforts for themselves and the animals.  That is the way it typically evolves.  The farm in question has got to the point where the pause button has been pressed.  There will have to be investment as a consequence of what happened.  That will be picked up by farmers.  We have learned a great deal.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill raised a few issues concerning the moratorium.  I have to agree with him.  We are delighted the moratorium has been lifted.</p><p>I have made no bones about my view that starting salaries for researchers and advisors in the organisation are a major problem which is only getting worse by the day.  I acknowledge that we are no different from the rest of the public sector and that we will not be top of the queue for any adjustment in the near future, unlike other sectors with a higher profile.  However, the starting salary for someone who has completed a PhD that takes four or sometimes five years, is &euro;32,500, which is simply not competitive.  Not only is it not competitive with the private sector, which we would not expect it to be, it is not competitive with the university sector.  That is our main problem, as that is where we are competing.  It is an issue and we have to go down the line sometimes to less qualified candidates.  Sometimes people take up the position, stay a short while and go.  Sometimes we have had to go through several interviews to get people.  It is an issue and I cannot see a quick solution to it.  It is bound up with the national public finances.  I have an economics background and can understand the wider macroeconomic issues, but we have serious concerns.</p><p> There is no doubt that discussion groups have worked in the dairy sector.  They have been less successful in beef, but with the knowledge transfer scheme, beef farmers have come into the system and we are reasonably confident that a number of them will stay on when the scheme ends next year.  The message that we are trying to get across to them is that the concession farmers received for joining the scheme pales into insignificance in comparison with the benefits to profitability and incomes.</p><p> I do not have the detailed figures on student enrolments, but I will supply them to the committee.  In general, however, there has been a levelling off over the past few years in college attendance.  In fact, it has dropped back a little.  It is not uniform across the country.  For example, Ballyhaise has maintained numbers for some reason and bucked the trend a little.  However, college enrolments have been more than offset by the part-timers.  Someone mentioned the distance education students.  There are great incentives by way of grant aid and there was access to the national quota reserve for a period for those about to inherit farms.  Such people have to get a qualification, which is why there was a major influx of people with other qualifications, including accountants, solicitors and an array of others who were eligible for the distance programme.  That is why they came in.  Equally, there has been a significant increase in the number of people with farming backgrounds who did not have prior qualifications and so must go the part-time route at our regional centres.  In particular, we have approximately 2,000 people on a waiting list in the north and north east.  We hope to work down through that demand but it is difficult to do so with the limited resources we have.</p><p> I will talk to Deputy Cahill again at some stage about our work on climate change.  It has been front and centre in the national response.  I will follow up on the point about stamp duty.  I was not aware of that issue.</p></speech>

It is a combination of intensive advisory activity and, albeit it is not my area, putting policy support behind that.</p><p>For example, on the solar panels, every Teagasc dairy farm in the first instance will have photovoltaic, PV, panels, hopefully, by the end of next year, as will all our colleges.  That is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned.  We are hoping to work with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p><p> Senator Mulherin asked about the technological universities.  We have partnerships with virtually all the institutes of technology and with UCD and UCC.  We are not directly involved in any of the discussions around the establishment of the new universities, except in that a lot of the universities will want Teagasc to support their research activity.  For example, I mentioned the Walsh fellowship programme which funds 250 PhD students.  A number of those would be within institutes of technology and we would expect the number to increase with the technological universities.  Our partnership would be more at that end.  We have very strong partnerships with Dundalk, Waterford and Cork Institutes of Technology, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, and a number of others.</p></speech>

We have a long-standing relationship with GMIT.  The Senator asked a very good question about climate change on the education curriculum.  Last June, we published our education vision blueprint, which is a programme to take us up to 2050.  Believe it or not, the green cert is about 30 years old.  In educational terms, 30 years is a very short time.  The curriculum is constantly improving.  At the moment, we do not have autonomy on the design of the curriculum but have to defer to Quality and Qualifications Ireland, the supervisory body.  We hope to get autonomy and, when we do, we will be able to respond to changing needs far more quickly.  At the moment, sustainability more broadly, including climate change, is part of the curriculum.  The Senator is absolutely right that it is going to increase in the future.</p> <p>  The question about the farmer in the food supply chain is a hardy chestnut.  Unfortunately, Irish farmers have very little control over prices because of the nature of the market.  Their price tapers, effectively.  In some niche markets they probably have a little bit more influence but certainly in the broader commodities they do not.  They can influence the quality of the product, of course, which makes a massive difference to the price they get.  Our approach is to focus on research as a driver of value added, which hopefully will translate into benefits for the farmer and certainly will translate into greater efficiencies on the farm, which will give the farmer a little bit more headroom.  The issue that is very evident to me in the food sector, particularly for commodity production, is that quality, food provenance and sustainability of production are becoming requirements for being in the marketplace.  It is not that the farmer is going to get a premium for producing his product in this way but that doing so is a requirement.  That is becoming very evident.  </p> <p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy raised the question about the IPCC report.  It should be a wake-up call for us all.  We have identified measures that, if implemented, would allow us to square the circle between growth in dairy production and the need to adhere to very stringent targets.</p><p>Presumably, the punishment for not meeting the targets will be significant fines.  I am not sure what will happen in 2020 but even if a small fine has to be paid, the visibility of that would create massive difficulties.  A continuation of breaches in our increased emissions will point to an inability or unwillingness on the part of the country to address the challenges.  One would always be worried that while the whistle has not blown yet, it may blow in the not-too-distant future if we continue the way we are going, and none of us know how that will work out.</p><p> The Chairman asked a difficult question about our role in appeals.  As he said, we were involved in a research exercise initially.  When the original maps came out, Ireland was going to be a substantial net loser from the way in which they were constructed.  If I recall what my colleagues told me at the time, that was for the simple reason that the officials in Europe who put this map together had forgotten that Ireland is a wet country.  We rebalanced things at the time and I am more comfortable in us engaging in that high-level role than engaging in an individual case-by-case submission.  Any farmer who wants to make an appeal can draw on the research we have, which is publicly available.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Boyle for his contribution.  I would like a steer on one issue.  Teagasc does a good deal of research, which is the potential for different uses of land.  I am interested in the further development of that research.  Research and development are the buzz words we hear everywhere.  I am conscious that much of the research that is done can prove the economic viability of a concept at a certain scale but commercialising that and making it a reality requires somebody to take it on, and usually it is left to the private sector to do that.  While farmers may have an interest in issues such as the work done on willow, miscanthus and different grasses, Professor Boyle is talking about developing a sector and not just developing an additional farm enterprise.  There is no point in growing this stuff unless it will be processed and brought to market somewhere and there is a clear track it can go down to ensure people can believe in it.</p><p>In respect of that, is there a gap there?  If there is, how can it be filled?  I understand it is not Teagasc&rsquo;s place to bring that to a conclusion.  However, how or where does Professor Boyle think that could be brought to a conclusion and where we could develop these trialled ideas as viable alternative sectors for farmers in many areas?</p></speech>

Pensions seem to be a large part of this, accounting for &euro;43 million.  Where does he see that figure going and how much will it be?  Does he feel, like many organisations do, that pensions will become a burden and affect Teagasc&rsquo;s capacity to expand its service?  It is an issue for the State.  Where does Professor Boyle feel that pension issue will come into play?</p><p>He replied regarding what happened at the Greenfield farm, County Kilkenny, during the severe weather events.  Media reports stated there were three Teagasc personnel, members of the Phelan family and an <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i>staff member to help on that occasion.  There was a significant labour issue.  How does having two members of staff overseeing 370 cows fit into a farming model when there is a crisis?  Few farmers could call on such expertise of that labour if they were in that crisis.  The lack of labour is a significant issue for the agricultural community.  How does this tie in with what happened in Greenfield and the recommendations about changes to animal housing and so forth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121100002#UU00300"><p>Deputy Martin Kenny raised an interesting question.  Unless research is used, it is useless.  Teagasc conducts research in both agriculture and food.  The most significant challenge we have is not so much doing the research but getting it adopted.  I have often spoken about two contrasting situations.  For example, there was the successful adoption of work we have done along with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, on the economic breeding index, EBI, for dairy.  I consider that to be one of the most successful pieces of research done in the history of agriculture in Ireland.  The beginning of that work goes back 20 years when there was a significant problem with fertility in the dairy herd.  That is almost resolved now.  Since then, we have also introduced genomic selection.  We are the second country in the world to do it.  A year ago, I asked my colleagues to put some economic numbers on this.  Conservatively, they reckon the benefit-cost ratio is 20:1.  The EBI has been going up year on year.  It is a simple index of the profitability of dairy production.  It is going up by the rate of &euro;10 a year.</p> <p>  What is interesting about that is the research is complex.  The head of research in Teagasc, Dr. Frank O'Mara, often says that when one looks under the bonnet. it is complicated and one closes it quickly.  The implementation is simple, however.  We will tell farmers to buy a combination of straws, spread their risks, look at the traits in which they are interested and whether the farmer is involved in liquid milk or manufacturing milk.  It is simple and then the advisory service comes in behind that.</p><p>On the other hand, although I am forever an optimist, I am disappointed in the uptake of some of the grassland work we have done.  It was a massive challenge to get farmers to adopt what are straightforward technologies.  We are working on that and have put in a lot of investment at both research and advisory levels.  The contrast is interesting.  It is probably fair to say that the science is not as involved on the grassland side as it is on the breeding side, yet the uptake has not been as good as we would have liked.  We have to look at how we can devise systems.  It is a whole-system approach when grassland is used optimally.  The farmer has to be linked in as regards his fertiliser and the grass seed company.  He has to be capable of measuring the grass and recording the information.  There are many elements to it and critical elements may not work well in the system.  We are looking at the measurement side at the moment to see if we can encourage companies or one-person operations to provide a service in grass measurement to farmers, creating a new market.  That would enable the information to be uploaded to the pasture database.  The advisory service could be brought in at that point.  Advice in the future will be database-led.  The advisor will not have to visit the farmer any more.  If the farmer has the information on a mobile phone, the advisor could be anywhere in the world and could look at the grass wedge and talk to the farmer about it.</p><p> Increasingly, we are going to have to think about the development of new systems of production.  One of the best examples going back a long time is in the mushroom industry, although it has had a lot of trouble more recently with Brexit and everything else and has changed utterly.  However, that industry was established purely out of research.  It did not exist before a concerted programme of research was put in place to create it.  In many respects, that is where we are now.  An area that is going to require that kind of system-wide thinking is the future development of the beef system.  In the past, there was greater integration between dairy and beef than there is now.  The quota intervened and created massive growth in beef.  We are going to have to examine how we can achieve greater integration.  It will be a challenge because it will not happen through the marketplace.  All of the pressures are the opposite there.  There is great opportunity for good beef-stock men in the growth of contract rearing of heifers and so on.  At the same time, there is a responsibility on all of us involved with the dairy sector to make sure the quality of calf produced can lead to a decent quality, valuable beef animal.  The market will not deliver that so there has to be some way of developing the system.  I could give other examples.  I have seen successful agroforestry development in other countries, which is a new system.  In the energy area, the greatest problem in much of the development is that there is no market.  The farmer learns how to use biomass to produce energy and then finds that the market does not exist or it highly volatile, and he goes out of business.  I am not sure what the answer is but the Deputy has identified an important issue in respect of robust agricultural systems can be created into the future.  There are both opportunities and challenges.</p><p> Senator Lombard referred to pensions.  We are a bit unusual in that the pension comes out of our grant-in-aid.  Officials in Departments do not worry about that because the payments come out of central funding, as is the case with many other public bodies.  Our pension is a pay-as-you-go system.  It operates on the same basis as the rest of the public sector in that the concern around pensions is a wider concern than just Teagasc.  Each year, we negotiate with our parent Department on our grant-in-aid for the following year.  It is not too difficult for us to forecast retirements and so on.  To date, the facts have been responded to appropriately.  However, there is a bigger issue around public sector pensions of which I am sure all the members are well aware.  In a different life, I certainly had some interest in that.</p><p> In the context of Greenfield farm, the Senator identified that there was a significant response on the day of the storm from a number of my colleagues.  The Senator mentioned the Phelans and so forth.  I would like to think that people in most parts of Ireland would club together in a crisis situation.  That is the nature of things.  The conditions were atrocious and that is one of the issues picked up on in the report.  People truly did go above and beyond the call of duty on the day - I know that phrase is sometimes misused.</p><p> The Senator raises a bigger issue in respect of the labour situation and the numbers of cows.  There is an acute labour situation on dairy farms.  For some reason and oddly enough, not as many issues arose in respect of the farms as was the case last year.  We took an initiative last year on foot of a request from the Minister to set up a group to examine the sourcing of labour within and outside the country.  One of the biggest problems, which is a fundamental flaw in the model, is that we cannot have untrained people working on dairy farms.  The challenge lies in recovering the cost of the training.  Teagasc provided a subvention in a small scheme last year.  We trained up people who were on unemployment assistance in a couple of colleges.  That cost us and we were not able to recover the cost subsequently.</p></speech>

It was disappointing.  We had looked at overseas as well.  On foot of our work on that committee, we got a change in the migrant worker permits but, again, the take-up has been very poor to date.  It is a slow burner.  Our research suggests that once a farmer has approximately 120 cows, there will be a labour situation in most cases.  Even at 120 cows, factoring in reasonable allowance for days off and so on, the farmer will need some casual labour support.  That is the difficulty.  There is a great opportunity.  We have done all the sums and there would probably be a couple of thousand jobs in it over the next four or five years.  There is also the issue of salary, however.  We will have 20 or 25 new managers graduating on Friday.  They will expect to get significantly above the minimum wage.  Not every farm can afford those kinds of wages.  I do not have an answer for the Senator.</p></speech>

Overruns in health expenditure have become a key issue and exercised the committee during its pre-budget discussion earlier this year.  In July 2018, the prospect of significant overruns in the health budget was flagged to the committee and became a key theme raised with the Minister for Finance at our summer meeting and in our interim report which was published in July.  Following budget 2019, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Parliamentary Budgetary Office highlighted expenditure management in the health service as a key fiscal risk.  The role of our committee is to monitor fiscal and budgetary risks and make recommendations on how budget scrutiny can be improved.  As such, we requested the attendance of officials from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss our difficulties in scrutinising the health Vote and its impact on broader fiscal and budgetary policy.  I welcome to the committee today Mr. Colm Desmond, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health, and acknowledge his agreement to attend at short notice to accommodate the committee's request.  I note that the committee had invited the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to contribute to the meeting but it declined the invitation.  This is something the committee finds regrettable and unacceptable.  The committee noted the lack of engagement by the Department and agreed to follow it up with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform at the earliest opportunity.  We have now done that.</p><p>I draw the attention of Mr. Desmond to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Mr. Desmond provided a statement on the issues before us to the Joint Committee on Health a few weeks ago.  I invite him to make a number of points to us before we discuss the matter further with him.</p></speech>

I welcome this opportunity to address the committee on budgetary control and oversight of health expenditure.  The committee has noted its concern at the level of persistent Supplementary Estimates in respect of the health Vote and commented on budgetary planning in this regard.  In any given year, the Government has a finite amount of money for allocation in the budget and has many competing priorities.  During the fiscal crisis, as with most areas of public spending, significant restrictions in health funding were experienced.  Including in 2014, the budget provided for health was less than that provided in the previous years with significant targeted savings through pay reductions and efficiency.</p> <p>  The first modest increase in the health Vote for a number of years came in 2015 but this was insufficient given the erosion of base funding during the financial emergency.  The once-off Supplementary Estimate that year was required to meet ongoing running costs in the sector, new initiatives commenced during the year and some demand-led services.  Thus, while 2016 saw a further budgetary increase, the majority of the funding merely met the existing costs within the system, along with pay rate increases.  In recognition of the difficulties facing the system, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved a further &euro;500 million for health in the Revised Estimates Volume and this sum remained in the base for 2017.  This allowed for services for older people to be maintained at the previous year's levels, which accounted for &euro;30 million, met shortfalls in the State Claims Agency and PCRS in the amount of &euro;200 million.  It further provided for a winter initiative at &euro;40 million that year.  Additional funding of &euro;450 million was provided in the 2017 budget, along with a further supplementary estimate of &euro;195 million.  Of the original funding, 39% was required for pay rate and pension costs with a further 6% supporting the State Claims Agency.  In relation to the Supplementary Estimate that year, 38% or &euro;75 million related to the acceleration of the restoration of pay under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, with a further 25% or &euro;50 million required for the State Claims Agency.</p> <p>  For 2018, the Government approved gross expenditure of &euro;15.332 billion for the health services, &euro;14.839 billion for current funding and &euro;493 million for capital funding, representing a 4.9% increase on the original Vote budget for 2017.  For 2018, 45% of the additional funding provided in the budget was required for pay restoration, resulting in very modest increase for services and the consequent need for a further Supplementary Estimate.  When account is taken of pay restoration, costs associated with the State Claims Agency and other demand-led areas, there is a reason for the level of increased expenditure year on year.  Furthermore, the nature of the health services is such that the normal budget management levers available to other sectors, such as reduction of services, are simply not available to us and consequently, overruns can and do occur.  External factors, such as the actions of private health insurers, can also drive the need for additional funding.  In his recent presentation of the 2018 Supplementary Estimate to the Select Committee on Health, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, welcomed the significant additional funding for the health sector in 2018 of &euro;655 million, of which &euro;625 million is towards overspends in current expenditure in various areas of the HSE.  The Minister of State acknowledged that while the amount of the Supplementary Estimate was significant, it represents less than 4.3% of overall health expenditure in 2018.  The Minister of State also noted that, despite the significant increases of recent years, the issue of health funding remains a major challenge, not just in Ireland but internationally.  Dealing with a growing and aging population, more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs, and the rising cost of health technology will continue to post a financial challenge into the future.</p> <p>  The annual health budget is set within the parameters set out by the Government in its approach to planning for the annual budget.  The improving economy has enabled the health service to achieve much needed budget increases in each of the last three years.  It is also clear that there are areas where further improvements are required and the Department will continue to work with the HSE to optimise service provision within the constraints of available funding.  Extensive planning and performance management processes are in place in relation to budget management and health sector planning.  The HSE publishes performance profiles on a quarterly basis and separate management data reports for each month.  There is a monthly performance management cycle both within the HSE, under its performance accountability framework and between the Department of Health and the HSE.  The HSE's performance and accountability framework operates under a national performance oversight group which has delegated authority from the Director General to scrutinise the performance of the health service provider organisations, in particular hospital groups, community healthcare organisations, the national ambulance service, primary care reimbursement service and other national services, to assess performance against the national service plan.</p> <p>  Despite welcome increases in the health budget over recent years, a financial challenge remains as we deal with a larger and older population with more acute health and social care requirements, increased demand for new and existing drugs and the rising costs of health technology.  The costs of payments under the State Claims Agency are also rising, adding to the overall cost of health above the operational costs funded to meet the health demands of a growing and aging population.  These challenges reinforce the need for good budgetary management and control, a focus on improving the way in which services are organised and delivered and on reducing costs, all of which aim to maximise the ability of the health service to respond to growing needs.</p></speech>

Most of it is going to the HSE regions and other health agencies.  The breakdown was pretty detailed.  It states that this was not to fund any additional activity but to maintain current levels.  If this is the case, if any of the additional allocation is due to an increase in unexpected demand, what performance indicators are being put in place in terms of outputs?  I imagine that demand in an acute hospital setting has knock-on effects throughout the system.  When the officials are calculating the figure for the Supplementary Estimate, do they take into account likely increases that may result in increased funding into one setting?  If it goes into an acute hospital setting, would it not likely also increase the number of inpatient and day case discharges?</p></speech>

It is certainly one of those areas, among others of which the Deputy will be aware, that have tended to overrun.  It is, therefore, considered both in its detailed components, as the Deputy has described, and in its overall composite form.  It is interrogated by the HSE centrally as part of the performance framework that I have described, and by the Department in its engagement with the HSE on whether a Supplementary Estimate should be sought.  It is on that basis that the performance indicators do indicate, when the service plan is established at the beginning of the year, what the likely evolution of spending will be.  However, it is not always the case that the various components of the acute sector, for example, can remain within that area, due to particular circumstances.  The winter issues and Storm Emma, for example, had a significant impact on the acute sector this year.</p></speech>

However, up to a week before the budget, we could not get an answer from the Ministers for Health or Public Expenditure and Reform on what the likely Supplementary Estimate would be.  Is there a reason they do not know?</p></speech>

Reporting cannot be simultaneous because of the scale of what is required in terms of compiling information from a diverse system such as the hospital system.  However, the Department and the HSE were aware and signalled relatively early in the year that there were pressures emerging.  From that point of view, I imagine the issue was more that a specific figure may not have been available at that point.</p></speech>

The HSE makes a request of the Department of Health, which engages with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  At the end of the process when the figure is set at a certain amount, can there still be a significant difference?</p></speech>

That gives an indication to all Departments of the scope for managing within the existing allocation and planning for the year ahead.  Planning for the budgetary allocation is guided by that from the beginning.  The HSE is invited to submit its bids and the Department and the HSE then engage in the late spring and summer period in a detailed manner, to interrogate the application by the HSE in all its different components right across all the sectors, including workforce, pensions, pay and so on.  Having interrogated the HSE thoroughly, the Department of Health will then engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  HSE officials are available to and participate on the detail with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials in respect of determining the basis upon which the demand stands.  They will usually arrive at a quantum, which is agreed to be the requirement for the health sector, or at least what the health sector, through the Minister and his officials, seeks from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As with all Departments, demand is invariably greater than what is available from the global amount available to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under his budgetary parameters.  It is, therefore, a question of discussion and negotiation in the period leading up to the budget as to how the Department's budget is allocated for the year.</p></speech>

It comes down to the dying days of budget preparation.  I have some small insight into that by virtue of the confidence and supply agreement.  Health always seems to be the last piece of the jigsaw.  There is extremely late contact between the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE in settling on the final figure.</p></speech>

It is a challenging budget for everyone to settle, not least for the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  I can reassure the Deputy that the engagement commences early on, takes place in parallel with all other Departments' engagements with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials, and is very detailed.  It is a significant range of programme areas and by its nature requires a fair degree of interrogation.  This year, it was well known that we had an emerging overrun which was significant.  That added to the level of detail that had to be engaged with.</p></speech>

Did the HSE through its request in spring-summer 2017 and right up to the eve of the budget in 2017 predict that it would need &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million extra, even on a standstill basis?  There has to be a reason this keeps happening in one Department.   How predictable was it?  Looking ahead to 2019, is it again the case that there is a large gulf between what the HSE is saying it needs to provide health services and what it has been given in the budget?</p></speech>

That will form the basis of the HSE's view on how it will spend the allocation that has provided by the Government.  In respect of 2018, we engage in regular monthly monitoring and performance support with the HSE right from the beginning of the year, as I described in my opening statement.</p><p>It stands to reason that we would monitor and take account of the evolution of the major spending areas in the HSE.  That is the process we have and it would signal to us that there are areas where there are pressure points.  Some of them are performance-related and some are outside our control, such as State claims and other such areas.</p></speech>

To put it another way, what is the gap between what the HSE asks for and what it ultimately receives in its budget?  I am trying to establish how predictable all of this is and whether it is going to happen year on year until we somehow manage to get the two to marry.</p></speech>

The 2018 budget was agreed in budget 2018 a year ago, and the health sector is required to manage within that.  Regrettably, that did not prove to be the case and that has been a feature in recent years, but for the varying reasons I set out in my statement.  It is a feature of an area that is under a fair degree of demographic pressure, although that is not a reason to fail to interrogate the reasons for that type of pressure.  It is also an area where there are other factors, such as pressure in disability, older persons and other areas that the Deputy will be aware of, which are clear from the demand throughout the health service.</p></speech>

One relates to the accounting and reporting dimensions of this.  With regard to the Exchequer returns, the fiscal monitor for the end of September shows that the overrun in health is approximately &euro;300 million yet the Supplementary Estimate at the end of the full year is &euro;655 million.  How is it that three quarters of the way through the year the reported deficit in health was approximately &euro;300 million, yet it ended up at more than double that figure for the full year, which only had three months left?  Somebody said to me that it was because the figures reported every month in the fiscal monitor or Exchequer returns are cash-based whereas in health bills are building up that are not yet paid.  Can Mr. Desmond outline exactly how that works?  We were hearing about a Supplementary Estimate of hundreds of millions of euro but when I cross-checked that with the Exchequer returns, I did not see the same scale, yet that is where it ended up.</p></speech>

There is, therefore, also be a time lag, which I described, in that what is reported in September may well have been slightly earlier.  There may have been a degree of delay in that.  It might be more useful if I could provide a more detailed paper on the different components of how that accountability and reporting operate.  I can provide that to the Deputy.  It was certainly a time lag in the programme areas.</p></speech>

As practising politicians, we are all aware of the pressures of the demographic changes that are happening and the consequent impact on nursing home care, care for the elderly, disability services and so forth.  There are extreme pressures.  Thankfully, people are living longer but that is having a direct impact.  To what extent are the figures the Department has for the next three to five-year horizon realistic and based on proper assessment of the demands that are known to exist over that time?</p></speech>

They are set firmly for the area of capital spending under the national development plan up to 2022, with 2023 to be firmed up.  There is quite an amount of planning ahead under the ten year plan.  Current expenditure is a little more difficult to project.  On the other hand, it also must take account of what is realistically available to us over the next period of time.  It would certainly be a factor when we look ahead over the period the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

He outlined in his presentation a number of interventions designed to assist the Department with budget management and health sector planning, including management data reports, performance profiles, performance accountability framework, a national performance oversight group and so forth.

For example, one cannot refuse demand in the primary care reimbursement service of the GMS, reimbursement for certain high-tech drugs and, as happened with the adverse weather last year, increased demand for emergency departments or other acute hospital beds.  All of these matters confer an entitlement on the health service user.

Mr. Desmond mentioned that this would be scrutinised live.  However, in primary care and other areas the money is spent before it comes before the review committee, which means the committee examines them after the fact.  </p></speech>

It is a very broad range of services provided across a very large budget every year.  Therefore, pressures will inevitably begin to emerge in a number of points during the year.  The HSE will indicate to the corresponding Department officials if it believes there are pressures emerging and that would become more definitive through the performance supporting process that I described.  There will be interrogation by the Department of the HSE and by HSE senior management of the different programme areas within the Health Service Executive, which cover a vast range of services, as to the basis upon which a particular budget is under pressure.  I would not like the Deputy to take the view that one area is treated more preferentially to another because we have not gone into the detail of each particular area to that extent.</p></speech>

The education sector is pretty complex, as is social protection given the range of schemes involved and the variations that occur all the time.  I imagine it would be hard to predict the social protection budget at the beginning of the year in terms of the number of people who will be in receipt of disability benefit and the number who will leave or join the live register.  Then there is the plethora of schemes that only few in this House really understand.  Despite this, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not experience the level of overruns that occur in the health sector.</p></speech>

These are complex Departments with complex budgets and challenges.  Mr. Desmond has acknowledged that the overruns in those Departments are not as significant as in the health sector, so we will park that.

To follow on from what my colleagues have said, there is a consistent overrun.  What accounts for that in health?</p></speech>

Apart from the acute area, there is primary care and community care and in the latter there is a lack of capacity.  Therefore, there is a great deal of pressure on the acute area.  All of these have individual budgeted areas and all these budgeted areas are managed within those component areas.  That brings a degree of complexity that we consider to be very challenging right across the health sector.  Perhaps that is a factor compared with the other Departments the Deputy mentioned but, in fairness, I could not comment on those Departments.</p></speech>

I have brought him back to the point where he does not know that for sure and is surmising that it may be the case.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for the latitude I have been given.  We would have always thought that the big supplementary budgets for health are caused by a drain in one particular area, for example, the drugs scheme, hospital beds or primary care, but the drilling down that the Parliamentary Budget Office has done suggests that the Supplementary Estimate required this year is spread pretty evenly across the entire health system.  It is about 5% across health and there is no big chunk of additional funding being provided to one area as opposed to other areas.  What does that tell us?</p></speech>

We have identified some areas of the budget, such as the mental health budget of close to &euro;900 million this year and has not needed additional funding.  However, the disability area, home care packages, the acute area and corporate in the HSE have required additional funding.  There are, however, other areas that have not required it.  Perhaps I have not fully understood the Deputy's point but the additional requirement is spread widely across the health sector but not that widely, if I could put it like that.</p></speech>

To set it in a slightly longer context - I made this point earlier in our discussion on another issue - if we take a 15 to 20-year perspective, the health budget in 2000, including both private and public health spend, was about &euro;6.4 billion.  It is hard to believe the scale of the jump but it had increased in 2007 to &euro;15.7 billion.  In 2013, which is when Mr. Desmond's analysis started, even though, as he said, there had been a significant curtailment of the budget arising from pay and other restrictions, health expenditure stood at &euro;18.4 billion.  The Estimate for this year indicates the health budget will be the guts of &euro;21 billion if we include the Revised Estimate at the end of the year.  In terms of the correlation between spending and outcome, we were not starting from a low base when Mr. Desmond started his analysis in 2013, but from a base which had dramatically increased in the previous ten or 15 years.  There had been a very large increase in spending.  It was not as if spending had reverted to the 2000 level or anything close to that.  It is important to point that out because this committee is concerned about the effective spending of public funds.</p><p>One could say that all the problems arose because there was a contraction in the 2013 budget, for pay rates and services.  However that contraction was in the context of significant increases in the budgets of the previous ten to 15 years.  Does Mr. Desmond understand the point I am trying to make?  Does he think that timeline has any relevance?  How did we survive in the year 2000 on a budget of &euro;6.5 billion? </p></speech>

The figures I quoted in my opening statement are the public spending figures.  In the years prior to 2013, I think there had been tight budgets in the years immediately up to that year, because the fiscal changes had begun to hit in 2010 and 2011.  </p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that it is a significant increase during a period of time, but it may well be that the cost of services are a factor and we would have to look at international comparative figures to see whether we were particularly out of sync in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.293" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018121100002#J00200"><p>That is very true.  I was looking briefly at the statistics in terms of a drawing a comparison on spending <i>per capita</i>between Ireland and the OECD.  Spending <i>per capita</i>is the best way to draw comparisons because spending as a percentage of GDP is a distorted figure because of the nature of Ireland's GDP.  When one looks at spending <i>per capita</i>, my understanding is that we are one third above the OECD average and seventh highest in the OECD at &euro;4,706 per annum.  Is that a fair assessment of where we are placed on the international comparators?</p></speech>

Within that there can be quite significant variations in how spending is measured compared to other countries.  There is the perennial issue of whether spending on social care should be included.  We are including social care, whereas it may not be within the health sector in other societies.  Also there is the question of whether that is a factor.  There are within that particular areas which are difficult, such as the number of doctors per population which is considerably lower in Ireland and the number of beds per population is lower yet we have a significant acute budget.  There are issues in terms of the emergency department and other pressures that may be contributing.</p></speech>

While Mr. Desmond cites that we are being challenged by demographics in terms of an increasing population, the reality is that in comparison with other European countries, we have a much younger population profile, which should see us having a much lower health spend, the bulk of health spending comes in the latter years and therefore countries which we are comparing ourselves against have a much higher percentage.  Given our very low number of doctors<i>per capita</i>, our very high spend and our very low youth age <i>per capita</i>, the figures would point one to question why we have a policy problem in how we are spending our money.</p></speech>

I agree there are issues in respect of the analysis but it is a comparison that is difficult to judge and bears a good deal more research.</p> <p>  There is a general overall demographic increase due to population increase.  We are seeing the aging population beginning to have an impact on the overall budget and it will not decrease.  We are also seeing very high occupancy within the hospital system and upwards of 94% occupancy compared to 77% in other European member states.  We have significant pressure there due to the lack of appropriate community and primary care services which might relieve that.  There are a number of factors that might complicate the analysis.</p></speech>

Mr. Desmond mentioned the State claims, demographics and so.  If we needed to introduce a Supplementary Estimate because we were increasing our capital expenditure to address some of what are undoubted critical shortfalls in our system, one would say we were on the right path, but if we are just plugging the gap and not actually seeing capital expenditure kick in, that raises concerns.</p></speech>

In the next ten years, and the process has started with the national development plan, we have &euro;10.9 billion to spend.  We have a lot of planning to do to get into place for the second half of the national development plan.  The capital element is entirely recognised as something that needs significant attention and the Department of Health and the HSE are gearing up for that.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Ryan that the capital infrastructure investment has not been at the level it should have been in recent years.   </p></speech>

However, due to other commitments some of the members could not remain.</p> <p>  I have some questions and comments.  I begin by thanking Mr. Desmond for coming before us and showing respect for the work of our committee unlike the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  In October 2018, the Government announced a new budget oversight group to be established which will include officials from the aforementioned Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who think therefore they should not come before our committee, which is interesting because they will be involved in the budget oversight group, as well as the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  The purpose of the new body is to monitor and control health spending and staffing within budget allocation.  </p> <p>  I wish to put a number of points to Mr. Desmond, which tie directly into the 2018 national service plan.  There was a financial challenge of &euro;347 million at the beginning of 2018.  How much of the savings were achieved to address the financial challenge and to what extent is the Supplementary Estimate for 2018 a result of not meeting that financial challenge?  Mr. Desmond mentioned the work plan for 2019; will there be a financial challenge in 2019?  If there is, and allowing for the historic inability to meet that challenge over many years, is the Department effectively conceding that any mention of a financial challenge in that 2019 plan is effectively the announcement of what will crystallise as a Supplementary Estimate for 2019?</p></speech>

That is the position we are in at this point.</p></speech>

Where does the overrun come from?  Deputy Lahart was referring to the 5%.  Having looked at the figures, the one most remarkable, consistent strategic management by the Department is its ability to overrun in the various sections of the budget to exactly the same amount.  The overrun in HSE Dublin and mid-Leinster is 5%; HSE Dublin North East is 5%; HSE South is 5%; HSE West is 5%; grants to health bodies is 5% and building and equipment is 5%; and, there is a blip in what is a small subhead on the payments to State Claims Agency, which is 17%.</p><p>It seems to indicate a consistent disregard of trying to reach target with 5% overruns on every one of those areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Desmond" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018121100002#K00200"><p>Without looking at the detail of those, there is no doubt that, as I explained in the opening statement, given the base from which they were starting, budgets were challenged for many years.  With the demographic demand that started to appear roughly in parallel, it led to the view that coming close to meeting the budget was considered acceptable performance.  That is obviously not acceptable in any circumstance.  With significantly increased resources we believe these need to be managed within the overall allocation.  The Fiscal Advisory Council considers that a hard budget constraint, for example.  We need to continue to consider how such resources can be managed more effectively.  If the trend is there, the trend merits examination.  That is part of the performance and accountability process and the financial examination process I described.  The Chairman has reasonably identified that issue, which will be a key issue for the HSE in 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-11a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1310" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018121100002#K00300"><p>It certainly is a key issue.  I appreciate it may sometimes be unfair to take one line from an opening statement, but I have a real problem with it.  Mr Desmond said: &ldquo;Furthermore, the nature of the health services is such that the normal budget management levers available to other sectors, such as reduction of services, are simply not available to us and consequently, overruns can and do occur.&rdquo;  People from other Departments would probably like to be able to use such a line.  It seems the health services can manage within a budget if they choose to.  With such a consistent overrun across so many areas, it strikes me that the operating practice was just to manage the fact that there would be an overrun.  The normal type of operational management structures were not in place.</p> <p>  In the context of the Department of Health versus other Departments, it had differences of 1%, 2%, 4% or whatever.  Let us consider the heavy hitters.  The health area had an overrun of &euro;655 million.  The next biggest heavy hitting Department is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection with an overrun of &euro;139 million.  That Department&rsquo;s budget is &euro;10.62 billion; the budget for the Department of Health is &euro;14.871 billion.  There is a major difference there.  The overrun for the Department of Education and Skills is &euro;181 million.  While one can juggle around on 1%, 4% or whatever, it is a very substantial overrun.</p> <p>  It seems to occur due to a complete lack of ability to control or predict expenditure accurately.  In the early part of the year the expenditure overrun seems to be relatively modest.  It then seems to go out of control in the latter part of the year.  If that only happened once, one might believe that something just went wrong there, but it happens almost every year.  In some of the tables I saw almost the exact same pattern of lack of control in four consecutive years.  Surely somebody is capable of making the decision to redo how that expenditure is dealt with.</p></speech>

It is of serious concern for the health sector.  It is a complex sector with very mixed quality of data available and very mixed quality of financial and other systems to assist us in our job.  All of these issues contribute to ascertaining where the funds are actually spent and in the manner in which they are spent.  It varies considerably across the services.  The structures to monitor expenditure and to keep it under control are far from being perfect.  Nobody would disagree that the matter requires serious consideration.</p> <p>  I explained earlier that we need to move to continuous monitoring to a greater extent.  That would actually yield us the information and the control that we need as soon as it manifests itself.  We hope having integrated care organisations in a more decentralised structure will mean that management will be more accountable.  That can only be of benefit to us.  It will mean that financial problems should be addressed rather than being passed up with someone saying: "Here is another thing that we can't deal with.  You'll have to deal with it."  We hope giving that degree of scope to local organisations in an integrated structure will assist in the level of responsibility and, in fairness, the level of capacity that would be accorded to managing budgets there.</p> <p>  The Chairman also mentioned -----</p></speech>

It certainly should facilitate the best budgetary management we can get.  It is a journey, in fairness.  We would hope it is part of a widescale financial reform within the HSE.</p></speech>

I borrow an analogy that is used about speed limits in this country.  They are supposed to be guidance as to where one should stop and not a target to aim for, because if one aims for the target, one will overshoot.  Without that mindset change irrespective of how big the health budget becomes, the existing management structure will end up overrunning by 5% because it is almost inherent in how things have been done to date.  I hope that change in thinking permeates right down to the delivery of the service.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the time and I need to draw proceedings to a conclusion.  I thank Mr. Desmond for the time he has given the committee and for the answers he gave to all the members.  It has been a very informative exchange.</p></speech>

I will take the opportunity to speak on the section.  A number of amendments were ruled out of order.  One of them was tabled by Deputy Cowen and one was tabled by me.  The amendment related to a cohort of public servants who would be excluded under the legislation, particularly those who are working under the circular at present.  The policy adviser in my office met with the Minister of State's officials and I thank the officials for providing us with the explanation.  It was quite a detailed explanation of the reason they are being excluded.  Has the Minister of State examined it to try to address those anomalies on Report Stage?  If he has not, that is fair enough but has he given it further consideration?  A small cohort of people who are currently working under a circular will not benefit from this legislation.</p></speech>

The amendment tabled by the Deputy has been ruled out of order but I appreciate the concern he has raised and for whom he raised it.  When considering the amendments we sought the advice of the Attorney General.  Unfortunately, it is not something that can be facilitated.  In devising the interim arrangement it was necessary to respect the current legislative provision that these individuals were required to retire at 65 years of age.  They did so and received their pension benefits.</p><p>The interim arrangements were established to offer a limited temporary solution to individuals who reached the age of 65 in the period between the Government decision of 5 December and the commencement date of the necessary legislation.  If the arrangements had not been in existence, this cohort of people would not have been able to continue working.</p><p> Not to labour the point, we are very anxious that we would have a conclusion and draw a line under this.  The sooner we can get this enabling legislation enacted, the sooner any others who could wind up in that interim arrangement will be facilitated by the passage of the Bill.  I know the committee is aware, through my officials, that there are many complicating factors in regard to people who have already started to draw down their pensions and those who have retired but who did not avail of the interim arrangements because they were told this was only an interim arrangement.  On the basis of the legal advice we have received, and having reflected on the amendments, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has decided to proceed with the original decision of 5 December last year, which was that the interim arrangement would stand pending the enabling of this legislation, and we would move forward on that basis.</p></speech>

We have a later amendment which pre-empts the Minister's decision with a view to preparing a report.  When this was published in December last year, there was an expectation on the part of many that they would be able to avail of an interim measure.  Yet, one year later, it has not been enacted and the light has been turned out for a whole cohort of people who had an expectation.  While I acknowledge the amendments as proposed may be a charge on the State, we are asking that the Minister would prepare a remedy or a suite of measures that might be possible within a few months, in light of the acknowledgment of the commitment that was made this time last year but, unfortunately, was not acted upon in time through enabling legislation.  We ask that there would be some procedure for those caught in that bind.</p></speech>

That is why I am appreciative of the fact the committee has met today and that we will try to get Report Stage finished next week.  We do not want a situation where it slips into January and another group of people who will retire at the end of December find themselves in the same situation.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, sends his apologies that he cannot be present.  It was made clear at the time, as everybody would accept, that the interim arrangements were just that - interim - until such time as we had enabling legislation enacted.  I go back to my previous point.  There is a group of people who, in recent months, did not avail of the interim arrangements because of what was said at the time, namely, that they were just interim arrangements.  If we are now proposing to reverse engines, where does that leave those who did not avail of the interim arrangements, where does it leave the pension contributions that have been paid, where does it leave Revenue and where does it leave those people's point on the scale?  There are many questions.</p> <p>  To be fair, the Deputies have engaged on this.  We will discuss Deputy Cowen's amendment later.  The Minister is prepared to accept in principle the suggestion that Deputy Cowen has made but, in doing so, to point out that this may require legislative remedies.</p></speech>

One was that some of those public sector workers may not have been re-hired in the role they were in and they may be in new roles.  The second was that some of those workers no longer pay into the old pension scheme and, if they resumed employment on a permanent basis at the old salary scale they had left, then a new pension scheme would have to be put in place.  The Minister of State might clarify if that is the case.  The third reason was that if public sector workers were simply given the option of resuming work until the age of 70 under the same terms and conditions as exist under the current interim arrangements, they would receive significantly less in salary compared to workers who are turning  65.  The argument was put forward that it is a principle of pay equality.  I find this a bit strange, given we have no problem with 60,000 post-2011 entrants earning less than their colleagues for equivalent work.  I do not agree with that reason, which I think is a bit of a red herring.  With regard to the first two reasons, do we know the number of public sector workers under the circular who are in the roles they were in when they reached 65 and the number who have started new roles?</p></speech>

I do not disagree with the Deputy in regard to the length of time it has taken.  I appreciate that we are being facilitated today.  I accept it has gone on too long.  The Bill was published in July and, unfortunately, we got to this situation due to the fact we do not order the business in the House for Second Stage.  We are here to try to get this completed as soon as possible, notwithstanding the legitimate concerns that have been raised and the pre-existing commitments given when the Bill was published and when the Government decision was made last December in regard to those who entered into the interim arrangements, which were well understood.</p> <p>  As important, if not more important, there is the position of those who did not enter into the interim arrangements because they were told they were just interim arrangements.  Given the number of people who retire on an annual basis, it would be desperately unfair to rewind and say we will now have to reopen the whole thing, which would be one of the remedies we would have to consider.  The Bill would then be in a very difficult position and we would probably not be able to carry it forward.  All of that new cohort of people who, from 1 January, are hoping to be able to avail of this will not be able to avail of it.  That is the bind we are in.</p> <p>  I will come to Deputy Cowen's suggestion when his amendment is raised.  We are prepared to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within three months, or whatever is agreed on Committee Stage, to see how this is working.  However, to do that may require legislative remedies which we cannot pre-empt at present.</p></speech>

When one looks at it from the point of view of the individual, we are not forcing people to retire if they want to continue to work, and so on.  However, it does take place in a social context, and that is the social context of attacks on pensions and cuts in pensions over years.  What starts out as something voluntary, and in this case voluntary and with the agreement of the Minister, can over time morph into something that becomes the norm.  The fact people are living longer and healthier lives just goes to become a benefit for the employer, as opposed to people having a long and healthy retirement.  If it would lead to guarantees of decent pensions and so on, that is fair enough.</p><p>I would be interested to hear the responses of Deputy O'Brien and the Minister to that point.  The social context is the flipside of that.  Maybe it is a broader question.  Has the Minister done any studies on it?  If the option of working until the age of 70, rather than 75, were taken up by large numbers of public servants, what impact would that have on recruitment?  We are talking about jobs that could go to people who are entering the workforce.  Has any sort of impact study been done on that?</p></speech>

In this case, the new section 3A(3) sets out a number of policies and principles to guide the Minister, such as "evidence of an increase in normal life expectancy in the State", "the pensionable age applicable at the time " and "the likely cost (if any) to the Exchequer".  In addition, the maximum age of 75 is included in order to further assist the Minister in the exercise of his power.  I have taken advice on this matter and I am satisfied that the policies and principles provided for in the new section 3A(3) are sufficient to guide the Minister in the exercise of that power.  We do not want to be contradictory as we do this.  We do not want to say how many new jobs we are going to prohibit because the economy is expanding, the population is expanding and the public service is expanding.  I remind the committee that this is a public service Bill.  The employer here is the State.  As I said to Deputy O'Brien, we need an age.  We cannot leave it open-ended.  In that context, the Government does not have a difficulty with Deputy O'Brien's suggestion.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reviewed this issue in its Review of Barriers to Extended Participation in Public Service Workforce report, which was published in November of last year.  The report in question analysed the arguments in favour of and against the proposed extension in the four key areas of performance management, skills renewal, human resources issues and savings.  Although the report identifies some downsides to this proposal, for example in terms of new recruits, it focuses on some of the positives in areas like the retention of skills.  Obviously, there is a cost if people are working longer.  There is a need for continuous professional development.  The report mentions the impact that this proposal would have on other legislation.  It emphasises that grievance procedures are age-proofed and stuff like that.  This report is available.</p></speech>

The Minister's decision on amendment No. 2, in my name, was pre-empted by the amendment being disallowed on the basis that it would impose a charge on the State.  This amendment proposes that a report be laid before the Oireachtas within three months to highlight and analyse the options that may be available to correct the unfairness I have mentioned, to set out the potential costs to the Exchequer of such an approach and to clarify whether there are any potential administrative barriers to addressing this issue, as mentioned earlier.  I think such a report would allow us to be in a much more informed position than we are at present.</p></speech>

This system is in place to ensure continuity of teaching provision throughout the school year and to limit any classroom disruption.  Deputies will accept that this is of particular relevance for students preparing for State examinations.  This arrangement is currently provided for in various pension schemes in the education sector.  The Bill, as currently drafted, does not allow the continuation of this arrangement.  The Government has agreed, on the recommendation of the Minister for Education and Skills, that this arrangement should be maintained in the context of the new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Amendments to sections 4 and 5 of the Bill are being proposed in that regard.  An amendment to section 4 is required to ensure any service rendered by affected staff in the period between their 70th birthday and their retirement at the end of the school or academic year will be reckonable for pension purposes.  An amendment to section 5 is required to ensure that a statutory instrument or public service pension scheme which provides for a compulsory retirement age will be read as meaning the age of 70 for relevant public servants or, in the case of certain relevant public servants in the education sector, the end of the school or academic year in which they reach that age.  Both provisions are limited to public service pension schemes made or approved by the Minister for Education and Skills with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

This is necessary in order for the treatment of the additional superannuation contribution to comply with the understanding reached with the public service unions in the context of the 2018-20 public service stability agreement, which was that the treatment of the additional superannuation contribution would mirror the treatment of the pension-related deduction.  An amendment of the Long Title of the Bill is required to take account of the amendment to the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 in relation to the additional superannuation contribution, and this is provided for in amendment No. 12.</p></speech>
