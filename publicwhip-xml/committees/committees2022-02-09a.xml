He will make an opening statement and members will then be free to ask questions if they wish.  I remind members to turn off their phones and advise them that, while they are entitled to absolute privilege while on the grounds of the Houses, they may be entitled to only limited privilege if they are not participating directly from Leinster House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#A00400"><p>The CSO is Ireland's national statistical institute and is responsible for the production, co-ordination and qualitative oversight of official statistics for Ireland.  The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service, under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO under the Statistics Act 1993.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.  The role of the director general of the CSO, as prescribed by the Statistics Act 1993, provides that the officeholder act independently and exercise sole responsibility in professional statistical matters.</p> <p>  EU legislation introduced in 2015 fundamentally changed the role of national statistical institutes throughout the Union.  Following the enactment of this legislation, the director general of the CSO now has responsibility for co-ordinating and overseeing the quality of all European official statistics in Ireland.  It is thus the responsibility of the CSO to ensure that all compilers of European statistics in Ireland adhere to the quality and methodological standards set out by the EU and detailed in the European statistics code of practice.  Under the terms of the Statistics Act 1993, the director general may request any public authority to consult and co-operate with him or her for the purpose of assessing the potential of records as a source of statistical information.  In addition, the Act stipulates that a public authority shall consult with the director general where it intends to introduce, revise or extend the retrieval of information or make a statistical survey.</p> <p>  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions - EUROSTAT and the European Central Bank, ECB, primarily - the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN's fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.  Indeed, the CSO will undergo a review of its alignment with these standards in February 2022 known as a EUROSTAT peer review.  The review process forms part of the European statistical system strategy to monitor the implementation of the code of practice.  The objective of such reviews is to consider the compliance of members with the code of practice to ensure the implementation of the common quality framework underpinning European statistics and to help the statistical authorities to further improve and develop their national statistical systems.  The reviews cover all the member states of the EU and the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, as well as EUROSTAT.  The CSO will be assessed under the 16 principles of the European statistics code of practice.  The outcome of the peer review will be a set of recommendations to assist the CSO to further improve and develop the Irish statistical system.</p> <p>  The CSO plays a vital role in the functioning of the State in providing independent and verifiable data to citizens and policymakers on a broad range of topics including social, economic and environmental issues.  The ability of the CSO to inform has been evident throughout the pandemic.  It delivered on the vast majority of the planned statistical work programme for 2021, publishing 439 releases and publications.  Of these, 40 were new products providing insight into issues as varied as the business impact of Brexit on SMEs, productivity in Ireland in the period 2010 to 2019, the rental sector in Ireland and ecosystem accounts.</p> <p>  The CSO has continued to publish a series of new surveys, outputs and formats to capture the evolution of Ireland's economy and society since the Covid-19 outbreak.  Alongside the new products developed and delivered to provide additional insight, the CSO has provided statistical and analytical expertise and new data services to support the analysis of health data sources in a safe and secure environment.  The CSO has continued to supported epidemiological modelling, analysis of both health and real-time data, and analysis to provide insight regarding trends and identifying emerging issues, all to support central government's response to the pandemic.</p> <p>  The planned 2021 census of population was deferred because of the Covid-19 pandemic and will now take place on 3 April 2022.  The publicity campaign for the ten-week live-census field operation will commence with a launch on 3 March and cover all media channels, informing people about the census and their obligations and encouraging responses.  The delivery of forms to the public will commence at the end of February, with all forms expected to be collected before the end of May.  The processing of the forms will begin immediately on receipt and is expected to run until the end of December.  A preliminary population count will be released before the end of June.  The CSO is making every effort to ensure that the census being undertaken will be comprehensive, inclusive and safe and will provide valuable and accurate data for our country in the years ahead.</p> <p>  The CSO has developed a significant new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland.  The survey involves the collection of highly sensitive personal data from householders in a manner that is confidential, ethical and designed to support accurate and reliable survey results.  Achieving an appropriate sample, ensuring confidentiality and offering appropriate supports to participating householders and CSO staff are all key priorities.  A pilot survey was conducted between April and June 2021, which has informed arrangements for the formal survey, the field operation of which is planned to commence in June 2022 and run until November.</p> <p>  Work is progressing on the data collection and processing of the next wave of the State's longitudinal study of children and youth, Growing Up in Ireland, from 2023.  A questionnaire for the pilot survey of the 25-year-old cohort will go into the field in April or May 2022.  Planning is under way to return face-to-face collection at airports and ports, which ceased in March 2020.</p> <p>  The household budget survey, which was delayed because of its requirement for in-household interaction with a CSO field interviewer, will go into the field later this year, surveying all members of a sampled household on their expenditure.  Data collected from this survey are used for many purposes but are now required to re-weight the consumer price index.  The CSO has also continued to develop new interactive graphics and infographics, new formats such as bulletins and frontier series, and outputs to provide the additional insight needed by the public, businesses and policymakers both on the impact of the pandemic and across more general social, economic and environmental issues.  The CSO produced 189 press releases and 127 infographics in 2021 to support understanding of the data and provide insight for citizens, businesses and policymakers alike.</p> <p>  The CSO has continued to publish key economic indicators and tracked the impact of the crisis on business sectors and the economy via monthly exports and imports of goods, the quarterly national accounts, government deficit and debt, the quarterly balance of payments, the labour force survey, the monthly unemployment and live register, the survey on income and living conditions, births, deaths and population estimates, the consumer price index and the harmonised index of consumer prices, the wholesale price index, monthly industrial production and turnover, and the retail sales index, among others. </p> <p>  Being both trustworthy and confidential are core strategic values for the CSO.  Security is embedded in its culture.  Significant attention and awareness are allocated to the protection of CSO data and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.  Continuing development of the organisation's security capability is ongoing.  A series of both practical and tactical measures are being implemented to militate against cyberattacks.  These include, but are not limited to, security reviews, annual cyber training, continuous strengthening of data governance and the ongoing deployment of new technology security initiatives throughout the organisation.</p> <p>  As Ireland continues to move out of the pandemic, the CSO will provide necessary insights into how our economy and society is reacting and progressing.  It is crucial that the office has sustainable, secure access to data and can reuse high value data sources in the form of administrative data and some private data sources to provide timely and accurate data that are meaningful to policymakers.</p><p>The quality of data is crucial and the CSO is driving the building of national data infrastructure and the use of unique identifiers such as the personal public service number, PPSN, Eircode postcodes and business identifiers to ensure that data throughout the Civil Service and public service is collected, managed and shared efficiently and effectively.  This work will support the Civil Service renewal action plan themes of digital first and embedding innovation and evidence-informed policy and services.</p><p> The CSO has the unique expertise to support and deliver on both these themes within the office and across the Civil Service.  This will build on the quality of data across the data ecosystem, which will support the delivery of official statistics and deliver insights for the creation and evaluation of policy.</p><p> The office is also embarking on a digital transformation journey, enabling it to modernise and provide for the capability to meet increasing Government, business and citizen expectations for digital services.  A digital first census forms the centrepiece, enabling the citizen to complete future censuses of population online.  The office has obtained &euro;1.5 million from the national recovery and resilience plan for the development of an online platform for data collection.  This funding will assist with the planning and implementation of the digital census programme of work on a multi-annual basis.  The CSO has acquired this funding for five years to a total value of more than &euro;9 million.</p><p> Turning to the office's budget, the net allocation for 2022 is &euro;103.485 million.  The increase in 2022 reflects the cyclical impact of CSO&rsquo;s activities, primarily for the additional staff required for the 2022 census.  This census of population includes an uplift in census headquarter staff plus provision for more than 5,500 temporary staff, who are required to distribute and collect the census forms.</p><p> Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues, as demonstrated by more than 23 million web hits on the CSO website and more than 19 million hits on PXStat in 2021.</p><p> The funding provided reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the CSO to meet its obligations under national and EU law, continue to develop the Irish statistical system, deliver a census of population and produce new outputs to meet domestics demand through the provision of trusted and robust official statistics.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#B00300"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it as teacht os comhair an choiste.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, NISRA, being the statistical body in the North.  The Minister of State mentioned the work he is doing with regard to businesses, etc., and the economy.  It obviously comprises the information in the North and the CSO is a southern equivalent.  I am aware that funding was allocated as part of the national development plan, NDP, for shared island projects.  I am interested to know if there are any plans for closer integration of the work of these two statistical agencies.  We are an all-island economy and having access to all-island data that is comparable is important.  It should be accessible to everyone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#B00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  As she mentioned, it is a very pertinent question.  There is strong collaboration and linkage between the CSO and NISRA and there is ongoing engagement around that.  There is also planning in progress around certain parameters that are provided in terms of statistics.  We can send the Deputy a detailed note on the nature of that collaboration.  As she said, it is important from an all-island perspective that we have strong links between both bodies, North and South.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#B00500"><p>That would definitely be of interest.  With regard to the census, will it contain any additional questions that might be pandemic-related?  It will be an interesting census to look back on in years to come given the changes people have gone through over the past few years.  Will there be questions on the increase in people working from home or anything else that could be pandemic-related?</p> <p>  I am also interested in any change to the religion options.  Previously there were options for different religions and "No religion" in the responses.  Will there be an option to select "Atheist" or "Agnostic"?  The Minister of State might give more detail on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#B00600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, detailed preparations went into the census.  It was finalised prior to 2019 before we knew about Covid-19, which we have heard much about it since.  Obviously, to have a robust system underpinning the questionnaire and developing the statistical framework is important.  The pandemic intercepted the census last year so it was not possible to integrate questions around the pandemic specifically.  We can supply census forms to the committee, which might be useful in order that members will be able to see the exact type of questionnaire.  We want to get good engagement from the political system to promote the census and getting maximum participation is crucial to reflect our population.  We can give the Deputy detail on that.</p> <p>  She asked a question on religion.  There is a variety of questions.  The nature in which they are set out was developed with strong project governance that was set in 2019.  Now that we are going to see the issuing of those forms, we can send the committee the detail of the census forms and the nature of questions.  It is in our collective interest to ensure that people engage and participate in it in a way that allows us, as policymakers, to respond to the needs of our population. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#B00700"><p>Yes, absolutely.  I understand that it was done before Covid-19 hit us.  It is unfortunate, in a way, because I think it would be interesting to see those different changes happened as a result reflected.  Many people will look back in years to come at this particular census.</p> <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that Benefacts is a provider of high-quality data to the CSO.  It was raised in the Committee of Public Accounts and other places that it looks like it will be closing.  It provides information on the non-profit sector here.  It is my understanding that its data is relied on by the CSO and without it, there would be a significant gap in the ability to prepare the national accounts.  Has the CSO raised any concerns with the Minister of State about the upcoming closure of Benefacts and the end of the provision of that information to the office?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#B00800"><p>I am aware of the issue around Benefacts, which has been raised in the D&aacute;il.  I have been informed by the CSO that it is interested in a replacement and in the data.  I am aware that another Department within government is considering that work at the moment.  The CSO is anxious that all data sources are live, active and updated.  I believe another Department is considering that at the moment.</p></speech>

If possible, could the Minister of State give a little bit of clarification on something he said this morning whereby there would be an open consultation process and that the project is going back to tender?</p></speech>

Obviously, the two tenders failed in that we did not get a supplier in that process.  There is active engagement now with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, to find an appropriate structure to do that work.  The plan is that they will happen in parallel.</p></speech>

A detailed briefing document for each of these Votes has been supplied to the committee in advance.  I will focus on the work of my Department in light of the proposed 2022 Estimate and touch on the proposed 2022 Estimate allocations for the President&rsquo;s Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in some of these offices, they operate independently of my Department.</p><p>On Vote 1, the Estimate for the President's Establishment is &euro;4.75 million.  This includes just over &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians' bounty.</p><p>On Vote 3, the Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;33.29 million.  Of this, &euro;14.31 million relates to staff costs and &euro;2.78 million is allocated to the Law Reform Commission.  A new subhead for the consolidation and revision of planning legislation has been allocated &euro;12 million.</p><p>The Estimate for Vote 5, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is &euro;47.83 million.  This provides &euro;19.32 million in administration and pay, an increase of &euro;2.1 million on 2021.  Some &euro;16.5 million has been allocated for fees to counsel and &euro;8.2 million to fund the local State solicitor service.</p><p>For Vote 6,<b></b>the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office Estimate for 2022 is &euro;49.66 million, the bulk of which relates to salaries and administration.  A provision of just over &euro;22.9 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred.</p><p>The Estimate for my Department, Vote 2, is just over &euro;38 million.  Almost 62% of that relates to staff and administration.  The remaining almost &euro;15 million provides funding for Covid-19 public communications, the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the National Economic and Social Council and several independent inquiries.  My Department will continue its role in providing, co-ordinating and overseeing a whole-of-government focus on the response to Covid-19 over the coming period.  A whole-of-government approach to the management of the pandemic over the past two years has been critical to our current position and our recovery.  A comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed Covid-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences.  This will help to ensure we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or other similar type emergency arrives.  We are considering what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p><p><i></i>We know the capacity to have a public health response that is agile and flexible, with an ability to pivot rapidly and respond to any emerging threat, is critical.  We have much to build on in terms of our achievements in disease surveillance, ICT infrastructure and vaccination programmes, all of which expanded rapidly over the past two years.</p><p>Our vaccination programme is one of the best globally.  Over 93% of the Irish population above the age of 12 is now fully vaccinated.  In total, more than 10 million vaccines have been administered since vaccination began in late 2020.  More than 2.7 million booster doses have now been administered and the vaccination programme continues.  In the European Centre for Disease Prevention data, Ireland is ranked fourth in Europe in terms of the population aged over 18 to have received a booster vaccination and has the sixth lowest overall mortality rate out of the 27 countries in the EU plus the UK.  Nevertheless, while continuing to monitor the disease situation and the downstream impacts of the pandemic, we must also use this time to assess learnings and mainstream the changes we need.  We need a public health response that is sustainable and flexible and has the capacity to surge in response to future pandemic threats.  We are also working to ensure a flexible and robust vaccine delivery system is in place for any future needs.</p><p>As it has throughout the pandemic, the Government has taken extensive and unprecedented measures to support workers and businesses.  In excess of &euro;20 billion in direct supports have been provided to date, which places us as among the most generous within the EU.  This includes approximately &euro;9 billion for the pandemic unemployment payment and a further &euro;9 billion through the employment wage subsidy scheme and its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme.</p><p>While we continue to manage the impact of the pandemic on the labour market, we have seen positive developments.  Last December, the Covid-adjusted unemployment rate stood at 7.5%, down from 21.7% in December 2020.  The overall level of employment reached a record high in quarter 3 of 2021, rising to almost 2.5 million people in work.  This is a record number in employment.  The Department of Finance has estimated a general Government deficit of approximately &euro;9 billion or 4% of national income for 2021, following higher than expected tax returns in the second half of the year. </p><p>Of course, the pandemic is not over but our management of it is changing and that will continue to evolve to deal with the ongoing impacts and to respond to any fresh threats.  Through the Cabinet committee structures, we will continue to assess longer term impacts and responses across public services.  My Department will also continue, for as long as is necessary, to co-ordinate communications for the whole-of-government response to the pandemic, keeping the public informed about current public health advice, vaccination and booster programmes, and economic and other supports.  Clear and consistent communications across national and regional press, national and local radio, digital display, social media, television and online video have been a core focus of the pandemic response from the beginning.  Those Covid-19 public information campaigns will continue to ensure we reach all those who are relying on information, guidance and advice to underpin our recovery.</p><p>As we continue to live with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is important as a people that we pause and reflect, take time to remember those who have lost their lives and pay tribute to everyone who has contributed to how we have faced and are facing the challenges together.  The public holiday to be held on 18 March is in recognition of the efforts of the public, volunteers and front-line workers during the Covid-19 pandemic and in remembrance of those who lost their lives during that time.  A national day of remembrance and reflection is also planned for 20<sup></sup>March to reflect the experiences of all those who have suffered loss during the pandemic.</p><p>The 2021 economic recovery plan, which was published last June, is being progressed through the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  The plan sets out renewed supports, investments and policies for a new stage of economic recovery and transition, with an overarching ambition of 2.5 million people in work, which will now be achieved by the end of the year, well in advance of what was originally set out in the plan.  It is helping to drive a jobs-rich recovery and will support the economy in transitioning towards a decarbonised and digital economy.  As part of the plan, a new artificial intelligence, AI, strategy was launched in July, and in the past week a new digital strategy, Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework, has been published.</p><p>The Irish economy, like many other advanced economies, is, as we know, also experiencing a surge of inflation driven by supply chain difficulties and rising energy costs.  Unfortunately, this is a global phenomenon.  The Government is examining a number of ways to alleviate pressures on people from the rising cost of living.</p><p>Like all sectors, housing and construction have been impacted by the pandemic.  The housing crisis will take time to resolve and the strong economy will mean continued pressure on prices and rents in the short term.  It is a priority for the Government and for my Department.  My Department chairs the Housing for All delivery group of Secretaries General and provides the secretariat.  There are three subgroups, each chaired by a Secretary General.  These are working on three key areas: investment, industry capability and public service delivery.  The Housing for All Plan is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State and contains a range of actions and measures to ensure more than 300,000 new homes are built by 2030.  This figure includes 90,000 social, 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes.  Last week, the Government published the second quarterly progress report for quarter 4 2021.  It shows significant progress towards the fundamental reform of the housing system, setting the course to increase the supply of housing significantly and provide a sustainable housing system into the future.</p><p> The end of January marked two years since Brexit, a process that started almost six years ago with the referendum in the UK in June 2016.  Throughout that period, Brexit has remained a key focus of Government.  I want to place on the record the importance of engaged cross-party support in the Oireachtas for the Government&rsquo;s key objectives and approach to safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the context of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  Officials in my Department were deeply involved in the negotiations and the preparation for Ireland&rsquo;s national response.</p><p> While Brexit has brought ongoing disruption, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, together with the withdrawal agreement including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, means that Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives in the Brexit negotiations were achieved.  In particular, these agreements ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process and include: avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland; facilitating the maintenance of the common travel area; enshrining the best possible outcome, given UK choices, for trade and the economy, notably tariff- and quota-free trade with the UK; protecting Ireland&rsquo;s place in the Single Market and the Single Market itself; and ensuring fair competition and a level playing field for Irish businesses.</p><p> The Government has worked hard to support businesses exposed to the British market to prepare and continues to do so.  I pay tribute to the effort that so many businesses have made to diversify markets, make supply chains more resilient and adapt where necessary.  Our work on the implementation of the protocol will continue.  The EU has listened closely to concerns in Northern Ireland and is working in good faith to minimise friction.  The current talks between the EU and the UK must be given every chance to succeed.  The Commission has put forward serious proposals which directly address the concerns about outstanding issues on implementation of the protocol.  Our joint focus should be on achieving positive progress.  We remain confident that solutions exist within the parameters of the protocol for the issues that have arisen.</p><p> I am deeply concerned about recent developments in Northern Ireland and the resignation of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, First Minister, Paul Givan.  I have consistently stated that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should not be undermined and that politicians from all sides should respect this.  I urge the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid any action that could damage peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</p><p> The Government&rsquo;s shared island initiative is progressing on an ambitious and whole-of-government basis and through all-island partnerships with the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government, and local authorities and civil society across the island.  The shared island unit established in my Department in 2020 acts as a driver and co-ordinator of this whole-of-government initiative.  The Government allocated &euro;50 million from the fund in 2021 to move ahead with key cross-Border investments, including new phases of the Ulster Canal, the Narrow Water bridge project and a major new North-South research programme delivered by the Higher Education Authority.</p><p> We are also continuing the shared island dialogue series to foster deeper civic engagement on how we can work across all communities in practical meaningful ways for a shared future.  In 2021, there was participation by over 1,000 civic representatives across all regions, communities and sectors in eight events.  In-person and regional events will be convened during 2022 as part of the series, now that this is possible.  A comprehensive research programme is also under way, working with the ESRI, the National Economic and Social Council, Irish Research Council and other partners on publishing a stream of high-quality work through this year, to inform discussions and engagement by all communities and traditions on the island on the opportunities of our shared future.  </p><p> Since assuming our seat at the start of 2021, Ireland has played an active role on the UN Security Council.  Together with Norway, we successfully led efforts to secure the renewal of the mandate for cross-border delivery of humanitarian assistance in Syria.  We are closely involved in work on women, peace and security, and on upholding the Iran nuclear deal.  At the September UN meeting, I spoke about the urgent need for a concerted multilateral response to climate change involving all organs of the UN.  A key theme of the Irish presidency of the Security Council was the link between climate and security.  Climate change is a major contributor to unrest across Africa and the developing world.  Some 80% of UN peacekeepers are deployed in countries that are most exposed to climate change.  Ireland, along with 60 other countries, is an active member of the wider group of friends on climate and security work.  The Government is determined to continue to play its part on integrating climate-related security risks into the work we do to prevent conflict and build peace.</p><p> My Department supports whole-of-government efforts to combat poverty and disadvantage, improve the position of vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, promote diversity and inclusion, tackle inequality in all its forms and provide ongoing support to children and families.  Through the work of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, we are overseeing implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, equality and public services, including matters relating to justice, policing reform and community safety.  The Cabinet committee receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers the implementation of commitments and reforms.  The Government is due to publish its new strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence next month.  The Cabinet sub-committee will be responsible for its implementation.  The strategy will be underpinned by clear actions, timelines for reforms and robust accountability mechanisms, including a delivery board, to ensure that all organisations deliver on their obligations under the new strategy.</p><p> We will continue to support the work to build stronger and safer communities through reforms in policing and community safety, including oversight roles in the implementation of A Policing Service for the Future, the piloting of the local community safety partnerships and the Dublin north-east inner city initiative.  There are also pilots of local community safety partnerships in Waterford city and county and Longford county.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a human rights unit and established the strategic human rights advisory committee.  The Government will continue to implement the reform programmes outlined in A Policing Service for the Future.</p><p> Through the work of the Cabinet committee on health, we will continue our investment in an expanded public health service and embed the lessons learned in the pandemic into community and primary care services.  2022 will see the biggest ever investment in the health system in order to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, reduce waiting lists, increase capacity, protect the most vulnerable and address inequalities.</p><p> The Government is committed to building a world-class education system from early years to higher and further education.  Through the work of the Cabinet committee on education, we are overseeing major reforms to the funding model for early learning and childcare services, the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for higher level education, and the development of a new ten-year strategy for adult literacy, numeracy, and digital skills.  We will work through the National Economic and Social Council and other new engagement structures to ensure that a full range of views can input into the development of economic and social policy.</p><p> Tackling climate change and transitioning to a climate-neutral economy remains a key focus of this Government.  My Department plays an important role in driving implementation of our ambitious climate agenda, including by co-chairing the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change and reporting on the implementation of the Climate Action Plan 2021.  That plan is the latest in a suite of measures introduced by this Government to fundamentally alter our approach to climate change.  Our new climate legislation, carbon budgets and annual climate action plans provide for clear targets, actions and accountability.  This puts climate action at the heart of all of Government&rsquo;s plans and policies over the next decade and beyond.</p><p> The Government has agreed to establish two citizens&rsquo; assemblies to run concurrently.  One will be on biodiversity and will examine how the State can improve its response to the issue of biodiversity loss.  The other will consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.  It is also our intention to set up a citizens' assembly on drugs later this year.  A resolution setting out the terms of reference for these assemblies will be put forward to the Oireachtas for its approval.</p><p> Provision is made in the Revised Estimate for a number of independent inquiries, including the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan commission and the Cooke commission.  The estimated cost of the Cregan commission to date is &euro;11 million and the cost for the Cooke commission it is approximately &euro;3.9 million.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates with Deputies.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is before us today and as he is the chair of the Civil Service accountability board, I thought it was important to ask him about that.  However, he said that the board has not met since 2016.</p> <p>  Some &euro;15 million was spent on Covid-19 communications.  We do not have a full figure-breakdown of the number of public communication campaigns etc. that have resulted in that amount.  We are all aware that a lot of money would have been spent on Covid-19 communications; that is clear.  I would like to see greater detail and a breakdown of what the spending was on campaigns, including spending on private media organisations compared with the State broadcaster, and if any external PR companies were hired to assist in this.  If external companies were used, did they go through a competitive procurement process?  We know that did not happen in some cases during Covid-19 because of the nature of the pandemic.  Does the Taoiseach have that information?</p></speech>

The Office of Government Procurement runs a procurement process for media buying and contracts are put in place from which Departments and Government offices can draw down.  When the Office of Government Procurement runs various campaign advertisements, the Department of the Taoiseach liaises closely with it on all matters relating to public procurement.  It has procedures in place.  It monitors all areas of expenditure.</p> <p>  On the question the Deputy asked, there were about 68 separate public information-campaigns in 2021 under the Covid heading, with campaigns using a combination of national and regional press, national and local radio, digital display, social media, television and online video.  Campaigns provided, as the Deputy knows, information on public health measures that were in place at different stages of the pandemic.  In addition, a wide range of business, social welfare and community supports had to be advertised and communicated.  There were also targeted initiatives such as the #Antiviral campaign, which was a Covid-19 communications campaign that was designed by and for young people, allowing them to share their experiences of the pandemic while reinforcing key public-health guidance.  There was also the RSVP campaign, which we used more recently.  It encouraged people to be risk aware and assisted them in assessing the relevant riskiness of activities, and it supported them to take steps to mitigate the risk of contracting and transmitting Covid.</p> <p>  The total Covid spend in 2021 was &euro;12.1 million.  The breakdown shows, more or less, an even split across national and regional media outlets.  The Department will continue to co-ordinate this throughout 2022.  As I said, the oversight is provided by the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

The programme for Government has identified a number of citizens' assemblies that we have committed to, including on a Dublin mayor, biodiversity and drugs.  We are committing to one on drugs in the latter part of this year, with education.</p> <p>  I will give my view on a citizens' assembly in terms of the island of Ireland.  The shared island unit is a worthwhile initiative that, without prejudice to the constitutional situation, allows us to engage with civic society on the island on a range of issues outside the constitutional question, including on biodiversity, climate change, health, education, infrastructure and so forth.  On the research area, we have had a successful subscription to the idea of joint research projects North and South.  Some &euro;40 million will be allocated to joint research initiatives between researchers in the Republic and researchers in Northern Ireland to which there has been a great response.</p> <p>  On the constitutional issue, having been involved in this area all my life, and since I became a Deputy, my view is that I am not convinced the future evolution of the island and relationships on the island can be resolved through a citizens' assembly.  Rather, I believe it takes the painstaking engagement of people to people, the building of relationships, and that requires a lot of detailed work.  It can take weekends.  It requires constant engagement with all traditions and people from all backgrounds.  It is consuming but it is necessary.  We have all been on a journey of understanding in regard to Northern Ireland; I certainly have been since I became a Deputy and, indeed, before then.  I honestly can say that the best insights I got were from talking to people who I perceived had completely opposite views and different perspectives to me.  I met them at weekend gatherings organised by facilitators where we learned more about their backgrounds and issues.</p><p>I did it through the British-Irish Association.  During the 1990s and the early 2000s in particular, it did invaluable work in drawing people from different backgrounds together.  Those weekend meetings were held in Cambridge or Oxford alternately.  I attended a reconciliation event in Ballycastle at which I meet 12 public representatives from the unionist and loyalist tradition to get a greater understanding.</p><p> The Deputy is speaking about a citizens' assembly in terms of designing the structures.  To be honest, from a republican perspective, it really is about people engaging on a constant basis.  This is what will enable us to develop and evolve beyond the Good Friday Agreement into a meaningful accommodation.  This is what I believe.  I am not yet clear in my head that a citizens' assembly can accommodate this.</p></speech>

This is something on which I have engaged.  I have taken part in the type of weekend meetings the Taoiseach described.  It is very important to have engagement and to speak to people from different backgrounds who have different points of view and different lived realities.  This is extremely important.  It is something I would in no way want to diminish.  This work is something on which we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been very active for a long period.</p> <p>  What I am saying with regard to a national citizens' assembly is that the conversation in respect of our future has progressed.  I do not mean just among the people in this room who deal with politics every day; I am talking about people who, before Brexit and Covid, never necessarily had that much of a thought about or interest in the constitutional future, but it has become far more of a daily reality for them.  People do bring this up and they do discuss this.  I am not just speaking about people who have had strong points of view previously.  The idea of a national citizens' assembly would be to move the conversation on and have a forum for people to have these conversations.  The idea of a national citizens' assembly would be that people from all backgrounds and all perspectives would be able to come together and have this conversation.  We all know that the only way we can move forward in any capacity is through conversations.  I agree with the Taoiseach on this.  There is a role for a national citizens' assembly in this regard.</p></speech>

I am not sure that all traditions would come to a citizens' assembly with this as the agenda item.  Even on the shared island initiative political unionism have not engaged.  To be fair, it has not put any obstacles in its way either or has not campaigned or articulated against it.  Civic society in Northern Ireland from all persuasions has engaged in the dialogue, which has been very valuable.  Projects are progressing.  Funding is being allocated to sensible projects that can bring benefits to people North and South.  There is a considerable distance to go before we are at that stage.  It is not about simply convening a citizens' assembly; it is about the participation required to make it meaningful.</p></speech>

For the Taoiseach, is it about the timing of a national citizens' assembly rather than a national citizens' assembly in general?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#Q00500"><p>It is about the mechanism.  The fundamental point I offer, and I am open to engaging in further discussion, is that the alternative route I suggested is better.  It is a longer route but a more engaging one.  A citizens' assembly in itself will not facilitate constantly meeting and engaging with people in a short period of time.  Think of all of the work that went into the Good Friday Agreement, even the constitutional framework that emerged from the Good Friday Agreement such as the need to amend Articles 2 and 3 in the Republic and changes to the Government of Ireland Act.  It involved the British Government, the Irish Government and the unionist, nationalist and republican and loyalist parties in Northern Ireland.  It took enormous work for years to get to the stage we ultimately got to.  I was a backbencher for part of it.  I was a Minister for the concluding parts of the Good Friday Agreement.  Perhaps I am influenced by the experience that it took that length of time and engagement to sound people out in order to identify what would be possible and not possible.  A citizens' assembly is a different type of mechanism and I am not clear it lends itself to the type of work that was required for the Good Friday Agreement and the advances made prior to the agreement.  I hope this explains where I am coming from.</p></speech>

He accepts the Good Friday Agreement is a legally binding agreement on the Irish and British Governments and parts of it are judicially reviewable, does he not?</p></speech>

That part of the Good Friday Agreement is also judicially reviewable.  Is this not the case?</p></speech>

In the most recent opinion poll, 51% of people in the North said that they want a referendum within five years.  I would not dare to extrapolate that this would mean 51% would support it.  Some will want a referendum for different reasons.  Support for Irish unity has been growing, particularly among younger demographic groups.  The point I am making is that the transition to a new type of Ireland is outside of the hands of politicians, including the Taoiseach or whoever holds his office or whoever is Prime Minister of Britain.  We have all agreed and signed up to it being up to the people North and South in two referendums.  The courts could force the Secretary of State to trigger the mechanism in the Good Friday Agreement if the courts believed the terms of it were reached.  We could have a situation in four or five years where we have a series of opinion polls that show more support for Irish unity and, therefore, somebody would go to the courts and we would have a referendum.  Is this possible in the Taoiseach's view?</p></speech>

Ultimately, politicians will have to work out the future of this island.  If we go back over the 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement, for half its lifetime the institutions have been down for one reason or another.  This is problematic and illustrates the need for people to work the institutions in the first instance and to try to get normal politics applied within the institutions.  They have never really been given a chance for any long period to do things the people want done on bread and butter issues such as housing and health.  I remember George Mitchell talking about what he expected to see when he brought his son to the assembly.  He said he expected to see the normal toing and froing of politics.  This has not quite happened with the Good Friday Agreement, and this needs to be reflected upon.</p> <p>  There have been various polls and surveys.  My view is that of Wolfe Tone, namely, that there is not a reconciled people.  We have a lot of work to do on this.  I said that an immediate border poll at the time of Brexit would have been counterproductive.  We can see what is happening, in my view unfairly, with regard to the protocol and its impact.  I believe the protocol is advantageous for the entire island, including Northern Ireland.  We can see how certain people have elevated it to a constitutional level to which it should never have been elevated.</p><p>That would be my response to that.  </p></speech>

I agree with the Taoiseach's view concerning the dialogue and engagement that must happen to ensure any referendum and any transition that would take place in the future would be as smooth and seamless as possible at that point in time.  That is an important but different point.</p> <p>  In a conversation with a former Secretary of State when we raised these issues with him at the time, he made the point that if he was to call a border poll under the Good Friday Agreement, he could be judicially reviewed and the courts could find him in breach of an international agreement.  The point I am making is that the opposite can happen.  We could have a situation where the courts find that the Secretary of State is acting against the Good Friday Agreement because the desire could be there and represented and there would be a breach of the Good Friday Agreement in respect of not triggering the poll.  He pointed to opinion polls as an indicator.  The problem is that we need to have the preparation work done and part of that involves engagements and discussions that need to happen among all of us who believe in a new and shared island.</p> <p>  Part of that work needs to involve a separate work about an understanding for those of us who believe in a new Ireland regarding what our taxation system will look like, what our new health system will look like and how the transition of the Six Counties to the EU will take place, as is already allowed for by the EU.  What will the economy look like?  What will a new constitution look like?  How will the identities and traditions of 1 million people who identify themselves as British or unionist not just be recognised but cherished on a new island?  All of these tricky and sensitive questions must be asked and they cannot be asked just in terms of building relations.  They must be asked formally.  This is why it is really important regardless of whatever mechanism we find such as a Green Paper, a constitutional convention, a new Ireland forum or an all-party committee to thrash those issues.</p> <p>  There is a real danger because of the momentum that is growing, and discussion is really rampant concerning the question of unity, that a referendum takes place and, from my point of view, is won and the people of the North and South agree to constitutional change and a new Ireland but we have not done the work we should have done.  We have always made it very clear that it is this work that needs to begin immediately.  The discussion leading up to the referendum is crucial, just as it was in the Scottish referendum.  Opinion polls can vary.  They can go up and down as we saw in the last election.  Those supportive of Scottish independence failed to achieve above the mid-30s before the debate on Scottish independence happened.  We know the result of the referendum, which was very close.  The debate is really important - not just in terms of winning hearts and minds but reassuring those who are not in any way supportive of the idea of Irish unity.  I think every political party believes there will be a referendum.  Does the Taoiseach believe there will be a referendum on the constitutional change in the next ten years?  Does he see this as a possibility?  If so, when do we start that other type of work in terms of what we think are the changes that would be required?  This needs to be as inclusive as possible while recognising that some people may not be up for that discussion at this point in time.  Others will, including some unionists.</p></speech>

What is very interesting in the current discussions around the protocol is that nobody has told me they do not want to have continued access to the European Single Market, which is significant notwithstanding all the objections and opposition to the protocol.  My genuine view at the time of Brexit was that it was the wrong time to draw up a border poll.  We had our views on that.  My view was that it would put people into the trenches and people would have strong views either way.</p> <p>  Probably one of the most important developments in my lifetime was the New Ireland Forum.  I was not in politics at the time.  I would have been an observer of politics.  What the forum did to some extent was bring constitutional nationalism together to work out the best options for a unitary state.  Options included joint sovereignty.  We heard Margaret Thatcher say no, no, no to all three options.  In retrospect, it was a good exercise.</p> <p>  The other one I thought was important was the Opsahl Commission which went through a range of scenarios regarding how to demilitarise the North.  That was well in advance of the peace process.  I do understand that point.  The question is whether we do it in the Republic and just have our own rethink about where we are.  What does that do?  What impact does that have on unionism, loyalism and other traditions such as the new Irish?  There is a centre ground view in the North.  I think Andrew Trimble said on that programme that he sees himself as Northern Irish, so the Deputy is right in talking about all the traditions because there are many of them.  I just do not think one would get buy-in to that in a citizens' assembly.  Perhaps there is a case to be made for political opinion in the Republic.  What do we mean?  What are we talking about?  One thing we do need to reflect on are the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  </p> <p>  It seems we are in a very difficult space.  Again, the institutions have been pulled down - wrongly, in my view.  I think this is undermining the institutions in terms of public esteem and people's buy-in to those institutions.  Whatever happens in the future must be grounded in the Good Friday Agreement foundations, which are three sets of relationships.  They are that the British-Irish relationship would continue regardless of whatever evolution takes place.  Other factors include the North-South relationship, the two traditions plus new traditions and parity of esteem between traditions.  In my view, devolution in the North will be here for quite a while and should be engaged in.  The Executive is another factor.  These are only observations.  I accept that these things need to be talked through but the issue is whether we do it in the most inclusive way possible or we do it just in the context of the Republic for the moment.</p></speech>

The problem is that if one believes the only way we can have these conversations is when everybody is included and political unionism is at the table, that is not likely to happen in the short term because unionism, by its nature, believes in the union, which is a legitimate view held by leaders of unionism who worked alongside Sinn F&eacute;in in better times and recognised the legitimate views of nationalists, republicans and Governments in the South.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments.  I think there is further thought in this other than just figuring out the structure.  The structure is not the important part of it.  The important part is a discussion so that we are not talking to ourselves but instead are talking together and trying to figure out the best way to go forward because there is tricky work to be done.  I agree with the Taoiseach's point.  Some of the heavy lifting has been done by the Good Friday Agreement because many of the issues were resolved in terms of parity of esteem and equality.  Those fundamental principles in the Good Friday Agreement will outlast any constitutional change or decision in a referendum.</p></speech>

I am not sure of the next time it will meet.  The Taoiseach reiterated that the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will be fully utilised to bring dedicated focus to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, to ensure oversight of the issue from his Department and that he would take a role in this.  Has the Taoiseach allocated any budget or resources to this new oversight function for the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence to the Cabinet committee that is now charged with bringing forward that focused view?  Can the Taoiseach let us know when it is next to meet?</p></speech>

On the funding that has been provided, while I do not have an estimate or the exact figures, funding will not be an issue on this question.

It is sharp in the public focus right now, following a series of attacks, which have occurred in recent days.  The committee will meet in March.  I suspect that it will meet again in April with the publication of the strategy.  We also want to deal with issues to do with the accommodation question in the interim period.</p></speech>

This is because I think this will turn out to be an unprecedented time for actual delivery on issues that, unfortunately, have been around for a long time and with which the previous Oireachtas could not deal.

It appears that there was an announcement of an investigation because what happened was completely and utterly wrong and because it hurt many victims at that time.</p> <p>  We are dealing with the Estimates here.  If the Secretary General has spent a part of his time over the past year and a half investigating this matter, there will be a cost to that, just as would be the case if we were to put in a freedom of information, FOI, request to look for documentation.  It would tell us that we would have to pay &euro;300, because the FOI will take up however many of a person's hours.  Can the Taoiseach inform this committee, as part of the Estimates, how many man-hours or how many work hours has the Secretary General  put into this investigation?  How many people and documents were scanned as the output - which is part of the Estimates process as well - has happened over the past year and a half? </p></speech>

We have to work hard to maintain those relationships, notwithstanding the challenges and tensions that may arise from time to time.  Brexit has created significant challenges to that relationship.

We believe that it would be very damaging indeed if the British Government were to pursue this.  There is, as the Deputy knows, a mechanism in the agreement and in the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has engaged in that process and on that specific issue with his counterparts, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and the political parties in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  There was a meeting on 24 June.  Following that meeting, the Government joined with the British Government and with the Northern Ireland parties in a process of intensive engagement on these issues.  Discussions began in July.  We have said that the victims must come first.  I think that the Deputy would agree with that.</p></speech>

As for the relationship between Britain and Ireland, that relationship has reversed significantly in recent times.  Britain actually started to take unilateral decisions with regards the relationship between the two countries.  It would not be unusual for a participant of an agreement to state that they would seek to uphold that agreement up to the point of even using the courts to do that.  It would send a strong message to the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday, of Ballymurphy, of the Springhill massacre, as well as the victims related to Operation Greenwich, following the report that was reached yesterday.  At this juncture, a strong message to the British Government is needed to state there is a line that cannot be crossed when it comes to upholding the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

Most polls show that a majority of people of the North support the protocol or could live with the protocol.  The DUP is a minority party and unionism is now a minority political view in the North.  I believe the DUP has put itself in a strategic cul-de-sac at the moment.  At every juncture of Brexit, it has misstepped.  It now finds itself in the past ten days pulling down Stormont, playing its trump card, which is its last card.  The British response yesterday was just to say it would implement the Irish language Act.  I do not believe the Irish language Act should be politicised in anyway in this entire process.  It was interesting that in a debate in Westminster yesterday, Ian Paisley Jnr. basically said the Tories had no real interest in the North.  He said they were an English nationalist party, more interested in the red wall than in the border on the Irish Sea.  The DUP has created this situation.</p> <p>  I welcome that the Taoiseach said that no party should pull down Stormont on the basis of its own political agenda.  I fully agree with that.  If we allow Stormont to be pulled down by one single party in the future, is that not a recipe for dysfunction?  It is actually undemocratic because there is a majority in favour of the Irish language Act in Stormont.  There is a majority in favour of the protocol in Stormont.  Do we not now need Stormont to be reformed?  The rules of the institution itself need to move beyond where Stormont is at the moment.  Even if there is an election in May, there is a serious likelihood that the DUP will not participate in the Executive.  We cannot put ourselves into a two- or three-year hiatus when 44,000 people are on waiting lists for houses in the North, 250,000 people are in poverty and another 250,000 people are waiting for hospital beds for more than a year.  Surely the Irish and British Governments now have a responsibility to rewrite the rules of Stormont.</p></speech>

The DUP represents a very important constituency.  It represents people of particular views in Northern Ireland.  That needs to be respected as we must respect the UUP and the views it represents.  Notwithstanding that we might disagree with some of the policies the parties might present, we need to respect that they have electoral mandates.</p> <p>  If there is to be broad community-based faith in the elections of the institutions, the results of the elections must be accepted on all sides.  That part of it must be fulfilled.  The Deputy has raised broader points that are valid regarding how it is operating.  The First Minister's office and the deputy First Minister's office of course are two equal offices.  Issues have surfaced over how business gets done and the role of other parties, and those issues are worthy of discussion.  There can be no equivocation.  There must be an election and whatever way the votes fall we have existing agreements and everybody who has signed up to those agreements should adhere to those, accept the result and take up their roles in the institutions.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that no institutions should be taken down for political reasons.  As I said earlier, I believe they have been down for half of the lifetime of the Good Friday Agreement.  There is an enormous difference between the esteem in which the Scottish assembly is held among Scottish people and the position in Northern Ireland based on surveys carried out.  Based on my experience of having been in the North during one election recently, they do not like abstentionism; they want their politicians to do things for them in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  They want people to work them.</p></speech>

I understand that the North now has the ability to institute a corporation tax and potentially to equalise that rate with the South, which obviously would be a massive boon for the development of the economy in the North and would be a step forward in taxation equalisation on both parts of the island.  Have there been any discussions with the Department of Finance in the North on that?  What is the position of the Irish Government and the Department of Finance in the North on excise duty and minimum pricing on alcohol?</p></speech>

There are challenges with movement over how to make up the revenue foregone.  I will check with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to see if there have been any discussions between the two Departments of Finance and the two Ministers in respect of corporation tax.  I understand there have been discussions on the minimum pricing of alcohol between the two Ministers for Health; I can get clarification on that.  Again, that would need to come through the Executive.</p> <p>  Suffice it to say, the Oireachtas passed the legislation on minimum pricing for alcohol almost unanimously.  We did it for public health reasons.  It was done in Scotland first.  The results in Scotland appear to have been beneficial for public health.  I take the point that the optimal way to do it is on an all-island basis.  We would like the Northern Ireland Executive to implement it when it can.  Obviously, now it is not in a position to do that because the Executive is no longer in place.</p></speech>

Under which Department will they take place?</p></speech>

That means taking on board all the issues the Deputy has outlined.  We need to learn how we have managed Covid-19 and whether we could have done it better.  What lessons can be learned from our experience over the past two years in dealing with a global pandemic, which was the first in 100 years?  That would mean we would be in a better and stronger position if another pandemic or emergency arose.</p> <p>  The Minister for Health has established a public health reform expert advisory group.  It will focus on identifying lessons from the public health components of the response to Covid-19 with a view to strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness.  We are not just talking about hospital capacity, etc., but also the Sentinel system within the GP network.</p> <p>  We have doubled the workforce of public health doctors and support staff.  For the first time ever, we have brought consultants into the public health area, which had been denied public health doctors for a long time.  We need to get the public health side right because that should be the first line of response to any new pandemic.  The key players on Covid-19 need to be at the wheel even still because we need to monitor what is happening with Omicron and where we go towards the middle of the year.</p><p>There will be a meeting of the Cabinet committee dealing with Covid-19 shortly to assess where we are right now.  The key players are the leadership of the HSE and our leadership in public health.</p><p> The model I envisage will draw on different disciplines in the first instance.  They would consider the different phases of the pandemic, and what happened in nursing homes would come under the first phase remit.  We would have to set ourselves terms of reference, indices and how we compared internationally.  I wanted to keep the key players working in the field, so to speak, during the pandemic, so we have not yet settled on a model.  I have ideas in how to progress it and at the next meeting of the Covid-19 committee we will discuss the best model.</p></speech>

Do not get me wrong, as I understand that governance in this period was extremely difficult.  The issue was live and it was very hard to make decisions, as information may not have been fully at the disposal of the Government.  There is much information coming out now on the massive increase in domestic violence that occurred, in part, because of the restrictions and the length of their imposition.  There was also the cancellation of cancer care and consequences for diagnoses, as well as the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of BreastCheck appointments.  There were difficulties for the mental health of younger people especially.  In the first quarter of 2021, only one country in the whole of Europe had stopped building homes, and that was Ireland, despite it probably having one of the worst housing crises in the whole of Europe.</p> <p>  There is a necessity for a real investigation into this.  I am not looking for heads or individuals to lose their ability to do their jobs.  It is really important, nonetheless, with the benefit of hindsight and understanding of the real costs, to measure them against the necessity to protect against a live virus and conduct a robust investigation into what happened.  In nursing homes, 10,000 people were moved from hospital beds to nursing homes in the first six months of 2020 and many of them were never tested for Covid-19.  The nursing home sector sought to close its doors to visitors in March and April 2020 but the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, said the doors to visitors should be kept open for visitors to circulate in hospitals.  The HSE took personal protective equipment and staff away from nursing homes in 2020 when those nursing homes were crying out for staff.</p> <p>  A range of decisions were made that had a significant impact on the health and well-being of individuals and we need more than an analysis of that.  We need to be able to have a proper, detailed, forensic understanding of those decisions and the impact they had to ensure we do not repeat them.</p></speech>

To me, the fundamental objective was always to save lives and people from becoming severely ill.  We also wanted to protect our health services from being overwhelmed.  The mortality question is important, and as I said in my opening address, we have the sixth-lowest mortality rate in that respect in Europe.  We counted almost everything when it came to Covid-19 deaths and our data are very comprehensive.</p> <p>  We were very conscious of many of those matters throughout the pandemic.  The Deputy mentioned domestic violence and mental health.  I do not want to go back over old issues but on one occasion we were accused of differing from the NPHET opinion.  At that meeting there were presentations from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on well-being and mental health, and all of that informed our view of the time.  I have remained very concerned about mental health and particularly the impact on young people through the pandemic.  The effect on domestic violence, for example, was not unknown to us and it would have been reported to Covid-19 committee meetings that during the first lockdown, domestic violence rates increased.</p> <p>  These were very difficult decisions of life and death in deciding whether to lock down.  I was very concerned about construction but we must remember where the alpha variant had us.  That alpha wave was the worst moment of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it really stretched us.  It was a variant that ran through us and we did not have vaccination to protect us.  In hindsight we tend to look at things differently.  I genuinely believe the absolute game-changing nature of vaccines has not been fully appreciated.  I can look back at the Alpha wave and we did not have vaccines so people were getting very sick and dying.  This time around, with the Omicron variant, we were vaccinated and doing far more socialisation even before Christmas than the previous Christmas but hospital beds were not filling up to the same extent.  The vaccine story is the key to what happened in 2021 and how we go out of this.</p> <p>  There should a robust inquiry and evaluation of this.  I use the word "evaluation" because I do not want future public officials - or private sector personnel who worked very well with us - looking over their shoulders.  The Irish Business and Employers' Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were very good on the return to work process and we saw some really good collaboration.  We needed decision makers and for people to take decisions in the middle of a crisis like a pandemic.  They will take what comes with that.  We need an international comparator as well and we should have an international person or two in such a process.</p></speech>

The truth of the matter is that the Omicron variant spread at a rate of 500,000 per week towards the end of the last wave.  In many ways, it is the spread of Omicron through the population that led to it having nowhere else to spread.  That contributed to the end of that wave as well.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, came before this committee recently to discuss the salary of the Secretary General in the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt.  This is a burning issue in the minds of many people around the country because we could not create a bigger contrast between the experience of the general population and that particular salaried individual in the public sector.</p></speech>

We are talking about an approximate &euro;100,000 increase in salary over a period of a year for one individual with no process or international benchmarks.

The Deputy's point is about a specific post and a position of Secretary General in the Department of Health.  When I was questioned, I made the point that given my experience in health, there is merit in the Secretary General position in the Department of Health having a higher salary than other Secretary General positions.</p><p>Why would I say that?  At that time and in the few months before that appointment, we were in the middle of a global pandemic, we had allocated enormous sums to the Department of Health and we had emerging issues with the children's hospital that summer.  If I am honest about it, the Department needs fundamental reform and change to be fit for purpose.  That was the motivating factor.  Something similar happened regarding the HSE position, the Garda Commissioner and other positions.</p><p> I understand fully the points the Deputy has made.  I understand people may not agree with me on this.  We are all entitled to have views.  I have no personal interest in this other than, as Taoiseach, I have to act in respect of the health portfolio.</p><p> The Government set itself three fundamental objectives when we came into office and, to be blunt about it, we do not have time to be hanging around.  Climate change is one issue.  Housing is another, and health.  Of course, there is a range of other issues.  We want to get things done and we want change.</p><p> People may disagree with us on an issue such as the filling the position of Secretary General of the Department of Health but I am clear that more needs to be done in health.  The Department of Health needs to be the go-to Department in the public service.  It was not that for the past number of years from what I am hearing.  There are many very good people working in the Department.  They have been working extremely hard during Covid-19.  I pay tribute to the public servants in the Department for the work that they have done above and beyond the call of duty.  It is so enormous.  It is relentless in terms of issues that arrive on the desks of civil servants in the Department.  It needs expansion, it needs capacity and then the relationship with the HSE is one that has to be developed.  However, the expenditure we have allocated to health generally is exponential in its growth.</p></speech>

You were answering that in respect of the specific wage increase for the Secretary General.  In your opening remarks and in the Estimates, you referred to Cabinet sub-committees which I was interested in.  They are dealing with the disability sector and improving the lot of people with disabilities, and equality and justice, etc.  I was not going to mention this but, in contrast, I put it to you that Ellie, who is three years of age, was accessing services through an agency funded by the HSE and she was doing very well.  She has a particular diagnosis which is rare, genetic and so on, but she was doing well.  Then the HSE reconfigured its delivery of services and it went from that agency back into the HSE and Ellie lost 75% of the services that were improving her lot in life.  Her mother was told that she should reassess her expectations of what Ellie can achieve.  She said: "If we get her to a place where she can creep and perhaps shuffle around on her bum, then I should celebrate this and be happy with that."  That is from a letter that parent sent to your office, to mine and to others.  I looked at it and I found what the mother was saying was absolutely true.  I raised it last night with two Ministers in the Department of Health at a meeting.  I cannot fathom why services that were working - that is not the only one and I have lots of correspondence here to do with the disability sector - when they are changed would result in that young person losing out to that extent.  I am saying this to you in the context of the Cabinet sub-committee on disability.</p> <p>  There is another case where the young chap has been 28 months lying on a couch.  I do not expect you to know anything about this.  I am just giving you the general thrust of what is happening out there.  The allocation from the HSE is &euro;54,000 for the services that he requires.  He is a child with autism who has not been in school and has not received any supports whatsoever for his condition, and there is no intervention.  When I inquire as to why it has stopped and why the parents are put under such pressure, I do not get an answer.  That is the difficulty.  I am presenting this to you to explain things from my end.</p> <p>  Likewise, a family in Glanmire, County Cork do not have services for their child.  I cannot understand given the amount that is being spent, that services are in such a state of almost collapse.  It concerns me.  This young man, Joey, is receiving services from Praxis, a company, I understand, being paid for by the Department.  The services were closed in Douglas and they were moved to Monahan Road in Cork.  Praxis has refused to pay for the transport of that young person to the services.  As some of these services are transferred from the private sector to the HSE, people who require them are just not getting them.  It is difficult to explain to those parents why that is happening.</p> <p>  When I listened to both Ministers last evening, I was struck by the level of bureaucracy that prevents them from delivering the funding effectively to the end user.  I am wondering, in terms of the sub-committee, whether that the type of issue that is discussed.  I do not expect you to deal with individual cases but you are aware of all of this.  When can people expect that there will be a response?</p></speech>

That is my point.  That is wrong.  No professional should say it and no official should say it because they never know the potential of a child.  Parents know best, not professionals.  I do not decry professionals.  Sometimes even the best of professionals should listen, listen and listen.  They should listen to the patient and listen to the parent.  That can be soul-destroying and devastating to a parent and that is not acceptable.</p> <p>  We did decide policy-wise to move disability from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and to have a specific Minister for disability, the reason being to try and give it more focused attention because the stories you articulated have been experienced by many of us.  I am impatient with this in terms of a more direct link between funding and action.</p> <p>  I would argue - not everyone might agree - it is much better in the Department of Education.  At least when funding is allocated for SNAs, they will be allocated to schools.  It is similar with psychologists, through the National Educational Psychological Service, although people may argue about the capacity, etc.</p> <p>  The Department of Health has an overly bureaucratic system.  We must work on that relationship between the HSE and the Department, and link it to the Cabinet committee.  That is work that the Cabinet committee has to do.  The challenges of Covid have not helped in the transfer of responsibility for disability from the Department of Health over to the new Department.  That is key.</p><p>On the relationship between education and health, the Progressing Disability Services programme has been going on quite a long time and, as I have said before, we have argued that existing services and multidisciplinary services in schools should be retained, particularly in special schools.  Notwithstanding Progressing Disability, we need to look at what more we can do within the school environment.  From what I can see, we can get a lot more done through schooling than we can through health services at the moment, so long is the entire journey for parents and children.  There is a lot of good work being done also, and we must acknowledge that.</p></speech>

The Cork Enable Ireland centre has been a tremendous success in Curraheen.  That came out of Progressing Disability and it is an excellent service. Provision in general, however, is too patchy.  We have evolved a non-governmental organisation provision, with various charities, that in the past has provided services when the State was not providing services.  In some instances, the State is always negotiating with agencies and negotiating with service providers, and this tug-of-war that goes on is not productive or constructive.  For example, when we were trying to set up classes or schools for children with autism, some service providers might have said they did not want any more, that they had enough, and that they were not going to facilitate an expansion.  That is going to have to change and the State is going to have to become more involved in providing services directly.  I take the point, however, that it should not be done at the expense of other services.  If the child already has an existing service, he or she should retain that service.  If somebody wants to create a new service, there are many other children who will avail of the new service.  The quality of service should not be diluted.</p></speech>

My point to the Taoiseach is that we cannot let time go by for these children.  It is simply wrong.  They are progressing, then there is a lack of service or a hiccup with the service or whatever it might be, and they just go backwards.  It is having a devastating effect on families.  Some of these families are on the verge of separating because they cannot manage it any more in their lives.  It is not that the HSE is not getting the money.  In these cases the HSE actually has the money.</p></speech>

There must be an integrated single pathway for children and the provision of services.  On the aids and appliances, some areas are now simplifying.  No child should have to wait four years.  The funding is there to make sure the child should get such a specialist bed.  I remember in the southern area when there was rationing when five children would be done this month, for example, and then another five children would have to wait another three months for the next quarterly meeting or something like to be allocated.  That is not good enough.  The money is there.  I believe that legacy funding needs in some organisations has, again, been picked up on by us in the context of provision.  The reconfiguration of the HSE has to deliver.  Work is going to be done there with reconfiguring the HSE but it simply has to deliver multidisciplinary teams.  Every child needs multidisciplinary input.</p></speech>

I am not sure which page it will be in the Taoiseach's Estimates, but he referred to the number of staff in the Department.  There are two blocks of information where it describes the number and type of staff in the Department.  At the end - and there may be information missing - it says the remainder of staff includes service staff and those assigned to the private office, the constituency office and the internal information and records management unit.  No figure is given for that.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give the committee that figure.  If he does not have it to hand, perhaps he will send it on to the committee.</p></speech>

In light of the number of different cases I have read about, does the Taoiseach believe those offices are appropriately funded in the context of the number of cases they have and given the most recent decision not to prosecute in the Grace case?  Is that the end of it?  Is there a learning from that as to how the case was brought forward, or from the information or evidence?  What causes something like that not to proceed given the huge context of Grace and the 47 other people?  The Taoiseach will also be aware of the Shane O'Farrell case.  Lucia O'Farrell had a lot of criticism of how that family was treated.  In learning from that, what sort of reforms does the Taoiseach believe might be necessary in those offices?</p></speech>

It has gone up 12% for the director and her staff, and it provides for the recruitment of extra staff to deal with the increased workload in the office and for the payment of increases arising from the Building Momentum public service pay agreement.  The DPP's office will always be looking for additional resources, and I believe there was a need for additional resources.  We provided those this year and we will keep it under review.  It is a fundamental office.</p> <p>  The DPP's office is independent in the conduct of its work.  To be fair, I know the Chairman has been a very strong advocate in the Grace case and in the Shane O'Farrell case.  I cannot comment on that and I do not know the context of the inner workings for what leads the Director of Public Prosecutions to make a decision on whether particular cases are to be prosecuted.  That is beyond my remit.  It is an independent office.  It has to be independent in how it does its work.  It has been a long-standing principle that we do not interfere with the Office of the DPP.  Most democracies maintain that divide.</p></speech>

In the D&aacute;il Chamber today, I had queries for four inquiries.  In my speech I referred to inquiries that are under the remit of our Department such as the Cooke and Cregan commissions and so on.  They are taking a long time.  It is probably time to consider whether we need to revisit how we conduct commissions of investigation of different models.  Inquiries are taking too long, for the victims and for survivors.</p></speech>

Within every organisation, there should be robust systems.  If a whistle blows or someone has an issue or a serious complaint, that person should be dealt with properly within the organisation and there should be an appeals mechanism to deal with that quickly and expeditiously.  This does not seem to be happening in the State, however, and we end up with a lot of cases that are brought to the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  There was a particular case raised today by a Deputy with regard to the Irish Prison Service.  I was not familiar with the individual case but the very fact it is being raised in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is telling me something about the systems we have in place in organisations.</p><p>The Women of Honour and other groups I have met have been clear: they all agree on the need for change.  Some believe in what the Government has been doing, namely, facilitating an independent review, without ruling out a statutory inquiry.  Others want a statutory inquiry.  All are clear that the minute they reported sexual assault against them, that was the end of their careers.  That is what they said to us.  That is the terrible reality of what happened to women in the Defence Forces over the years.  It indicates that something is not working.  A statutory commission of inquiry will not provide early closure or resolution in respect of the issues.</p></speech>

It then escalates into some sort of a demand for a commission or a State investigation.  There are so many agencies and Departments that if they were actually told to engage and sort out the cases, they might not get as far as they do.  My point about Shane O'Farrell and Grace is that there was no explanation and there is no method by means of which these offices can give an understanding to people who are close to the cases as to why, generally, they did not proceed.  The State needs to learn from that and from what people such as Lucia O'Farrell have articulated about the justice system in general.  The investigation might not get to the end of everything but surely there is a way of dealing with human beings in a different way from how they are being dealt with now and thus preventing further demands of one kind of another for investigations and allowing people to go on with their lives.</p></speech>

The O'Malley report in respect of domestic violence and Supporting a Victim's Journey speak to that in the context of the journey of a victim of sexual or domestic abuse.  They address how the criminal justice system liaises with and works with the person.  If the Chair saw the programme earlier in the week, he will know that the victims spoke about the criminal justice system not serving their needs in some instances and the pressure that they came under.  I will check that out with some people.  The Chair is saying that if something does not progress, the families should be told.  Garda&iacute; are much better at liaising with families in the context of crimes and what is happening.  Strong liaison work is being done by garda&iacute; for the victims of serious crimes.</p></speech>

If someone is appointed to a board, as in this case, where there is a representative of the Taoiseach's office on the board, is there a reporting mechanism within the Department that nominated a person to alert the Taoiseach to something that might be wrong with governance or an issue such as this?</p></speech>

I know that when people are appointed to certain boards, their legal duty is to the board, which may prohibit them from reporting to individuals about matters relating to the board, governance and so on.  That is problematic for public officials on boards because their ultimate loyalty should be to public service.  Nonetheless, if a public servant is on a board, the nature of the board means that the person has to behave properly in the context of that board.  I do not know the specifics of this case.  Some opportunities would arise for people to alert me about certain issues.</p></speech>

I will give the Taoiseach the details.  I will not dwell on it now.  I have a question on the Cabinet sub-committee on enterprise.  Does the Taoiseach envisage any change regarding employers being allowed to bring in truck drivers or mechanics from other EU countries or beyond?  One cannot get truck drivers, bus drivers or mechanics.  Employers have come to me in the south east to ask if someone can change the regime so that if people are found, they can be fast-tracked in.  I was struck by the preparations for the Irish Open.  The applications for chefs are waiting to be cleared in the Department.  I would have thought that for major events such as that or indeed major bus companies or hauliers that there would be some method of fast-tracking applications to bring in people from outside the country to fill the vacancies that cannot be filled here.  This is a significant problem.</p></speech>

There is a significant issue with vacancies and the difficulty in attracting workers for a whole range of sectors, especially hospitality, truckers in the haulage industry, and construction, although the capacity for construction is back to where it was before the pandemic, which is a good story.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been apprised of the fact.  We have engaged with the Department to accelerate work permits and visas for people living outside the European Union area.  It needs to be kept under constant review.  I know that, in respect of foreign direct investment, there has been a long-standing arrangement to try to accelerate critical companies' capacity to bring in non-EU or non-EEA workers.  Given the level that the economy, employment and resulting vacancies are at, there is a need to accelerate and to review our existing practices with regard to attracting workers from non-EU countries.</p></speech>

Everything possible is being done to speed it up.  Representatives of many of the sectors have told us they cannot get workers.  One issue with hospitality related to the income thresholds that existed for work permits.  In the interim, we will have to examine that because hospitality has taken a significant hit as a result of Covid-19.  We will need to come up with a medium-term plan for hospitality arising out of Covid-19, and that speaks to the issue of skills and talent.  To be fair to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy Niall Collins, much work is being done in that regard to expand the field of apprenticeships and develop a range of skilled courses to get people trained up.  As I said earlier, 2.5 million people are now in employment.  When we produced the economic recovery plan more than a year ago, we thought it would take us until 2023 to get to that figure, yet we are almost there.   There is an issue there.</p></speech>

I do not want to do a Deputy O'Connor on it but I would like to see the N24 and N25 included.  As part of the programme for Government, &euro;3.5 million is required, between the two schemes, to move them forward to the next phase.  The Taoiseach liaises regularly with the other two coalition leaders.  He might encourage the Minister for Transport to look again at the N24 and N25 projects.</p></speech>

Similarly, ours was one of the most successful vaccination programmes globally.  The booster campaign, too, was vital in dealing with the Omicron variant.  I think we have placed sixth in the European Union in terms of lowest mortality rates.  As for the economic recovery and employment, there has been a very significant bounce-back, which means the economic interventions the Government made during the pandemic worked.  They have got people back to work quickly as we have emerged from the pandemic.  Even so, there are all sorts of issues arising as we bounce back from the pandemic in regard to inflation, which is a big issue.  Fundamentally, however, we are back to 2.5 million in employment, which underpins the success of our economic and employment policies.  The Bloomberg resilience metric, which measures a range of factors such as health, mortality and socioeconomic impact, for quite a while was ranking us as number one.  Nevertheless, there are lessons to be learned and we will have to conduct a proper evaluation of the response.</p></speech>

I accept that the fuel issue and the potential unrest in eastern Europe have had an impact.  Is there any other way the Government can intervene with a view to lightening the burden of inflation that now presents itself and at least trying to ensure the trend will not continue?</p><p>My next question relates to Brexit, the Northern Ireland protocol and the suspension of the Northern Irish Assembly.  To what extent can the Taoiseach advance the cause of dialogue and, perhaps, the shared island initiative while only the barest of political institutions are operating in the North?  Does it present an opportunity to progress that area?</p><p>The Chairman made a point about women serving in the Defence Forces.  My theory has always been that a duty of care applies within the body where an alleged offence occurs.  Are the frameworks that are in place robust enough to deal with such matters as and when they arise?</p><p>My final question relates to due process.  As we know, there was a case where public perception found against Members of the Oireachtas and private citizens who were employed elsewhere.  By virtue of the public perception and the presumption of guilt, several of them ended up losing their jobs.  The event was not a small thing and people will argue that is politics for you, but they were not all politicians.  There was a difference of legal opinion and legal opinion was sought.  As we know, every legal opinion is subject to challenge.  Nevertheless, is there a case for the need to ensure due process and natural justice will prevail, rather than proceeding to a summary execution, as it were, whether or not a <i>prima facie</i>case could be established before the ultimate taking place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#Y01800"><p>We implement a security-by-design, defence in-depth approach to cybersecurity.  We are very conscious of the need for ongoing engagement with experts, particularly in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure best practice operates as it relates to all aspects of cybersecurity and information security.  In the Department of the Taoiseach, we have factored in a significant review of our security posture in our plans for 2022.</p><p>Overall, for operational and security reasons we are advised by the national centre not to disclose details of systems and processes that could in any way compromise information systems.</p><p> More generally, we do not want to assist any criminals.  It was clear to us following the cyber attack on the health service that there is a need for European solidarity.  It was interesting how countries such as Poland and the UK came to our assistance very quickly.  We will not do this on our own; European member states must share experience and knowledge and work together to combat cybersecurity problems, which will be a major threat in the future.  The attack had an enormous impact on the health service.  Considering the nature of the event, it could never be fully presented.  I paid tribute to all the senior officials in the HSE who worked for 24 hours a day to try to get the system back.  It took many weeks and months.  It affected the front-line clinicians, who could not get scans.  It was a very difficult time for all working in the HSE and the Department.  I was critical regarding systems but I must pay tribute to the staff in this case.  On top of Covid, the attack was the last straw for those on the ground and in the system.  That people had to work so hard to save the system had an impact on their health.  That is the truth, and that needs to be said too.  I thank the staff for the work they did.</p><p> On inflation, the Government has said it is going to have a package of measures.  Again, we must not fuel inflation inadvertently through our measures.  Oil and gas prices have increased exponentially globally.  The opening up of societies and the economic rebound across the world have meant an imbalance between the supply of products and demand, which is driving up inflation.  Quantitative easing in America and Europe has been unprecedented during this pandemic.  All of these factors combined are leading to inflationary spirals.  We can see this in respect of both fertiliser and microchips for cars.  It is manifesting itself in many ways, so we must now take measures to cushion the blow for affected people as best we can.</p><p> With regard to Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol, the shared-island dialogue is working.  Without prejudice to anyone&rsquo;s constitutional views or perspectives, it is reaching out.  The dialogues have been fantastic.  There have been well over 1,000 participants.  An All-Island Women&rsquo;s Forum has been established on foot of the dialogues.  An All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Network has been established as a result of them also.  Great research has been done by the National Economic and Social Council and the ESRI on various systems, including primary care systems, and on educational curriculums etc.  That is good and we will continue with that.</p><p> On the duty of care issue, I do not want to pre-empt the independent review, but my sense is that the review is important and not statutory because we need to safeguard serving and current members of the Defence Forces.  We need to be satisfied that the duty of care is applied now.  We cannot wait for a couple of years for a statutory inquiry that could take a long time.  It will not give us the reassurance we need that existing systems in the Defence Forces are robust enough and that the culture is right.  In that regard, the independent review led by the judge, human resources person and senior counsel is important.</p><p> Due process should always apply.  Reference was made to public representatives, judgments and so on.  Due process should always be allowed.  I take the point that the pressures on politics sometimes create a shortcut through due process.  As parliamentarians, we should guard against that.</p></speech>

Everybody has a right to due process and natural justice.  The ultimate decision, which is made in the courts, could be subject to appeal, but the point is that the axe has fallen and the decision has already been made.  Regardless of whether the individuals in the case to which we refer feel they had due process, they lost their jobs.  Therefore, it is a serious issue.  There is sometimes a tendency to say in the public arena that it is all about perception.  Of course, it is not all about perception; it is about substance.  Therefore, whatever we do, we need to ensure that we assume people have a right to their good name and to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty.  That is one of the basic tenets of our system.  However, maybe there are some lessons to be learned from these matters.  Would it not be a good idea to learn them?</p></speech>

Today we will be considering 2022 Revised Estimates.  This is a special select committee meeting.  The purpose of our meeting today is to consider the following Revised Estimates for public services: programme D of Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications, and Vote 31 - Transport.  I remind committee members that the committee has no role in approving the Estimates.  It is an ongoing opportunity for the committee to examine departmental expenditure, to make the process more transparent and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.  I welcome the Minister for Transport and for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, and his officials to the meeting.  They are most welcome.</p> <p>  I will read a brief note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the committee remotely via MS Teams.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via MS Teams that, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that member confirms he or she is on the grounds of Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.</p> <p>  I call the Minster, Deputy Ryan, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#A00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the 2022 Estimate for the Department of Transport and for programme A of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p> <p>  For 2022, the budget has been restructured to make it easier to monitor and report on how funds are being invested.  The former land programme is now split into three new programmes, namely, programme A, sustainable mobility, active travel and greenways; programme B, carbon reduction and public transport; and programme C, road safety and road networks.  Programme D, civil aviation, and programme E, maritime safety and transport, remain unchanged.</p> <p>  The set of transport Estimates before the committee provide an overall gross allocation to the Department of Transport of &euro;3.432 billion, which constitutes &euro;885 million in current expenditure and &euro;2.547 billion in capital.  Core expenditure has increased by 7% in current expenditure and by just under 1% in capital, in line with the capital ceiling for 2022 agreed as part of the negotiations underpinning the revised national development plan, NDP.</p> <p>  Covid emergency expenditure has fallen by 46%, in line with the gradual recovery in the economy.  Supports are still provided, where deemed necessary, to protect public services.  In total, an additional &euro;238 million in emergency funding is provided in 2022.</p> <p>  This year will see a number of significant milestones as major transport projects continue to advance and the number of active travel schemes in the pipeline continues to grow.  In the budget, we secured additional funding to assist our investment agencies to continue to scale up to deliver on projects within their remit.  The responsibility for greenways has been transferred to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which is in a position to utilise its knowledge and expertise to advance interurban networks.  In addition, legislation is now before the Oireachtas which will, if passed, make it easier for local authorities to experiment with active travel proposals.</p> <p>  Turning to active travel and greenways, &euro;358.6 million is allocated under this programme.  Major urban projects to commence construction include the Clontarf to Amiens Street route in Dublin and the MacCurtain Street scheme in Cork.  In all, an estimated 1,200 active travel projects will be funded.  Some 170 schools are participating in the current round of the safe routes to schools programme.</p> <p>  Construction will continue on significant greenway projects, including Clifden to Recess and Midleton to Youghal.  In 2022, an estimated 150 km of greenway will be under construction and 900 km in pre-construction.  As bicycles take up, on average, one tenth of the space of a car, cost a fraction of a car to purchase and use, and properly designed networks have much higher capacity to carry people to their destinations than congested roads, their impact over short journeys simply cannot be underestimated.</p><p> Under programme B, sustainable mobility, carbon reduction and public transport, approximately &euro;1.475 billion has been allocated, &euro;102 million of which is allocated to carbon reduction measures, including supporting the continued rate of growth in the number of electric vehicles, EVs.  Under this programme a number of schemes are funded, including the very successful electric small public service vehicle, ESPSV, scheme and the EV grant scheme for private cars.</p><p> Some &euro;780 million is allocated to public transport investment.  This year will see a number of key milestones in public transport projects presently under development.  Just before Christmas, the preliminary business case for DART+ was approved, with DART+ West the first project scheduled to enter the planning system.  The contract for the DART fleet was signed, a major step in facilitating the increase in fleet capacity.  In the coming months I expect to bring the preliminary business cases for BusConnects and MetroLink to the Cabinet.  The Cork commuter rail project, part-funded through the EU's national recovery and resilience programme, will also be progressed.  Some &euro;538.8 million is allocated to public service obligation, PSO, services.  Included in this allocation, emergency funding of &euro;205 million will continue to support PSO services and to remediate the impacts of the Covid-19 emergency measures.  New routes will be rolled out under the BusConnects, rural transport and Connecting Ireland network plans, and the new youth travel card scheme will be rolled out.</p><p> Under programme C, road safety and road networks, approximately &euro;1.423 billion is allocated.  This funding will maintain and renew national, regional and local road surfaces; assist in undertaking safety works and bridge maintenance and rehabilitation; meet our contractual obligations under public private partnerships that delivered parts of our motorway network; fund the construction of new national, regional and local roads; and fund vital safety-related services.</p><p> Construction continues on a number of major roads, including the Dunkettle interchange and the N5 Westport to Turlough road.  The Listowel bypass and the N59 Moycullen bypass will commence construction in 2022.  Projects with planning approval that will continue to progress towards construction phase include the N28 Ringaskiddy road and the N6 Galway ring road.  Some &euro;825 million has been allocated to protection and renewal.  As for road safety, as well as funding for driver licensing services, additional funding has been provided to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to support its vital work in detecting drug and alcohol misuse by drivers.</p><p> Under the civil aviation programme, &euro;67.417 million is allocated to the sector.  As the sector continues to recover, the amount of funding in emergency supports is significantly down in 2022.  The regional airports programme provides targeted supports to regional airports that handle fewer than 1 million passengers per annum.  Cork and Shannon airports are eligible to participate in the programme in 2022 alongside Knock and Donegal airports.  Funding of &euro;5 million is available in the event that customer refund or repatriation is required following the failure of a travel or tour operator.  Some &euro;10 million is available in additional travel trade industry supports, and &euro;11 million is allocated to fund services such as air accident insurance and membership of key international organisations.</p><p> Under programme E, maritime transport and safety, &euro;108.81 million is allocated for 2022.  Most of that funding is directed to the Irish Coast Guard, and the main cost in this regard relates to the search and rescue helicopter contract.  The programme also funds the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which operates buoys and lighthouses and keeps seafarers and their cargoes safe while in Irish waters.  We also cover various administrative costs associated with the Irish Maritime Administration.  We will continue the Coast Guard building programme to ensure the volunteers have adequate facilities for their operations and equipment.  We are investing in IT  infrastructure to enable the teams to enhance further how they work together.  Some &euro;1 million has been provided to Wexford County Council to assist in the cost of environmental remediation works at Rosslare Europort as part of the transfer of the port to management by the local authority.</p><p> I now turn to the connectivity and communications delivery programme of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The aim of the programme is to deliver world-class connectivity and communications.  Over &euro;255 million is being allocated to the programme in 2022, consisting of &euro;19.95 million in current expenditure and &euro;235.2 million in capital expenditure.  The current expenditure relates mainly to the Department's digital economy programmes and the National Cyber Security Centre.</p><p> The biggest item of capital expenditure within this programme is the national broadband plan, at &euro;225 million.  The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of high-capacity and reliable broadband to ensure people, communities and businesses throughout Ireland can avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy.  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has continued the roll-out of the new high-speed fibre-optic broadband network under the national broadband plan, NBP.  Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across every county in Ireland, with almost 292,000 premises surveyed or undergoing survey as of 14 January.  More than 34,000 premises have been passed and retailers are now able to resell high-speed broadband services via the National Broadband Ireland, NBI, network to those premises.  In excess of 54,000 premises are able to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband service, and nearly 5,500 premises are now connected.</p><p> The 2022 Estimate includes &euro;3 million for Eircode postcodes.  Since their launch in 2015, their usage has continued to grow and they are now used widely among the public, businesses and the public sector.</p><p> The Estimates also include &euro;5.1 million operational funding for the National Cyber Security Centre and &euro;3.5 million for the National Digital Research Centre.  The National Cyber Security Centre is the central cybersecurity authority in the State, its key roles being to monitor and to respond to cybersecurity incidents and to manage and to share intelligence relating to threats to network and information security.  In line with the Government decision of July 2021, the 2022 pay Estimate for the programme includes an allocation to increase staffing at the National Cyber Security Centre by 20 to 45 in 2022.  The National Cyber Security Centre will continue to develop its incident response, threat intelligence, monitoring and research and development capabilities.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions on the 2022 Estimates of expenditure for the services provided by both Departments under this programme.</p></speech>

Should that read "programme D" rather than "programme A"?  It is probably a typo.</p></speech>

He is on the ball.  As I said, it is just for the record.  We now move to Members.  I call Deputy O'Connor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#B00500"><p>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire and his officials to the committee.  I thank the Minister for his presentation and the work he is doing.  I know there is an awful lot going on in the areas of mobility and sustainability.  I compliment the active travel measures.  It is welcome to see such focus put on that area, which has been neglected for an awfully long time.  For the coming financial year, it will be important for the Minister and his Department to put pressure on the local authorities to spend the money available to them.  That comes up quite a bit.</p><p>Another thing I find deeply frustrating is when there are projects that those of us who have served on local authorities know and that may be extremely expensive to undertake.  There is sometimes a degree of fear on the part of local authorities in that they do not want to undertake projects of such large scale, such as long footpaths and pedestrian schemes.  It might be nice for the Department to allow some Oireachtas representation on large-scale projects.  We may want the Minister to report to the local authorities rather than it being <i>vice versa</i>the entire time, with local authorities reporting to the State agencies that have the responsibility to allocate that funding down.  That would be very welcome.</p><p>As for the transition to greener modes of transport, we are in the midst of an enormous shift in vehicle patterns in respect of the types of fuel required to drive vehicles on Irish roads.  Does the Minister think the Department, with this year's expenditure, is doing enough to realise and meet targets we have set down for the removal of diesel vehicles from Irish roads?  Something I have a degree of concern about is that many families may be buying soft hybrid diesel vehicles, which have become quite normal, but where will they be in five and six years' time, when it comes to trading in and perhaps purchasing new cars?  What will the knock-on ramifications be for the value of those vehicles?  Will it still be legal into the 2030s to drive those vehicles on Irish roads, despite their being less than ten years old?  Will the Minister give us some guidance on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#C00100"><p>I agree with the Deputy's comments around encouraging local authorities and Departments to make sure we spend the money.  Covid interrupted a lot, but, hopefully, this year we will have a clear run.  I expect all budgets will be fully utilised.  In everything, I will be pushing for acceleration.  This Government has to be about delivery and getting good value for money in that delivery.  Applying the same urgency we saw in regard to Covid to the housing crisis, the climate crisis and the reform in the health system is the key metric for the Government.</p> <p>  With regard to diesel vehicles and the future - I do not have the statistics in front of me, but if my officials have them I will be happy to share them - the proportion of diesel vehicles within new purchases has fallen significantly in the past two to three years.  I expect that to continue and to accelerate in its own right for a variety of reasons, but in the main because we are going to see battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric and full electric vehicles take off.  All of the manufacturers are going to start providing such options.  During an engagement I had yesterday with the SEAI on a separate issue, we were in agreement that we are not far away from the point of comparative life-cycle costs.  They are actually more economic and, therefore, their use will start to accelerate.</p> <p>  The Fit for 55 plan, which I support, provides for the ending of the sale of combustion vehicles by 2030.  I think it was the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, who introduced that in his climate action plan.  That type of message and signal is very appropriate to give to the Irish public so that people and retailers and garages can start to plan for that.  As I said, the EU Fit for 55 package contains a proposal around that timeframe.  The signal that we are switching from combustion vehicles, particularly for passenger cars, is important.</p></speech>

I have only five minutes remaining.</p></speech>

We are not going to start telling people what to do completely.  The electric vehicles are increasingly going to be the more economic, better resale, lower maintenance-cost option.  That is where people are going to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#C00400"><p>I am concerned that we are building a mountain that the Government may have to climb and that it could be quite a nasty one if we delay implementing a major scheme that will allow people to scrap older diesel vehicles.  I am particularly concerned that tens of thousands of vehicles using traditional methods of combustion are still being bought and put onto Irish roads on an annual basis.  The reality is that in the 2030s we will be in a new era when it comes to how we fuel our cars.  There will be a financial burden and impact in terms of the trade-in value of vehicles, if it will even be permitted to trade them in.  We all want to see a degree of clarity brought to this particular area.  I ask that over the course of this year the Minister would work on a comprehensive scheme that will allow people to transition from diesel to hybrid vehicles.  The schemes that are currently in place are very small in terms of the proportional cost of purchasing hybrid and fully electric vehicles, which often are significantly more expensive that their diesel and petrol counterparts.  This is an area that needs to be worked on.</p> <p>  We had a lot of drama over the course of the past 12 months around the National Cyber Security Centre, and rightly so.  As Minister with responsibility for communications, what assurances can the Minister provide that the Irish defence system, in terms of defence from cyber attacks into the future, has been strengthened by way of the actions he has taken in the context of this year's budget?</p></speech>

We did have lessons to learn.  There were mistakes made and networks were not secure.  Work has advanced on closing those loopholes, but it is important that we learn from that attack.  I am confident that with the additional resources, the additional staff and the willingness to learn the lessons from that cyber attack, we will have a more secure network.  No system can be completely fail-safe, but there were significant lessons that we needed to learn and have learned from that crippling event.  I am confident those lessons will be learned.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#C00700"><p>There was no expense spared when it came to the provision of further resources for the National Cyber Security Centre.  The ask was for the optimal staffing with skills as well.  It is not just about numbers; it is about skills as well.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was immediate in providing us with the necessary resources.  Staff are being taken on, bringing total staff numbers up to 44 this year.  That was optimised on the basis of best international expertise advising us.  That is what they felt we needed.</p></speech>

It is not about staffing on its own.  It is interesting that the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which has been published today, recognises that the Department of Defence also has a key role on the cybersecurity side.  That Department will, I am sure, be looking to enhance its capability.  The other lesson is that we need this capability in the agencies and the main corporate entities in the State.  It is not just about the National Cyber Security Centre; it is about the HSE and the Departments as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#C01000"><p>I do not wish to be derogatory or dismissive, but perspective is key in this.  It has to be acknowledged that the people working within this space are extremely committed and working very hard and they have been put through the wringer in the past 12 months, but 44 personnel is fewer people than work in a busy McDonald's restaurant or a major supermarket.  For an economy worth hundreds of billions of euros, where we have tens of thousands of people working in the tech industry, is it not the case that we are in a better position than any other small developed economy in the world to bring in experts in encryption and the other people who are necessary?</p> <p>  I have an additional concern with regard to pay.  If these people are expected to be paid salaries that are merited for their expertise - what they would get in the private sector is probably many multiples of what they would expect to get working in the public service - has the Department done any analysis from a pay perspective in terms of dealing with this particular issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#C01100"><p>I was involved in helping to oversee the management in response to that cyber attack.  What we saw in terms of the calibre, dedication and sense of duty among the people we had was beyond compare.  The Deputy is correct that a lot of the time these people would be earning significantly higher salaries within the private sector, but many of them come with a history of involvement with the state.  Some are Defence Forces personnel and they have that patriotic sense.  They also learn a lot in this role.  There tends to be a relatively constant flow of staff from the private sector into the public sector and back out again.  That can be healthy in terms of mixing skills and learning new skills.</p> <p>  As I said, when it came to beefing up the National Cyber Security Centre, there was no restriction in terms of what we needed to do around pay or positions.  We went about that in a way that, first and foremost, involved increasing resources on an urgent basis.  We have taken on a director, a principal officer and an assistant principal officer and competitions are under way for a whole range of different cybersecurity operations roles.  I am confident that we will fill those roles and that we are able to get skilled people.  The National Cyber Security Centre is a very good agency.  In terms of the manner in which it shares information, it is an open and trusted organisation internationally, which means for anyone who is working there it tends to enhance their reputation.  That makes it an attractive place for people to work in.  </p></speech>

It sends a chill down my spine, and that of anybody who is committed to State security, that this area is going to become an increasing risk in years to come.  The world is becoming a more unstable place, unfortunately.  Over the past few years, we have seen that pattern starting to emerge.</p><p>Arguably, an individual group could do more damage using a hacking method to damage the capacity of a state in terms of its IT systems in times to come.  I very much advocate the Minister doing all he can in that regard in the year ahead.  I appreciate him taking the time to answer questions.</p></speech>

The first is that when the national cybersecurity issue arose with the HSE, the committee wrote to all Departments to ask that they isolate cybersecurity costs.  The Minister referred to the fact that each Department now has a role in the context of cybersecurity spending.  I know the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, is under the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, but has the Department of Transport looked to isolate the costs involved in cybersecurity?  The committee wrote to all Departments so that the Estimates, when they come out, will include a heading under which the costs within the Department that are incurred in dealing with cybersecurity are outlined.</p> <p>   The Minister referred to the Commission on the Defence Forces and its recommendations.  He stated that all Departments have a role to play in this regard.  I do not know whether he or his officials are aware that the Irish Aviation Authority appeared before the joint committee last week to discuss the Russian situation.  The presentation from its representatives was excellent; their knowledge was second to none.  They were asked about the fact that if planes without permission to come in beyond the 12 nautical mile limit do not have their transponders switched on, the IAA cannot detect them.  Does the Minister see a role in terms of the purchase of primary radar equipment?  It was a recommendation under the White Paper, as well as the updated one, that the State now needs to make that large investment in primary radar equipment in order that planes can be detected whether they have the transponder on or not.  There is an issue that planes can fly very close to our coastline and if the transponder on a plane is not turned on, it undetectable by the IAA or even by the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The first point is a housekeeping one; I ask the Minister to make an observation on the second point.</p></speech>

The NCSC has a particular role, however.  It does work with Departments and-----</p></speech>

When the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, appeared before the committee, he made the point that the amount that is down as spent on cybersecurity is probably far higher than what is allocated to the NCSC itself, so the committee made a recommendation.  We wrote to all Departments to ask that they isolate as a spending item money spent on cybersecurity.  One would then get a holistic view with all Departments.</p></speech>

The Government has agreed to give it a number of months before we respond to the report of the commission.  It was independently published, in effect, today.  The one point I will make is that the biggest economic development of this country in the coming two decades will be the deployment of offshore renewable power.  It will be at the centre of our economic, energy security and climate strategies.  I refer to the scale in particular.  With 30 GW of power generation, we have a competitive comparative advantage that we can turn to industrial policy.  Much of that will be beyond the 12-mile limit.  It will be in the Atlantic off the north-west, west and south-west coasts and our interest-----</p></speech>

I refer to the ability to have speedy turnaround times for naval ships.  The proposal is to have dual crews such that the ship can come in to harbour, swap crews and sail straight back out again.  It is about ensuring that whatever number of naval vessels we have, they can be turned around quickly and spend most of their time at sea, manned by alternating crews.  Either of those will have a good priority strategically because our economic future will be in the Atlantic.</p></speech>

It is the Shannon region as well as the SOTA and NOTA, which are areas we manage on behalf of the UK but that are under our jurisdiction in terms of management of the airspace.  Have we reached a point where we have to put radar in place so that we can detect all planes, whether they have the transponders switched on or not?  Have we reached that point in terms of security, even that of energy supply?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#D01400"><p>That was an interesting exchange on the need for radar and so on.  I was very interested in the response of the Minister.</p> <p>  Before I crack into my questions, I note the &euro;3 million for Eircode was mentioned in the report and there was reference to how successful it has been after a rocky start.  It is worth mentioning that when we invest long-term in these things, they can bear fruit.  I remember it being described as a big waste of time.  It was claimed that no one would use it.  I think everyone now knows their Eircode off by heart.  I assume the &euro;3 million is for new builds and that kind of thing.</p> <p>  Many Ministers in various Departments through the years have pointed to increased funding and investment in certain areas that the public do not see.  The investment may be very real but it certainly is not visible to the naked eye.  I do not think that can be said about active travel, to the credit of the Minister.  It is clear there is significant investment going into active travel, such as measures in respect of segregated and other cycle lanes and pedestrianisation.  It is a very positive move and certainly represents in real terms where the people of Ireland, particularly young people, want to go.  They want more active travel options.  They want the Government to invest in it and it is doing so, which is to be commended.  Two weeks ago, we discussed objections to housing and other matters.  Have there been many objections to active travel measures?  Has the Minister been disappointed by such objections, be they from stakeholder groups, councils or politicians, such as councillors?  Is it an issue?  Is it increasing the cost of the provision and roll-out of these pieces of infrastructure?  It may be too early in this mass roll-out we are seeing for him to comment in detail in that regard, but I would be interested in hearing his thoughts on it and just generally around the whole culture of objecting to change.</p> <p>  Subhead 5.2, dealing with public transport infrastructure, covers light rail projects such as Luas and metro, as well as and public service obligation bus replacement and fleet enlargement programmes for BusConnects and next generation ticketing.  Does the Minister have a more detailed breakdown of that?  Obviously, I am very interested in how much will be spent on MetroLink in the coming year in terms of pushing it forward.  In response to my question on Questions to the Taoiseach yesterday, the Taoiseach was very strong in terms of the Government being supportive of MetroLink.   Representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland who appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week stated that 2035 is the earliest it will be delivered.  That is disappointing.  I would be interested in the response of the Minister to that projection.  It seems like we are baking in as a given an awful lot of imponderables such as judicial reviews, environmental impact assessments and procurement timelines.  It is like we are baking in the longest possible time those could take rather than trying to be positive and forward-moving.  In fairness, what we are hearing from the State agencies is not what I am hearing from the Minister or from the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il.  I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on that.</p> <p>  On bus replacements, fleet enlargements and the electric buses we are now seeing in Dublin, I ask the Minister to comment on the investment in that regard into 2022 and what we will see in terms of these replacements.  These buses can actually be seen now.  It is another example of seeing things happen rather than just having figures on a spreadsheet.</p><p>I am very interested in the accessibility retrofit programme for which &euro;15.3 million has been allocated.  Could the Minister provide further comment on what that is going to deliver and where we will see the money being spent?  I have a young disability activist in my constituency, Conor Dillon, who has been working with Dublin Bus.  He has been taking trips on Dublin Bus to highlight just how difficult it is for wheelchair users to use public transport.  This is someone with a great desire to use public transport but is frozen out of it.  It would be great to hear about where the money is going to go and what we are going to see from it.</p><p> I echo the comments of Deputy O'Connor about a scrappage scheme.  That is something we will need to see down the track in advance of 2030.  Whether it is next year or two, three or four years from now, it is something we are definitely going to need to see.</p><p> The Minister mentioned the national broadband plan.  There have been delays with it due to Covid.  Has there been any impact on the cost from the Department's point of view and is he disappointed in that?</p><p> The Minister said that our economic future will be based on the Atlantic in terms of renewable energy.  We hear a lot about renewable energy, wind energy and offshore energy on the east and south-east coast.  I assume all parts of the coastline will be important in that regard.  This is the first time I heard the Minister being so definitive about the west coast.  There is massive expectation that the east and south-east coasts are going to play a major role as well.</p><p> On a more local and regional level, the Athy distributor road is included as well.  The sod-turning ceremony is due to happen in early March.  I assume that is still going ahead.  Are there any timelines for that project?</p></speech>

Contracts have been signed.  My understanding is that it is proceeding.</p> <p>  On the Eircode, one of the other innovations or investment here is having shorter update and renewal of the Eircode system.  Previously it was quarterly, and it is moving to monthly.  A lot of people used to give out that it took a long time to be registered.  One of the benefits of that is to speed up the registration.</p></speech>

He is correct about where the people of Ireland are, in particular younger people, but not only that group.  I will be honest.  My frustration is that we need to go faster.  The Government must come out of Covid with the same sense of urgency and speed of delivery that we showed during Covid in three areas: housing, further healthcare reform and climate.  The three key aspects of climate to my mind that require immediate acceleration are: retrofit, which we announced yesterday, offshore wind and sustainable mobility.  I have been talking to the officials and my colleagues in government about how we can establish teams within Departments and evolving agencies that accelerate delivery.  Our job is all about delivery.  We have good plans in the climate action plan and the national development plan, but we need to be quick in delivering them and also make sure we get the most for the money we have.  The &euro;35 billion we have in transport will not cover all our needs or anything like it.  The same is true of the &euro;360 million we have in active travel.  While we have had difficulty ramping up spending in the past year or two, very soon we are going to have many more projects ready to go than we have funding for, so we need to get good value for money as well.</p> <p>  Anyone could look at their own example of delays due to a variety of reasons, but I might just take three examples.  They are not in any way inclusive.  I refer to the likes of what happened in Strand Road in my constituency and the likes of what is happening at the moment in Salthill.  I am touching wood thinking surely the good councillors in Galway will see the benefit of having a spectacular seafront facility for their people and for visitors to the city.  I might also take an example from Kerry where we have had an issue on the Kerry greenway, which was one of the earliest projects, based on the old railway line to Cahersiveen.  There are different aspects to all three examples.  I hope some of the concerns will be addressed by the planning reform review the Attorney General is carrying out, for example, on Strand Road.  I must be careful.  I do not want to question judgments.  It is not going against a court decision, but there is a real issue as to whether we sometimes over-apply the likes of the application of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.  I do not think many other countries in Europe apply it in some of the ways that we are applying it and I do not think it was designed in that way.  Often, projects that would help the environment are being delayed and have to go through hoops that I do not think the original directive was designed for them to go through.  I say that without any criticism of any individual decision.  I hope the Attorney General's review will help make it a lot clearer and a lot easier, whether one is an objector, a developer or just a citizen who wants the services.  That could provide significant certainty.  The same applies in the Kerry decision.  I hope the court decisions there will help us to get to good agreements with all landowners across the country quickly and not necessarily to gilt-edge everything, but to be able to deliver as many kilometres of network as we can.</p> <p>  When it comes down to it, the decision in Salthill is probably the most immediately interesting one, because a lot of what we need to do will not always be popular.  There will be a lot of benefit for people, but if we are to provide a safe space, which is what we need for active travel, it does require taking space, whether that is from car parking or taking a lane out.  That is where we need to go more than building out.  Building out is expensive and it requires compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, and additional land.  Covid gave us the opportunity to free up space because people were not commuting as much.  We must use some of that space quickly to provide a safe space, in particular for walking and cycling.  Those decisions are political decisions for local councils in particular.  I hope councils across the country will see this as an opportunity and they will be willing sometimes to make hard decisions.</p> <p>  With regard to the metro, the exact same thing applies in terms of speed and urgency.  Our public procurement process is so long and drawn out that it adds cost to projects.  Increasingly, in this current inflationary environment, time is money.  I have full confidence in Peter Walsh and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  I have seen the business case which we are getting ready to go to the Government.  It is a very good business case.  TII is highly capable.  It is probably the best agency in the State in terms of delivering large infrastructure projects.  I will be honest.  I am not certain that we must have this sequential process where we have two or three years in planning and then two or three years of procurement and then X number of years.  What I would be looking to see is if we could not co-ordinate in some way and do some of that work concurrently.</p></speech>

We want the big transport infrastructure projects built.  It does take a long time to build.  The physical reality of getting from Lissenhall to Ranelagh is not a small project.  It is huge and the complexity of it is not insignificant.  I do not believe that people should look on the 2035 date as an inevitability.  I believe it is our job to shorten that and to deliver it sooner if we can at all possible.</p></speech>

They are very much city orientated.  To date, electric buses are not working on the long distance Bus &Eacute;ireann routes.  That is one of the reasons we put three trial hydrogen buses on the longer distance routes.  To date, the battery electric buses are more suited to shorter distances.  A total of 165 electric buses are being contracted.  That is the big investment in public transport this year.  I refer in particular to the purchase of new battery electric trains, the intercity railcar, ICR, the rail carriages and the electric buses for rural and regional services.  We will have a significant increase in capacity.  We need it to coincide with BusConnects, which will require greater frequency and new services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and the National Transport Authority, NTA, are going to have to be clever because the patterns of demand may be changing post Covid, so there will be a fair bit of flexibility as to where they go.  The more those buses and those rail carriages go in, the more we can increase the capacity on the overall systems.  That is what they are designed to do.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of questions.  Am I right in saying the overall Department budget is down by 6%?  Is that a trend the Minister expects to continue?  What is the headline figure in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#F00200"><p>That is due to Covid support.  We had an enormous budget and as that declines, the budget decreases but not in the underlying sense.  In the national development plan, a political decision was taken that for the first four or five years of the plan, housing will scoop the full pot.  That is an appropriate political decision.  However, in the second half of this decade - and my colleagues from the Department of the Environment, Communications and Climate may wish to close their ears before I say this - spending on transport will ramp up.  That is appropriate because it will take time to get some of those projects, particularly the public transport projects, ready to go.</p></speech>

He said the Covid supports account for a significant part of that 6% budget decrease.  We have provided &euro;208 million to subsidise the public service obligation, PSO, routes on top of what would normally be given.  It seems strange there would be such a massive additional subvention for our public transport services at this time.  It was fair enough during the pandemic when people were encouraged not to use public transport.  Should we take this opportunity to encourage people onto public transport?  It is fair enough to encourage people back onto public transport but it would be better again to encourage people onto public transport for the first time.  That would align well with our climate objectives and modal shift.  I understand a piece of work has been done on the youth travel card, and the Minister might give us an update as to when that will happen and how it will affect the private operators, but is there a big idea from Government to reduce fares or anything else to encourage people back onto public transport in 2022?</p></speech>

Does public transport have a big role to play in that regard?  The Minister is dealing with the dual issues, one of which is encouraging people onto public transport, which has considerable benefits for climate change.  I often use the train and am a great believer in public transport.  The other issue is that of the cost of living.

On the wider point, Deputy O'Rourke is right.  I will go back to what I said about this moment as we come out of Covid-19.  Hybrid working and working from home have become realities, which is a positive development for towns and suburbs around the country because people will increasingly be working, living and staying in what might previously have been a commuter town for Dublin, Cork, Galway or Limerick.  Life will be brought back into those towns as people work from home, shop locally and so on.  That is positive.  However, it will lead to very changing transport patterns.  The reality is we are going to have to adjust our public transport system to suit that.</p> <p>  We are still providing significant Covid supports this year, to the tune of over &euro;200 million, as the Deputy said.  One of the reasons we expect to fully utilise that money is that our public transport numbers, according to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to whom I spoke during the week, are still only approximately 60% of pre-Covid numbers.  As we all know, the level of commuting is not back to anything like the level it was.  Tourism numbers are not there and even the level of socialising is probably still below what it was historically.  Our numbers are still down and the job is to get them back up.  How can we do that?  The youth travel card is one perfect way to do it because it is fundamental for those under 24 that we provide a 50% reduction in fares.  It has taken some time, and will still take a number of weeks, to roll it out.  We expect it before the end of April, initially on the PSO routes.  They are much easier for us to administer and manage in this way because they are interoperable and fully accounted for, as it were.  Commercial bus operations are useful and brilliant services but we do not set the prices for commercial bus operations.  Those operators set their own prices and, understandably, the same accounting mechanisms do not apply to them as those which apply for PSO services.  We are going to concentrate on the PSO routes first.</p> <p>  I will return to something I spoke to Deputy Duncan Smith about.  My belief is that we need to look at some of the BusConnects measures, which are starting to be rolled out.  Three more BusConnects routes in Dublin will be rolled out this year, two of which are already up and running.  As soon as we get BusConnects through planning in different cities, I will be looking for political support in councils across the country to look at some of the elements that can be accelerated.  There might be some instances, for example, where a bus gate could be put in.  That does not mean any trees must be chopped down or anyone's front garden will have to be taken or any pavement has to be broken up.  It may involve those areas where we can reorganise the traffic management system in this post-Covid time to give public transport a massive boost through more efficient timing, greater priority and so on.  That does not require huge budget expense.  It requires political commitment.  To put a bus gate into Rathmines main street, to use an example from my constituency, does not cost anything.  It is a traffic management measure and I will be looking to see are there examples such as that which we can accelerate ahead of what was originally planned.  If we do not, what will happen is traffic volumes will increase to fill the road space and make it difficult for the public transport system to work.  We are already seeing that happen.  We need to give the system a leg-up and more than anything else, we can do that through the allocation of space.</p></speech>

They are and remain a significant barrier.  If we are already providing additional subsidies to the public transport network when they are running well below capacity, there is real opportunity to do something in that regard.</p> <p>  The Minister pointed to the issue of hybrid working.  Another issue that frustrates people is the lack of flexibility in the tax-saver scheme for people who are working in the city two or three days a week.  There seems to have been no movement from the NTA or the Department in that regard.  Is that something that is being considered and on which there will be movement?  Can we expect to hear about that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#F01300"><p>I happened to have discussions with some of my officials on that topic this week.  Everyone recognises that the old system, which assumes everyone is commuting five days a week for 30, 40 or more weeks per year, is no longer most people's lived experience.  The NTA is engaging with partners to look at options to deliver more flexible projects.  Everyone wants to do that.  I was explaining one of the difficulties in this area to Deputy Nash in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Let us apply that notion to the Luas, for example.  In that case, it could be done tomorrow because with the Leap card system, which is a swipe-in and swipe-out system, people could easily measure how many days a week they are using it or allocate a certain amount of days and use it up to that threshold.</p><p>On a rail or bus system, we do not have those swipes on and off.  We do not have the data on the number of days per week or what journeys people take.  The absence of that data is a complication that makes it difficult.  We would ideally have a two- or three-day week taxsaver system.  Currently, the infrastructure is not there to back that up, which is why the NTA is taking time to look at every option and come up with a practical workaround solution.</p></speech>

I have experience of trying to be committed to public transport while working part-time.  The minute one moves away from it and back into the car, one saves time and money.  From a policy perspective, that is the wrong incentive and needs to be addressed.  There is huge opportunity to encourage people onto public transport if we make it make sense for them.  If people are increasingly hybrid working, the option of public transport will be more attractive than if they worked and commuted full time.  It behoves the Department, the NTA and all the stakeholders to do everything to resolve that.</p></speech>

Cost is a factor for many people.  At one stage, Irish Rail was pushing people to go online.  It brought the fares down and there was a huge uptake.  It is something that I ask be considered.  I take it the Minister has a submission gone into the Government from his Department on the issue.  I wish him well with that.  I will respect his decision not to comment.</p></speech>

It does not seem to operate exclusively across the board.</p> <p>  I want to get my head clear on something on page 3 of the briefing document.  In the programme for Government it says the ratio of spending on public transport to that on roads will be 2:1.  That is under the capital programme.  I am seeing that active travel is &euro;356 million and sustainable mobility is &euro;900 million.  That is roughly 50% of the capital budget.  Will the Minister elaborate on where the 2:1 is at?</p></speech>

Many are close to construction or in construction and there is ability to deliver on all those.  It is not the same in public transport.  We have not had a history or policy of promoting public transport in the State.  As a result, projects are only now coming to the planning phase, including DART+, metro and BusConnects.  Without being critical of any individual, there was a mistake in allowing a gap to open where we had no public transport projects in construction in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick or around the country.</p> <p>  We are turning that around.  The Connecting Ireland bus programme is one of the most significant and important new projects in public transport in the history of the State.  The BusConnects projects for all five cities are hugely significant and will be delivered.  Going back to what I said in the previous discussion, we can start delivering some of those elements.  We are already starting to roll them out.  Irish Rail was starved of investment over the years but that is being reversed.  There are the likes of the DART+ programme and the Cork metropolitan rail.  We will build DART for Cork in a short number of years.  I think we can do the same in Limerick.</p></speech>

The number of new grant-aided vehicles purchased will go from 6,000 to 18,000 this year.  There were 5,000 or some huge number purchased in January.  That would represent a threefold increase.</p><p>The number of grant-aided electric vehicle charging points has only doubled from 400.  Could there be an acceleration of the roll-out of charging points in terms of their location and the speed at which people can charge?  There is a public appetite to switch to electric vehicles.  It is clearly evident.  One of the features people mention is the lack of charging points.  There is a level of insecurity that people may not be able to make a full trip without stopping at a charging point.  The journey from Limerick to Dublin is an example.  What can be done to expedite the roll-out of charging points?</p></speech>

The Chairman's point is well made.  We have to accelerate it.  The Department will be publishing or finalising in the coming weeks to two months a full electric vehicle strategy on the best way to do it.  We are working in particular with local authorities.  We have to start looking at experimenting.  In rural areas this issue is much less of a problem.  In a one-off house in the country home charging is very easy and an immediate solution.</p></speech>

I actively go out and ask people.  In every estate we go into someone has a car charging.  The one issue that is raised is the location of charging points and the speed at which cars can be charged.  There is a belief that being on a motorway, for example the motorway from Limerick to Dublin, eats into the battery and uses it a bit quicker.  The only way we can overcome this is with additional charging points.  The batteries are getting bigger and they will get stronger.  What can be done at a policy level to expedite this if people are buying electric cars?</p></speech>

I believe petrol stations will have to switch over to cater for electric vehicles.  I will detail my personal experience without promoting any one brand.  Over the past year I have driven around the country a fair bit in an electric vehicle.  Those stations with high-speed fast charging are out there and they are the ones I am using.  They are the ones that will get the patronage.  The revenue will be in the coffee dock and in the shop.</p></speech>

This is key.  Getting the grid to these stations or moving stations to where the grid is strong is where we may go.  When this scales up and when we have a large number of vehicles charging at high speed it will require significant grid capacity.</p></speech>

It was slow at first.  I met the Irish Petrol Retailers Association and told the retailers they needed to speed this up.  I am glad to say they have done so over the past year.</p></speech>

The number of charging points should increase commensurate with the increase in the number of cars.  If there are extra charging points at a faster speed we will have even more people looking to purchase electric cars.  Some people are reticent.  As a non-technical person what are the challenges at present?  Why do we not see faster growth in the number of charging points?</p></speech>

There is a spend of &euro;225,000 this year.  National Broadband Ireland came before the committee recently.  Is the Minister satisfied with the pace of the roll-out of broadband?  Does he believe the taxpayer is getting value for money?  What is his overall perspective on where the roll-out of broadband is at present?</p></speech>

It is our job to kick everything on.  From my experience, and I said this in opposition as well as in government, the team we have in place in the Department is world-class in terms of skills, composition and dedication.  National Broadband Ireland is giving it full throttle.  It is in its interests for this to accelerate.  It wants to get customers.  It wants to pass as many houses as possible.  There have been obstacles.  The committee knows this better than anyone.  Many of those obstacles have been overcome.  We had obstacles with regard to getting planning permission for poles to go in.  Through very active engagement with local authorities, in fairness to them, they were overcome.  There is a very particular and significant obstacle at present in terms of the quality of some of the ducting and the need for resolutions on a far more frequent basis than had been predicted or expected.  The delay in getting some of these ducting issues cleared is one of the reasons it has been delayed.  I am confident these difficulties will be overcome.  The structure and teams involved are highly capable and highly committed.</p></speech>

The Minister is probably aware that Shannon Airport has no European hub connectivity.  It does have flights to Heathrow.  Aer Lingus was supposed to go ahead with a route from Shannon to Paris Charles de Gaulle in March 2020.  Covid intervened and we have also had Brexit.  Because of Brexit, Shannon Airport is exposed because we do not have direct hub connectivity with Europe.  The Minister is aware of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  It is for dealing with the impacts of Brexit.  Is the Department willing to consider Shannon Airport making a case that the Department would apply under the Brexit adjustment reserve fund in Europe for funding under a public service order for a route to be established to a hub such as Amsterdam?  There would not be a cost to the Exchequer.  It would be a cost to the Brexit adjustment fund.</p> <p>  Ireland has been allocated &euro;920 million overall.  It is the largest single contribution.  This funding is available for Departments and the Government to make an application.  I understand any application would have to come from the relevant Department.  I am trying to find something that would not be a charge directly on the Irish Exchequer.  This would come from a fund that is there.</p> <p>  Shannon Airport has been heavily impacted by Brexit.  We are the only Irish international airport that does not have direct European hub connectivity.</p></speech>

Throughout the Covid pandemic, we have looked, on a number of occasions and in a variety of ways, at what we can do to help some of our airports, particularly Cork and Shannon.  We looked in real detail at what can be done.  Even though the Chairman's suggestion involves funding coming from Europe and so on, it would, in effect, still be a PSO-type operation.</p></speech>

I am always impressed when he comes here and can rattle off the names of villages and various places.  He has a very good geographical knowledge and I was brimming with optimism when he mentioned Cratloe and some of the other stations on that rail line.  We hope to see progress in this regard and that the Minister will plough on with it.  We really want to see some of those projects in the mid-west delivered.</p> <p>  At the previous meeting he attended, I referenced the pricing of rail tickets.  I hope he will forgive me if this is repetition but it is an important point.  For my family of two adults and three children, a return rail trip to Dublin this coming Saturday to visit the zoo would cost &euro;150.90, which is the lowest fare I could find.  That is a return journey of four hours and 20 minutes.  It would cost &euro;152 to take me and my family from Amsterdam to Munich on a sleeper train, involving overnight travel.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the chronically high cost of rail services in Ireland.  I have already bought my ticket to travel by train to Dublin next Wednesday to attend the D&aacute;il because I know what time I need to be there.  It is possible to get cheaper fares when making travel plans a week or two weeks' ahead.  However, for parents who want to load all the children onto the train, it may cost &euro;150.  The same journey would cost me approximately &euro;40 in fuel if I were to drive from door to door.</p> <p>  People will only make the modal shift the Minister and all of us in this room want them to make when it makes sense from a pounds, shillings and pence point of view.  I know much of the answer is to be found beyond this room.  There is a role for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and it is to do with PSOs.  There really is a need for the Government to lead on this, grasp the nettle of expensive tickets and work to make rail travel cheap and viable.  The Minister is a fan of the train, as am I, and our colleague, Deputy Matthews, who is often at these meetings, is an even bigger fan.  In continental Europe, one can get across several countries for the same cost as travelling from Ennis or Limerick to Dublin and back.  That is wrong.</p></speech>

He should by all means share his thoughts with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He has a tough job, as do we all, in allocating scarce resources.  It might be useful for the Deputy to share some of his thinking with him.</p></speech>

I want to talk about new aviation.  I had a meeting in Shannon Airport yesterday and the people there are very excited about the return of transatlantic routes in March and the new summer routes out of the airport.  As the Chairman said, they want to build more routes and more connectivity.  One of the areas of real potential for Shannon, of which we are only scratching the surface, is new aviation.  Last October, FedEx launched a drone from Shannon, which delivered a parcel across the Shannon Estuary to Foynes.  We have a hub of testing facilities around Shannon looking at new aviation.  The one issue we have not looked at yet is hydrogen-powered flight.  We saw the first such commercial flight take off in December and many European countries, particularly Italy and Germany, are seizing all available European money to look into sustainable aviation.  It is where people are going.  There is a crazy irony that teenagers will go on the Internet and buy a pair of jeans that has to be shipped across the world but they may feel guilty about travelling on an aeroplane because of the environmental footprint.  People will increasingly look to sustainable travel, particularly for international journeys.  Is there anything the Minister hopes to lead out from his Department beyond scratching the surface in this area?  We need to go deep and ensure we are leaders, as we always were in the Shannon region, on sustainable aviation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#J01000"><p>Again, I agree with the Deputy.  We are only at the concept stage in this area, as are all countries.  When we read all the reports about great hydrogen plans, and there is evidence going into it now, we must remember that we are all at an early stage.  It is not yet clear and certain what exactly the alternative fuels will be.  There is a variety of potential options as well as different modes and capabilities, including, as the Deputy mentioned, hauling goods across the Shannon Estuary with a drone.</p> <p>  I said on the radio earlier that I am looking forward to my visit to Shannon Airport on Friday.  Shannon may have more potential than anywhere else to be a location for developing and testing such new solutions.  It has a great history, including the use of flying boats, and was, in effect, our first real point of connection.  Looking further south to Valentia Island, it was the first telecommunications connection with north-west America.  Shannon has a very long runway and can take very heavy payloads, which can increase efficiency.  It also has a small geographical benefit in being furthest west.  If we are looking at the very large volume of transatlantic traffic from Europe to America, Shannon, even just at a concept level, has a comparative competitive advantage.  As it happens, it is also in a location that will probably offer one of our greatest sources of clean renewable energy, with offshore wind that can be brought ashore and a very strong grid, the Moneypoint lines being very close.  It has very advanced manufacturing and a very large transport industry hub.  For that variety of reasons, there is great potential there.</p> <p>  At the Glasgow COP conference, I made the case for Shannon to the chief executive of United Airlines and a number of other people involved in the industry.  We started initial talks about whether they would be interested if we had some sort of hub where we could test latest technologies.  Governments providing that sort of safe-place location to test new sustainable transport systems makes a lot of sense.  It is only at a concept phase but it may be something that gives Shannon an advantage over other airports and destinations.</p></speech>

He is pushing an open door in Shannon.  There is a lot already happening, he and the industry are interested in it and there is funding in Europe to guide and steer it forward.  I hope it will be pursued further.</p> <p>  I must leave shortly to attend the D&aacute;il but I have two more brief questions.  The EU directive on the common system of VAT was amended in December, which potentially paves the way for action on the cost of bicycles.  I cycled here today, as I am sure did the Minister.  However, bicycles are still very costly.  In fact, they have become more costly at a time we want more people using them.  Is the Minister looking seriously, with his colleague, the Minister for Finance at having zero VAT on bicycles?</p> <p>  My final question relates to wind turbines.  I know this straddles two Departments and we had a chat about it only a few weeks ago.  I understand the guidelines are in the Minister's Department before they go back to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is crucial that they be updated.  The current guidance is grossly outdated, going back to 2006.  There are two sides of the coin when it comes to people's views on turbines.  In fact, most of us take a middle position in that we embrace renewable energy but are concerned by what we are seeing in some locations.  In parts of County Clare, there is a proliferation of turbines, some of them twice the height of Big Ben, the famous clock in the heart of London.  The siting of turbines in Gougane Barra in west Cork was on the news last night.  They are springing up everywhere.  They are positive on one hand but there is a proliferation of them in some parts of Ireland.  When I get the train, once I pass the Curragh towards Dublin, I do not see a single one.  They all seem to be dotted along the west coast.</p> <p>  When will we get the updated guidelines?  People will tolerate a certain number of turbines but it has now got to the point of proliferation and dumping on communities.  We need more rigorous guidelines that allow the industry to function - it, too, wants updated guidance - but also give some safeguarding to communities.  At the moment, we are nowhere.</p></speech>

There is a wider strategic move to offshore and away from onshore.  There will still be onshore wind development but there are certain capacity limits to that, including the needs of communities, the requirements of the grid and the fact that the efficiency, capacity and power resource is in the north-west Atlantic in particular.  The further north and north west we go, the more that power is available.</p></speech>

There is a real difficulty regarding how they would be applied.  There is real uncertainty as to how they could be applied.  That is the reason there has been such delay and difficulty.

That is the reason why they have been delayed and why there is such difficulty around them.</p></speech>

VAT rates are not easily adjusted or changed.  The Minister for Finance rightly protects that because it is often seen as such an easy solution to every problem.  My experience is that VAT rate reduction is not the easiest one to get over the line and it is not centre stage in the plans.  The key thing for active travel is safe space.  That is what is holding people back from taking to bikes in even greater numbers.</p></speech>

Being environmentally minded is in some people's DNA and they are already making modal shifts in their lives but for others, it will not be until it changes what is in their pockets - pounds, shillings and pence.  The cost of living has been a national debate this week.  As many people will make the modal shift when it makes sense economically, in that regard, there needs to be a bit of carrot and stick - more carrot than stick, of course.  Things like reducing VAT and making the train to Dublin much cheaper than going in the car will eventually get families and individuals off the armchair and on to the bike rather than taking the diesel or petrol engine car.  I think pounds, shillings and pence still matter to a lot of people.  I hope the Minister can lead that within Cabinet.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about people feeling safe.  Obviously, we saw the terrible tragedy that befell Ashling Murphy.  I was reflecting on the security aspect of greenways earlier today.  If people are to use greenways, they must feel safe.  Obviously, councils are rolling out most of the greenways.  What is being done in terms of the planning and design of greenways in terms of installing cameras and making areas safe because that is the one core element in terms of encouraging people to engage in active travel - walking, running or cycling?  People must feel safe.  Has policy changed in this area?  Are there areas the Minister can change or put resources into in order that when a local authority is building anything relating to active travel, a core element of that must be the provision of a safe environment for the public using it?  The acid test for me is whether a man, woman or family - obviously women are particularly vulnerable - feels safe.</p></speech>

It is not just about active travel.  It also relates to public transport in particular.  There was a very good research paper on this issue.  It is by design from start, particularly around bus stops, stations, public transport itself and active travel routes.  We need incorporate this thinking at every turn in everything we do.</p></speech>

There is a need for the Department to ask all local authorities to carry out an audit of their current active travel facilities, including greenways, to ensure they are safe.  I am not in any way questioning whether local authorities have done it but at the same time, certain points come along.  The murder of Ashling Murphy was utterly tragic.  Her parents were down in Limerick.  They are exceptional people.  Is it something the Minister is looking at?</p></speech>

There was a considerable amount of conversation around the investors.  Peter Hendrick has told us that on some level, the investor profile he has is not the investor profile he wants.  He spoke about two things.  One of them was how at some stage, NBI would become some sort of European super-telecoms outfit - I am not entirely sure how.  Beyond that, he also spoke about ensuring that one had somebody who was in it for the long haul.  I imagine this would be a telecoms investor.  Anyway, that is what it is.  Has there been discussion with the Minister about any of those possible investors or ensuring the viability of the entire project?</p></speech>

It has some of our best journalists and does really good reporting.  Obviously, there was real concern in some of the stories.  They raised issues around ownership structures and so on.  In response to that, we immediately commissioned independent legal and accounting review advice at the highest level to see whether we need to act and go further.  I have to be straight up.  There was a quick turnaround but the response from the independent review conducted by the lawyers and accountants, EY and William Fry, was that what had happened was as per the contract and normal business practice.  We responded immediately by asking for an independent assessment, which told us that it was within the contract and within business norms.</p></speech>

Nobody is happy that this has not reached the deadlines.  There is an acceptance regarding the Covid delays.  I will ask a couple of questions rather than have a couple of pieces of paper cross over.  Are we fairly sure 60,000 premises will be reached by the end of March?  Do we have what will be the new figure for the end of this year?  I know it was somewhere between 100,000 and 130,000 but it was to be firmed up.  Are we still talking about June for the piece on the acceleration?  I know it is twofold.</p><p>It involves the catch-up owing to Covid, the figure for which is a little higher than it was, and reducing the timeframe for the whole project to what NBI has said is six years.

Despite the best of intentions, several areas will not see broadband rolled out for some years.  There may be interim solutions, some of which may involve engagement with providers, including those providing low-Earth-orbit satellite broadband.  I suppose it is getting to a point whereby we can say to people that we intend to get to them in year four while also presenting them with the available alternatives.  That task force may be the body capable of doing this work.</p></speech>

It concerns the wider, national picture.  Almost ten years ago, the idea of task forces and collaboration in what is an inherently competitive market was touted.  The approach involves open-access networks, shared ducting and such elements.  That approach has actually delivered for us as a country.  While we have had some difficulties and delays in the roll-out of broadband nationally, the wider national picture - it is important to be aware of this - shows we are shooting up the international league tables in terms of high-speed broadband access.  The really significant investment being made across a variety of operators, which are competing to get to the householder as quickly as possible with fibre, means we are starting to see really high-speed broadband roll-out right across the country.  Obviously, the national broadband area has specific characteristics; that is why it exists.  The decision on it was the correct strategic decision.  It will be delivered upon.  That will put the country in a remarkably strong position.  Whether delivery is in five, six or seven years, it will happen.  Practically universal access to high-speed fibre broadband affords us the potential to be transformative because it means we can roll out public services, educational and other services-----</p></speech>

In some cases, there are plenty of people who will have the capacity and ability and who will do the due diligence work and research.  What we are talking about is just engaging with those stakeholders that might provide interim solutions for those who will be waiting several years.  Could the mobile phone and broadband task force be the body that could do some of this work?</p></speech>

We want it to consider this work and the idea of getting the State to do it, probably resulting in better engagement between constituents and Deputies on broadband provision.  This is an alternative to our submitting requests to telecommunications companies on the basis of what they cannot do, particularly regarding the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  I realise I am probably out of time.  I want to follow up on Deputy O'Rourke's remarks on the NTA.  We are all aware of the value of remote working and we all realise people are considering the idea of hybrid working.  A flexible tax-saver scheme is logical in this regard.  The NTA seems to have jettisoned this idea in the past while.  I accept what the Minister is saying about obstacles but we knew about those beforehand.  The NTA had said it was working on the matter and at times gave dates for completion.  What is the timeline?  Before we even have the infrastructure in place, could we not consider offering people the facility in question?  We could introduce the tests afterwards.</p></speech>

I would be very open to members of the committee showing me technological solutions that we could implement realistically at the railway stations in Dundalk and Drogheda.  There is no lack of desire to deliver; it is about having real-time solutions for the tens of thousands of customers who would have to be able to avail of the facility.</p></speech>

I am referring to where an individual in a country area has Eir fibre broadband while their neighbour over the ditch does not.  NBI has agreed to tender to determine whether we can expedite broadband roll-out in those areas.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  NBI is due to come back to us in the not-too-distant future on how it has got on with the tender.  I assume the Minister would be supportive of this.</p></speech>

The Minister will not die of shock if I speak about electrification, particularly in respect of the Enterprise line.  We are still talking about 2027 as the date for delivery on that.  I am working on the basis, whatever the outworkings of this review, that the resources will be in place to deliver it, with all the caveats surrounding planning, etc.</p></speech>

It was a very large consultation, especially in the North and, as I understand it, in the desire for connectivity to the north west, which makes a lot of sense, including quite radical solutions-----</p></speech>

That would require UK Government funding.  Nichola Mallon and I had meetings with Sir Peter Hendy twice on this issue to make the case.</p> <p>  Separately, the reality of the rail review is that it expanded from initially looking at the high speed Dublin-Belfast-Cork line to a much wider consideration of freight and other underutilised rail lines, such as Waterford-Limerick and the western rail corridor.  It will be very all-encompassing.  I am looking forward to seeing the results.  As we just talked about, I hope it will come up with innovative solutions to optimise the existing network and, where appropriate, expand it.  It is very expensive to expand the network but, to go back to the issue of Limerick and four underutilised rail lines in and out of a city, it is about whether we can optimise existing assets under the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, strategic direction.  I do not think we are making the best use of the existing network.   </p></speech>

We will have a level of engagement regarding it.  It is interesting what the Minister said about local authorities, EV infrastructure and the fact that there has probably not been a sufficient amount of work done.  That is something we probably need to butt into, for want of a better term.</p></speech>

There are technical issues, but the one thing that is coming across from the general public is there is a major appetite for the purchase of electric cars.  People are now, in many cases, holding back.  There is a tide in the affairs of men and, at present, electric vehicles are something the public has very much bought into, but there is a reluctance in some quarters regarding how far they can go.</p></speech>

He is a mechanic and a car salesperson who was clear in saying to me that he has an agenda in that he wants to sell more cars.  I know he had approached the local authority.  I assume a greater number of those conversations need to happen, but they have to go beyond that and towards putting operational projects in place wherever we can.  If we do not, especially if the funding is there,  it will be a misstep and we will all miss out.  Even when someone looks at buying a car, the first consideration is not being caught out in the sense of not having the infrastructure to deliver.  This will probably be fine in two, three or four years, but that will only be the case if we do that groundwork now.  We have to do a chase on that.</p> <p>  I will very quickly raise a few issues before I leave the meeting.  There have been a significant number of conversations about cybersecurity.  The Minister also spoke about the likes of the wind energy investments we will be talking about into the future.  Some of this may necessarily fall under defence, but it is that difficulty of cyber to physical and ensuring that we have all the capacity necessary.  The last thing I will ask the Minister relates to the An Post taskforce.  Where are we on that piece of work?  It is all about the sustainability and viability of the network.  </p></speech>

An Post is facing a difficult transition but one it is successfully managing as letter post decreases and parcel deliveries increase.  The company is expanding significantly in the latter area.  The real key is also expanding the post office network as a supplier of government services, for example, the one-stop shop capability we announced yesterday.  An Post has already gone into the market for retrofitting, where it brings the pieces together, which are energy expertise, finance and the management process.</p></speech>

It is a little unusual that under recording of penalty points the Department is estimating a figure in advance of the year itself.  Is that an estimate?</p></speech>

One of the bigger issues in Adare has been the lack of a bypass.  I know the Minister has tried to get through Adare.  Once again, rail and road are not mutually exclusive.  We also need to bring people from other areas of the country, such as Cork, via the M20.  I am once again saying, and it is a philosophy of mine, that road and rail are not mutually exclusive.  I totally buy into rail but, equally, there is a serious problem in Adare with the lack of a bypass and the bottleneck.  The bypass is before An Bord Plean&aacute;la at present and we are looking at the M20 project coming forward as well.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that Adare has a serious problem with traffic.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with Adare and it is clogged with traffic.  When that bypass goes in, and it is in planning at present, we should be radical in looking at mechanisms to really reassess the public space and possibly move away from through traffic.  A village like Adare would really benefit from that sort of space.</p></speech>

It is due to come through An Bord Plean&aacute;la imminently.  I presume it is something that the Department will very much factor in.  I know the Minister is under time pressure.</p></speech>

I have concerns about regional balance, how it will be achieved and how it is playing out in practice.  I am looking at two issues in particular.  The first is the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, review.</p><p>As I understand it, DART+ and MetroLink are included in that review.  My colleagues in the west of Ireland are concerned that the proposed western arc project is not included, and that that does and will put that region at a considerable disadvantage between now and 2030 in respect of accessing European funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#N00200"><p>My officials inform me that the TEN-T review is looking at existing infrastructure.  Subject to the strategic rail review, however, we will be able to go back to the European Commission and reconsider this aspect.  If the rail review were to come up with recommendations in that regard, then that would help us in being able to go back and reopen this issue with the European Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.454" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#N00300"><p>Therefore, there is an opportunity.  The concern is that this TEN-T review closes the door for a considerable period.  The Minister is saying that is not the case.</p></speech>

The strategic rail review is designed to give us that capability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#N00500"><p>We will be hearing about the western rail corridor and rail links to Navan and elsewhere as part of our considerations.  On a related point, we asked specific questions about the NTA funding for active travel projects undertaken in 2021, broken down by local authorities and other bodies.  We did the same for cycling and walking projects in 2021.  The geographic spread of such projects is incredibly stark in respect of the advantage enjoyed by certain areas.  I appreciate that we are not always comparing like with like.</p> <p>  To give some examples, University College Dublin, UCD, in the south of Dublin, got &euro;607,389 in funding.  Meanwhile, County Laois got &euro;413,100 and County Westmeath received &euro;205,000.  Those are the smaller figures.  As might be expected, the Dublin local authorities got significant allocations.  Those local authorities that I mentioned in the midlands, however, are in the just transition area, which is most impacted by the effects of the transition away from fossil fuels.  They are particularly disadvantaged in this transition and they seem to be faring poorly in the allocation of State funding.  I wonder how the Government will ensure that there is going to be an element of fairness and equity in these schemes.</p></speech>

I refer to this being a case of the survival of the fittest and of first up, best dressed.  When it comes to local authorities competing to see who will be the best dressed, for me it is no coincidence that these schemes were launched in the Dublin suburbs.  I say that with the greatest of respect for those areas; they are as entitled to fight their case as anybody else.  There is a particular challenge here, however, that must be recognised and addressed.  I refer to ensuring there is capacity at local government level to avail of these schemes and to put them to use.  I say that because everybody has an equal right to have liveable towns and villages.</p></speech>

In the broader context of this planned climate transition, the fundamental underlying political reality we must live up to is that every place and every person matters.  It cannot be a situation of rural versus urban.  We must try to provide for both.  Much of this would come down to local authorities saying they are not resourced and that they do not have the resources to be able to apply for these schemes.  It is not because of a lack of will or a lack of interest.  If that were the case, then they would have a real problem.  We provided significant new numbers of engineering staff, particularly for active travel projects around the country, and, to be honest, it was not just the rural local authorities that were slow in this regard.  Dublin City Council, DCC, did not fill its positions either.  It beggars my mind as to why that was the case.</p></speech>

Having spoken to people in my region, they would say their local authority got additional staff, but they came from the local authority next door.  In turn, that same local authority which got the extra staff might also have lost staff to its neighbouring local authority.  Therefore, I understand that this endeavour will take time.  What I am saying, in the context of an initial exploration of the practical outworking of this significant State investment, is that it does not seem to be equally distributed across the State.  This is something that may require intervention in future</p></speech>

Greenways are connected to active travel; they are not separate.  That body does undertake its considerations and operate in a national context, and that may help in connecting everything up.</p></speech>

We can be frustrated by projects not having reached particular stages, of course.  Those interactive maps exist for the Twenty-six Counties.  The Minister already has a long list of things to be done in this area, but I think we should map the projects now under way in this context and have them interactive in respect of where they stand in the context of this roll-out.</p></speech>

It is under great pressure and hauliers took to the streets before Christmas.  The Minister met with members of the representative bodies, and he indicated that some moves would be made after Christmas.  What is he doing for that sector and what does he intend to do for it?  Will anything be included for this sector in the cost-of-living proposals to be announced?  Equally, has consideration been given to supporting the sector in making the transition to using engines and fuels which give rise to low carbon emissions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#N01400"><p>We had a good meeting with representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA.  They have a good reputation in respect of how they represent their members and how they have worked with the Department over the years.  Even recently, in the context of some of the Covid-19 measures, the members of the IRHA played a helpful role in the context of the flexibility we needed.  The same applied with Brexit as well.  This issue of high fuel prices is not an easy one to resolve, to be up front and honest about it.  We have had extensive discussions with the Department of Finance and we are looking at a range of different options in this regard.  I do not think the cost-of-living proposals to be announced tomorrow will be the time to deal with this aspect.  What will be announced then will be a small number of more general measures for the wider population.</p> <p>  We have, however, committed to talking to the representatives of the road hauliers again to explore what we can do for the sector.  Whatever it is we do, it must help in the decarbonisation of society.  There is no point in us going down the wrong road and delaying this transition.  I am keen to try to support the haulage industry in adapting and to help it thrive.  It is typically often a low-margin industry, with many good small family businesses.  The supports the Deputy referred to will not be contained in the measures to be announced tomorrow.  As I said, we must go back to the hauliers to drill down further into how we can work together on this issue.</p></speech>

The hauliers have protested on the streets twice now.  The economic challenge posed to them has not got any easier.  There are aspects that could be addressed, including, for example, the fuel rebate and the alternative fuels excluded from that measure.  If one speaks to hauliers, they will point out the types of supports they require to move towards Euro 6-compliant vehicles, or an alternative.  Equally, some of the schemes we have are oversubscribed.  There is an opportunity here to undertake both endeavours, but the hauliers must be supported.</p></speech>

The European transport plan is to move away from such fuel rebates.  It is effectively being said that they will come to an end.  Therefore, there are no easy silver-bullet measures in this regard.  I refer to the use of alternative fuels and alternative engines.</p><p>My own view is we should look to see whether we can make the journeys quicker and help hauliers through improved journey times in a variety of ways.  It is not just about the fuels.  We could also look at our haulage system in the context of the ongoing wider haulage strategy, in addition to the rail strategy review.  Can we devise new haulage systems that mean hauliers are running empty less and so are getting paid more?  We need to look at a whole range of different options.  Can we look at alternative vehicles?  They are very expensive at present compared with diesel vehicles, but we will have to look at a variety of options.  The existing rebate scheme is the easy option, while even European directives and legislation are coming to an end.  We will have to be more creative and look at a variety of options. </p></speech>

Does that mean we have to have major capacity motorways in all cases?  To my mind, no, but we have to first and foremost focus on towns.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, launched our towns first strategy this week.  Transport is part of that, as is taking traffic out of the centre of our towns as best we can.</p></speech>

My primary purpose was to ask the Minister about the Adare bypass.  In fairness, he has given an update on that.  As I said, the other two projects are going through a process of their own at present.  Does the Minister wish to make any concluding comments?</p></speech>
