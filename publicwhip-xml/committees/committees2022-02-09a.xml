I welcome Dr. Alan Moore and the representatives of Hedgerows Ireland and thank them for coming before the committee today to engage with us on hedgerows, carbon and biodiversity.</p> <p>  In regard to Covid-19, with effect from 25 January 2022, members and witnesses have the option of attending committee meetings in the relevant committee room rather than participating via MS Teams.  Masks should continue to be worn by those present when not addressing the committee.  Room capacity will continue to be reduced in the short term until all microphones and seating can be returned.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means a witness has full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as far as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third party or entity.  Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts, and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.</p> <p>  Today's witnesses representing Hedgerows Ireland are Dr. Alan Moore, secretary; Ms Lilian O'Sullivan, external expert, Teagasc; Mr. Michael Hickey, committee member and beef farmer; Ms Shirley Clerkin, heritage officer, Monaghan County Council; and Mr. Donal Sheehan, diary farmer and project manager.  Mr. Sheehan is joining us remotely.  I invite Dr. Moore to make his opening remarks before we have questions from the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#C00200"><p>I thank the members for inviting us to the attend the joint committee.  The central message of our presentation is that Ireland's hedgerows are a fantastic asset in a range of different but complementary ways, but we are currently failing to value them, protect them and reward farmers for looking after them.  As a consequence, they are being continually removed at a rate of thousands of kilometres a year, and because of the way they are managed, remaining hedgerows are often in poor condition and so are not providing all of the multiple benefits they could.  For this reason, we are making a key recommendation that immediate steps are taken to protect our remaining hedgerows from further removal and that a number of other measures are adopted to improve both the management and payment systems for the future.  Contrary to previous teaching and advice, it is now accepted that the net economic, climate, biodiversity and social benefits of hedgerows on farms fully justify the land that they occupy on all farms, including tillage and intensive dairy farms, where the losses are often the greatest.  Recommending better protection and payment for hedgerows is fully in line with the latest thinking and research on how Ireland can meet our very demanding carbon and climate goals.<br/><br/>Good quality hedgerows do vital things, including carbon sequestration, playing an increasingly important role in flood control, water quality and soil improvement, and providing shelter, shade, disease control, biodiversity sanctuary, and landscape definition - literally how our countryside looks.  Despite these benefits, 2,000 km to 6,000 km of hedgerows are still being removed annually in Ireland.  The lower figure is from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which seems very high in itself, but the extraordinary higher figure of 6,000 km is from the recently published Monaghan hedgerow survey, in which Ms Clerkin was involved.  This means that on our watch, a resource that is vital for so many reasons is being lost at a huge rate.  We are literally grubbing up and destroying a vital asset, and this is happening on our watch.<br/><br/>Why does it matter?  I want to focus briefly on two particular benefits, namely, carbon sequestration and biodiversity.  Carbon sequestration is now seen as crucial to farming and the new carbon farming business.  The figures for hedgerows are very significant indeed<font color="#4181C0">.  </font>The Teagasc farm carbon hedgerow project is working on this at the moment, using drone technology.  By early next year, we will have a carbon score at an individual farm scale, which has massive implications for carbon accounting as we reach towards our reduction goals.  Ms O'Sullivan will be happy to answer questions about it.  What is already known is that bigger, wider, taller, denser and more mature hedges store far more carbon.  Early results show that approximately 600,000 tonnes of carbon are stored by our hedgerows but the potential could be 1 million tonnes and upwards.  The higher figures are directly related to good management methods, the avoidance of, for example, severe or excessive cutting, and, of course, stopping further removal.<br/><br/>Looking at biodiversity, good quality hedgerows are a vital habitat for animals, bird and insect species, particularly pollinators, which as we know are under severe threat.  Two thirds of our native birds either feed or nest or both in hedgerows, and they are home to more than 600 of our 800 flowering plants.  Because of our very low forest cover, which is 11% compared with the European average of 40%, hedges play a correspondingly far greater role in our biodiversity.  We have a lot more to lose if we continue on our current path.  Our hedgerows have been described as Ireland&rsquo;s equivalent of the Amazon rainforest.  Again, management techniques are critically important to biodiversity here.<br/><br/>If we are removing thousands of kilometres of hedgerows annually, are there no protective checks and balances against this?  First, hedgerows have no direct protection under current law.  Indirect protection only is provided during the nesting season under section 40 of the Wildlife Act<font color="#0000FF">. </font>In practice, this legislation is unwieldy, has many exemptions and provides no protection out of the so-called closed season.  In fact, it is considered to be in breach of the EU birds directive.  Second, where landowners plan to remove more than 500 m of hedgerow, they are supposed to apply to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the environmental impact assessment regulations.  In practice, 95% of these applications are given the go-ahead.  In a recent study, no environmental assessments were carried out in the five-year study period.  Under cross-compliance, if you take out a hedgerow, you are supposed to plant an equivalent length before removal to continue your basic payments.</p><p>We know, however, that a new hedge will take 20 to 50 years to reach the same carbon and biodiversity values.  We have concerns about the level of oversight of this replanting and the quality and species diversity of what is being replanted.  Hedgerow quality is a huge concern.  Ms Clerkin's recent Monaghan study and another study in the south east last year found that only about 10% of hedgerows are in good condition.  Excessive cutting and herbicide and fertiliser use were the main issues, as were neglect and a lack of rejuvenation.  Ms Clerkin's study is devastating in its findings.</p><p> As for education and training, there are currently no hedge management certification courses running.  They used to take place but there has been nothing for several years.  There is, however, the excellent annual Hedgerow Week, run by Catherine Keena of Teagasc, as well as online Teagasc information.</p><p> As for Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments, we do not know what the final schemes will be but it looks like the recommendations of our group and several others have not been included.  It was suggested that the quality and management of existing hedgerows be rewarded under both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 schemes, giving a financial incentive for taller, wider and more productive hedges.  CAP is good on new planting, and that is great, but it is missing out on an easy win in respect of our existing hedges.</p><p> As for forestry, hedgerows are effectively being lost to forestry with exotic species because the recommendations of the EPA BioForest project are not being followed in respect of minimum setback distances, which are needed to ensure that hedges are not shaded to destruction.</p><p> We have made five recommendations.  The first is that legal protection for hedgerows, by either a new amendment to the Wildlife Act 1976 or new legislation, be considered.  In the immediate term, the interpretation and implementation of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, regulations by the Department should be urgently reviewed.  Third, the new CAP schemes should recognise and reward good hedgerow management.  Fourth, hedge management courses and certification should be reintroduced.  It should be a requirement that hedge-cutting contractors complete these, as with the requirements for pesticide spraying, for example.  Hedgerow management deserves to be a specialty area.  Finally, implementation of the EPA recommendations on setback from hedgerows in forestry should take place.</p></speech>

Ms Clerkin might wish to respond because the matter is dealt with in her report.  How can fertiliser have a negative impact on hedgerows?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Shirley Clerkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#D00300"><p>Because of its high level of phosphates, fertiliser, if it is spread too close to a hedge or if the run-off from it reaches a hedgerow, can affect the species diversity of a hedgerow.  The floristic diversity of a hedge is one of its quality features.  It can house a variety of flora.  If it has too much nutrient input, you end up with a lot of nettle and dock and a few other species, so it results in a lower quality hedge because of a lower number of species.  That is how fertiliser affects hedgerows.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#D00400"><p>Could Dr. Moore expand a little on the implementation of the EPA recommendations on setback from hedgerows and forestry?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#D00500"><p>The EPA BioForest project recommended a minimum setback from new forestry plantation in order to allow hedgerows to flourish where they are being impinged by new forestry.  A distance of 7 m was recommended, but currently a distance of 3 m is being applied.  One recommendation is that the EPA study is implemented.  The effect of the shorter distance is that hedgerows are being encroached and obliterated by new coniferous forestation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#D00600"><p>I thank Ms Clerkin and Dr. Moore for those clarifications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#D00700"><p>I welcome our guests.  We have met Dr. Moore and Mr. Hickey before.  The sector we are talking about is struggling to deal with paperwork, red tape and so on as it is, and farming is so difficult these days.  Will the suggestions the witnesses are presenting us with result in farmers having to wade through a raft of further regulations, or is there a way in which the benefits of good hedgerows can fit into established practices?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#D00800"><p>I will take that question and might then hand it over to Mr. Hickey or Mr. Sheehan.  Essentially, our position is that this is a win-win situation and that hedgerows could provide a real way forward in meeting our carbon and biodiversity challenges.  We strongly recommend that farmers are paid for good-quality hedgerows.  We do not foresee extra paperwork or extra difficulty - far from it.  We think there would be a win-win all around.  In answering the Deputy's question, I wish to turn, if I may, to Mr. Sheehan, who is working on the Biodiversity Regeneration in a Dairying Environment, BRIDE, project, to talk about the benefits to him of good-quality hedgerows.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Sheehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#D00900"><p>Thank you, Chairman, for the opportunity to speak to your committee, and I thank Dr. Moore for the invitation.  My name is Donal Sheehan.  I am a dairy farmer who milks 72 spring-calving dairy cows in Castlelyons, part of the River Bride valley area of north Cork.  As well as being a farmer, I am one of the people involved in the BRIDE project.  The project is one of many European Innovation Partnership projects, EIPs, scattered throughout the country.  Ours was set up to provide a template and a knowledge transfer for the wider agricultural community on different aspects of environmental and sustainable food production practices.  It is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the EU.  It was initiated by two farmers and an ecologist, all frustrated by the way our farming system was damaging the environment while farmers themselves were being blamed by the public.  There was a need to showcase a more positive image as well as improving biodiversity and water quality and reducing our carbon footprint.  The project aims to incentivise farmers to retain all their natural farmland habitats, that is, what is called the space for nature.  That term is now widely used not just here but in the EU generally.  We also incentivise farmers to increase the space for nature, especially where habitats such as hedgerows have been removed over the years.  The project pays out capital funding of &euro;2,000 per farmer for the creation of new habitats such as hedgerows and woodlands.  It also provides an annual results-based payment based on the ecological quality of the various habitats, including hedgerows, found on the farm.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Browne's question, because I am a farmer, I am very much aware of the paperwork involved in farming nowadays, especially for a generation that may not be used to it.  There is no paperwork involved in hedgerow management.  You use a mechanical hedge cutter.  You side-trim the hedgerows; you do not top them.  Our project offers lower payments where hedgerow management is poorer.  If your hedges have the standard short, back and sides, we will call it, that is not the way we want them managed, so you will get a lower payment.  If the hedgerows are allowed to mature and to grow, you get more or less the top payment.  I am not sure if the committee has hard copies of my presentation - I sent it on as a Word document - but the scorecards for both new hedgerows and existing hedgerows are on it.  Ultimately, we want farmers to start managing their hedgerows in a similar fashion, with everyone singing from the same environmental hymn sheet.  As Dr. Moore said, there needs to be a payment for these habitats because there is currently no value placed on them.  There is no legal protection in respect of them.</p> <p>  As Members will see in the presentation if they have it, we funded farmers to the tune of &euro;100,000 last year for putting in capital measures such as hedgerows, woodlands, ponds, field margins, etc.  All of them can be taken out because of the Wildlife Act.  There is a discrepancy in the Act.  I will quote the relevant passage in the Act because it is quite interesting.</p><p>It states:</p><blockquote>	40. - (1)(<i>a</i>) It shall be an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy, during the period beginning on the 1st day of March and ending on the 31st day of August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated.<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) It shall be an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy any vegetation growing in any hedge or ditch during the period mentioned in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of this subsection. </blockquote><p>Section 40(2) states:</p><blockquote>	(2)<i>Subsection (1)</i>of this section shall not apply in relation to -   	(<i>a</i>) the destroying, in the ordinary course of agriculture or forestry, of any vegetation growing on or in any hedge or ditch;  </blockquote><p>In other words, a person is not allowed to take out hedgerows except in the business of farming.  It might seem severe to farmers who are listening but that has done more damage to farming because our image is being ruined.  We are perceived as being the destroyers of the environment.  We cannot blame farmers as this is the price of cheap food production, with habitats being removed purely to increase food production.  Until there is some sort of protection and value put on our hedgerows and all other natural habitats, this will continue.</p></speech>

What we are saying is there is a large resource of hedgerows in Ireland now right across the country.  It is a habitat with which everyone is familiar.  In some ways, as a result, it is kind of a shifting baseline.  We have not really noticed the damage we have done to it.  The Monaghan survey carried out last year is an exact replica of a study done in 2010.  It uses a template and survey methodology that was agreed by Woodlands of Ireland and the Heritage Council way back between 2010 and 2012.  It has been used across 21 counties at this stage but we are the first county to repeat it.  We did so because during the consultation for the biodiversity and heritage plan of County Monaghan, we got many submissions about hedgerow quality, quantity and concerns from members of the public.  As a result of that intervention by the public, it was entered as an action in our biodiversity and heritage plan.  That is why we repeated the study.</p> <p>  The study indicates we clearly have a problem with the removal of hedges.  It is quite a high percentage - perhaps 9% - over the past ten years.  It also demonstrates that because of overmanagement in some cases and undermanagement in others, the resource has been damaged.  Such issues can be addressed, however, and the position I want to emphasise is that older hedges are better.  They are longer established and have more species diversity in them.  Townland boundaries in particular have more species diversity because they often go right back to Gaelic times and are early medieval boundaries.  The enclosure of fields for agriculture thereafter is a little more modern but they are still really important for biodiversity.  They have fungal networks under the hedges and retain carbon under and within the hedges when they grow, which is a biomass value.</p> <p>  There is a role for hedges in biodiversity, nutrients, buffering for ditches and water courses, habitats and connectivity in the landscape, particularly now in a time of climate change and more intense weather patterns.  They act as flood control and mitigation and allow the landscape to be much more resilient.  They are very important.  We found 88% of the hedges in Monaghan were "unfavourable" in our survey, with 55% of this due to "gappiness" and 40% due to nutrient enrichment.  Approximately 75% of them are affected by poaching and not being fenced properly.  Virgin diversity has decreased as well.  Many of these factors can be addressed, and that is the point we want to make today.  There is a major opportunity for the farming sector to contribute to biodiversity in Ireland very simply by changing the management practices of the hedgerows and having contractors managing them in different ways.  Farmers could in some cases put less effort into managing their hedgerows, making them wider and allowing them to be fenced off.  Perhaps they could graze them at the end of the summer.  There could be a reward scheme for good-quality hedges.</p> <p>  It is advocated in the report and we echo the call for a results-based payments scheme for hedgerows based on the quality of the hedges.  That is just as Mr. Sheehan has said.  If a hedge is bigger, wider, absorbing more carbon and providing more species and benefits to livestock as shelter, for example, the farmer should get a higher payment.  We would really love to see a scheme like that be introduced into Pillar 1 or Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p></speech>

The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission recognises the role of new hedgerows for the connectivity of the landscape and connecting habitats.  We can think of one's heart and the heart does not function without arteries.  It is the same for nature as the other habitats attached to hedgerows will not function and will get progressively smaller without our hedgerows.  They are a very important habitat.</p> <p>  A new hedgerow, if attached to older hedgerows, will see species move across and it will gradually become more species-rich and sequester more carbon over a longer period.  We have an existing network, however.  It is a bit like saying we should ignore the crown jewels we have in order to find a whole new set of diamonds buried somewhere in earth.  We have these so let us use them and find a way to do something really positive for farming and nature.  As Mr. Sheehan correctly states, it is positive for food productivity and the image of the food being produced in Ireland.  We should be able to show our hedgerows as really good habitats that the farmers of Ireland are producing.</p></speech>

Why are the figures so vague?  As they are so vague, are we even getting true figures on the benefits of new hedgerows?</p></speech>

It came from a random selection but it was an exact random selection.  County Monaghan, for example, is divided into approximately 12.5 km squares.  There is a 10 km square and a 1 km square on the left-hand side box of each of those, and all the hedges in that were surveyed.  That is the methodology for the survey right across the country.</p> <p>  In County Monaghan in 2010 we had 12,845 km of hedges and in 2021 we had 11,921 km of hedges, meaning we probably lost 1,154 km of hedges in our small county.  Now I know we are a drumlin landscape and there may be other factors.  I certainly know from anecdotal evidence and speaking with colleagues in other counties that similar concerns come to them as heritage officers in their local authorities.  The Deputy knows how heritage officers are in contact with local communities.  We have contacts in local areas all around our counties and that is the news coming to us.  It is worrying but we can do something.  That is the important point.  Planting new hedgerows where none exists is always good but keeping what we have and improving them is equally or more important.</p></speech>

Our engagement with the company was essentially unsatisfactory.  In brief, we were concerned that with fencing replacement operations, the method being used was to remove the entire hedgerow rather than working with the existing one.  That project led us to discover all the issues the committee has heard about this evening, including a lack of protection of hedgerows and the failure to implement environmental assessments when removal is proposed.  We do not feel we have got very far with Irish Rail but the recommendations we make will protect not only Irish Rail hedgerows but the entire network being discussed this evening.</p></speech>

I want to get to the kernel of the issue and get some more information.  Depending on what one reads, we are talking about approximately 380,000 km, give or take, of hedgerow in the country.  That amounts to 4% of the land.  If that is turned into square kilometres, it is 690 sq. km.  How does that compare with other countries?  I drive in continental Europe a lot and I would not see a hedge on the side of the road at all.  As I said, I am not trying to be anti-anything that was said here because I agree, we have issues when it comes to biodiversity.  I accept what Mr. Sheehan is doing and what he said in that we are farmer bashing here.  We have to remember that somebody preserved, is the custodian of, and cares for, albeit not to the standard the witnesses require, those 380,000 km.  Perhaps I can be provided with a comparison, but I believe this is way ahead of the European norm.  The farmers have within reason and without compensation, which I would welcome and is being sought, been the custodians of those hedgerows.  Many of those hedgerows have survived.  I do not want the message going out from this committee that we are knocking the farmers again for having gouged them all.  Many hedgerows have survived, but perhaps not as much as the witnesses would like.</p><p> I have a couple of other questions on when surveys are done.  In regard to sequestration value and the carbon storage value, how accurate is the science being used?  When will we get a definitive figure?  I refer to when we are calculating those figures and will use my own example.  I built a house in rural Ireland on a site between a quarter to a half acre in size.  It is nearly all shrubs, bushes and hedges.  Is that taken into consideration when calculations are done?  That half-acre site, rather than having cows or bulls on it, is literally green and if herself at home had her way, it would all be green.  There are many houses around Ireland on quarter-acre or half-acre sites that are in complete greenery, other than the side of the house or the driveway.  Do we consider that when we are doing our calculations?  If that is a farmer's home, when the hedges around his fields or his paddocks are included, would he get credit for those around the half acre?</p><p> The setback between hedgerow and forestry was referred to.  The Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, having gone through the D&aacute;il, was before the Seanad yesterday.  It will open up the positivity of planting up to 1 ha of riparian or agroforestry without licence.  What role will that measure play?  I need more information about the setbacks and how hedgerows affect forestry.  From a hedgerow point of view, will it be more of a hindrance than a help to biodiversity and the environment?   I would like that explained further.</p><p> In situations of hedge cutting and the open and closed season, the issue of roadside safety will always be raised.  What is the solution to that issue?  Those hedges have to be trimmed every year.  How does one incorporate that from a safety point of view?</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned the 380,000 km of hedgerows.  In fact, we have perhaps double that amount.  The estimate from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is that we have up to 700,000 km of hedgerow but many of them are in poor condition.  What we do not have is native woodlands.  We have about 1.5% of cover for native woodlands.  In essence, our hedgerows are our woodland cover.  That is why they are relatively more important in this country compared with other countries.  We have better hedgerows than, for example, continental Europe, but in comparison with the UK we are not doing so well.  In answer to the question about the measurement of scrub and bushes and so on, I will hand over to Ms O'Sullivan.  She has the answers on the farm carbon survey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lilian O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#F00300"><p>I thank Dr. Moore for inviting me here and Senator Daly for his question on the science and where we are in terms of carbon stock sequestration and so forth.  It is important to point out that Teagasc has been working in collaboration with partners since 2010 to explore the climate regulation potential of hedgerows and, in particular, their relevance to land-use budgets.  Of course, we all know the linear structures we see in agricultural landscapes which consist of shrubs and trees.  While they are primarily agricultural field borders and boundaries and form part of the farms, they are counted under the land use category in the inventories.</p> <p>  For the purpose of accounting mechanisms, there are a few things we need to know.  We need to be able to give the amount of carbon stored in hedgerows nationally.  We need to know the annual sequestration figures, that is the amount of additional new carbon that is stored in the growing hedgerow every year.  To do that we need to know that the extent of the hedgerows, such as the width, height and the type, the extent of management that has been applied and, if there are trees etc., whether they are new or old.  We need to know a typical amount of carbon that is stored in hedgerows, which is not only in the above-ground biomass.  It is present in the woody biomass, in the leaves as well as carbon in the below-ground biomass in the roots and in the soils under the hedgerow, in addition to the leaf litter that is cycled back into the system.</p> <p>  In answering some of those questions, a lot of research has been done on understanding the hedgerow extent.  The first hedgerow map was published in 2011, which estimated that 6% of the country was covered in hedgerow and scrub, non-forest trees and woody plants, with up to 12% cover in County Monaghan.  Subsequent to that, there was a further project that used light detection and ranging, or LiDAR, a laser scanning technique.  It was tested for its ability to estimate the amount of biomass from which the amount of carbon storage and sequestration can be inferred.  From that work, we got some of the numbers that are often cited.  We know LiDAR is very effective in accurately measuring biomass.  Using published models, we are able to garner those national estimates.  There is anywhere between 0.3 and 1.1 mega tonnes of CO2 per annum, which is not insignificant.  As LiDAR is expensive, further projects were commenced.  We have had the BRIAR project, which explored the potential of radar, but ultimately LiDAR or photogrammetry from aircraft or drone are required to get accurate estimates of biomass.  We obtained the figure of about 680,000 km from that work.</p> <p>  One of the issues that repeatedly come up is that we need to take some direct measurements of biomass so that we can use them to quantify carbon stock changes for these inventories.  The challenge is to track carbon stock change over time on a national scale.  The current project I am leading is called the farm carbon project.  In the earlier work, previously published models were used, but they were built on published forestry models.  This is the first time we are characterising the relationship between biomass and carbon through field studies.  Ultimately, what we are doing is relating biomass to a remote measurement that is then measured for carbon.  We will then have true data that will allow us to build biomass functions whereby a remote measurement detects a certain amount of biomass that can then indicate a certain carbon stock.  The idea is that one can see whether that increases or decreases over time.  That work is ongoing.  It is being pushed through the laboratory and we expect to publish results by September.  We are also developing a scorecard that will allow for a rapid in-field assessment as to the quality of a hedgerow from a carbon perspective.</p></speech>

That is a brand new scheme and the distance of 7 m would pertain to forests.  It will be looked at in the future but I am sure it will not be 7 m for a hectare because there would not be much left for forestry in that case.</p> <p>  As for our European cousins, we have all seen and travelled across Germany, France and so forth, where the hedgerows have gone.  Instead they have blocks of forestry in much greater number than we do.  They are therefore able to meet their carbon sequestration targets that way, whereas our forestry cover is very low - I think it is 11% - and our hedgerows make up 6% of our land.</p> <p>  As for the bigger picture, worldwide, the tipping point for carbon dioxide is now 350 parts per million.  We are at well over 400 parts per million, so the knocking is way past the door at this stage.  We need to do something.  As Ms O'Sullivan has pointed out, we have this jewel in front of us in our hedgerows that we can claim as carbon sequestration and we are not using it.  We are not counting it.</p></speech>

In the BRIDE project, roadside hedges are scored in the same way as internal hedges.  They are expected to be side-trimmed, but there is no obligation on any farmer to cut and shave them, as is often seen.  Farmers get penalised if their hedges are overgrown and encroaching onto the road.</p> <p>  As for the half-acre's worth of carbon sequestration a farmer might have, we now have an app with which we score farmland habitats and we are able to measure accurately all habitats on a farm.  Generally speaking, the gardens scored are usually full of ornamental species and there is a lot of pesticide use, though not always.  There is bark mulch and lawn, which does not have a high biodiversity value compared with a native hedge.</p></speech>

They are very welcome.  Dr. Moore has scrubbed up well since we last met on a wet, miserable day in the Chairman's constituency.  It is good to see Ms Clerkin as passionate as ever about her areas of interest.  I am excited about this conversation because I think there is great potential to address many of the challenges the committee deals with if we get hedgerow strategy right.  It is probably the easiest thing our farmers can do to resolve some of the other big challenges we talk about, such as water quality, carbon emissions and biodiversity issues, while also being able to continue farming, which is obviously very important to them.  The witnesses have dealt very well with the benefits of having good hedgerows in place.  One issue I am not sure if they have touched on, and maybe there is a reason for that, is soil quality on adjoining fields.  Are adjoining fields impacted by a wide span of hedgerows?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Moore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#G01100"><p>I will start with that question and then maybe hand over to Ms O'Sullivan or Ms Clerkin.  I think the research shows a significant benefit is conferred on the soil on either side of the hedgerow in that water is retained and the water level is raised.  There is also the effect of pollinators on pest control and the stop to disease spreading.  As for soil filtration, there is the effect of filtering out nutrients from getting into waterways and preventing soil loss during flash flooding, which is increasingly a problem.  There is a long list of soil benefits, so I am glad the Deputy has raised the issue with us.  I am not sure if any of the other witnesses would like to take up the issue of soil quality.</p></speech>

Related to that, and part of the work we are looking at in the farm carbon project, is whether there is a carbon accrual effect in soil under hedgerows.  In the context of an arable setting, the research has shown elsewhere that soil under hedgerows accumulates more carbon.  Thinking about hedgerows within their landscape is important.  That same finding has not been borne out elsewhere in respect of grassland, so we will see what our results will show in that regard.  Dr. Moore has already touched on many of the benefits, but it also depends on the depth of the soil and the way in which the rooting network will develop, which will in turn determine its impacts or effects.  By and large, however, it is positive.  That is the general sentiment in the context of the setting.</p></speech>

I often explain in this committee and others that Monaghan is strange, even in agricultural terms.  Traditionally, our holdings were very small, which made them unprofitable, which in turn has meant that farmers have largely moved into areas such as poultry or mushrooms, which are very intensive and considered environmentally damaging.  However, if we did not have them we probably would not have the communities around them because there is no other employment or economic activity in the area.  We therefore have to try to get the balance right.</p> <p>  As for hedgerows, I think the decline over the period has been visible throughout the country.  I get the sense, however, that there is now a greater recognition of the importance of hedgerows.  Maybe there has been a U-shaped trajectory and we are seeing a resurgence of hedgerows.  I have been taken aback by the quality of the hedges that are there.  Ms Clerkin says they are not delivering, even those that are there now, compared with ten years ago.  She mentioned pesticides as maybe one of the influences, but what are the other influences?  Why would that be the case?</p></speech>

They are assessed on their composition and their species diversity across floral, woody and tree species and then on their structure, that is, their effectiveness for livestock management, gappiness and so on.  That is actually measured.  In Monaghan it was found that of the unfavourable hedgerows, which account for about 87% of all hedges, 55% showed a lot of gappiness.  That would be over 25% gappiness in a hedgerow, which obviously affects the hedgerow's livestock value.  It also-----</p></speech>

That would be an impact of a lack of the right type of management, which can be addressed.</p><p>Another impact is nutrient enrichment.  This can occur where there is possibly excessive use of fertiliser or slurry.  The hedge acts as a nutrient barrier in some senses, but it gets to a point where it is too much, it cannot take any more and the species diversity starts to decline.  That is when a shift is noticed in the amount and type of species growing in a hedge.  That can be directly related to nutrient enrichment.  It is like any habitat; you can continue to do something for a while and it is not always noticed, then you reach an environmental threshold and something shifts.  That is what we found in the hedges in County Monaghan.  Approximately 40% of the hedges that were in poor condition had nutrient enrichment.  Some of them even had slurry spread directly onto them, affecting their ability to photosynthesise.  Nobody would welcome such a practice.  All of those are management issues.  There is also the issue of poaching, which involves cattle getting onto the banks of hedges and affecting and taking out all of the undergrowth.  The soil is then exposed and can run off into any ditch that is there.  That then has a downstream impact with sedimentation.  Farmers also lose a very valuable resource, namely, the soil, in this process.  We found that 75% of hedges in Monaghan were affected by poaching.  Hedgerows can be fenced off temporarily during the growing season and cows can be allowed back on later in the season, in late summer and autumn, to graze the understory and prevent brambles and blackthorn from growing out too far into the field.  That is all about making a shift in hedgerow management.  Many of the issues are about management.</p></speech>

Ms Clerkin mentioned over-management. I presume that she was referring to cutting the hedgerow back-----</p></speech>

I believe Mr. Sheehan referred to the short back and sides.  Over-management occurs where hedgerows have been shaved down to around 1 m or under 1.5 m and given a short back and sides, so they are just a box, effectively.  One of the farming ambassadors for nature referred to them as rows of sticks.  Such hedgerows do not actually function for the farms, as biodiversity habitats or for carbon sequestration at that stage.</p></speech>

I presume that a hedge is left there and it is not being cut by domestic animals or humans, it is a good thing.</p></speech>

Every few years, they need to be trimmed at the sides so that they are not encroaching completely into the field.  If a hedgerow is left to its own devices over time, it will either grow into a tree line or what is known as a relict hedge, which will no longer have any of the understory.  That is very good.  In fact, it gives other benefits.  There are mature trees that can be used for other functions.  For example, different songbirds will be in those trees, etc.  However, as a hedgerow and an agricultural feature, they may not be as useful for a farm.  What we are talking about here would be a results-based payment scheme for farmers that would recognise the value of hedgerows for biodiversity and carbon and their agricultural function, including acting as a barrier to livestock and enclosing fields.  That should be taken into account.</p></speech>

In terms of State-owned lands, including local authority lands, is she satisfied there are adequate strategies in place to use those lands for these type of projects?  I am often struck by land that is serving no purpose and is not used by the public but is perfectly manicured.  It might be an ideal option to put these projects into practice.</p></speech>

All agencies need to play their part at this stage, with the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis.  Young people will start to raise these types of issues more in the coming ten years.  Certainly, the all-island pollinator plan, which most local authorities have signed up to, has resulted in a percentage of local authority land having changed its management practices to accommodate better pollinating practices, for example, by changing parkland into species-rich grassland.  It has also been done through changes in management.  I do not refer to the planting of new species or anything like that, but changing management practices, including, reducing pesticides, changing the grazing regime or changing the cutting regime.  Much of it is about changing our habits.  We have got into a bad set of habits that we need to look at and change.  Then we will be able to do a lot more than we are at the moment, without a lot of difficulty.</p></speech>

I suppose it is an example of the long-term damage done by ill thought-out policies.  It has been outlined fairly well, but in terms of the actual mechanics of paying people for sequestering carbon and for maintaining hedges, do the witnesses see that as being best delivered through eco-schemes, agri-environmental schemes or another mechanism?  That is considering that if we choose the former, there is a chance that perhaps the farmers that we most need to be encouraging to engage in these practices might not actually be participating in them.  How do we get around that?</p></speech>

We felt that it was a real missed opportunity in the CAP that the quality of existing hedgerows was not recognised.  We recommend that that should happen in both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.  Under the Pillar 1 eco-schemes, and the space for nature, for example, while hedgerows are recognised, there is no reference to the quality.  It is a missed opportunity in that respect.  The technology is available to actually measure the linear length and width of hedgerows.  That could lead to a meaningful payment for hedgerow quality in that pillar.  Under Pillar 2, the opportunity to look at existing hedgerow quality is even greater under the results-based schemes.  Again, that opportunity was missed.  There is a lot about rejuvenating, replanting and new planting, but nothing about existing hedgerow quality.  Again, we think that could still be remedied.  Perhaps Mr. Hickey can respond on the management issue.</p></speech>

That could be done almost immediately.  If that could be added to Pillar 1, it would be hugely beneficial.  It would take in all of the hedgerows that we have at present.  The big problem that we have in Ireland is a communication problem.  It is not really a difficulty between farmers and legislators regarding hedgerows.  What we need to do is to educate everybody - the public, the farmers and the legislators - as to the benefits of hedgerows, as outlined by Ms Clerkin.  If we can do that, then there will not be any difficulty with farmers.  It is a win-win situation for them and for the legislators.  Nobody will be in opposition to it.  In no part of our presentation today, we stated that we want to be a negative force in respect of farmers or legislators.  Everybody is a gainer.  As far as the EU is concerned, it is going to be delighted.  It will go for this option.  It amazes us that we are missing this opportunity and that it has been left out of the CAP.</p></speech>

The first thing that must be recognised is that in the 1980s, the same EU that the witnesses have spoken of, in respect of what it is looking for now, paid farmers around this country to knock every ditch and hedge down.  Farmers basically had to get bulldozers and drive them into a corner.  It is the same EU that is looking for farmers to do a full 3600 circle.  In fairness, in most parts of the country, farmers are interested in having hedges; there is no point in saying they are not.  Mr. Hickey spoke earlier about the different problems around the world.</p><p>It should be recognised that places such as Brazil are cutting an area the size of a football field every day from the lungs of the world.  Mr. Hickey talked about the new CAP.  My understanding is that, to qualify for the CAP payment, 4% of land has to be used for biodiversity.  Some 4% of a farmer's land can either be idle or in hedges or such.</p></speech>

Mr. Sheehan recommends pressing the hedge down in the BRIDE Project.  That is done when a hedge has lighter growth.  The gaps in many of the hedges in Monaghan are quite wide and they need in-filling before that can be started.  Everything has become woody and old.</p></speech>

Teagasc would have completed that LiDAR survey work that was done with Devenish.  In the work that I am involved in now, the Deputy is right that one needs to know exactly what area is being captured.  At the sites, we would have five zones marked out in 6 m lengths.  They have been captured remotely, so it captures everything.  One can fly a drone immediately over it and it captures exactly what is in that zone.  For us to be able to translate that to a carbon measurement, it captures the volume using the remote technology.  We are now translating that biomass to a carbon stock by dry-weighing it, grinding it down and sampling it in the different pools used in the inventories for the accounting.  There is our above-ground biomass or living biomass above and below ground, the soil underneath and the root system.</p></speech>

The witnesses talked about the importance of cattle not going where the roots of the trees are, especially around ditches.  The clay in ditches will move down in soft weather and expose the root of a whitethorn.  Would the witnesses recommend that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine help farmers fence on both sides with a grant or such to protect both sides?  It is important to talk to farmers, not at them or down to them.  We need to respect that we are dealing with their ground and give them the required respect.  There are farmers who want to get the whitethorn hedges, to save on fencing in many cases, if it functions properly.  The witnesses talked about lining fences with them.  We have to think of roads and road safety too, as Senator Paul Daly said.  The sides have to be trimmed or a hedgerow will come out into the middle of the road.  What is the witnesses' view on handling that land?</p><p>The contractor going along has mirrors and the worst thing that could happen is a bramble catching one of them.  Everyone wants to have these.  Farmers will buy into this and into the eco-scheme in the line of sowing more hedgerows.  We need to work with them to make it workable and ensure it is not affecting or hammering them.  What are the witnesses' views on the maintenance side of it?</p></speech>

I have hedgerows that are 50, 60 or 70 years of age.  I fence along outside my ditch and have no trouble with encroaching trees and so forth.  I side trim and when a tree gets to a certain height, it branches across.  There is no problem for machinery passing underneath or anything like that.

From our point of view, there is no problem with roadways and so forth.</p></speech>

It is wonderful to have four of them in the committee room and fantastic to be back to having witnesses in the committee room.  I also welcome Mr. Sheehan, who is joining us online.  Mr. Sheehan and I met in the climate committee five or six months ago and our session then was very interesting.  I am not coming at this from a farming background and would not pretend to know as much as my colleagues on farming.  However, I sit on the climate committee and we spend a lot of time tearing our hair out trying to figure out how to reduce emissions, sequester and offset carbon and so on.  Nobody in Ireland has the answer yet but enhancing and promoting new or existing hedgerows looks like a win-win.  That may be simplistic and I defer to others' expertise.  I would like to hear more.  I apologise because I missed the start of the meeting and some of this may have been covered but will the witnesses take me back over the climate potential of hedgerows?  Dr. Moore mentioned the quality of the existing hedgerows and their importance.  There is a different conversation about new hedgerows.  He might elaborate on those two sides to it.  I would like to hear from Mr. Hickey and Mr. Sheehan, who are active farmers, on how beneficial hedgerows are in day-to-day farming.  It is important the committee hears that.</p></speech>

An awful lot of our hedgerows would be bounds ditches between landowners.  For claiming benefits, how would that work?  Would there be a double claim?</p></speech>

On Deputy Leddin's question, the benefits of hedgerows have been well described in the meeting so far and there seems to be unanimity of agreement that hedgerows provide a huge range of services.  We feel among friends and there is no dispute about the value of hedges.</p> <p>  On the value of old versus new, there has been discussion about the 20 to 50 years it takes for a new hedge to achieve the benefits of an old hedge.  The question was asked about the new hedges under cross-compliance and where they are. It is a good question.  There has not been the follow-up or oversight of where those new hedges are and what is in them.  The multispecies issue is a big one.  There is no dispute among any of the experts that existing hedgerows are better.  We have a huge network.  They are being destroyed, unfortunately, at an alarming rate.  We have this asset but it is disappearing.  The EIA regulations are not fit for purpose and I do not think even the Department believes they are.  That and the lack of legal protection are two issues on which we would love to get the committee's support and knock heads together to see how we could prevent further destruction.</p></speech>

That is significant in terms of the reductions we are trying to get.</p></speech>

The rate of sequestration declines.  However, if we are looking at hedgerows' potential as a carbon stock and whether that changes over time, ecosystems that accumulate more carbon than they lose can become sinks.  Effectively, they have sink potential.  Sequestration accumulates over time and reaches an equilibrium but I think we have covered that it is about multiple benefits.  It is not only sequestration.</p></speech>

There is huge value and potential in hedgerows but we are trying to get to net zero by 2050, so there is a 30-year challenge.  It seems that however difficult the 2030 challenge might be with growing new hedgerows, sequestration and so on, we should be taking the 30-year potential very seriously.</p></speech>

The landscape will need to be more resilient and be able to withstand intense rainfall events, drought, fire and other events.  Hedgerows are very important for all of these reasons.  It is definitely something that would add to our response.</p></speech>

We may bring Hedgerows Ireland before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action at some point to speak further about it.  Others may speak on how hedgerows enhance practices on the farm.  What we are trying to solve here in many ways is a real challenge for farmers throughout the country.  We know many of them are struggling.  We think there is an obvious way to provide value to farmers through existing hedgerows and potential new hedgerows.  The CAP strategic plan has been mentioned.  I do not think the door on that has closed.  If we make enough noise about it, we can provide further value to farmers.  There is money in Europe and we should really be putting up our hands for it.  It seems that farmers can benefit to a far greater degree than they have in the past from various eco-schemes in the two pillars.  The witnesses might address this if they can shed further light on it, if they want to come back on their experiences on their own farms.</p></speech>

I was in the D&aacute;il.  I heard the Chair was keeping a good eye on me.  I will not repeat many of the questions that have already been raised.</p> <p>  This is an interesting subject.  In rural Ireland many farmers are very protective of the hedgerows and have been over the years.  The problem is there are hedgerows in the farm but there are also hedgerows on the side of the road.  How do the witnesses feel about the hedgerows and verges that are not cut?  I completely understand there are certain times of the year that trimming should not take place.  There are situations in rural Ireland and in rural communities whereby in the middle of summer hedgerows grow out onto the middle of the road causing accidents.  People with bicycles are hurt.  There should be a separation between one and the other.  It is a very important issue.  It may have been brought up when I was speaking in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  The issue of burning was raised earlier.  I am totally opposed to out-of-control burning but there is also controlled burning and we should be very supportive of this.  The IFA and the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association came together with the Garda to train farmers on controlled burning.  We should encourage this in specific areas where it is needed at specific times.  Sometimes we cannot burn in season because the season is damp and wet.  This puts farmers in a very difficult position.</p> <p>  As previous speakers have said, I hope the witnesses can work with farmers on their plans.  The problem farmers have at present is with dictation.  This country is turning a lot like this.  Farmers are being dictated to.  They have more serious worries about further regulations coming before them.  Much of what the witnesses have said is great.  I have no objection to it with regard to protecting hedgerows and on my farm we do the same.  Protection of the hedgerows is very important.  In this country we depend on progressive farmers and I hope they will be protected, brought along and not dictated to as such.  Grant aid is a great way to encourage farmers.  I hope no policy will dictate too hard to farmers because it would put a whole different light on all of this.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to comment on road verges where hedgerows are growing.  I did not say it at the beginning but I welcome all of the witnesses.</p></speech>

We have already covered the roadways.  There is no problem.  Local authorities already have rules on boundary hedges along roadways.  It is the responsibility of the farmer from the point of view of local authorities.  Farmers make sure hedgerows do not encroach on roads and are not a danger to motorists.  As far as farmers in general are concerned, there is no discrepancy between what we are asking for and what farmers are doing with regard to hedgerows.  We see a win-win situation whereby we can help farmers to appreciate their hedges even more than they do at present.  We see an incentivised scheme whereby farmers could avail of funds to retain their hedgerows and improve them so there would be no difficulty in that sphere.</p></speech>

I will pick up on the point he made about progressive farming.  What the discussion this evening has shown is that it is now understood that what was previously good farming in terms of taking out the hedgerows is now seen as questionable and not good practice.  As the Deputy has heard this evening, we are very much farmer led.  Our group has high farmer representation.  We strongly believe the retention of good quality hedgerows represents good, progressive farming.</p></speech>

We have to be fair to the next set of witnesses.  This has been a very good session and very informative.  From my point of view as a farmer, what farmers want is to get full credit and recognition for the hedgerows they have.  If there is a parameter for measuring and rewarding farmers for them, we will see that farmers will buy into this policy of hedgerows.  As Senator Paul Daly said, we have a completely different landscape from continental Europe.  It is annoying farmers that they are not getting recognition for the hedgerows on their farms and the sequestration of carbon.  Anything that can be done on this front will be mutually beneficial for farming and the environment.  Farmers are custodians and they want to look after their farms and the environment.  We have a way to go to get recognition for farmers of what hedgerows are doing for the environment.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the witnesses for their presentation.</p></speech>

This will allow the witnesses an opportunity to read their statements into the record.  Members have already received the statements and the Deputies will be back to put their questions.  Rather than sitting around waiting for them to come back, the witnesses can at least read their statements.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses and persons in the Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  Members are requested to ensure that, for the duration of the meeting, their mobile phones are switched off completely or in airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on their device.  It is not sufficient for members just to put their phones in silent mode as this maintains a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  With effect from 25 January 2022, members and witnesses have the option of attending committee meetings in the relevant committee room rather than participating via Microsoft Teams.  Masks should continue to be worn by those present when not addressing the committee.  Room capacity will continue to be reduced in the short term until all microphones and seating can be returned.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means a witness has full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as far as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third party or entity.  Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance relating to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts, and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.</p> <p>  For the second part of today's meeting I welcome the representatives from the Environmental Pillar and BirdWatch Ireland and thank them for coming before the committee today to engage on Ireland's draft Common Agricultural policy, CAP, strategic plan.  The witnesses today are Ms Oonagh Duggan, head of advocacy, BirdWatch Ireland; Mr. Charles Stanley-Smith, CAP consultative committee representative, Environmental Pillar; Mr. Fintan Kelly, agriculture and land use policy and advocacy officer, Environmental Pillar; and Dr. Oliver Moore of Cultivate, UCC Centre for Co-operative Studies.  I invite the witnesses to make their opening statements.  We can start with the Environmental Pillar if that is okay.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair, Deputies and Senators for inviting the Environmental Pillar to speak.  I am the agriculture and land use policy and advocacy officer at the Environmental Pillar.</p> <p>  The trajectory of Irish agriculture is a significant challenge in respect of the protection of biodiversity, water and air quality and the management of greenhouse gas emissions.  There has been a long-standing societal failure to align the sector with planetary boundaries, our environment's carrying capacity and Ireland's legal obligations.  Policies that have prioritised a productivist model of agriculture focused on specialisation, intensification and concentration have degraded our environment and locked farmers into an unsustainable commodity-driven food production system, which has left many economically vulnerable and at the mercy of fluctuating global markets and inequities in the food supply chain.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding positive environmental interventions, such as Ireland's world-class, results-based agri-environment schemes, successive CAPs have by and large failed to meet head-on our looming biodiversity and climate crises or the socioeconomic crisis facing many farms, particularly smaller farmers and those on marginally productive land.  While there are elements of the CAP strategic plan that we strongly support, this CAP and other Government policies will, regrettably, fail to address the defining social and environmental issues of our time because, ultimately, they are not designed to do so.</p> <p>  As the main financing mechanism underpinning the social, economic and environmental well-being of rural Ireland, it is essential that supports are credible, targeted and measurable.  Many of the proposed actions are not ambitious enough or targeted enough to deliver the degree of change needed.  The level of ambition within the CAP strategic plan is not aligned with the level of ambition highlighted in various overarching strategies that span the same timeframe.  The CAP is supposed to be the vehicle for change, but it is not clear what the roadmap or the destination is.  For example, the EU biodiversity strategy has a target to expand protected areas to 30% of the EU's land and sea, with 10% strictly protected by 2030.  It also sets the ambition to restore nature by 2030, and the Commission has promised ambitious binding targets under new restoration legislation.  Agriculture is the leading pressure on protected sites nationally, but the CAP strategic plan is not tailored to rise to the challenge outlined in either the EU's biodiversity strategy, Farm to Fork, or the European Green Deal.</p></speech>

The CAP is therefore responsible, at a bare minimum, for ensuring that what it funds will not impact the environment negatively.</p> <p>  Climate change is with us now.  There is a report nearly every other day on levels being breached.  Ireland's emissions profile means it is essential that significant reductions in agriculture and land use emissions are delivered over the short and medium term.  The CAP strategic plan does not have the ambition to deliver meaningful climate action.  There are no clear deliverables listed such as reductions in tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and associated timelines.  The agriculture sector has to meet a cut in emissions of between 22% and 30% by 2030, and it is not clear how the CAP, worth &euro;9.8 billion, will help the sector achieve its target.  The timeline of the CAP strategic plan runs from 2023 to 2027, in parallel with the climate action plan targets for 2030.  Despite the importance of agriculture and the land use sector to the climate action plan and the Climate Change Advisory Council's carbon budgets, there is a lack of policy coherence across the board.</p> <p>  As for methane reduction, the IPCC's sixth assessment report, AR6, updated our understanding of the global carbon budget and the need for net-zero emissions of long-lived gases - for example, CO2 and N2O - and for a strong, rapid and sustained reduction in methane emissions.  There may be arguments about the multiplication factor to be applied to methane in a steady state in respect of the amount of methane, but nobody is in any doubt that increasing or decreasing methane has a large and immediate effect.  The biggest reward would be in terms of greenhouse gases.  If a reduction in methane levels will not be politically possible, methane must not be allowed to increase.  Dairy cows produce at least one and a half times the amount of methane that beef cattle produce.  The suckler carbon efficiency programme of the CAP will have a positive effect on emissions produced by beef cattle, but any gains will be drowned out if dairy cattle numbers continue to increase.  There is no programme in the CAP strategic plan to help farmers to reduce the number of dairy cattle.  There is an extensification eco-scheme which will help to reduce the push for any extensive farmers to become intensive but it will have no impact on the stocking rates of intensive dairy farmers.</p> <p>  As for land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, the climate action plan and the carbon budgets place a strong emphasis on the need for increased afforestation and the re-wetting of high-carbon soils.  While we would question the feasibility of the targets that have been set, it is clear that any actions must deliver scientifically credible carbon sequestration and be targeted as the right action in the right place.  Without immediate action, the EPA projects that emissions from the land use sector will hit between 7 million Mt CO2 eq and 11 million Mt CO2 eq in 2030.</p> <p>  As for re-wetting high-carbon farmland, one of the biggest reductions proposed in the climate action plan is reduced management intensity of 80,000 ha of farmed organic soils, which would deliver direct savings of 880,000 Mt CO2 eq by 2030.  The scale of the challenge merits significant attention within the CAP strategic plan.  In the absence of an actual intervention, there needs to be a plan started now to include how the strategic plan's agri-environment climate measures, AECMs, can support farmers to achieve these objectives and how we should investigate sustainable paludiculture.  Lessons can be learned from the various Irish European Innovation Partnerships, EIPs, and the extensive work throughout northern Europe.  One item related to this is that the target of 2024 for GAEC 2 needs to be brought forward immediately to protect peatlands and wetlands.</p> <p>  As for forestry, the current proposals for native trees on farms in the next CAP are wholly inadequate, lacking overarching objectives with targets.  Under the current draft eco-scheme proposals, farmers would have to plant between three and six trees per hectare per year, but there is an absence of conditionality or guidance, which means that this initiative will fail to achieve maximum benefits for nature.</p> <p>  As for water quality, the EPA has stated: "Reducing the nitrate levels in our waters must be a priority."  The EPA highlights that levels of nitrate pollution are strongly related to increasing agricultural intensification.  The EPA has produced pollution impact potential, PIP, maps, which indicate where the greatest risks are for nitrogen and phosphorous run-off.  There is no targeting within the CAP strategic plan to ensure that safeguards such as buffer strips are tailored to protect water quality form agricultural run-off, especially in areas indicated by PIP maps.</p> <p>  The pillar also recommends that the definition of "vulnerable water area" for tier 2 be "any water body where agriculture has been identified as a significant pressure".  Priority should be given to those identified as having a critical source area, supported by EPA PIP maps.  These should be moved to tier 1.</p> <p>  As for renewables, we welcome the move to fund farm renewable energy technology.</p><p>As for training, all aspects of the renewed agriculture knowledge and innovation systems, AKIS, must be based on a foundation of the three elements of sustainability.</p></speech>

Ireland&rsquo;s CAP strategic plan was submitted to the European Commission.  The Commission will assess this plan, and reply to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This feedback, known as observation letters, will be made public.  This is a final opportunity to bring our CAP plan more into line with its own strategic environmental assessment, SEA, and with the more ambitious targets of our recently adopted climate action Act.  We need to continue to strengthen ambition while bringing everyone into the process.  My colleagues have outlined the issues in more detail.  To be clear, we have one final opportunity to get this right before we are stuck with a CAP until 2027.</p> <p>  In the SEA evaluation of strategic alternatives, both organic farming options, namely, reaching our organic targets and organics, agroforestry and extensive farming, scored the highest environmentally.  The organic budget and annual opening of the organic farming scheme, OFS, are to be welcomed.  However, the plan is to continue with the current structure for implementation, which is preparing to fail, frankly.</p> <p>  Ireland has among the lowest rates of organic farming in the EU.  We must address a number of issues.  Payment rates for farmers in the organic farming scheme are far too low.  They are about 50% of what is required to be competitive, with the exception of-----</p></speech>

Group organic certification is now allowable and must be developed.  Public procurement needs a mandated organic-specific percentage of supply increase.  Processor competition, for which there is a real need, is lacking.  A full suite of supports, covering production, research, advisory-extension services, processing, marketing and more, needs to be developed, as proposed in my submission to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action last year.  I ask members to refer to that for more detail.</p> <p>  In the Irish climate action Act, diversification's contribution to climate change targets is described as "TBD", or "to be decided".  Therefore, work clearly needs to be done on diversification to complement what Teagasc is doing and it needs to be done with imagination.  This is an opportunity.  There are at least three areas under which to consider diversification.  Diversifying farming practices and agricultural outputs being the first.  Much was made in the SEA of &ldquo;the right measure in the right place&rdquo;.  By extension, we need the right farming practice in the right region.  Diversification may help in some environmentally stressed regions.  How do we address numbers declining in tillage and horticulture?  What level of mixed farming and local market fulfilment can be reached?  How do we enable import substitution and emerging areas, such as hemp co-operatives, social farming and community-supported agriculture?  Teagasc research shows that farmers are willing to engage in forestry as a form of diversification------</p></speech>

However, the provisions in CAP do little to build an appropriate forestry base.  There is a strong case to bring in expertise from elsewhere in the EU to assess and evaluate current policy and develop better practices in forestry and agroforestry.  Approaches such as the co-operation areas, including building from the European innovation partnership base are to be welcomed and must continue to grow.  We need to begin approaching these questions.</p> <p>  Diversification also relates to farm incomes.  According to the European Commission, "the share of Irish farmers in the value chain fell from close to 20% in 2008 to just around 18% in 2016.  This is below the long-term EU average of roughly 25%."  How do we address this sustainably?  Teagasc supports research, sharing good practices, and technical assistance, but we need policy to mainstream on-farm diversification.  The LEADER programme does much, but more is needed.</p> <p>  The regional economy needs to be taken into account when considering diversification.  Reaching our climate targets in a just transition framework means supporting new directions for regional economies.  There are many elements to this, including developing food hubs, local and regional markets and processing opportunities, while also supporting digital infrastructure and the other targets in the Our Rural Futures policy.  Rural broadband roll-out has been especially poor thus far and needs to be taken seriously as a national need.</p> <p>  Finally, I will address fairness, which involves farmers, sectors, population groups and regions.  For farmers, Ireland will move to 85% convergence by 2026 and 10% redistributive payments.  While this is welcome, it is the slowest pace and lowest redistribution possible.  Why is this?  Other concerns include the lack of a small farmer scheme and social conditionality references.  In addition, the size requirement of producer organisations, at &euro;2.5 million turnover, is too high.</p> <p>  Modelling needs to be done on the impact of redistributive payments at high percentages; on allocating redistribution exclusively to small and medium sized farms, which Italy plans to do for farms below 50 ha; and on differentiating payment levels by farm size.  Policy expert Matteo Metto has reported on CAP and fairness in Ireland.  I ask members to refer to him for more details and, ideally, invite him to speak to the committee.</p> <p>  For women farmers, potential new entrants and people in rural areas, there is a need for access to land, supports, resources and opportunities.  Land observatories and land mortgages have been suggested.  Developing diversification and organics would also help to revitalise rural areas and provide welcome opportunities for people in rural areas and those who would like to relocate them.</p></speech>

BirdWatch Ireland is a charity with 15,000 members and 25 branches nationwide.  We have offices in counties Wicklow, Offaly, Donegal and Mayo.  Our mission is to protect wild birds and other biodiversity.  We do this through surveys and monitoring, which relies on over 700 skilled volunteers, education, awareness raising and events, habitat and species projects both in and off our network of nature reserves, and policy and advocacy to press for the changes needed to address the biodiversity emergency.</p> <p>  We have a long history of working directly with farmers and supporting them in conservation actions for threatened wild bird species.  We also work closely on agriculture policy, which is the biggest driver of biodiversity decline in Ireland, but also on other issues affecting farmland birds such as forestry, peat cutting and climate change mitigation and adaptation.  For the record, I am one of two Environmental Pillar representatives to the national CAP consultative committee.</p> <p>  Farming in Ireland over the millennia has shaped our wild bird profile, but populations have declined sharply in the face of the dramatic changes in agriculture in the past 50 years.  Farmland birds such as the curlew, which are intimately linked to our heritage in song, music, poetry and stories, are slowly but surely disappearing from the landscape, with some, such as the corn bunting, already gone.</p> <p>  Every six years, BirdWatch Ireland publishes the birds of conservation concern in Ireland assessment.  We use a traffic light system, with red identifying species of highest conservation concern.  There are 16 farmland birds on the latest red list.  These are: birds of meadows, including the corncrake, meadow pipit and whinchat; birds of arable and mixed farmland, including grey partridge, barn owl, yellowhammer, stock dove and kestrel; birds of damp pasture, including the curlew, snipe, lapwing and redshank; and birds of uplands and coasts, including golden plover, dunlin, red grouse, and twite.  Farmland birds are the fastest growing group on to the red list, having moved from amber, and are in serious trouble.</p> <p>  In addition, one third of our wild bee species are at risk of extinction and 85% of our internationally important habitats are in unfavourable condition.  These include grasslands, heaths, fens and other wetlands.  Species and habitats that rely on good water quality are also under pressure because water quality is declining.  Agriculture is the biggest pressure and threat to these, but farmers also have a unique role in the conservation of biodiversity, especially farmland birds, and agriculture policy must, with its reach and funding, support them in this role.</p> <p>  Biodiversity in Ireland is in accident and emergency.  The emergency was declared by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in May 2019.  In order to tackle this emergency, we need to act like it is an emergency.  Farmers and conservationists are on the front line together on this and, with the same determination used to tackle the Covid crisis, we can turn this around as long as urgent, effective and well-funded policies and actions are put in place.</p> <p>  The focus of Food Vision 2030 is a continuation of an intensification model with unambitious tweaks to address the environmental challenges in agriculture.  The CAP strategic plan for 2023-2027, which was sent to the European Commission in December for review and approval, includes some improvements for farmland biodiversity, but it is far from an emergency response.  Ireland still has the opportunity to increase ambition.</p> <p>  Most importantly for biodiversity is targeting the funding and supports to where it is needed most.</p><p>Between 2% and 5% of the &euro;9.8 billion Irish CAP budget will be spent on effective measures for biodiversity, which is really a small amount.  Much greater support and targeting of actions and funding is needed for all farmland, but it is especially needed for farmland with a high nature value and for pulling the brakes on the intensification model.  </p><p> I will now outline the key changes needed in the CAP strategic plan.  The land eligibility rule changes which would remove the threat of 30% of a parcel containing scrub and other habitats being red-lined is good but it must be accompanied by an effective communications campaign to encourage farmers to retain these important habitats.  </p><p> The space for nature condition of the basic payment, known as good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, 8, is good as it will apply to all farmland but small wetlands need to be added to the list of habitats and the forestry definition should apply to native woodlands only.  Furthermore, GAEC 8 requires retention of landscape features such as hedgerows.  Irish farmers are allowed to remove hedgerows as long as the same length is replanted before removal.  This is facilitating the removal of hedgerows all over the country and must stop.  You cannot compare the biodiversity supported by old hedgerows with that supported by new whips.  Retention of landscape features means keeping them.  Farmers can choose to go up to 10% space for nature on farmland in the eco-scheme but, under this scheme, there is no requirement to improve the quality of these habitats and that is a major concern.  Specialist ecological advice should be made available to help farmers improve the quality of hedgerows, ponds, wetlands and more.  Unless there are measures for improvement, the state of nature will not change.</p><p> The inclusion of an agri-environment scheme measure and European Innovation Partnership for breeding waders is positive but, according to BirdWatch Ireland mapping of important areas for waders and based on our direct experience with the curlew EIP, the budget for the EIP should be in the region of at least &euro;30 million to save this group of rapidly declining red list species.</p><p> We welcome the proposed co-operative projects which build on the results-based approach taken with the Burren programme but the funding allocation should be significantly higher to ensure broader geographical scope.</p><p> The areas of natural constraint, ANC, payment still has no linkage with environmental action and this is hugely regrettable because it is such a large amount of money.  The Natura and commonage AECM payments should also be linked to actions to support the conservation objectives of Natura sites and species.</p><p> Underpinning the CAP throughout is a requirement to adhere to national and EU environmental law.  The most common breach of cross compliance relates to the nitrates and water framework directive conditions.  We really need stronger education and awareness campaigns regarding environmental law and its enforcement.</p><p> During the Covid crisis, the State chose to try to vaccinate everyone and not just 20% of the population.  Partial, isolated and poorly funded measures will not solve the biodiversity emergency and they do a disservice to farmers who could otherwise have a good news story to tell.  We call on Deputies and Senators to support these changes to Ireland&rsquo;s CAP strategic plan.</p></speech>

I grew up with wildlife such as birds, bees and butterflies.  It was all part of nature and our bringing up and the love for wildlife was number one in my home.  However, that was always done with co-operation and people used to ask to come on the land.  They loved to view some of the animals and we loved to be with them when they were doing so.  Things have changed, unfortunately, and there is more of a dictation setting and finger pointing at farmers that they are anti-wildlife and anti-this and anti-that.  A rogue trader will probably be found in every business.  I have been looking into BirdWatch Ireland and its representatives might explain who funds the organisation.</p></speech>

I will play devil's advocate.  If all their asks could be delivered, we would live on a better island, but, realistically, that cannot happen.  In a concerted, genuine effort all round to achieve what we need to achieve and what the witnesses' requests are, they have very little reference to science.  A problem I have with climate change is that we keep referencing science and scientific changes, be it for the administration of slurry, anaerobic digesters or the improvement of the breed of animal or cattle.  Can much or any of what the groups are requesting be achieved by science?  Would the science proposed to meet the solution be an issue for some of the species BirdWatch Ireland have mentioned?</p> <p>  I ask the Environmental Pillar, in particular, to reference the issues they have raised in a global context and, in particular, issue of carbon leakage.  The prediction is the population of the world will have essentially doubled by 2050.  We have to be cognisant of ensuring food security.  If we were to meet all the Environmental Pillar's requests, would we end up in a situation in which we would have to import food from Brazil, which is the example that is always used?  It is taking out the rainforests, known as the earth's lungs, to produce meat.  Looking at this globally, can the witnesses give me a perspective on how we can balance it on an all-round basis and ensure food security as we go along with that?</p> <p>  I recall growing up, when we were cutting the meadow, being sent out ahead of the tractor and the finger-bar mower to run the pheasants, especially their chicks, away.  Machinery has probably played as much a part as farming practices and modern technology.  Farming practice and the world being what they are, we will not reverse the advances we have made in machinery.  How can BirdWatch Ireland propose a solution for that?</p> <p>  The witnesses have made a CAP submission.  I do not want to sound like I am opposed to anything they said.  However, the CAP as we know it is a cheap, traceable food policy and all their requests are environmentally related.  When and where do they see the purpose that CAP was initially introduced for changing?  At what point do they think the public will be prepared, through additional costs on their food, to subsidise much of what they have been requesting?  It is a roundabout way of asking the question.</p></speech>

Europe has changed CAP in this and the previous rounds, not us.  There has been a move over the past few rounds of CAP to move it away from a straight payment to paying for good things.  There is a still a good opportunity for farmers to earn good money by doing good.  I agree the move has been environmental, but it still allows farmers to get money, not out of direct payments, but out of eco-schemes, which are there to allow farmers to do something good and get paid for it.  It is not something we have changed; it is something Europe has changed.</p> <p>  I will go back to a few other issues such as the science.  I could have given the Senator a 20-minute dissertation on methane.  It would not have helped this argument.</p><p>All of our material is based on science.</p><p> There are many possibilities within CAP that could help combat climate change, but many of them are future oriented.  We may be able to reduce methane by using sunk carbon in the sea, but we do not know at the moment.  Climate change is happening and we can only rely a certain amount on what might be possible to do.  We need to act now and use approaches we know will reduce greenhouse gases.  We should reduce the number of cattle and sheep in the country.  I understand that this is a political argument more than anything else, so if that cannot be done politically, we must not increase the number.  All the experts on methane, Ag Climatise and so on say that this is based on the premise of there being no increase in numbers.  However, there seems to be a move to increase them.  CAP should provide a mechanism whereby farmers can be supported in reducing their impacts.  We are not demanding that numbers be reduced without some form of compensation; rather, we are saying that this CAP plan lacks any ability to support farmers.</p></speech>

At European level, there is a concerted effort to prevent carbon leakage because of the fear and risk of leakage.  There are what are called mirror clauses.  The French European Presidency announced that reciprocal environmental and health production standards for European products and products imported from third countries were going to be one of its focuses.  If it was a rule for products in the EU, it would be a rule for all products brought into the EU as well.  It is not a full EU position but the idea of mirror clauses is to deal with the risk and fear of carbon leakage and the problem that one country might opt for a stricter stance.  The EU is working on this in respect of forestry, antibiotics and across the board through the European Green Deal.  There is a specific effort towards reciprocal standards.  That argument is done.</p> <p>  To be fair, we have carbon budget parameters now.  Agriculture is aiming for between 22% and 32%, but carbon intensive foods will make that harder to achieve.  We have to consider the carbon intensity of the foods that we are producing.  That is happening globally.  It is why discussions will happen about how the European Green Deal integrates into WTO diktats.</p> <p>  The argument about leakage is not relevant because we now have targets for agriculture and there is a focus on having reciprocal standards.</p></speech>

One of our core messages as people who are interested in protecting the environment and the socioeconomic well-being of rural Ireland is that, in examining various policies that the Government adopts nationally and at EU level and while recognising that CAP is the primary financing vehicle for implementing these policies on the ground, we see many different targets but we do not see how CAP will achieve them.  We do not see the mechanisms.</p> <p>  We are supportive of technology.  If there are technologies that make it easier for farmers to have livelihoods, increase farm incomes and improve the environment, that is fantastic and we want to see them being invested in and implemented.  The main problem arises in light of the Climate Change Advisory Council's technical report on carbon budgets.  Large reductions in emissions have to be made at national level by 2030.  There is a programme for Government target of 51%.  Irish agriculture's emissions profile is 32.6% of our total emissions.  The council has linked 85% of Ireland's agricultural greenhouse gas emissions directly to cattle, be that in the form of methane, feed or nitrogen fertilisers in support of the feed.</p> <p>  The three most ambitious scenarios that the council has generated for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector involve a reduction in the size of the dairy and suckler herds.  As policy analysts and people who are concerned about the future of rural Ireland, we view it, similar to committee members, as an unprecedented level of change in rural Ireland, our socioeconomic well-being and the environment.  Other sections of the report set out targets for increasing afforestation from 2,500 ha per annum to 20,000 ha per annum by 2028 and to rewet 110,000 ha of drained organic soils, namely, land that was drained and is now being used for suckler farming, dairy farming, tillage and other such activities.</p> <p>  What the council is telling us is that, as a society, we need to change fundamentally how we manage land and how we farm.  These are major changes that are supposed to happen primarily over the lifetime of the current CAP.  As conscientious observers and people who have an obligation to speak up not just for the environment, but also for rural communities, we cannot see a roadmap for delivering those changes in the current CAP.  That is worrying.</p> <p>  Deputy Collins mentioned that environmentalists seem to be dictating to farmers.  We do not want to be seen to be dictating or saying there should be this target or something should be done that way; rather, we are observing a national dialogue with input from expert scientists and multiple objectives that people are trying to achieve across the board, for example, air quality, water quality, biodiversity and protecting farm incomes and the viability of family farms.  At the moment, though, we do not see that policy coherence being reflected in CAP.  We do not see a plan for how we will achieve these objectives coming through.  Combating climate change is not something that we can just decide we will not achieve.  It is something that we have to achieve for the well-being of our farmers, our society and the global community.</p></speech>

We encourage farmers in places such as Inishbofin, Donegal and the islands off Donegal to use practices like centre-out mowing, which would give the chicks an opportunity to get out of the way of the mowers.  Farmers would also be funded through schemes to delay mowing until after the chicks had fledged and had a chance to survive.  There are ways of doing this.  Through our conservation work, we test and trial methods with farmers on the ground.  We also examine the experience in other countries.  There are ways to help, but we need more habitats and we need more farmers doing this.  The key issue is that there is not enough funding to target methods and help farmers to move in this direction.</p></speech>

We have discussed organics in the past and we have heard that 2% of all agricultural land in Ireland is under organic production compared with 8.5% in the rest of Europe.  The Minister has set a target of 7.5% by 2027, which is already around the EU average.  If we are going to start playing catch-up in that area, will smaller farmers get elbowed out of the way by bigger farmers and holdings, which could start reaching that target faster than small farmers might?</p></speech>

That 7.5% would bring us up from where we are currently, which is a very low level.  While there would be the occasional case of very big organic farms taking over areas, so to speak, in general it is not really a problem.  Organic farms tend to increase diversity, employment, biodiversity and a range of things in rural areas.  If we manage to bring in more organic farming, it will work well.  We have a long grazing season and that suits organics.  I understand the payments are low for beef and sheepmeat, but with increased payments in those areas, farmers could easily move across to organic.  They need extra supports and payments.  That would be a full spectrum of supports from all the areas I mentioned earlier, including production, processing, third level, marketing and public procurement.  There is a whole suite of areas.  I am glad to see-----</p></speech>

That is fantastic.  My biggest fear in growing organics is not that it would have a negative impact on farmers, because I think it suits Irish extensive livestock farming.  What is different about organic farming is that there is a potential premium and market, whereas often schemes come along and the consumer cannot buy into them.  I love what the witnesses from the previous session do.  It is fantastic but I cannot buy into that product.  I cannot buy that milk.  It is just not possible.  There were 60,000 farmers in REPS 2 but I could not buy those products.  Nobody could.  There is a market of &euro;20 billion for organics between France and Germany alone and Ireland has the third lowest level in Europe.  We could really suit organics based on our grazing season and based on British and Irish breeds working well with organics.  I would not fear anything other than a more vibrant agrifood sector with more organics and I would look forward to that.</p></speech>

We are talking about going from 2.5% to 8% in five years.  Can smaller holdings do that?  Is there a role for smaller holdings in reaching that target in that short space of time or will they be pushed aside and these big farms take the funding to reach that target?  Do the witnesses think we can even reach that target in five years, by 2027?</p></speech>

It is more my area.  The 7.5% target is very ambitious.  It will be quite difficult to achieve and it will be very difficult to achieve at the payment rates being offered for beef and sheep, which is where most farmers are currently in organics.</p></speech>

Going from where we are at, we have never reached our organic targets.  We did not reach our targets for 2020 so I am not so interested in the figures as I am in the methodology and reports.  I do not want to see the negative effects the Deputy is describing potentially happening.  That might happen if loads of farmers came into beef and sheep and there was no competition in processing or prices.  Nobody wants these things.  People want to see a sustainable growth in organics, so opening the scheme year on year is a good sign.  We should also increase the payment rates for horticulture.  Horticulture does not take up a huge amount of land.  I want to see it grow sustainably and work for farmers.  I have no interest in big megafarms coming in and taking over, but that is happening in conventional farming anyway so I do not think it is a problem in organics.  We just need to do this slowly, carefully, methodically and in a full spectrum kind of way.</p></speech>

Ms Duggan said that 2% to 5% of the &euro;9.8 billion in Irish CAP money to address biodiversity matters is very weak and more funding is needed.  What kind of target or how much of that &euro;9.8 billion would be needed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Duggan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022020900002#S01000"><p>A big chunk of the funding is going to the co-operative projects.  This is one element of the agri-environment scheme and it would be good to see more funding go to that project to widen its scope.  That is the main chunk of that percentage I was talking about.  We do not know what the call will be for the breeding wader programmes for birds, for example.  That will be a specific scheme.  We believe that should be in the region of &euro;30 million to address breeding wader declines.  That funding is going to support farmers on the ground and it is targeted.  We would also like to see more linkage between the existing measures that are in the agri-environment scheme, like the Natura and commonage payments being more lined up with the conservation objectives of the different sites so they can help improve those areas.  Many of those would be peat habitats.  To improve the quality of the habitats, there could be a carbon dividend there.</p> <p>  In all of this, there is a good news story to tell once you start seeing a reversal in declines.  I am tired of talking about the decline in farmland birds.  We need to be talking about success stories.  Farmers can help with this but we just need to get more money to them to support and incentivise them.  Diversification to support farmland birds is an ecosystem payment.  It is an ecosystem service and payment for ecosystem services.  Society wants more biodiversity, not less.  There is a good opportunity here if we just target that money more to where it needs to be.</p></speech>

There are some that are very rare, like the great yellow bumblebee, which has its stronghold in Belmullet.  There is a project kicking off there, which I believe is an EIP project to help with that species.  Again, this is all about working with farmers.  This is the farmers' good news story.  They are doing the work supporting the habitats for bees.  Bees need food and shelter, which means flowers and places to nest.  If we can help bring back those habitats, we will be helping the bees.  Of course, all of society can help in their gardens but farmers have a lot of habitat on their land and they have a lot of land, so that is where big dividends could be made.</p></speech>

We need a scheme to support breeding waders, that is, birds such as the curlew, redshank, dunlin and lapwing, that like wet grounds.  These are birds with which members may be familiar.  The money would go towards supporting farmers in regard to actions on their farms in an area we would hope to map in our farmland bird hotspot mapping project in order that funding can be properly targeted.  All of the funding would go towards supporting farmer actions such as wader scrapes and other types of habitats.</p></speech>

It is good to have them here.</p> <p>  On organics, I was very happy to hear my colleague Deputy Martin Browne raise that issue.  I note the scheme was opened to farmers today.  Let us hope there is a good uptake.  All members of this committee are in agreement that we are good at what we do in Ireland in agriculture.  There is a proud tradition in that regard.  Members are also in agreement that we can do much more in organics to catch up with our European counterparts.  I accept Dr. Moore's point that we need to do that in a way that is sustainable and achievable.  I take his point that achieving a 5% share that is long-lasting and stable is better than lurching towards some bigger percentage.</p> <p>  I have a question for BirdWatch Ireland with regard to the Department and its obligations under the nature and water directives.  Is the Department meeting its stated objectives under the needs assessment?  On the CAP strategic plan, the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but my sense is that there is a large pot of money in Europe that we are not fighting for on behalf of farmers in Ireland for the types of schemes that are going to pay nature dividends and, as stated by Mr. Stanley-Smith, help farmers to do good things.  Is that true?</p></speech>

If that money was well targeted, we could, through that pot, make huge headway on water, climate and biodiversity, with farmers doing the work and us supporting them.  The Deputy also asked if the Department is meeting the objectives of its needs assessment.  In our view, the CAP regulation is weak.  There was a lot of horse trading in the final negotiation.  Negotiating is difficult with 27 member states arguing for different levels of ambition.  In terms of the regulation, Ireland has stepped up in regard to some elements of the CAP strategic plan.  It has an opportunity to step up further under a particular article, the number of which escapes me at this time.</p> <p>  In terms of water, there are measures within the CAP that could help but, again, not enough of the funding is being targeted towards effective actions that can happen on the ground.  At BirdWatch Ireland we often find that bespoke advice, which we get from engaging with farmers about their farms and what is happening in their areas, is what matters most.  They have a huge pride in what they are doing, especially when they learn about species.  I am sure it would be the same with water when they learn about the measures they can put in place.  If they are supported financially to put those measures in place, it makes a lot more sense to them and, obviously, to their pockets.  We would like to see a lot more targeting.  Within the agri-environment scheme measures on water there is some targeting but given that there are 130,000 farmers, that targeting reaches only a very small proportion of them.  That is the issue.  As I said, there is some targeting, but it does not reach everybody.</p> <p>  In regard to the eco-scheme, between the conditionality of the basic payment through to the eco-scheme, that is where one gets the biggest gains, again because one is targeting 130,000 farmers.  Under the agri-environment scheme, we reach about 50,000 farmers but we reach fewer of them under the co-operative projects element which is even more targeted.  We could be achieving a lot more with the money we have.</p></speech>

Is the door still open on CAP?  As I understand it, it is very much in the political space now.  Is that correct?

We have to remember that the CAP regulation finally agreed is not great.  We can increase ambition under one of the articles.  It is up to all of us to make those requests.</p></speech>

I also thank those who are joining us online.  My first question is to all of the witnesses.  We talk about CAP as if we have to do X, Y and Z environmentally.  In fairness, many farmers are doing things.  Years ago the purpose of the CAP negotiations was to bring down the price the farmer was getting for the food he or she was producing but it was subsidised so that the people in the cities and other areas who could not afford it would be able to afford it?  Do the witnesses recognise that was the reason CAP was introduced in the first instance, that it was not about the extras that have been added to it over the years?  I presume they would agree with that.</p> <p>  It is a while since I last met Ms Duggan.  Birds migrate and come back to Ireland.  Of the species in this country, what percentage migrate and come back?</p></speech>

The problem is we do not have enough habitats.  Farmers putting out a couple of piles of sand might not be enough.  Then it might not be done in the landscape.  I am not even sure how effective that measure is.  If it is done on a landscape scale, there should not be an issue with some localised badger doing whatever he was doing in that pile of sand.</p></speech>

That would have been based on the survey work done by volunteers through citizen science.

That is something that we have called for.  It is very important when we are undertaking measures that there is some way to monitor if it is having a result.  Anecdotally, however, we know the wild bird cover in certain areas increased the local passerine, small bird, population and that birds of prey also benefited from the wild bird cover because they would eat the small birds.  It helped with the food chain.  We would hope that monitoring and evaluation of all these schemes is done so that we know money is being used for the best possible result.</p></speech>

There is a problem.  Ms Duggan spoke of 20,000 ha of trees every year.  Being realistic, we are allowed plant 4,500, is it, or was it 2,500 trees per ha last year?  We should take an holistic view of this.  There is an opportunity which I have spoken of many times.  Just think that there are 130,000 farmers in Ireland.  Each single farm payment application is something around 32 ha.  One thousand trees is an acre, generally.  There are bigger farmers and smaller ones.  I am just averaging it out.  If you could get one of those farmers to put in 1,000 trees in the next few years, would we not achieve 130,000 acres of trees that would do an awful lot of good?  That is about 45,000 or 50,000 ha of a win that we could have between now and the end of CAP.  We should encourage the farmers.  I am not saying you put them all together.  You could put them down by a ditch so that a farmer would not interfere with them, as it were, and sow them in different places that would help biodiversity without inhibiting a small farmer.  That is one scheme.  The eco-scheme, in my opinion, will help a lot under the new CAP.  It is low-hanging fruit in my opinion that we can get.  Anyone thinking we can plant 20,000 ha of trees for the next 15 years would have to start making more land.</p> <p>  I was listening to Mr. Kelly on the phone after the voting.  I will call it straight because I do not believe in beating around the bush.  Mr. Kelly should think about the farmers around this country who went down with stone shores years ago on small farms and, with spades, shored it or gravel tunnelled it.  There are dairy cows in Kerry and a lot of the west is shored land.  Mr. Kelly knows the terrain probably as well as I do.  To tell those farmers they will rewet the land would be like a red rag to a bull.  Anyone who comes out with that should know it will not wash.  There is a saying in the countryside: bad land is like trying to tame a wild duck.  It is hard done.  If you tell a farmer with 30 or 50 acres that the piece down the end of the field that they have been all their life working on, that they have put blood, sweat and tears into, that they are going to let the land go back into the wild after they have been fighting with it all their lives to keep it right, it is not a runner.  I will be honest.  We need to look at other solutions.</p> <p>  I thank everyone for coming in.  There was tree planting under AEOS and under the old REPS scheme.  Under the eco-scheme I think 4% has to be done for biodiversity to qualify for CAP.</p></speech>

I come from the same neck of the woods so we will both speak straight to each other.  That is our way.  I was quoting those particular targets because they are targets that have been put forward by the Climate Change Advisory Council.  One of our jobs as an environmental NGO is to analyse these various policy drivers or policies that might be adopted by the Government and to try to give a view of what the environmental or socioeconomic impacts of that might be.  We would then give some advice or indication of what the best pathway forward might be.  I totally agree with the Deputy on the target.</p><p>I think it was something like 200,000 ha per annum but based on the track record of afforestation figures, that seems totally unfeasible.</p><p> As an environmental NGO, we would not be supportive of a roll-out of the forestry type on which the current model of forestry in this country is based.  It would have devastating impacts on biodiversity, water quality and the socioeconomic well-being of many rural communities.  Having looked at what the Climate Change Advisory Council is saying, if we are to achieve anything like the target figures, we need to see radical change in the type of forestry we plant.  That change needs to be informed by science, covering the best tree in the best place and with the right management.  There also needs to be real engagement with communities because the planting figures we are seeing now indicate that people are voting with their actions.  What people's behaviour tells us is that they do not like the forestry model we have.  I agree 100% with the Deputy on the feasibility of the figures.</p><p> On the re-wetting of agricultural soils, I also agree that there would be massive resistance to the reclamation of improved agricultural land.  One of the key points we are making today is that we see targets and ambitions but we do not see how the Government is proposing to meet them.  We see real constraints, although we also see opportunities.  Ms Duggan spoke about the conservation status of breeding waders.  Obviously returning some of that land to a wetter condition or to wetland would have massive benefits for biodiversity, climate change and water quality but if farmers have to give up their land and return it to a wetland state or a lower management intensity, they should be compensated.</p><p> To go back to the earlier point about the purpose of CAP, while it was originally designed to be a system to subsidise food production, the CAP we have now is much fairer for farmers because it reflects the multiple goods and services that farmers provide to society.  If a farmer who is managing reclaimed land at the moment is incentivised or rewarded for managing it less intensively, is happy to do that and delivers certain public goods and services, then that is a win-win.  We are not saying farmers should be dictated to, their land should be take off them and their ditches blocked overnight.  What we are saying is that there is a real need to recognise the scale of change that is required and in that context, there is a need for engagement, open dialogue and for everyone to learn from each other.  We have our perspectives but every time we engage with farmers, we learn something because they are environmentalists as well.  They are experts too.  Our message is that there is a need for massive change and the CAP as it exists currently is not capable of delivering that.  We need to see a better roadmap for how we are going to get to where we need to be and we need to bring everyone together.</p></speech>

We all accept that we have challenges to meet because of climate change and that we have to adapt but that will be a cul-de-sac.  Farmers will just not go there and that will not happen.  It just will not happen.  It has cost farmers an awful lot of money to make land productive and it is a source of pride to them to have managed to do so.  We have to meet our climate change challenges but we have to find another route because the re-wetting of productive land that has been worked for generations to arrive at that state will not happen.</p></speech>

I think the target in the climate action plan is 8,000 ha per year.  I laid out some figures earlier and have spoken to several Ministers about this previously.  If there are 130,000 farmers and they get 1,000 trees planted over the next few years under the next CAP, that equates to something like 45,000 to 55,000 ha.  If the target is 8,000 ha per year, then we could reach a seven or eight year target.  We also need a certain amount of planting to make sure we are supplying the commercial timber sector but I am talking about the farmer planting down by the ditch.  The group that was here earlier talked about whitethorns and breasting the trees like years ago and there is a lot that farmers are willing to do, in all fairness to them.  That is workable.</p> <p>  It would be no harm if the odd person from the Climate Change Advisory Council went out on the ground to see the reality.  The advisory council can put out all of the figures it wants but it needs to look at where we can get a win to get things moving.  Working with farmers, as Mr. Kelly pointed out, can lead to wins, perhaps in the context of the eco-scheme under the new CAP.  However, as the Chairman has said, land reclamation will not fly.  Anyone who went down the country and suggested that to a farmer would get a bit of a shock.  </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming in.</p></speech>

Mink are a non-native species and are doing serious harm to bird life, hares and other species that have their young on the ground in unprotected areas.  Have our guests any views on how mink can be controlled or curtailed?  In my part of the country, mink are a serious problem for wildlife.</p></speech>

The biggest issue there is providing habitat for them and that involves farmers working to help them with their habitat.  There are predators out there that have an impact but they would be more in the line of corvids and foxes.  That is why we need to be very careful about where we put trees because trees provide cover for foxes and crows.  We really need to make sure that trees are not planted in places that are important for ground-nesting birds because otherwise we will lose even more of them.  That is one issue.  There is no issue in relation to buzzards.  Buzzards are not a threat to our ground-nesting birds.  The main diet of buzzards is rats, rooks and rabbits, the three Rs, so we would not consider them a threat to ground-nesting birds at all.</p></speech>

I will try not to repeat what others have said already.  I will start by sincerely thanking our guests for being here and for the work they do.  It is important that the need for conservation, biodiversity and alternative ways of doing things is articulated at committees like this and in society at large, regardless of whether politicians agree with everything that is put forward.</p> <p>  One issue that would be useful to explore further in the context of the opening statements is the fact that we are in a very late stage in the CAP process.  The CAP strategic plan has been submitted to the European Commission.  The detailed plan was published this week and it is a fairly comprehensive document.  There was quite an emphasis in the opening statements on the need for the CAP to do more in terms of meeting the objectives set out.  What would be useful for this committee to bring to the Department and beyond is the witnesses' perspective on what needs to be changed in the Irish strategic plan in the context of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.</p><p> I noted Ms Duggan&rsquo;s comments earlier in respect of eco-schemes.  Eco-schemes are a set of options on which farmers need to take a number of actions to hold on to a large chunk of their Pillar 1 payment.  I understand the limitations that have been set out in respect of Pillar 2, particularly in the case of the agri-environment schemes, as I mentioned at an earlier meeting.  In some instances, the people we most need to reach may, for many different reasons, be partaking in those types of schemes.  Will our guests be specific - I apologise if they already have been - about what needs to happen in respect of both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2?</p><p> Sometimes this committee gets bogged down in discussing what the CAP needs to deliver, without taking a step back and recognising there are many things we expect the CAP to deliver that could be delivered directly at a national level.  We do not always need to operate these matters from within the Common Agricultural Policy.  What needs to be done, whether in or out of the CAP, that could be delivered outside of the CAP?  Once it does not fall within the remit of state aid, the sky is the limit in terms of what we can deliver nationally through Exchequer funding or alternative schemes.</p><p> To return to the general points, I agree with our guests&rsquo; objectives.  I agree with the carbon targets we have set ourselves and I recognise the need for action.  I would not start here if we were deciding what type of agriculture model we would develop in Ireland, but we are here and this is the starting platform.  I understand that when people hear about &euro;9.8 billion of CAP funding, they think it is a lot, but in real terms it is less than what was available in previous times.  If we are to look at CAP funding as a payment to farmers for carrying out a service, our guests are correct.  In every round of the CAP, the number of services we expect farmers to carry out on behalf of society is getting larger.  The CAP started off as a way of delivering food to a starving Europe and it has expanded to much greater issues such as rural development, environmental biodiversity, climate action, animal welfare - the list goes on.  The difficulty is we are asking farmers to deliver more services with less money and for less money, at a time when their alternative source of income, namely, the price they get for their product, is also under severe pressure in terms of input costs and the market price they receive.    This is not easy and there are no easy solutions, as our guests will appreciate.  Nevertheless, I would be interested to hear how we can address that.</p><p> Mr. Kelly talked about the need for real engagement with communities.  The fundamental problem is that, in the context of our climate action targets, there has not been real engagement with rural or farming communities, or at least they do not feel as though they have been consulted or engaged.  Most of the people I meet tell me they were adhering to the principle of "reduce, reuse, recycle" before it was ever a term.  In any farmyard, there will be a bucket of screws and nothing is ever thrown out.  Baling twine is wrapped up and used for something else.  Farmers will argue they were the protectors of the land before it was popular, when Government and European policies were advocating the destruction of the land for all sorts of reasons.  In many respects, it was farmers and the communities around them who were at the vanguard against some of those destructive measures, yet for many of the people I speak to in my constituency, climate action means additional taxes and charges and their livelihoods being put under threat.  They have not been engaged with to any great degree; in fact, they believe their lives are being made more difficult by something they regard as not necessarily their fault.  On the other hand, they really want to play a part.  Most farmers think in terms of generations in a way most other people do not.  In most cases, when they farm the land, they are thinking about who is going to take over the land when they pass on.</p><p> Do our guests recognise that we need to get a better sense of what engagement is?  Do they have a sense of how we can do that?  I do not pretend to have all the answers and I get very frustrated sometimes with Government policy set out under the guise of climate action that is actually destructive.  Whatever we might think of some Irish farming practices, at an international level we are world beaters in almost every sector in the context of sustainability, yet moves are made to reduce and reduce.  We tell farmers, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe, that they cannot use certain pesticides, for example, but we will import food from the far end of the world where those pesticides are used.  We talk constantly about the number of cows in Ireland, while trade deals are negotiated all the time that will see beef and dairy come to European shelves from countries that do not have a fraction of the level of oversight.  Unless and until we get to that point, these discrepancies and frustrations will grow.  I fear that, as those frustrations grow, it will lead to downright opposition to the progressive changes we need to make.</p><p> Our guests acknowledged this in the context of forestry policy.  It is a really good example of how to make a mess out of something that should be an absolute success story for our country.  The irony is that some of the trees that will be planted will be of very little benefit to the environment and will be planted in places where they will be probably more destructive than if we had left the land alone.  We have seen this in parts of the west, where there are swathes of peatland on which acres of Sitka spruce have been planted.  It is madness from an environmental point of view and, to many communities, when they hear forestry, that is what they think of.</p><p> In the short time that remains, each of our guests might give us a sense of how we can improve that engagement and turn the rhetoric of engagement into a working, live partnership between farmers, rural communities and our shared objectives of creating better conditions for land, wildlife and our country at large.</p></speech>

Our CAP strategic plan has gone to Europe and it is being analysed there, as are all the other CAP strategic plans.  The Commission will write back to Ireland with its views on what needs to be changed, what is good and bad and so on.  At that point, we in the Environmental Pillar will analyse that response from Europe and we will be quite happy to share our analysis of it.  There will be some toing and froing between the countries and Europe for a short while after we receive the response.  If we can provide any useful analysis of the response from Europe, we will certainly do so.</p></speech>

We have seen that with the Burren Life programme.  That is a very simple idea that has gone around the world, and Ireland is now one of the leaders when it comes to results-based agri-environment schemes.  It has had a very positive impact on communities in Ireland and throughout wider Europe.</p><p>We must identify the win-wins.  We must go down on the ground and try to get as many of them implemented as possible.  When we do that, we have to see how we take the next step, that is, how we take these lessons we have learned from these case studies and implement them nationally.  That is something we have not done enough of.  There have been many good targeted schemes, such as things that have found solutions for how to address water quality issues and whatnot, that just have not been rolled out.  That would be one suggestion.  We should try to be better at identifying best practice then rolling out the results from that.</p><p> Another suggestion is we really need a properly funded National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  Our rangers are the people on the ground who are engaging with communities on some of the most difficult conservation issues we have in the country, and the NPWS has been cut to smithereens over the years.  That originally came from an attitude that any environmental regulation was bad, but as that has played out, the result has been much worse for communities because we have had no engagement, we have ignored many issues and it has got to the point things have had to go to Irish courts or EU courts.  Then rules have come in a very abrupt way that has not improved the situation.  We must get much better at recognising the need for grassroots engagement and ensuring we fund the positions and the people who can deliver that at a community level.</p></speech>

He is correct in what he says about the Burren project and that has been very successful.  However, at the beginning of that, it was not working with the farmers but talking to them.  When the farmers took it by the scruff of the neck, it was they who made a success of the project and not the experts.  The farmers in the Burren should take a salute for what they did and what has been achieved.  As Mr. Kelly said, it is being rolled out everywhere now.</p></speech>

I want to follow up on the engagement question.  It is kind of reinforcing what Mr. Kelly said about the Burren.  The European Innovation Partnership element of the CAP in Pillar 2 and the co-operative projects rely on farm advisers and ecological advisers going out on the ground.  It is very bespoke.  They are powerful tools to work with farmers on the ground and that is where you get the engagement.  However, from looking at the sums, there is only about &euro;200 million in that pot.  That is not enough.  We need a lot more money.  If we are serious about engagement, we need a lot more funding out there to talk to farmers about what needs to be done.  I was born and raised on a dairy farm in County Limerick.  I was trying to think of what my dad would say now about what is happening with dairy farming and the need to change.  All I could think of is he would need very bespoke advice on what would suit his circumstances to bring down emissions, work with biodiversity on the farm and look at water quality.  That is what is needed and there is not enough of that in this CAP.<br/><br/>This might be a controversial topic but about 73% of the CAP budget is unattached to outcomes.  Look at the basic payment.  There is the 25% going to eco-schemes but we are not sure how much that is going to be effective for results.  A substantial portion of that CAP funding is not given to ecosystem services.  It is about paying farmers the direct payment to adhere to the law, so it is not all about providing services.  The main area we get bang for that buck is the advice on water and climate through Pillar 2, but that budget is tiny.  It is only &euro;1.5 billion.  The eco-scheme is &euro;1.4 billion.  They are very close but the targeted outcomes will come in Pillar 2 whereas we believe they will not in Pillar 1.  Hedgerows Ireland and colleagues who were here earlier would say there is no focus on improvement of hedgerows in the eco-scheme, so we are going to be paying for the <i>status quo</i>.  That <i>status quo</i>has allowed the removal of hedgerows in GAEC 8 and GAEC 7 currently.  Monaghan County Council can say only 12% of its hedgerows are in good condition at the moment.  We need to be paying and building up that big pot of funding in Pillar 2 to support farmers.</p></speech>

Members and witnesses have the option of attending meetings in the relevant committee room or online through MS Teams.  All those attending in the committee rooms and environs should continue to wear masks covering the mouth and nose throughout the meeting, and these may only be removed when addressing the committee.  Attendees should also continue to sanitise and wash their hands properly and often and to avail of a sanitiser outside and inside the committee rooms, as well as being respectful of people's physical space and practising good respiratory etiquette.

He requested that it be done this month.  The Bill aims to provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote work can be based.  It also aims to provide legal clarity and procedures for employers on their obligations when dealing with such requests.  Subject to the views of members, I anticipate the committee may need to consult more interested parties on this matter ahead of preparing a report.  Many people have been anticipating this Bill and there is huge concern about the way work is changing over recent years, especially with the pandemic.</p> <p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to consider this matter and I welcome online officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Mr. Dermot Mulligan, assistant secretary, workplace relations and economic migration; Ms Wendy Gray, principal officer, employment rights policy unit; and Mr. Mark Doheny, employment rights policy unit.</p> <p>  I will explain some limitations regarding parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses with regard to reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, that witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative he or she complies with any such direction.</p> <p>  The Department's opening statement has been circulated to all members.  To commence consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. Mulligan to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to do so and thank the committee for facilitating pre-legislative scrutiny on this important matter.</p> <p>  I will give some background and context to the Bill.  The increase in home working since March 2020 as a result of Covid-19 has brought remote working to the forefront of working life in Ireland and globally.  Though the adoption of remote work was already increasing in Ireland, Covid-19 has greatly accelerated this trend, making remote work a central part of the workplace today and into the future.   While this arrangement has been beneficial for some, it is important not to conflate the experience of home working during the Covid-19 pandemic with remote working under a regular scenario.  The sudden introduction of home working often resulted in less than ideal working conditions for both employers and employees.  Significant challenges have been faced over this period, including those regarding the remote working infrastructure, suboptimal home working environments and the availability of early learning childcare and schooling.</p> <p>  Despite these substantial challenges, interest in remote working in the long term remains strong among employees.  Research carried out in October 2020 by the NUI Galway Whitaker institute and the Western Development Commission found that 94% of participants would like to work remotely, at least some of the time, after the crisis.   This figure is almost 10% higher than it was in the first phase of the research, published in May of the same year.  Many workers place huge social value on workplace flexibility, and remote working plays a central role in enabling that increased flexibility to support a better work-life balance.</p> <p>  There has been a significant long-term shift in attitudes to remote work among both employers and workers throughout the country.  Acceptance of remote work is high.  Remote and hybrid working is here to stay.  While remote working should never be used as a substitute for any form of childcare, it provides families with more flexibility around which they can base their early learning and childcare choices.</p> <p>  The 2020 programme for Government contains several commitments on the topic.  Remote work is already a key consideration in Government policy documents such as the national economic plan, the climate action plan, the town centre living initiative and the smarter travel policy.  The State is committed to increasing remote work adoption in Ireland through removing barriers, developing infrastructure, providing guidance, raising awareness and leading by example in this area.</p> <p>  The Government&rsquo;s remote work strategy, published in January 2021, aims to build on the progress made in the adoption of remote work over the Covid-19 crisis period.   The strategy is built on three fundamental pillars: first, creating a conducive environment; second, developing and leveraging remote work infrastructure; and third, building a remote work policy and guidance framework.  The strategy sets out plans to strengthen the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees and to provide the infrastructure to work remotely.  It sets out clear guidance on how people can be empowered to work remotely away from the employer&rsquo;s premises.</p> <p>  In the context of pillar 1, creating a conducive environment, a commitment was made to legislate to provide employees with the right to request remote work.  This is one of the key actions of the strategy.  Prior to seeking Cabinet approval to draft the Bill, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertook a full public consultation that sought the views of relevant stakeholders and members of the public on key policy questions around the design of the scheme.  In total, 175 submissions were received with a good mix of views from business and employee representative bodies and individual workers and employers.</p> <p>  In addition to the public consultation, the Department undertook an international review to get a better understanding of how remote working legislation operates elsewhere.  There is no one-size-fits-all model.  Some countries have a similar right to request remote or flexible working, more provide for remote working only by agreement between employer and employee, and many have no legislative framework in this area.</p> <p>  The definition of flexible working is much broader than remote work and may include the possibility of starting or finishing at different times, doing compressed hours, and having access to flexitime and shared working options.  This Bill deals with remote work.</p> <p>  In relation to the key parameters, the policy objectives of the legislation are essentially to provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote work can be based.  It will also provide legal clarity to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.</p> <p>  The legislation will do a number of things.  It will provide a right for employees to request remote working, oblige employers to state business grounds for refusal of such a request and provide a right of appeal to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, where an employer has failed to respond to a request or to provide business grounds for refusal of a request.</p><p>The legislation will also provide for the development of codes of practice to provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives on the general principles that apply in the operation of remote working and to aid with the implementation of the new legislation.  It will oblige employers to prepare a remote working policy specifying the manner in which remote working requests of their employees will be managed and the specific conditions that will apply to remote working generally within the organisation.  The timelines for responding to a request shall also be set out in the employer&rsquo;s remote work policy but shall not be more than 12 weeks.  The legislation will provide that an employer shall not penalise an employee for proposing to exercise or having exercised his or her entitlement to request remote working and provide that the WRC may at the request of the Minister prepare a code of practice for the purposes of any section of this Bill.</p><p> Remote working does not work for everyone or for every organisation so the approach taken in the legislation is a balanced one.  It is recognised that not all occupations, industries or particular roles within an enterprise will be suitable for remote working.  Therefore, even in cases where employers want to support workers and be as flexible as possible, it will not always be an appropriate or suitable option.  It is clear that the interest in remote working in the long term remains strong for a lot of workers and many will want to continue with at least some remote working after the pandemic.</p><p> Regarding eligibility, an employee will be required to have worked for his or her employer for a period of six months before he or she is eligible to submit a request for remote working under the Bill.  This is to allow time for an employment relationship to develop between the employer and employee and is a feature in some existing company-level remote working agreements.  While we do not have a statutory maximum probationary period in Ireland, it is in line with the cap placed on statutory probationary periods of six months under the transparent and predictable working conditions directive.  It is also half the qualification period of the Unfair Dismissals Act at 52 weeks, which will ensure that those on shorter fixed-term contracts can also submit requests for remote working. </p><p> Many companies already offer remote working so the Bill is not intended to undermine existing remote working agreements that may offer more favourable terms overall, many of whom offer remote or hybrid working schemes from day one of the employment relationship.  The Bill is primarily intended to act as a floor-level protection and ensure that workers, particularly those employees who currently have no access to remote working, will have an entitlement to make a request to do so.  Employers will be required to provide grounds when refusing to facilitate an employee's request.  The Government wants to give employees a choice.  The T&aacute;naiste has said on several occasions that as long as the business gets done and services are provided, employers should facilitate remote working where they can.  </p><p> It was important to identify possible examples of business grounds for refusal in the legislation.  The new law also provides for a time limit for an employer to return a decision relating to a request from an employee.  The employer can set out its own specific time limit within its remote work policy but it must not be more than 12 weeks.  Where the employer has diligently completed the assessment process and any appeal has been heard, the employee will be required to wait a period of 12 months to submit another request provided he or she is in the same role.  If an employee moves to a new role within the company, he or she may submit a new request.</p><p> The legislation provides that all workplaces must have a written statement that sets out the company&rsquo;s remote working policy.  This policy will specify the manner in which remote working requests are managed, the timelines that will apply to deal with a request and the conditions that will apply to remote working generally within the organisation.  We will work to minimise the burden of this new requirement on employers.  Information will be provided in the form of templates for remote work policies to assist employers develop their own policy and to help them identify the types of information and procedures that should be outlined in the policy.  The legislation provides for the development of codes of practice to provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives on the general principles that apply in the operation of remote working and to further aid with the implementation of the new legislation. </p><p> As with other statutory employment rights, where an individual believes he or she is being deprived of rights to which he or she is entitled under the remote working Bill, he or she will be able to refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches.  We are currently looking further at the legal issues related to strengthening the redress provisions and a right of appeal and are taking legal advice on the matter.</p><p> This landmark legislation is the first of its kind in Ireland.  The Government has attempted to take a balanced approach in bringing forward the Bill.  Not all occupations, industries, or particular roles within an enterprise will be appropriate or suitable for remote working, for example, construction workers, nurses, doctors, waste collectors, etc.  Calls to introduce a blanket right to remote working are not realistic.  However, the scheme is designed so that all employers must consider the scope for remote working in all roles in formulating their remote working policy.  Some concerns have been raised regarding how remote working can impact people differently depending on gender with care burdens and reduced visibility of remote workers having potentially higher levels of negative impacts for women in the workplace.  I emphasise that the scheme is a work in progress that introduces a statutory framework around requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote working that can be adjusted over time.  In addition, as workplaces return to more normal pre-pandemic status and remote working is properly introduced, we will keep practice under review.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I am very heartened to know I am not the only person who says remote workly when I mean work remotely.  It is an easy mistake to make but I am glad I am not alone in occasionally getting that confused.  Mr. Mulligan said the Department is looking at strengthening the right to appeal.  I really welcome that.  There is no point in us pretending that this legislation has been heralded and lauded, in particular by those representing the interests of workers, because it has not.  The legislation has been subject to quite robust criticism from people who represent workers for a living.  The fact that the T&aacute;naiste said he is open to amendments is welcome because I will have a considerable number.  I sincerely hope they are received in the spirit in which they will be drafted and tabled, namely, being constructive and ensuring we get this right because we need a statutory sick pay scheme.  I have said it previously but I will say it again.  In a pandemic, a statutory sick pay scheme is a very effective and important instrument of public health.  We saw that during the pandemic because we did not have one.</p> <p>  I hope Mr. Mulligan takes my comments and questions in which the spirit in which they are intended but I was very disappointed when I read this legislation.  I will be straight with him.  I share the concerns of my former colleagues and comrades in the Irish trade union movement.  Does he believe the 13 sweeping and pretty subjective grounds for denying a remote working request strike the necessary balance?  ICTU said that this legislation will be judged on whether workers have confidence that it compels an employer to be fair.  The fact that the reasons for refusing have been codified and outlined and are writ very large in the legislation is cause for concern.  Does Mr. Mulligan think it strikes the right balance between employer and employee needs or is this one of the sections the Department will review along with the appeal mechanism?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has asked us to look to see how we can enhance the wording there.</p><p>It is in the context of an employer-employee relationship.  The question is how much can we influence this and to what extent we will interfere with it.  Many employers and employees make their own contractual arrangements.  We are very actively looking at the issue.  It is very definitely a work in progress.</p><p> With regard to the 13 grounds and whether the correct balance is struck, this is something we will look at.  I am aware we have looked at a number of countries where the number of grounds varies from five to eight.  We have included 13 in our proposal. It is something we will look at.  There is a point at which it is not so much a question of the number of grounds but what the sense of it is.  We will be looking at it again and taking on board many of the views that were expressed on the publication of the general scheme and that will be expressed today in the hearing.  We are looking at getting the balance right.  We want to create a framework with a right for employees to request remote working and employers then have to respond in a reasonable way.  How we set up a framework for this is what we are teasing out at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#C00200"><p>I welcome that the Department is open to looking at it.  We only have to look across the water to see how the legislation is working in Britain.  It is reviewing it on the basis that the eight grounds there represent a situation whereby all someone has the right to is to be in a bad mood about not having a request for remote working granted.  To be honest this is what is most disappointing.  I would have assumed the Department looked at other jurisdictions but it did not look at what is happening in Britain and see the difficulties it has for exactly the reasons the Department is proposing to stitch into the legislation.</p> <p>  I have a question on the right of appeal.  At present, as I understand, the appeal is to the WRC.  This is not for having been refused but because the employer did not say why the request was refused.  I will be straight with the witnesses, and I have a fair amount of experience in this, employers are never shy about telling workers why they cannot have what it is they might be looking for.  I do not think the Department is fixing a problem that actually exists with this.</p> <p>  The problem arises because there is no assessment tool for objectively managing why something will be refused.  Employers have been given a suite of options to tick a box and pick from the 13 reasons to say "No".  What has not been given to the worker is the right to go to the WRC and say, for example, the employer has refused the right to remote working because he or she has determined the person lives too far away.  The person may live in the same postcode but this cannot be offered as a reason.  Do the witnesses see where the difficulty with this is?  Do they see that coming from this position makes it very difficult?  I read this as 13 reasons someone cannot have remote working.  Workers read this as the T&aacute;naiste listing the reasons people cannot have remote working.  This policy should be positive.  It should be about granting it to the maximum extent possible.  I do not accept what Mr. Mulligan said in his opening remarks about the need to reinforce to people that some jobs cannot be done remotely.  People know this.  They are not foolish.  A nurse working in the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital this morning does not imagine for a minute that she can do her job remotely.  She knows.  These are not the people who request remote working.</p> <p>  Specifically on the right to appeal, Mr. Mulligan says the Department is examining it.  From what perspective is it being examined?  What type of changes is the Department looking at making?  Is it looking to ensure this will be rebalanced?  In my opinion it is not balanced at present.  It is very much out of kilter and balanced in favour of the employer.  Is this what the Department is looking at with regard to the appeal?  Is it that it will keep the 13 grounds but include a reinforced appeal?  Is it looking at dropping some of the 13 reasons for refusal?</p></speech>

We are looking at the number of grounds, the wording of the grounds and the grounds for appeal.  They all function together in an integrated way.  It is probably less important what the number of grounds are and more important what the wording is and what the sense of all of this is.  The grounds are there at one level as indicative but not exclusive.</p> <p>  With regard to the right to appeal to the WRC, as I mentioned we are trying to find a balance in the employer-employee relationship and to find the right balance so the employee has the right to request and the employer has the right to refuse if there are reasonable grounds.  This is the balance we are trying to strike.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#C00400"><p>Does Mr. Mulligan not see that by not giving the worker a right to test what the employer is saying, it is very much tilted in favour of the employer?  It is the equivalent of what your Ma would have said to you years ago: "Just because I said so".  This is effectively what it is.  Let us be honest, it is regrettable we are at the stage where something that is so desperately needed by workers is being considered as inadequate to deal with it.  It would have been better if we had started from a better place but we are where we are.  I strongly encourage the Department to look at rebalancing this in favour of workers.  There is not a person I have seen, as yet, certainly from speaking to people in the trade union movement and from what they have said publicly, who believes this will deliver for workers.</p> <p>  I want to speak about the appeal mechanism.  Under the legislation people have to wait for six months before they can apply.  Then the employer has a further 12 weeks to consider it.  This means it will be nine months later.  Then people can lodge an appeal to the WRC.  From my understanding it can take anything from ten to 12 months before it will be heard.  It could go faster and sometimes people can be lucky with the WRC.  However, it will not go any faster than six months.  This means it will be already well over a year before a worker can access a final determination on whether he or she can access remote working.  Mr. Mulligan outlined all the reasons people need remote working.  It will be a year when people will have had to juggle their childcare arrangements.  It is a year in which they will have had to commute when perhaps they should not have needed to.  When the Department is looking at rebalancing this and the appeals mechanism, is it the intention to include as part of the appeal the grounds upon which a worker was refused?  At present how it is written does not effectively give a worker this right or anything close to it.</p></speech>

As Mr. Mulligan said, it is one of the issues we are looking at.  It will be the reasonableness of why it was declined.  One of the issues we had looked at is the scenario where potentially an employee might say he or she would like to work from Spain or another jurisdiction.  This is the reason distance is included.  It is not for the local area that an employer would refuse.  Absolutely the reasonableness of the refusal would definitely be something that we will look at in terms of being able to appeal it as would whether the WRC would be able to adjudicate on it.  It is really with regard to another jurisdiction.  Because it is so popular we may have people saying they would like to work from a beach in Spain.  This is the distance issue and this is why some of the issues are in there.  We are taking advice on the reasonableness of these issues and whether an adjudicator can look at them and say it is absolutely not reasonable.  This is something we want to work on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.249" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#C00600"><p>It is not in any way clear from the legislation that it is referencing Spain or anywhere outside the jurisdiction.  It relates to some sort of a unspecified distance requirement.  The Department does see the difficulty with this.  Workers could be working from just down the road.  They could be working in the next building.  They could live in the next building and choose to work remotely for whatever reason or want to work remotely.  The employer can refuse it and the grounds of distance can be cited by the employer but then never be tested.  There is no point in going to the WRC if it cannot test the reasons the person is being refused and only the fact the person has been refused.  A worker could walk into an adjudication and the employer will say he or she has been reasonable and is not required to do anything else under the law.  The worker will say it is unreasonable.  The WRC then has to make an adjudication on the basis of the request only and not the reason for refusal.  I welcome the fact the Department is looking at it.  I will say again I regret the fact it was not looked at in advance.</p><p>I and many others have said there are better ways to make this work.  </p><p> Given there are such long waits to get cases dealt with in the WRC, which everyone would acknowledge, and it is probably testament to the good work it does that people are queuing up to have their cases dealt with by it, does Mr. Mulligan accept that enforcement of the legislation is weak and needs to be strengthened?  It would be helpful for any worker watching these proceedings to understand where the Department is coming from on this Bill.  Given the waiting period and time involved, if it is accepted an employee could end up working in his or her work location for a year and a half while his or her appeal application for remote working is being considered, is the Department examining a way to speed up that process, or considering putting in place a clearing mechanism in place in advance of the legislation, or will it remain that an appeal would be referred to the WRC but additional tests of reasonableness may be added?</p></speech>

If it is different from that, the implications for the workload of the WRC would be different.  There would be a whole other set of considerations to think through in terms of logistics to cater for that.  It depends where we end up with the shape of the Bill, when enacted.</p></speech>

This should be a good news story but there are too many flaws in it.  As an employer, I believe it is too heavily stacked against the employees in many cases.  That can be noted from the first contribution.  It gives rise to too many questions and too much uncertainty.  Companies naturally need to monitor their employees by some method.  What is proposed is a little over the top.  I will give a few examples.  At this stage a number of issues arise.  For example, will employees be entitled to recoup costs from their employer for setting up work from home stations in terms of equipment, including laptops and printers, and for the energy costs incurred?  A major issue in west Galway is the roll-out of broadband, which leaves people there at a significant disadvantage.  Has consideration been given to the fact that many employees do not have access to the required broadband standard, which would leave them at a significant disadvantage?</p> <p>  While the past 18 months to two years have been different, from speaking to employees in Galway, I would have concerns about support for employees working from home full time with respect to mental health supports.  Larger employers or companies are rolling out teams, including a mix of mental health aid with occupational health nurses and voluntary representatives as a point of contact.  I would be concerned to ensure an appropriate format for that would be in place for employees and that there would be an element of mental health assistance and better supports for them.  Does Mr. Mulligan consider more needs to be done for the employee and that it is too easy for an employer to refuse an employee's request to work from home on any grounds the employer might want to give?  I would raise the issue of the well-being of employees and he might address that point first.</p></speech>

It is a matter of trying to find that balance.  I hear what the Senator is saying in terms of his view on where that balance lies at present.  We are trying to provide a legal framework to give employees, for the first time, a right to request remote working, to provide a legal framework to allow that conversation to take place between employers and employees and, generally, and this is very much to the fore of our minds, to implement our making remote work policy.  We want to promote remote working.  It has many benefits for regional and rural Ireland, as we have seen.  That is very much to the fore of our minds as we develop this policy.  We seek to promote remote work to secure the benefits of it which both employees and employers have seen in recent months.</p> <p>  The Senator raised good points relating to mental health and broadband access.  In practice, those are elements we need to bear in mind from the point of view of employers and employees.  Employers have a duty of care for employees with respect to their mental health and employees also have a responsibility.  That is something we need to bear in mind.  It is not so much a matter for detailed description and prescription in the Bill, the purpose of which is to put in place a legal framework, and the putting of that in place allows these discussions to take place and allows us to address the issues the Senator has raised regarding mental health and so on.  My colleague, Ms Gray, would like to come in.</p></speech>

As the Senator said, broadband access may be an issue in certain rural areas but there has been significant investment in enterprise centres and hubs around the country to allow for remote working to take place in that type of commercial setting where the broadband access might be better.  Remote working would not necessarily be in an residential setting where the employee would be isolated and that would also help address the mental health issue.  It is about offering people more choices and options.  Significant investment has been made in enterprise centres and hubs around the country, which would help alleviate the isolation and assist the technical aspects of remote working.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for a code of practice, which will establish best practice for employers and employees with regard to how schemes will work at organisational level.  We see all of these as key issue to be discussed in the code of practice.  We have considered these issues as part of the process.</p></speech>

I have just a few questions.  The heads of the Bill require every employer to have a remote working policy.  There are some forms of employment where remote working will not arise.  I am thinking of businesses such as hairdressing.  The person has to be on the premises to cut someone's hair.  In situations where remote working would not work for employees, will it be possible to opt out of having a policy?  It does not make any sense to be required to have a remote working policy when all employees have to be on-site and cannot work remotely.  The Department might give consideration to that because the heads state, "An employer who, without reasonable cause, fails to bring to the attention of its employees the established and maintained Remote Working Policy", will be committing an offence but that does not provide for an opt-out from having one in the first place.  Certain employers may not need to have such a policy for various reasons.  The Department might look at that.</p> <p>  Does the Bill envisage hybrid working where people may work at home or in a remote hub for one or two days a week and go into the office for another two or three days?  Is it all or nothing?  Can that be built in or is it implied in the legislation?</p> <p>  My third question has to do with loneliness, isolation and so on, which has been mentioned.  I have been speaking to some younger people who have been working remotely and they are really craving to get back into the office for the social interaction.  One young man told me that he was at home in his own kitchen talking to himself all day and that it was driving him nuts.  In situations where remote working does not work, can a request be made to go back to the office?  It could suit many employers to have their workers working remotely and to dispense with the office completely.  It would be a massive saving for an employer to not need to have an office at all or if the number of work stations or the space rented in an office block could be reduced.  Is it possible for the employee to request to dispense with remote working and to go back to the office or even to go back to a hybrid model of some sort?  Will employees be locked into working remotely even if it does not work out for them for whatever reason?</p> <p>  There is also an implied issue with respect to the equipment that might have to be made available.  If somebody requests to work remotely and that request is granted, it seems to be implied that, on foot of that, the employer would have to make equipment available at the remote location.  Depending on the work, we may be talking about desks, chairs, computers, printers and whatever else.  Does that imposition on the employer naturally follow on from an agreement on working remotely?  It seems to be implied in the legislation that it would.  Maybe it does and maybe it does not.  If it does not, the issue of the employer being responsible for the health and safety of the employee who makes the equipment available arises.  There may be extra costs there.</p> <p>  Issues of taxation, data protection and codes of practice are also mentioned.  Data protection is a particular concern for certain employers.  I believe remote working is a very good idea in certain instances, as I believe we all do.  It saves on travel costs, saves time, improves quality of life and, in many instances, can also improve productivity.  However, the issue of data protection arises.  Some employers have told me they are concerned about it, especially in remote working hubs where a number of people are working at desks side-by-side.  Some employers have told me that if there is to be remote working, they want their own discrete, secure space where their employees will work so that they are doing cannot be overheard or made available to competitors and so on.  That is something I would like the witnesses to comment on.</p> <p>  I see in some of the documents I have read that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are being asked to promote remote working among their clients.  Will the officials comment on that?  How is it going down?  Are they doing it strongly?  How will this Bill impact on that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Wendy Gray" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#E01300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  With regard to the remote work policy employers must have, when drafting the Bill, the thinking was that it can be tricky to legislate to exempt whole sectors or professions because we could inadvertently omit somebody who could be facilitated.  For example, we might have chosen to exempt manufacturing.  While machine operators cannot work remotely, there may be administrative or clerical people who could easily be facilitated.  In the case of schools, people who do the accounts or secretarial work might easily be facilitated.  That is the reason we are not legislating to rule out and exempt whole sectors or businesses.  If an employer, such as the example of a hairdresser the Deputy mentioned or a butcher, has examined all roles, the policy may simply state that all the roles in the organisation have been examined and that remote work cannot be facilitated.  It could be as simple as that.  The plan is to provide templates for companies to work through in drafting their policies, assisting them so that they do not have the burden of trying to come up with things themselves.  We will assist companies and promote templates for how to write a policy, including policies that state the business cannot facilitate remote working.  We will mitigate that burden on employers.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's queries on hybrid working, we absolutely envisage that many employers and employees will want a mix rather than a full five days at home.  Hybrid working will absolutely be there.  We envisage employers' remote working policies covering how hybrid working is to be dealt with.  Some employers may not want 100% remote working while others may.  That will be part of their own policies.  It will also be part of the guidelines in the code of practice that will be developed to support the understanding of the rights and obligations involved.</p> <p>  On the issue of revocation, this is part of the normal terms and conditions of employment and will also be set out in the remote working policy.  The employer may not have desks or something like that and may say that he needs two or three weeks' notice if somebody is choosing to come back into the workplace permanently.</p><p>Again, we will be providing guidelines that should be set out easily for workers to understand where their rights are in giving up the remote work scenario.  That will be all set out to assist employees in the policy as well.</p><p> On equipment, the employer is responsible for providing the correct equipment for an employee to carry out their role.  Similarly, with health and safety, that obligation on employers should not change.  I am not sure that many employers would be happy if someone would choose to use their own private laptop or something, so I think many employers would want to provide the appropriate protections and security protections on a laptop or whatever.  We would envisage that there would be no change on the applications to the employer to support the worker to carry out his work properly.</p></speech>

Let us wrap up there, as Senator Ahearn wants to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#F00300"><p>I thank the officials for their contributions.  One official spoke about how this can have a real impact on rural regions.  I am from an area in south Tipperary where we are an hour from Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Kilkenny.  There are thousands of people who travel - or, certainly before Covid, travelled - to work.  People are saying that the draft legislation as it is at the moment is very much weighed in favour of the employer.  However, we are not finished yet.  In fairness, the T&aacute;naiste is open to amendments.  We have to remember this is legislation that is coming through to support the employee.</p> <p>  Are businesses and employees almost ahead of this?  We are bringing in legislation and it is important to do that.  However, the conversations between employees and employers have happened already.  Due to the past two years, it is almost a prerequisite demand from many employees, that this is what they want from an employer and if they do not get it they just look somewhere else.  Is that something that has already been seen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#F00400"><p>I think the Senator is right in that there has been a great deal of remote working during the pandemic in the past two years.  Even as we come out of the pandemic, we are seeing that rather than returning to five days a week in the office, hybrid working is much more popular.  This means, perhaps, a number of days in the office and a number not.  Still, probably some people are working 100% remotely.</p> <p>  The aim of this legislation is provide a legal framework so that employees have a right to request this.  As in all things, the occurrence of remote working can be uneven.  There are some sectors, as the Senator said, where there is an awful lot of it going on and it is very common.  In fact, to some extent, in some sectors, probably employers will have to offer either significant hybrid working or remote working in order to attract employees and the skills that they need.  That will be a reality in certain occupations and certain sectors of the marketplace.  </p> <p>  There are other sectors where, perhaps, remote working is something that has not been happening as much as it might and employers need to consider it more.  This legislation aims to give the employee the right to request of those employers that they seriously consider this.  That is the change and difference.  It also puts in place a legal framework to allow those conversations to take place.  </p> <p>  We would be very conscious of the impact in rural and regional areas, as the Senator said, and hub development is part of that.  Some &euro;9 million was announced last summer to try to continue to enhance hubs in regional and rural areas.  </p> <p>  There was a question earlier about Enterprise Ireland, EI, and the Industry Development Authority, IDA, and whether they are promoting this.  They most certainly are.  In particular, in relation to IDA, remote working is a key part of being able to supply businesses with the skills that they need in a tightening labour market in certain sectors.  Therefore, it is very much part of our enterprise policy and our enterprise agencies' activities, both EI and IDA.  We see this as part of the future and so we need to put a legal framework in place to make sure that there is a floor of protection, it occurs in a structured way and the employers that have not thought about it perhaps think about it more deeply whenever they get the request from the employee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#F00500"><p>I have two quick questions on that.  Mr. Mulligan spoke about remote hubs and the amount of money that is being put into them.  Does he think it needs to be ramped up even more?  Where I live in Tipperary, we have two excellent remote hub areas.  However, the demand is increasing week on week and month on month.  To manage that for companies looking to facilitate remote working, whether it is not at home in rural areas where I live where we might not have good broadband, but they want to do it in towns such as Cahir, Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir, do we need to ramp it up more?</p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan said there is a six-month period before someone can request remote working because there needs to be a relationship between the employer and the employee built up.  However, over the past two years, we have had an awful lot of people who have started a career with a company in remote working from the very start.  The employees and employer have not seen each other very much.  </p> <p>  Does Mr. Mulligan have information or statistics on how that has worked from the employer's perspective?  He said there needs to be a six-month period for that relationship to develop.  Does that mean that over the past two years that has been a challenge for employers or not?  It seems to me that part of the interview process at this stage will nearly be an offer of remote working as part of someone taking a role.  It would certainly be a conversation.  I can understand why there is a six-month period talked about but, practically, I do not see the logic in it because the opposite has been happening over the past two years.  I am interested in Mr. Mulligan's view on that.</p></speech>

Generally, the point is that we are creating a floor, a legal framework and a set of protections.  The Senator is right that in many employments, employers are happy to go directly to a remote working situation.  However, that is for the employer to decide.  Obviously, we do not intend to interrupt, infringe or impinge on any of those arrangements in any way.  We are creating a floor and we want to promote remote working generally.  Perhaps I will ask Mr Gray to come in and then Mr. Doheny.</p></speech>

It is the floor that we are offering, in terms of the minimum right of the employee.  In addition, it is quite common to have a number of months to serve in an employment before an employee gets legal rights, in particular, rights such as parental leave, carer's leave and unfair dismissals.  Those all require a certain amount of time served before an employee gets those rights.  We would be happy to consider a recommendation if the committee feels that six months is too long.</p></speech>

They mentioned that it was an onboarding process and that the initial six-month period was very difficult to get full handle on in a fully-remote environment.  It certainly was something that stuck out and it was repeated by IBEC and individual employers, and even some employees in the consultation.  It was something we heard over and over.</p></speech>

This was described as landmark legislation.  The question has to be asked, how can it be described as landmark legislation when there is no balance between the employee and the employer?</p><p>I refer to employees having to wait for 26 weeks before they can even ask to work remotely.  They then have an inordinate wait of 12 weeks before they can get an answer.  The grounds for refusal are so wide as to make the right to request meaningless.  Equally, there is no proper right to appeal the grounds for refusal.  How can the Department reconcile the ambition that was set out in the strategy on remote working, wherein the T&aacute;naiste referred to more opportunities being available for those with disabilities, caring responsibilities and those living in rural Ireland, with the rigid, conservative and very much right-to-request-focused proposed legislation we have here?</p><p> Turning to specific questions, head 6 deals with employees having to wait 26 weeks when they start before they can even ask to work remotely.  I know of no other workplace right that kicks in at 26 weeks.  The way it is drafted here means that it amounts to a perk for good behaviour as opposed to something we must be embedding into the future of work.  I would therefore like to hear a little bit more about how the 26-week period was decided.</p><p> Turning to head 12(3)(j) regarding concerns about commuting, why should the length and-or distance of the commute matter?  Inserting that provision ignores the decisions others here have highlighted.  I refer to decisions people have made during the pandemic to relocate because of the costs of rent and buying property in some of the main urban areas.  We are also on dangerous ground because we are asking employers to decide on the appropriateness of a commute.  Could we then end up in a situation where it might be considered okay for a single person to be commuting for two hours but not okay for a working parent or somebody with other responsibilities to be doing so?  We are getting into a space here where we are allowing employers to make decisions about the type of commute and, effectively, differentiating between workers, which is a very dangerous context.  Provision is made in these heads concerning the location of where a person works.  This issue is therefore already covered, and inserting this proposed provision regarding the length of commute is alarming.  I look forward to the responses.</p></speech>

On how the proposed legislation can be termed "landmark" and how it advances the Making Remote Work strategy, the first action in that document published by the Department was to "Legislate to provide employees the right to request remote work".   It is a right that has not so far existed, so this proposed legislation is landmark in that sense.  It is the first and central action contained in the remote working strategy published by the Department.</p> <p>  Regarding the balance between employers and employees, and we have heard today and previously several different views concerning where the balance lies in this regard and what is the appropriate balance, we would be the first to say that is not an easy thing to arrive at.  We are working through the various legal and policy issues to try to find what the appropriate balance in this regard should be and how it should be expressed in this proposed legislation.  This is very much a work in progress.</p> <p>  Turning to the 26-week wait and the commute, I ask my colleagues to comment on those aspects.  Mr. Doheny has already spoken a little about these points.</p></speech>

It is there to allow employers to judge whether such a commute might be suitable.  For example, if an employee is going to be a three- or four-hour flight away from work, would that be acceptable to the employer?  The inclusion of this point is there to give balance in this regard.</p></speech>

In the cases of most employers, we would be relying on this type of discussion being had before the legislation is enacted anyway.  If employers have experience over the past two years of the workers applying having carried out their work, the T&aacute;naiste has said many times that his expectation would be that employers would continue with that arrangement.  Having seen the evidence of the work being carried out properly over the past two years and there having been no difference in productivity, why not continue with the arrangement?</p></speech>

To be clear, though, the proposed Bill will not provide for any of that.  There is no recognition of the successful experience in many cases and of people working from home, and that is a glaring omission in the proposed Bill.  I also asked how the 26-week waiting period was decided.</p></speech>

Various pieces of legislation have such provisions necessitating the serving of a certain time.  The other issue we examined was facilitation of the training of people before they work remotely, because we have had feedback that it is often difficult to train people if they start remote working on day one.  That said, employers have the choice to offer employees such terms and conditions from day one if they wish to.  Therefore, employers are free to offer remote working to employees from day one.  What we are doing is just providing for a legal right and that must be treated differently and have a balance.  That is why we have selected six months as the potential qualifying period, which is much shorter than is the case regarding when many other employment rights kick in.  We are, however, again happy to take on board the views of the members of the committee and to consider this if they feel it is too extreme.</p></speech>

Turning to head 7 and the limitation regarding submitting another request within 12 months, I note that the definition of "remote work" states it is an umbrella term and that the concept of flexible work is part and parcel of the ability to work remotely.  In this head, however, I am reading language used such as "constant requests" being put forward by employees.  That says much about whose side the Department is on regarding this legislation.  Equally, it seems counter-intuitive to set a 12-month gap between the submission of a request to an employer and subsequent submission of another request.  What about a situation where a temporary arrangement may be needed to work from home or another location for several weeks?  Such a provision is not provided for at all in this legislation.  There is no flexibility embedded in these draft heads of the Bill as they stand.</p></speech>

It is too difficult to legislate for such instances.  We would expect, as normal and as things are working now, that most employers will be open to discussing with employees issues that may arise in situations requiring something to happen temporarily.  There is not necessarily a need for the State to intervene in such cases and to legislate for that kind of temporary or emergency arrangement to be put in place.  It is too difficult to envisage and legislate properly for every scenario.</p></speech>

I was speaking on our Private Members' Bill.  My apologies if I ask questions that have already been answered.  As currently drafted, the heads of the Bill are extremely weak and give a right to request, which is fine, and then a right to deny by the employer on very broad business grounds.  There is a list of 13 reasons, but it is explicitly stated that it is not an exhaustive list so an employer can reject on any business ground.  When we discussed this with the Minister last week, he said that perhaps 13 reasons are too many and he indicated a willingness to look at the grounds for refusal.  That was not included in the opening statement.  Is the witness considering the issue of the grounds being too broad and so forth?</p></speech>

The answer is "Yes".  We are considering the number of grounds and the wording of them.  The Deputy might have been here when I said we are trying to find the right balance between an employer who has to run a business and an employee who has an interest.  We want to create a right to request remote working, and we want to promote remote working in general.  We see all the benefits that has for the employee, the employer and, indeed, wider society and the economy.  We have to take all that into account.  In considering this piece of the grounds and so forth, we will be reflecting on all that.</p></speech>

In a sense the Department could remove all 13 grounds and it is still left with business grounds, which is extremely broad.  Any business can refuse on business grounds.  That appears to me to be where the problem is, as opposed to the 13 grounds.</p></speech>

What is in the heads of the Bill at present is the right to appeal as effectively a procedural right.  One can appeal on procedural grounds that one's employer did not refer back to one in time, as opposed to on substantial grounds that the business grounds the employer is citing are not substantiated.  Is the Department indicating a willingness to amend or change that?</p></speech>

He has asked us to examine that to see what can be done with that piece.  We are in the territory of the interests of the employer in running a business and the rights and responsibilities of the employee.  That is a complicated area.  Legally, there are a number of issues we have to think through in that space as well.  It is not simple, but we have been asked by the Minister to examine that and to consider what we can do, so we are looking at that.</p></speech>

The right to request is very limited when the employer can just refuse and one cannot appeal on substantive grounds.  Hopefully, that will be amended.</p></speech>

What we have to try to find is a legislative measure that will create a legal framework for employees to request remote working and to have that right to request, but also to create a framework where an employer can and should respond in a reasonable and considered way to that request.  We are very clear that we want to promote remote working in Ireland and we see all the benefits of it, so we are trying to find our way to strike the balance in an appropriate way between the various interests.</p></speech>

Is that something the Department has considered as an addition to the current model, which is based on all-year-round remote working and the right to remote working?  The idea is that a worker who normally would travel to the place of work might be able to say that he or she is also entitled to 20 days of remote working and can take them as necessary.</p></speech>

I had a Topical Issue debate in the D&aacute;il this morning.  However, I heard most of the evidence.  First, I welcome Mr. Mulligan and the team and thank them for their work on this.  In a normal situation these are terms and conditions that would be subject to negotiation, but what we have had here is a step change and as a result we have to ensure that a step change can happen in an environment where there are established contracts and there is no time for all the negotiation.  I can understand how the Department is trying to steer a route.  There are cost and convenience issues on both sides and we have to try to reach a reasonable outcome.  There is a concern in the committee that with this refusal of it as not suitable on business grounds, very trivial cost issues could be offered and it appears there is no opportunity for an adjudication.</p> <p>  What I would like to explore with the witnesses is the role of the codes of practice.  I know the codes of practice can be recognised by order.  It is stated in the heads of the Bill that there can be codes for any section of the legislation.  Will that include the section that offers the grounds for refusal?  Will the codes be able to test and set up what are reasonable grounds through these codes?  Could the codes be different for different sectors?  One can obviously see how difficult it would be to provide a code that would cover both hairdressing and IT services, that are normally delivered remotely.  The other issue is that if those codes can cover areas such as what is a reasonable ground for any one of those tests, be it cost, convenience, confidentiality, commuting and the rest of the 13 grounds, in a complaint that might be made to the WRC, how would those codes be interpreted by the WRC?  Could a breach of what would be established by order as a code constitute a ground for saying the employer had acted unreasonably and therefore the employee is entitled to redress either by getting his or her request or by getting financial compensation or whatever it would be?  I want to explore how powerful a tool these codes can be.</p> <p>  There is a balance to be struck and it is hard to do that in primary legislation.  I hear members say that 12 weeks is too long to decide, but it is a maximum of 12 weeks.  If there are assessments to be done of confidentiality, health and safety or whatever it would be, one could see circumstances where it would take some time to establish that.  The question again is whether employers use these periods reasonably or they simply exploit them for spinning out the process as long as they can and frustrate the request.</p> <p>  My central question is really to explore the codes and how effective they could be.</p></speech>

The WRC conducted various negotiations with unions and employer representative bodies to set out guidance and best practice to help employers to roll out the legislation in full compliance and also to help employees to understand what their rights are.  The Deputy is right in saying that the code is not an offence in itself.  Section 29 of the Workplace Relations Commission Act provides that in any proceedings before a court, the Labour Court or the WRC, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence, including any provision of the code which appears to the court to be relevant to any of the questions arising in the proceedings.  They are useful and helpful.  We can look at including all the different aspects that the unions and employer bodies deem to be helpful in the code when it is being drafted over the next months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#J00200"><p>I would like to explore that further.  Ms Gray refers to it being admissible in a hearing.  If the hearing was about an unreasonable refusal for a request for remote working which was brought to the WRC, would that mean that, if the employer had used a cost defence but it was of such a trivial nature and was not in compliance with the spirit of the code, the employee then would win the case?  Precedent would then become established fairly quickly once the codes were published if they were sufficiently defined for different sectoral situations.  Employers would have to quickly move to adopt a reasonable approach as established in the WRC.  This is an important issue for us because if we are to change the primary legislation, hoping to get an outcome that strikes a balance, that is a difficult job to do.  It would be better if the WRC had scope to test this reasonableness and establish codes that are flexible enough for different circumstances.</p></speech>

We need to look at it with regard to the reasonable grounds.  We are trying to balance it.  We cannot cause an avalanche of cases going to the WRC.  We also need to manage expectations.  The code of practice will be looked at.  We expect that individual employers would put certain parameters in place regarding requests for remote work in their own policies.  That will be taken into account as well, depending on how they deal with issues such as costs in the remote work policy and explain to employees how they will treat requests.  We have to look further at that.</p></speech>

We have to plan the timing for the commencement of the legislation.  We have to work towards that to ensure that employers know what they are doing when the legislation comes into place.  We are planning to have consultations in tandem while we are working through some of the legislation.</p></speech>

I welcome this legislation.  As a regional Deputy, I think it potentially offers great opportunity for people to try to work remotely.  It may not be every day of the week but it would be a number of days.  We are spending money on innovation hubs and working hubs around the country.  This is a good opportunity to try to cut down on the amount of commuting and to give people a better quality of life.  I think that, in general, employers will embrace it where it is reasonable.  I will present a number of scenarios and I ask Mr. Mulligan to give his opinion on them.  Does he think that remote working might disadvantage career progression, where someone is out of the office and someone else who is in the office is promoted?  Could this lead to a case of constructive dismissal?</p> <p>  If someone takes on remote working and decides that she is going to raise the kids at home for a few years, then the kids go to school, then she decides that she would like to go into the office, how would she be accommodated under the policy?</p> <p>  The other matter relates to commercial rates.  Many companies are tied into leases of up to 15 years for office space.  We are now saying to them that they need to be able to offer a good proportion of their staff the opportunity to work from home.  Does Mr. Mulligan think that there is any softening in the legislation, potentially with a rebate for employers who will have to offer that and are now renting space that they do not need because they are implementing this policy?  The Government is offering a tax credit for setting up domestic offices.  Does Mr. Mulligan think it is enough?  I do not think it is enough, especially if substantial IT systems are being installed.</p> <p>  The last matter relates to employer liability issues.  I am sure Mr. Mulligan saw the issue some time ago where a German worker tried to take an employer to court after falling down his own stairs.  How does Mr. Mulligan think insurance concerns will be considered by employers when they refuse remote working opportunities?</p></speech>

There are questions to be considered about career progression.  I referred to that in my opening statement.  Regarding whether people want to move back into an office from a remote situation, that is, in a sense, a right to request to work in the office, which is counterfactual in a sense.  They are all issues which are to be considered.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to employer liability too.  There are some real issues relating to employer responsibilities and obligations.  The Health and Safety Authority has issued guidance relating to working from home.  That plays a big part in how we balance the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees in a working from home situation.  The Deputy referred to a case in a different jurisdiction, which has a different set of employment laws.  It is an interesting issue.  We need to work through a number of issues as we apply this policy and as remote working becomes more widespread and permanent.  The Deputy raised commercial rates and the question of a rebate and tax credits.  They are outside the scope of this Bill but they are issues which will need to be considered as remote working becomes a more permanent feature.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste was here last week, talking about developing occupier's liability insurance.  He is hoping to introduce something to address that shortly.  I imagine that, at the present time, that extends to somebody who is contracted to work at home.  It might be a stretch but I am sure that many legal eagles around the country would not mind trying to create the association.  The other matter that I wish to raise relates to taking on somebody on a remote working contract.  If a lady wants to start her family, takes a contract for working from home and has that understanding with the employer, will this legislation supersede that understanding, so that she can then request to come into an office, which she was not offered as an option at the start because other people were working in the office?</p></speech>

He or she could request some element of remote and office-based work that would have to be considered by the employer.</p></speech>

The issue of insurance has not been well thought-out in this legislation.  We might be solving one problem but creating another.  That is what I would like to see put to bed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1648" speakername="Emer Currie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022020900002#K00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to ask questions.  I very much welcome this legislation and the remote work strategy that was launched last year.  We can consider this in respect of supply and demand.  We certainly have the demand for remote working and can see how the Government is investing to create an environment that allows people to work in their communities.  It is investing in hubs and broadband and by way of the Town Centre First initiative that was launched.  We also have to make sure there is a supply of remote jobs and that employers are facilitating remote working in order for us to deliver on the vision.</p> <p>  I have three questions.  They concern change, the grounds and language of the grounds, and appeals.  I read the consultation paper.  Have the delegates engaged with remote-only companies that have been operational in Ireland for longer than Covid, such as Glofox, Flipdish, Shopify and Flexco, which has over 1,000 employees?  I refer to companies that are leading in this area.  My concern is that the consultation and submissions might be skewed in favour of employers that have concerns and see barriers instead of opportunities.  Is there an opportunity to bring in those companies that are leading in this area to talk about how they deal with health and safety, data protection, monitoring, well-being and onboarding?  They are dealing with this matter already.  It could be good for the committee to hear from them.  If a consultation is being conducted, we should be leading the employers instead of having the employers lead us.</p> <p>  I also want to ask about the resources that are being made available.  We support SMEs with productivity and digital transformation.  This is a matter of digital transformation; it is about creating offices that are digital first.  We are focusing on people and the issues people might have regarding lost opportunities in the workplace, but we need to realise that it is the roles that are remote and that it is up to the company to embrace the culture of remote working rather than become too fixated on the idea of the legislation allowing people to work from home instead of allowing companies to become digital first and embrace change.</p> <p>  I wish to talk about Dropbox.  It is an organisation that bought a big office in Dublin a few years ago.  It spent a lot of money on it but it has changed how it does things by creating regional hubs.  Staff can work from the office if they want to or they can work from a hub.  The company has moved from the idea of presenteeism in the office to different ways of operating.  We need to hear from such companies.  We need to hear from Grow Remote, which is training managers in this area.  It is a matter of assisting companies and having an alliance of employers that are trying to lead in terms of best practice in hybrid working.</p> <p>  On the grounds and the language of the grounds, I note that the Long Title refers to &ldquo;reasonable grounds".  That is important.  Therefore, the ambition is such that employers must provide reasonable grounds to decline a request.  That could be reflected in head 12.  In the flexible working arrangements in other countries, the language is very important.  We should compare our language, which refers to the potential negative impact on the quality of the business, product or service, with the language pertaining to other flexible working arrangements, which might refer to a detrimental impact.  While we have concerns about certain business issues, it is a matter of whether we can make our aspirations concrete.  What I said about the learnings around health and safety, data protection, and monitoring would also feed into the grounds.  Therefore, the language concerning reasonableness is very important.  Should the word "demonstrable" not also be included?</p></speech>

There is a need to tighten up the parameters regarding people outside the country.  The formal disciplinary process seems a little unfair.  Somebody might be struggling because they could need remote work.  Unless it has to do with health and safety or data protection, I wonder why the measure is included.  I support the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s clear statement that it is not just about a solely procedural right in terms of the appeal because it also needs to be about the reasonableness of the request.</p></speech>

We are trying to include a floor, not a ceiling.  There is absolutely no limit to the possibilities regarding what firms or employees can do through remote working.  It is for them to agree as part of their normal relationships.</p></speech>

If the home becomes a workplace, there may be implications for insurance cover.</p><p>In some instances, perhaps a home would become a workplace even for rates.  Could a house or part of it be considered rateable?</p><p> If the home becomes a workplace, does the employer have the right to inspect the workplace?  If the employer is to be responsible for the safety of the worker, how can the employer ascertain the risks that might be involved if he or she does not have the right to inspect?  I note that in New Zealand the employee has to send in photographs of the workspace.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that.</p><p> Is there anything in the Bill that constrains or stops the employer from revoking the arrangements if they do not work?  If remote working is agreed on, proceeds but does not work for whatever reason, is there anything in the Bill stopping the employer from revoking the arrangements and saying remote working is to stop and the employee must come into work, the office or whatever?</p><p> Head 13 refers to "the commencement of an internal appeal process provided for within their employer&rsquo;s remote working policy."  It then refers to head 14 but I cannot find information on this process in that head.  Perhaps the witnesses will speak about this.  It seems that this is another step an employee needs to take before he or she can go to the Workplace Relations Commission, where there is an internal appeals process in the company.  Is there any time limit by which the employee has to appeal to the WRC?  Maybe there is such a time limit under the Act of 2015 but I have not found that.  Perhaps the witnesses will tell me.  I note that in some jurisdictions the employee has to appeal within a certain time.  Is it open-ended?  If so, that creates its own problems.</p><p> With regard to flexitime and flexible working, is there anything in the heads that would encourage or discourage flexible working?  If a person decides to work remotely and is working on Saturdays or Sundays, overtime and so forth comes into the equation.  I ask the witnesses to comment on flexible work because it appears that working remotely could facilitate flexitime and flexible working, particularly if parents have to collect children from school and so forth, provided the work is done, and they do these things in their own time.</p></speech>

I referred earlier to the Health and Safety Authority publication, Guidance on Working From Home, which sets out the responsibilities of employers and employees.  It also refers to a risk assessment of the employee's workstation in the home.  The nature of that risk assessment will vary from home to home and occupation to occupation but there are issues there that will need to be worked through.</p> <p>  We are considering the issue of revocation of remote working and whether, as part of the legal framework, we need something to cover that space.  We are actively thinking about that.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleagues to comment on the internal appeals process and the connection with flexible working.</p></speech>

It is intended that at organisational level, there would be an internal review before going to the formal review at the WRC in an effort to increase discourse and encourage consultation and conciliation at organisational level, rather than taking statutory recourse.</p> <p>  On flexible working, there is a flexible working directive currently with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It is progressing a Bill that will implement flexible working, in particular for certain categories of carers and working parents.  The Bill is designed not to restrict anything within that other Bill.  We have an interdepartmental working group in which we liaise with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth with regard to the various provisions.  As Mr. Mulligan mentioned, we are specifically looking at remote working, which is one of nine options under the flexible working directive.</p></speech>

Unless we see substantial change, this landmark legislation, as the Department describes it, will be a lost opportunity, especially given that Ireland is the member state with the highest share of jobless lone parents and jobless persons with a permanent disability in the European Union.  It is important that we use this Bill to encourage, incentivise and nudge employers into taking up remote and flexible working.  If, when we see the Bill, it in any way approximates to the heads we have here, this will be very much a lost opportunity.</p> <p>  In that context, I want to ask about the timeline that was mentioned earlier.  I understand there is an ambition to have the Bill passed through all Stages before the summer recess.  At my count, that give us 18 or 19 weeks, which should be plenty of time.  As we have seen, however, we still do not have a sick pay Act, despite the Government talking about that for a year and a half at this stage.  When can we expect to see the Bill?  I believe it will need time and cannot be rushed through the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  If the witnesses cannot provide an answer today, the committee needs to hear as soon as possible what precise timeline the Department has with regard to progressing this legislation over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  Masks should continue to be worn by those present when not addressing the committee.  I will remind members of this if necessary.</p> <p>  Today, we are engaging with representatives from the Institute for Fiscal Studies in the UK.  The committee has agreed to examine indexation of the welfare and taxation system and has scheduled a series of public meetings on the topic.  We intend to discuss several areas of interest, which include, but are not limited to, the rationale for indexation, the creation of an indexation system, the operation of that system and the impact of indexation on a budgetary sustainability cycle.  Today is our third meeting on indexation.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies in the UK.

First, I apologise for the fact that my wife seems to have taken over the computer and I cannot stop it from saying that I am Nicola Wilberforce.  I am, in fact, Paul Johnson.  I will start with a few thoughts and reflections on the UK experience, which I think will be of interest and relevance, and I will try to draw out the broad lessons from that.  I will talk about pensions, welfare benefits, tax thresholds and briefly about excise duties and a couple of other things.</p> <p>  Pension indexation is extraordinarily important.  In the UK we had a long period, between about 1980 and 2010, of indexing the basic state pension just to price inflation.  Over that period, the basic pension fell quite significantly as a fraction of average earnings, from something like 25% to not much more than 15%.  While it maintained its real price index value, it fell further and further behind the general standard of living and was not offering much in the way of replacement rates.  There was a big review of that in the early 2000s and a decision was made to move back to earnings indexation from 2010.  It remains in the legislation that the pension should rise year on year in line with earnings.  In fact, we have had in place a triple-lock system, which means that each year the pension rises according to earnings, prices, or 2.5%, whichever is the biggest.  As a result, it has grown relative to both prices and earnings over that period, as this was an unusual period in which there were a number of years where prices outpaced earnings, as well as years in which earnings outpaced prices and, indeed, some years in which the 2.5% increase was brought into play.  That has resulted in a relatively rapid increase in the value of the state pension relative both to prices and earnings over that period.</p> <p>  This is a very strange policy in one sense because if you rationally decided you wanted the pension to be at a particular level, either relative to earnings or prices, this would not be a very rational way of getting there.  The defence of it is that it is the most politically acceptable way of getting the state pension to a higher level over a period of time.  One of the general messages of indexation is that different ways of indexing things can make a very big difference over time, and it is a difference which often goes somewhat unnoticed politically.  It makes a very big difference to future costs.  Whether we continue with a triple lock or earnings indexation, let alone price indexation, we are talking about a couple of percentage points of national income within 30 years.  This is a substantive choice about the rate at which pensions are indexed.  It is a choice of whether to keep it at the same real level or to move it in line with other living standards.</p><p>I can speak more about pensions if the committee wishes.<br/><br/>Welfare benefits for those under the pension age have been significantly reformed over the past 30 or 40 years and some of those benefits, particularly for families with children, have been made very much more generous.  The indexation rules have essentially been price indexation year on year over the past 40 or 50 years.  For example, looking at the standard rate of unemployment benefit, it stands today at essentially the same level in price terms as it did in 1970, which is over 50 years ago.  At the same time, of course, real earnings have something like tripled, although not quite tripled.  The level of unemployment benefit for people without children is much lower.  It is less than half the value relative to average earnings compared with where it was 50 years ago, and few people believe it is at a level where people could nowadays reasonably live on it.<br/><br/>It is worth saying that within recent years, specifically 2015 and 2019, these welfare benefits were frozen so they were not even indexed in line with inflation for a four-year period.  That was used as a way of saving significant amounts of money on the welfare budget.  The biggest cut to welfare benefits was over what is known as the austerity period in the UK through the 2010s, but it was the least remarked upon and, in a sense, the least unpopular, using indexation as a way of changing policy gradually, and this seeps through rather easily.  Freezing things is a rather bad idea, and I will say a bit more about that with tax thresholds, as we do not know <i>ex ante</i>what the impact will be on the real level of the benefit.  For the first couple of years of the freeze, inflation was lower than expected but after that it was higher than expected.  Towards the end of the period, there was a bigger real cut than what was intended.<br/><br/>Tax thresholds are, on the whole within the income tax system, by default supposed to rise in line with prices.  That was an amendment in a finance Bill in the 1970s that put this in as a default and the Chancellor must announce if the default is to be varied.  We have seen very different policies on different tax thresholds, and the personal tax threshold below which a person pays no income tax rose very fast as part of a deliberate policy through the 2010s.  It was well ahead of inflation then but it has now been frozen for the next four years, so it is a policy reversal.  Again, this freezing of a personal tax threshold is a substantial tax rise over a four-year period.  It is a bigger tax rise than was initially intended because inflation has turned out much higher than anticipated.<br/><br/>That is a personal tax threshold but there are other thresholds in the income tax system that really matter.  The higher threshold is the point at which a person starts to pay 40% income tax as opposed to the standard 20% rate.  Broadly speaking, it again has been subject to all sorts of changes, such as freezes, increases and so on, but it has risen much less quickly over the past 30 years than earnings and slightly less quickly than prices.  The result, again not announced as a policy, is that we have something like four times the fraction of taxpayers who are higher rate taxpayers today than we had 30 years ago simply as a result of the way in which that threshold has been increased.  It could be increased in line with prices, in which case the natural effect over time is to increase the number of higher rate taxpayers.  It might be increased in line with earnings to, broadly speaking, keep the number of higher-rate taxpayers constant.<br/><br/>Some elements of the income tax system have been frozen since they were introduced.  In particular, we have thresholds at &pound;100,000 and &pound;150,000, at which higher rates of income tax come into play.  We have a 60% rate on incomes between &pound;100,000 and &pound;125,000, and that &pound;100,000 threshold has been unchanged in 12 years.  The point at which the 45p rate comes in at &pound;150,000 is also unchanged over 12 years.  The result has been something like a doubling of the number of people affected by those thresholds over time.  I know this is a deliberate policy to take more money from relatively high-income people without announcing changes year on year.  Those are big unannounced changes to the income tax system.<br/><br/>One could speak about other direct taxes but I will say something very briefly about excise duties.  Again, one would expect excise duties to rise year on year in line with prices to keep their real value constant.  Most excise duties in the UK are set in what I was going to call a random way on a year-by-year basis; the difference is they rise in line with prices.  Excise duty on petrol and diesel has not even risen in line with prices for more than a decade now.  It is simply being held constant in nominal terms.  One of the biggest tax cuts of the past decade has been the effective fall in the real value of petrol and diesel duties because it was considered impossible politically to increase these even in line with prices.<br/><br/>There is a lesson here that has become very salient.  If such things are increased once every year in a budget, once the increases stop, it becomes difficult to move back to doing so.  One of our suggestions is that it may make sense to have monthly indexation so the duty goes up by a very small amount every month, and this makes the process much more stable.<br/><br/>There are all sorts of other aspects of public policy that are affected by indexation and the way in which regulated prices, for example, are indexed in rail and energy markets in the UK.  One bit of public policy that has recently gained much attention is the way in which elements of the student loan and maintenance systems are indexed, so the threshold beyond which graduates start to repay student loans was frozen this year.  It had increased significantly three or four years ago and it was frozen before that.  These are supposed to be loans and the threshold is supposed to go up with earnings each year.  In practice, again, policy is made on the hoof each year in a way that makes it even more clear that this is simply a graduate tax.  Again, one might use indexation to change the structure of that system quite significantly.  It is worth saying the maximum loan level has only changed once in the past decade, while the real value of money going to universities has fallen over that period.  Through lack of indexation, there have also been significant cuts in the level of student maintenance loans.<br/><br/>These are just a series of examples from the UK perspective of different ways in which different parts of the tax and welfare system have experienced indexation over the past 40 or 50 years in some cases.  It is really a statement of the very great importance that indexation plays.  As a commentator, I significantly dislike the lack of transparency often involved in the way the structure of tax and welfare systems changes because of the way indexation is not used.  There are clearly very big and deep questions in many cases as to whether appropriate indexation is in line with prices or earnings.  There are quite deep political and philosophical issues to explore there.  We should go into those decisions with a very clear view of the impact.  Freezing thresholds and so on is something one can do to change structures significantly over time, but one really ought to be very transparent about that as a policy objective.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#C00100"><p>I am sorry for butting in and butting out.  There are three meetings going on so forgive me if I repeat what I have said before.  I will say what I want to say in one fell swoop.</p> <p>  I always hear how we can improve the systems and that we should try to do that.  My worry is that, before the economic crash in this country, numerous people were quoting from time to time that we were one of the wealthiest countries in the world and that we should be doing more of this, that and the other, and we had the private sector and some of the public sector saying we deserved more just because we deserved it.  As we know, things do not work out that way and they did not work out that way.  My question is this.  How does the linking of taxation and social welfare, for example, give the latitude to the Government that it may need to respond to a particular situation without disrupting the whole fabric of taxation in particular, given the extent to which indexation might impact on the freedom of Government to direct budgetary policy?</p> <p>  I have not carried out a comparison myself in recent times but I have had some private discussions with constituents in regard to pensions from other jurisdictions.  How do we fare in comparison with other jurisdictions such as, for example, the UK and in the rest of Europe?  Are we behind the curve and do we need to urgently improve the situation?</p> <p>  With regard to the reduction in inflation, to which Mr. Johnson made reference, how does it affect the general population if the indexation is working as it is supposed to work?  How smoothly can it reduce, or is it likely to reduce, payments to people who receive State pensions in the short term?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#C00300"><p>I will try.  I am not convinced I can respond to all of that.  I am certainly no expert on the Irish pension system.  In terms of indexation, you can decide to what extent to allow it to tie your hands.  I understand there are clearly times when people might want to move away from a stated policy but there is a great deal to be said for a stated default such that the expectation is that each year, unless there is some very good reason not to, whatever we are talking about &ndash; be it tax thresholds, welfare benefits or pensions &ndash; will rise by whatever we decide they are going to rise by in terms of pensions earnings, inflation earnings or whatever else.  If people do move away from that, I think there is a strong case for, first, giving a clear explanation that they are doing it, second, what the effect will be and, third, how long we expect that to last.  There is a strong case for an intended path and a default and for moving away from that in relatively unusual circumstances.</p> <p>  One of my concerns about UK policy on taxation, for example, is that the movement from the default is pretty much constant.  In some cases, it is up one year and down the next and, in other cases, it has left us kind of stuck with the unintended consequence with regard to fuel duties that it becomes almost impossible to make the change.</p> <p>  In terms of what the impact of different levels of inflation are, one thing we are obviously facing in the UK is higher inflation than we have seen in a very long time.  One consequence of that, particularly for people who are subsisting on welfare benefits, is that by the end of the fiscal year, they will be 7% worse off than they were last April.  That is something we used to worry about a lot in the 1970s but it is not something we have had to worry about too much recently.  Whatever the level of inflation, if we want to maintain the real value of anything, we probably need to increase the thresholds or benefits in line with that inflation.  Of course, governments can decide to make different use of indexation provisions.  For example, the UK Government is going to be looking very hard at public sector pay over this year.  With inflation at over 7%, clearly, any pay increase of less than that will be a real cut which, from a fiscal point of view, will be something the Treasury will be quite keen on, but which would result in yet further cuts in real levels of pay, which have been going down over a period.  As ever, there is an awful lot to trade off in these decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#C00400"><p>Thank you.  I have an easy question in regard to inflation.  To what extent are we vulnerable in terms of international trends and issues?  My reason for raising that question is that, some years ago, I was in another European country that had a very busy port and there were about ten oil tankers anchored far offshore.  When I inquired as to what they were doing there, I was told they were waiting for the price of oil to increase.  How vulnerable are we to the manipulation of the system by external forces which will have the effect of accelerating inflation to the detriment of our respective economies across Europe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.366" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#C00500"><p>Inflation at the moment across Europe is largely externally generated.  This is not inflation, whether in the UK or, I am sure, in Ireland, that is created by increases in wage costs, for example.  It has been created, as we know, by increases in energy costs and by problems with supply chains across the world.  The UK, as a relatively small open economy, and the Republic of Ireland, as a much smaller open economy, are very much impacted by trends elsewhere in the world.  If we look further back, a large part of the low levels of price inflation we have seen over the past 20 years has been attributed by at least some people to the opening up of China and elsewhere, and the resulting cheap manufactured products that we have been able to purchase.  Therefore, yes, external changes are very important for domestic inflation.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Johnson for appearing before the committee.  We appreciate it as this is something we have been looking at for quite some time.  We know Mr. Johnson is very busy and we appreciate him coming to speak to us today to add to that conversation.  I apologise as I was a little late coming in.</p> <p>  First, what does Mr. Johnson think would be the best anchor for indexation?  What calculations would he use for that?  Should taxes and social welfare payments be indexed to the same measure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#C00800"><p>It depends what one is trying to achieve in the end.  For welfare benefits and pensions, for example, if what we want to achieve is that those who are not in work share in the changes in living standards of those who are in work, then earnings is the appropriate measure to use.  If, on the other hand, we believe we have them at some form of subsistence level, or at a level that we think is the appropriate absolute level over a period of time, then prices might be right.  I think it is quite hard to justify price indexation over very long periods because we lose that link between the real living standards and what we are paying the payments for.</p><p>That is where we got with pensions in the UK by the early 2000s and it is where we are today on at least some welfare benefits.</p><p> When it comes to tax thresholds, again it depends on what one is trying to achieve.  If thresholds are increased only in line with prices and in normal times, when earnings are going up faster than prices, the tax burden will be gradually increased.  Given demographic pressures, pressures on spending on health and so on, one may want to increase the tax burden.  That is politically a relatively easy way to increase the tax burden but, again, there is a lot to be said for transparency in that regard.  Broadly speaking, the neutral method of indexation is probably to increase that in line with earnings or incomes such that the tax burden is not gradually increased.  As I said, that is a clear policy option.</p></speech>

We call them social protection payments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.374" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#D00500"><p>Again, different views on this may be taken.  It may be thought that there is a different case for incapacity benefits, for example.  It may or may not be thought that issues around work incentives and so on are less important than unemployment benefits.  One might want to do those differently.  It may be thought that some benefits are at relatively the wrong level at the moment.  Broadly speaking, I agree with the thought behind what the Deputy says, that quite a good reason is needed for doing this differently between different benefits.  Over the past 30 years, one consequence of a series of policy changes, including, importantly, the increase in the state pension considerably faster than prices or earnings and the fact that welfare benefits for people under pension age have gone up if anything a little less quickly than prices, is that the gap between those has grown dramatically from about 30%.  Thirty years or so ago, the state pension was about 30% higher than unemployment benefit for a single person; it is now about 130% higher.  That has changed dramatically the relationship between the generosity of benefits for those below and above state pension age.  Obviously, that matters very much if someone is out of work.  At the point at which people hit state pension age their income goes up a lot but at the point below that they are very badly off.  That is seen replicated exactly in the income statistics such that even the poorest pensioners over state pension age have seen their incomes rise reasonably significantly over the past 30 years but the poorest people in their early 60s have not seen that increase.  The gap between the poor just below pension age and the poor just above pension age is open, and that is significantly though not entirely down to indexation policy.</p></speech>

This is slightly off point but it is something I have noticed more and more in my clinics.  I will have been a public representative for eight years come May, and it is only in recent times, in the past few months, that I have found more and more people in their late 50s and early 60s really struggling with accommodation and so on.  Obviously, housing is a big crisis here at the moment.  What Mr. Johnson says is very interesting to note.</p> <p>  Is my time up, Chair?</p></speech>

I heard some background noise and I did not know whether it was the Chair.</p> <p>  I have another question.  We have heard in this committee calls for an independent body similar to a low pay commission to oversee indexation.  Does Mr. Johnson think it would be worthwhile to have an independent body that would oversee indexation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#D00900"><p>It depends what the Deputy means by "oversee".  It would be difficult to have an independent body making decisions about indexation, given what an important part of the tax and welfare system it is.  To me, it is fundamentally political.  However, as for having a body able to recommend on the basis of a particular remit or comment on the basis of a particular remit on the direction that policy is taking as a result of choices over indexation, there could be some benefit to that, again, certainly in increasing transparency and accountability.  Because people suffer from money illusion, because indexation is a complex issue and because freezing something can look like no change when it can be a significant and real change, anything that increases transparency in that regard and in people's understanding of this would be extremely worthwhile.  It could be that an independent body or person with a remit to do that would be of some value.  As I said, though, those decisions feel to me to be too fundamentally political to farm out to technocrats, much as we technocrats would love to be in charge.</p></speech>

It is about the impact of the State pension triple lock on budget sustainability.  What has that been?  Although I hate to say it, we are probably coming into budget season again.  It basically starts in March to April for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#D01100"><p>I will give the Deputy a flavour of where we are in the UK.  The cost of state pensions has not risen as a factor in national income in the past decade because the female state pension age has risen from 60 to 66 and the male pension age from 65 to 66 over that period.  What we have had, therefore, is a saving, as it were, because we have been increasing state pension ages, and a cost associated with the triple lock has been in place and they have been broadly offsetting over that period.  Looking forward 20 years, we will see the state pension - I forget the precise numbers but I am referring to a triple lock scenario - taking up another 2% or 3% of national income within 20 or 30 years.  National income is quite a lot compared with an increase in line with earnings, where there is an increase of about half that amount, so indexation does matter.  If the increase were in line only with prices, that would go down further.  As for the UK budget sustainability, if earnings indexation of pensions is done and we continue with planned increases in the pension age, we are adding a percentage point or two to national income and to public spending when we and, I think, many advanced countries are facing bigger challenges in the healthcare system, but that is a topic for another day.</p></speech>

It is great to listen to his take given his experience in the UK.  I will go back to his point that people in their 50s or 60s who are out of work are getting a relatively poor jobseeker's allowance or jobseeker's benefit, as we call it here.  Then when people come to pension age they come into a different category.  I might have missed what Mr. Johnson said.  Is it just the pensions that are index-linked or are all social welfare payments index-linked?</p></speech>

Certainly, going forward, almost everybody will get the full state pension.  It is increasing.  It is in principle contributory so long as the person has been in the country for, I think, 30 years.  It is pretty hard to avoid - at least going forward it will be - getting the full pension.  Time spent as a student, time spent looking after children, time spent sick or disabled and time spent unemployed count towards years of contributions, so, certainly going forward, pretty much only the idle rich or those who have spent a long time out of the country can avoid having a full pension.</p></speech>

The other part of it is that we are in discussions here about the pension age and increasing the pension age.  There are several scenarios in front of us.  The current pension age is 66 and we are discussing whether we should increase that going forward or whether we should increase the PRSI levy to pay for the pension deficit that may be there in future.  Interestingly, Mr. Johnson said that because the UK increased the retirement age upwards from 60 to 66, the overall cost of indexation has been more or less balanced out.  I refer to the fact that the numbers are not coming in as quickly as one would have thought in the context of the age threshold having been changed.  Has a calculation been done in that regard?  What is the increase, percentage-wise, in the overall bills in the context of just having indexation without actually increasing the age at which people can enter into a pension?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#E00600"><p>I do not have that number to hand but there are several things going on there.  As regards the impact of increasing the state pension age, we see that it has contributed to a reasonably significant increase in the number of women in work.  The pension age for women has gone from 60 to 66, while for men it has gone from 65 to 66.  Each year, one can see a significant increase in the number of people coming up to pension age who are in work, although that number is in the tens of thousands in context of the cohort of approximately 700,000 or 800,000.  When the state pension age went up to 66, there were approximately 50,000 additional people in work.  The behaviour of most people is not impacted.  There are some whose behaviour is impacted but the majority of people are already out of the labour market by the time they get to 65.  Certainly in the case of the most recent increase, particularly for men, the people most likely to have been persuaded to stay in work are the relatively low-paid.  People who are highly paid are either able to retire early anyway or would have been in work in any case.</p> <p>  In terms of controlling the cost of pensions going forward, indexation is one method and the state pension age is clearly the other method.  If the state pension age is increased in line with longevity, that has quite a big impact on the sustainability of the system going forward.  Identifying the appropriate rate of increase is sort of a political, not just technocratic, question.  One of the things we have certainly experienced in the UK is an astonishing increase in life expectancy in the past 40 years, with no increase in the State pension age before 2010 and, for men only a one-year increase in the state pension age despite something like a ten-year increase in longevity in that period.  Thus far, not all of the gains, at least for men, have come in additional years in receipt of pension rather than any sort of sharing of that in terms of higher pension ages.</p></speech>

That is very interesting.  As regards the overall issue of indexation, the discussion here includes all social welfare benefits, including jobseeker's allowance, disability allowances and the whole area of social protection, which is probably where most of the certainty needs to be in place for people who cannot work for a particular reason.  We need to consider how they will be protected until they get to pension age.  What comment or advice does Mr. Johnson have on tackling an issue such as that?</p></speech>

In terms of the indexation of benefits under pension age, although, broadly speaking, they go up in line with prices and will go up at the same rate, when we had the four-year freeze on working-age benefits, that did not apply to incapacity benefit.  There was a clear policy decision that in some sense, those on incapacity benefits were more deserving than those on unemployment benefits.  As I stated earlier, it is quite difficult to make the case for long-term price indexation for most of these benefits because that is clearly a choice to make that group of people worse off relative to the rest of the population.  If that is the choice that is going to be made, it needs to be made explicitly clear that the choice is to make that group of people worse off relative to people in work.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I missed part of the discussion but quite a bit of information has been provided and some of the questions I wished to put to Mr. Johnson have been partly answered.  When one starts indexing, where does one draw the lines or how far does one go?  I note the UK has drawn a line at the pension age and treated people differently or treated payments differently depending on whether they are for younger people or older people.  Is it only on the core social welfare payment for people under the pension age or does it also extend out into indexing in taxation or in other benefits such as qualification or thresholds for housing or medical cards and so on?  How wide is it?  How did the UK decide on that pension threshold?  Why were the lines drawn where they were drawn when indexing was being introduced?  Mr. Johnson may have answered my next question already.  Does the UK look forward to wages or back to inflation when indexing?  How was that decision reached?</p></speech>

We have covered most of it one way or another.  When it comes to benefits below pension age, most of them just go up in line with inflation pretty much automatically.  Different choices are made at times to freeze them to save money.  The Deputy mentioned housing benefits, which is quite an interesting issue.  I refer to where there are thresholds in the system.  The maximum housing benefit one can get is set according to the local area in which a person lives, the size of his or her family and so on.  It is set at the 20th percentile of rent for a property for that family type in that area.  However, it is set at that level at a particular date and that maximum amount is then indexed in line with inflation each year.</p><p>That has a number of curious effects.  Given that on the whole, rental costs go up faster than other prices, the real amount of housing you can buy with that maximum allowance goes down over time.  The more curious one is that because rental costs go up at different rates in different areas, we get a world in which these are much more generous in some parts of the country than in other parts of the country due to the way-----</p></speech>

If you look back 30 years, we effectively had a single rate of income tax covering the large majority of people and a higher rate affecting only 5% or 6% of people.  Given the way the thresholds have been indexed over that period, we have moved without anyone announcing it to a world in which something like one fifth of income taxpayers are paying that higher 40% rate.  This is entirely down to the way in which the higher rate threshold has been changed and certainly has not risen anything like as quickly as earnings over that period.  Although it has gone up and down at different points in time over that period, there was nothing like a consistent policy over that period, although it has been particularly noticeable over the past ten or 15 years post-2010.</p></speech>

Tobacco tends to go up somewhat quicker than that over time.  Regarding alcohol, I cannot remember how it averaged out but we get different policies every year depending on how much of a cheer the Chancellor wants when he announces that beer duty is not going up.  The big one really has been the failure to index petrol and diesel taxation, which has been stuck at the same nominal level for 12 years.  As I said earlier, that is one of the biggest tax cuts we have had in real terms over the past 12 years.  One of the bizarre aspects of this is that the default remains that it goes up in line with prices and, therefore, the deal with Government policies is that, next year, it will go up in line with prices and, therefore, all the fiscal forecasts must assume that fuel duties will rise in line with inflation knowing full well that they never do so it is a very odd sort of world in which official policy - the law - states this will rise in line with inflation next year and it is always undone in the budget yet you must forecast if you are the official forecaster on the assumption that something will happen that you know will not happen.  That is an example of very poor and un-transparent policy making.  When the Chancellor looks at his budget numbers, the numbers always assume that this thing is going up in line with prices, which always flatter the truth.  It is a relatively small point but it is a slightly absurd situation that we have reached.</p></speech>

I must be honest.  I am slightly intrigued by his outlining of indexation in terms of the politically acceptable way of increasing certain rates and his description of the fuel tax and its failure to increase in line with inflation.  I will be honest.  The reason some of us here are interested in this issue is because during our budgetary cycle, welfare increases are often based on the political issues of the day and not necessarily on fiscal metrics in any way.  Could Mr. Johnson talk about the mechanisms by which when even if you have an indexation system, it is set to one side during the course of political action?  He mentioned that there have been freezes on particular welfare rates.  Are there other mechanisms by which basically indexation is set aside?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.409" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#F01300"><p>I mean in different areas, indexation is set aside very frequently.  There are default rules about income tax thresholds and benefits.  I have not been looking at adding this up but my guess is that certainly for tax thresholds, what happens is more frequently not in line with the default than it is in line with the default.  The basic rate threshold was raised more quickly in one period of time than inflation while in others, it did not really rise with inflation at all.  The higher threshold was bumped up and down, although broadly speaking, it was down relative to earnings over time.  There were bits of the tax system, in particular the threshold for the very highest rates, which are not indexed at all.</p> <p>  Allowances relating to pension taxation are a rather important aspect.  For example, allowances for how much you can put into a pension have been changed quite dramatically over time.  Again, that is not something that most people notice most of the time but one of the biggest tax changes in the past decade has been the very big cuts in those allowances.  Essentially, there is plenty of scope for British Governments and British Chancellors to do whatever they want whenever they want in terms of these indexations.  </p> <p>  For the state pension, the legislation only allows for earnings indexation.  It is policy that is set each year that decides on the triple lock.  Most years, working-age welfare benefits do rise in line with prices.  Between 2015 and 2019 when as part of the Conservatives carrying out their manifesto commitment to bring about a significant reduction in welfare spending, the easiest part of that politically for them was a four-year freeze on the level of welfare benefits.  It is certainly a very big cut, which got very little negative publicity.</p></speech>

From my perspective, many countries that have had indexation operating for some time began by linking it to a consumer price index of some sort but are now moving it more towards wages.  What has been the debate on this in the UK?  The UK is considering changing its consumer price index, CPI, or that basket of goods that is covered, slightly.  Will Mr. Johnson speak to us about that process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.412" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#G00200"><p>I could speak about the construction of the CPI for a long time.  The CPI itself is not being changed.  Actually, there are many things happened, so let me go back a step.  In terms of prices, we used to index everything to the retail prices index, RPI, which is a different measure of price inflation than the consumer price index.  It is the longest standing index in the UK and has been produced on a somewhat consistent basis for 70 years or so.  It is wrong in the sense that it overstates inflation for technical reasons that I will not go into.  This became evident in 2010 when some changes were made to the collection of clothing prices and the gap between the RPI and the CPI grew significantly.  Up to that point, most price indexation was in line with the RPI.  Gradually over the past decade, most of it has moved into line with the CPI, which is the more correct measure of inflation.  However, the British Government has left some areas where the RPI is still the basis for indexation.  This includes some regulated prices, for example, interest rates on student loans and one or two other matters.  It was noticeably slower to move from the RPI to the CPI where it was beneficial fiscally to keep to the RPI and quicker to move to the CPI where doing so saved money.  We have got most of the way from the RPI to the CPI, though.  As such, how inflation is measured matters.  We need to get it right, which we were not for a long time.  Indeed, we got it significantly wrong, particularly post 2010.</p> <p>  The Chairman might also be referring to moves to look at different measures of inflation for different kinds of household.  Households at the lower end of the income distribution or spending distribution spend a higher fraction of their budgets on things like energy and food.  Households at the higher end of the distribution spend more on holidays, services, electronic gizmos etc.  Those do not necessarily go up at the same rate over time, although from what we can tell in the UK, there has not been any significant divergence for some time in the rate of price changes faced by households in different parts of the distribution.  That remains true even now, although we expect that to change over the next two or three months as energy prices start to bite, and they will definitely bite more for those towards the bottom of the income distribution.</p> <p>  There is then an interesting question as to whether, year by year, we want to have measures of prices that are sensitive to the different rates of inflation that may be faced by different groups in the population.  If one were to increase pensions in line with prices, for example, one might want a pension price index.  We have produced those in the past.  For those on welfare benefits, one might want a price index that looks at the basket of goods that they purchase.  These things are doable.  When there are significant differences - such times exist - there may be some benefit in doing this, but one would need to be careful about a proliferation of price indices and price index shopping.  One needs to move to decisions in that direction carefully and with considerable consensus.  Otherwise, we would be in danger of creating a great deal of instability.  I can imagine a world where it was decided for all the best possible reasons to increase welfare benefits in line with a price index that was determined by the spending patterns of the poorest people.  There could easily be a year where that index was much lower than or even negative compared with the overall price index.  In those circumstances, it might prove difficult to implement.</p></speech>

That was illuminating.</p> <p>  Something that we have not considered in any great detail during our sessions is the question of how indexation would interact with regulated prices.  Mr. Johnson spoke at length about student loans.  We do not have that same scenario, but issues like rail and energy would be of great interest in this regard.  Both of our countries are experiencing a very particular level of inflation right now.  Will Mr. Johnson expand on what kind of effect indexation might have on regulated items?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.414" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#G00400"><p>There are many ways in which various regulated prices are increased.  It is a current issue where student loans are concerned because there are different parts.  With one exception, the regulated price for university tuition has been frozen for a decade.  That is essentially a saving for the Government because it means universities get less.  It does not make much difference for most students how much they must pay off because most do not pay off the full amount in any case.  What really matters to the student is the threshold above which he or she starts paying off the loan.  In principle, that is supposed to rise each year in line with earnings but was effectively frozen for a time before seeing a large increase.  It then rose in line with earnings and has now been frozen again.  This is not a loan.  It is not how people who make loans are allowed to behave.</p> <p>  I will try to remember how the system works for other regulated areas.  Rail fares have historically been linked to the RPI plus a certain amount.  The RPI already overstates what inflation is.  In periods of high inflation like now, it is within the power of the Executive to cut that link.  While there are defaults, those defaults are easily overridden.  There are other examples.  The BBC licence fee, which is a tax in national statistics terms at least, is set.  There is no default for that and it has been frozen for the next several years, which means a big cut in its value over time.</p> <p>  We are increasingly in a world where the Government is understandably reacting to high levels of inflation by overriding the defaults in some cases, as with rail fares, and in others by making political decisions about the amount of money it wants to go to institutions like universities and the BBC.</p></speech>

It might not be in Mr. Johnson's wheelhouse, but I am trying to get a sense of what aspects of indexation are British Government policy and which are set down in legislation.  My assumption is that, while elements like the triple lock are legislative and binding, we have established that much of indexation can be largely set aside or varied at the behest of the Government.</p><p>I am aware that Mr. Johnson is not a legislator, but in the context of his understanding of the matter, how much of indexation is policy and how much is legislative?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.417" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#H00200"><p>The triple lock is not legislative; that is policy.  What is legislated is the earnings indexation.  The Government decides to deem the higher of the earnings indexation prices at 2.5%.  That is not legislated for.  If it wanted to do less than earnings indexation, then that does require legislation.  For most, if not all, other changes certainly within the tax system, while there is the default in legislation, where things go up in line with prices, all the Chancellor needs to do is stand up and say that it is going to do something different, and that goes through the Finance Bill, and something different happens.  As I have said, that happens on a very regular basis.  If the Chancellor did not say anything, then there is a series of defaults, which are set out in legislation.  Assuming he can get his budget through Parliament, however, he then has executive control over pretty much all of this on an annual basis.  I am pretty sure that things like the student loan thresholds and so on can be changed by statutory instrument, or similar measures.  The truth is that most of this is effectively within the hands of the Executive on an annual basis, even where legislation exists to provide defaults.</p></speech>

I do not see any other members indicating.  We are nearly at the end of our session.  I will ask Mr. Johnson a final question.  Considering the leeway it still allows, in Mr. Johnson's estimation as a professional in the sector, is indexation a worthwhile set of benchmarks to provide to governments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Johnson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022020900002#H00400"><p>Hugely so.  It is one of the most important parts of fiscal policy, both in tax and welfare.  Having those defaults and being clear what one is trying to achieve with that is incredibly important.  The default on tax thresholds was set in the 1970s by a couple of Labour politicians at the time, Jeff Rooker and Audrey Wise.  Famously known as the Rooker-Wise amendment, it was designed specifically, particularly in periods of high inflation, to create this default whereby things would go up in line with inflation.  Over a period, it totally changes the structure of a tax welfare or pension system and how ones does indexation.  As I said, we had a clear policy between 1980 and 2010 to increase the State pension only in line with prices.  That fundamentally changed the nature of the State pension and the structure of our pension system, just as the current indexation system is changing it again.  The structure of our income tax system is being changed fundamentally by the failure to index the higher rate threshold, for example the failure to index the duty on petrol has fundamentally changed the structure of the whole of that system, and we have lost so much money as a result.</p> <p>  There are few things more important than having a real debate about indexation policy in order to get a clear understanding of what it is.  I am delighted that the committee is looking at this, and I am very pleased to have a chance to talk to the committee about it.  I really do think it is terribly important.</p></speech>

The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service, under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO under the Statistics Act 1993.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.  The role of the director general of the CSO, as prescribed by the Statistics Act 1993, provides that the officeholder act independently and exercise sole responsibility in professional statistical matters.</p> <p>  EU legislation introduced in 2015 fundamentally changed the role of national statistical institutes throughout the Union.  Following the enactment of this legislation, the director general of the CSO now has responsibility for co-ordinating and overseeing the quality of all European official statistics in Ireland.  It is thus the responsibility of the CSO to ensure that all compilers of European statistics in Ireland adhere to the quality and methodological standards set out by the EU and detailed in the European statistics code of practice.  Under the terms of the Statistics Act 1993, the director general may request any public authority to consult and co-operate with him or her for the purpose of assessing the potential of records as a source of statistical information.  In addition, the Act stipulates that a public authority shall consult with the director general where it intends to introduce, revise or extend the retrieval of information or make a statistical survey.</p> <p>  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions - EUROSTAT and the European Central Bank, ECB, primarily - the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information.  The CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN's fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.  Indeed, the CSO will undergo a review of its alignment with these standards in February 2022 known as a EUROSTAT peer review.  The review process forms part of the European statistical system strategy to monitor the implementation of the code of practice.  The objective of such reviews is to consider the compliance of members with the code of practice to ensure the implementation of the common quality framework underpinning European statistics and to help the statistical authorities to further improve and develop their national statistical systems.  The reviews cover all the member states of the EU and the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, as well as EUROSTAT.  The CSO will be assessed under the 16 principles of the European statistics code of practice.  The outcome of the peer review will be a set of recommendations to assist the CSO to further improve and develop the Irish statistical system.</p> <p>  The CSO plays a vital role in the functioning of the State in providing independent and verifiable data to citizens and policymakers on a broad range of topics including social, economic and environmental issues.  The ability of the CSO to inform has been evident throughout the pandemic.  It delivered on the vast majority of the planned statistical work programme for 2021, publishing 439 releases and publications.  Of these, 40 were new products providing insight into issues as varied as the business impact of Brexit on SMEs, productivity in Ireland in the period 2010 to 2019, the rental sector in Ireland and ecosystem accounts.</p> <p>  The CSO has continued to publish a series of new surveys, outputs and formats to capture the evolution of Ireland's economy and society since the Covid-19 outbreak.  Alongside the new products developed and delivered to provide additional insight, the CSO has provided statistical and analytical expertise and new data services to support the analysis of health data sources in a safe and secure environment.  The CSO has continued to supported epidemiological modelling, analysis of both health and real-time data, and analysis to provide insight regarding trends and identifying emerging issues, all to support central government's response to the pandemic.</p> <p>  The planned 2021 census of population was deferred because of the Covid-19 pandemic and will now take place on 3 April 2022.  The publicity campaign for the ten-week live-census field operation will commence with a launch on 3 March and cover all media channels, informing people about the census and their obligations and encouraging responses.  The delivery of forms to the public will commence at the end of February, with all forms expected to be collected before the end of May.  The processing of the forms will begin immediately on receipt and is expected to run until the end of December.  A preliminary population count will be released before the end of June.  The CSO is making every effort to ensure that the census being undertaken will be comprehensive, inclusive and safe and will provide valuable and accurate data for our country in the years ahead.</p> <p>  The CSO has developed a significant new national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland.  The survey involves the collection of highly sensitive personal data from householders in a manner that is confidential, ethical and designed to support accurate and reliable survey results.  Achieving an appropriate sample, ensuring confidentiality and offering appropriate supports to participating householders and CSO staff are all key priorities.  A pilot survey was conducted between April and June 2021, which has informed arrangements for the formal survey, the field operation of which is planned to commence in June 2022 and run until November.</p> <p>  Work is progressing on the data collection and processing of the next wave of the State's longitudinal study of children and youth, Growing Up in Ireland, from 2023.  A questionnaire for the pilot survey of the 25-year-old cohort will go into the field in April or May 2022.  Planning is under way to return face-to-face collection at airports and ports, which ceased in March 2020.</p> <p>  The household budget survey, which was delayed because of its requirement for in-household interaction with a CSO field interviewer, will go into the field later this year, surveying all members of a sampled household on their expenditure.  Data collected from this survey are used for many purposes but are now required to re-weight the consumer price index.  The CSO has also continued to develop new interactive graphics and infographics, new formats such as bulletins and frontier series, and outputs to provide the additional insight needed by the public, businesses and policymakers both on the impact of the pandemic and across more general social, economic and environmental issues.  The CSO produced 189 press releases and 127 infographics in 2021 to support understanding of the data and provide insight for citizens, businesses and policymakers alike.</p> <p>  The CSO has continued to publish key economic indicators and tracked the impact of the crisis on business sectors and the economy via monthly exports and imports of goods, the quarterly national accounts, government deficit and debt, the quarterly balance of payments, the labour force survey, the monthly unemployment and live register, the survey on income and living conditions, births, deaths and population estimates, the consumer price index and the harmonised index of consumer prices, the wholesale price index, monthly industrial production and turnover, and the retail sales index, among others. </p> <p>  Being both trustworthy and confidential are core strategic values for the CSO.  Security is embedded in its culture.  Significant attention and awareness are allocated to the protection of CSO data and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.  Continuing development of the organisation's security capability is ongoing.  A series of both practical and tactical measures are being implemented to militate against cyberattacks.  These include, but are not limited to, security reviews, annual cyber training, continuous strengthening of data governance and the ongoing deployment of new technology security initiatives throughout the organisation.</p> <p>  As Ireland continues to move out of the pandemic, the CSO will provide necessary insights into how our economy and society is reacting and progressing.  It is crucial that the office has sustainable, secure access to data and can reuse high value data sources in the form of administrative data and some private data sources to provide timely and accurate data that are meaningful to policymakers.</p><p>The quality of data is crucial and the CSO is driving the building of national data infrastructure and the use of unique identifiers such as the personal public service number, PPSN, Eircode postcodes and business identifiers to ensure that data throughout the Civil Service and public service is collected, managed and shared efficiently and effectively.  This work will support the Civil Service renewal action plan themes of digital first and embedding innovation and evidence-informed policy and services.</p><p> The CSO has the unique expertise to support and deliver on both these themes within the office and across the Civil Service.  This will build on the quality of data across the data ecosystem, which will support the delivery of official statistics and deliver insights for the creation and evaluation of policy.</p><p> The office is also embarking on a digital transformation journey, enabling it to modernise and provide for the capability to meet increasing Government, business and citizen expectations for digital services.  A digital first census forms the centrepiece, enabling the citizen to complete future censuses of population online.  The office has obtained &euro;1.5 million from the national recovery and resilience plan for the development of an online platform for data collection.  This funding will assist with the planning and implementation of the digital census programme of work on a multi-annual basis.  The CSO has acquired this funding for five years to a total value of more than &euro;9 million.</p><p> Turning to the office's budget, the net allocation for 2022 is &euro;103.485 million.  The increase in 2022 reflects the cyclical impact of CSO&rsquo;s activities, primarily for the additional staff required for the 2022 census.  This census of population includes an uplift in census headquarter staff plus provision for more than 5,500 temporary staff, who are required to distribute and collect the census forms.</p><p> Members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues, as demonstrated by more than 23 million web hits on the CSO website and more than 19 million hits on PXStat in 2021.</p><p> The funding provided reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the CSO to meet its obligations under national and EU law, continue to develop the Irish statistical system, deliver a census of population and produce new outputs to meet domestics demand through the provision of trusted and robust official statistics.</p></speech>

The Minister of State mentioned the work he is doing with regard to businesses, etc., and the economy.  It obviously comprises the information in the North and the CSO is a southern equivalent.  I am aware that funding was allocated as part of the national development plan, NDP, for shared island projects.  I am interested to know if there are any plans for closer integration of the work of these two statistical agencies.  We are an all-island economy and having access to all-island data that is comparable is important.  It should be accessible to everyone.</p></speech>

As she mentioned, it is a very pertinent question.  There is strong collaboration and linkage between the CSO and NISRA and there is ongoing engagement around that.  There is also planning in progress around certain parameters that are provided in terms of statistics.  We can send the Deputy a detailed note on the nature of that collaboration.  As she said, it is important from an all-island perspective that we have strong links between both bodies, North and South.</p></speech>

With regard to the census, will it contain any additional questions that might be pandemic-related?  It will be an interesting census to look back on in years to come given the changes people have gone through over the past few years.  Will there be questions on the increase in people working from home or anything else that could be pandemic-related?</p> <p>  I am also interested in any change to the religion options.  Previously there were options for different religions and "No religion" in the responses.  Will there be an option to select "Atheist" or "Agnostic"?  The Minister of State might give more detail on that.</p></speech>

It was finalised prior to 2019 before we knew about Covid-19, which we have heard much about it since.  Obviously, to have a robust system underpinning the questionnaire and developing the statistical framework is important.  The pandemic intercepted the census last year so it was not possible to integrate questions around the pandemic specifically.  We can supply census forms to the committee, which might be useful in order that members will be able to see the exact type of questionnaire.  We want to get good engagement from the political system to promote the census and getting maximum participation is crucial to reflect our population.  We can give the Deputy detail on that.</p> <p>  She asked a question on religion.  There is a variety of questions.  The nature in which they are set out was developed with strong project governance that was set in 2019.  Now that we are going to see the issuing of those forms, we can send the committee the detail of the census forms and the nature of questions.  It is in our collective interest to ensure that people engage and participate in it in a way that allows us, as policymakers, to respond to the needs of our population. </p></speech>

I understand that it was done before Covid-19 hit us.  It is unfortunate, in a way, because I think it would be interesting to see those different changes happened as a result reflected.  Many people will look back in years to come at this particular census.</p> <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that Benefacts is a provider of high-quality data to the CSO.  It was raised in the Committee of Public Accounts and other places that it looks like it will be closing.  It provides information on the non-profit sector here.  It is my understanding that its data is relied on by the CSO and without it, there would be a significant gap in the ability to prepare the national accounts.

I have been informed by the CSO that it is interested in a replacement and in the data.  I am aware that another Department within government is considering that work at the moment.

A detailed briefing document for each of these Votes has been supplied to the committee in advance.  I will focus on the work of my Department in light of the proposed 2022 Estimate and touch on the proposed 2022 Estimate allocations for the President&rsquo;s Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  While I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in some of these offices, they operate independently of my Department.</p><p>On Vote 1, the Estimate for the President's Establishment is &euro;4.75 million.  This includes just over &euro;3 million for pay and administration, with the balance to fund the centenarians' bounty.</p><p>On Vote 3, the Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General is &euro;33.29 million.  Of this, &euro;14.31 million relates to staff costs and &euro;2.78 million is allocated to the Law Reform Commission.  A new subhead for the consolidation and revision of planning legislation has been allocated &euro;12 million.</p><p>The Estimate for Vote 5, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is &euro;47.83 million.  This provides &euro;19.32 million in administration and pay, an increase of &euro;2.1 million on 2021.  Some &euro;16.5 million has been allocated for fees to counsel and &euro;8.2 million to fund the local State solicitor service.</p><p>For Vote 6,<b></b>the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office Estimate for 2022 is &euro;49.66 million, the bulk of which relates to salaries and administration.  A provision of just over &euro;22.9 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred.</p><p>The Estimate for my Department, Vote 2, is just over &euro;38 million.  Almost 62% of that relates to staff and administration.  The remaining almost &euro;15 million provides funding for Covid-19 public communications, the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the National Economic and Social Council and several independent inquiries.  My Department will continue its role in providing, co-ordinating and overseeing a whole-of-government focus on the response to Covid-19 over the coming period.  A whole-of-government approach to the management of the pandemic over the past two years has been critical to our current position and our recovery.  A comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed Covid-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences.  This will help to ensure we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or other similar type emergency arrives.  We are considering what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p><p><i></i>We know the capacity to have a public health response that is agile and flexible, with an ability to pivot rapidly and respond to any emerging threat, is critical.  We have much to build on in terms of our achievements in disease surveillance, ICT infrastructure and vaccination programmes, all of which expanded rapidly over the past two years.</p><p>Our vaccination programme is one of the best globally.  Over 93% of the Irish population above the age of 12 is now fully vaccinated.  In total, more than 10 million vaccines have been administered since vaccination began in late 2020.  More than 2.7 million booster doses have now been administered and the vaccination programme continues.  In the European Centre for Disease Prevention data, Ireland is ranked fourth in Europe in terms of the population aged over 18 to have received a booster vaccination and has the sixth lowest overall mortality rate out of the 27 countries in the EU plus the UK.  Nevertheless, while continuing to monitor the disease situation and the downstream impacts of the pandemic, we must also use this time to assess learnings and mainstream the changes we need.  We need a public health response that is sustainable and flexible and has the capacity to surge in response to future pandemic threats.  We are also working to ensure a flexible and robust vaccine delivery system is in place for any future needs.</p><p>As it has throughout the pandemic, the Government has taken extensive and unprecedented measures to support workers and businesses.  In excess of &euro;20 billion in direct supports have been provided to date, which places us as among the most generous within the EU.  This includes approximately &euro;9 billion for the pandemic unemployment payment and a further &euro;9 billion through the employment wage subsidy scheme and its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme.</p><p>While we continue to manage the impact of the pandemic on the labour market, we have seen positive developments.  Last December, the Covid-adjusted unemployment rate stood at 7.5%, down from 21.7% in December 2020.  The overall level of employment reached a record high in quarter 3 of 2021, rising to almost 2.5 million people in work.  This is a record number in employment.  The Department of Finance has estimated a general Government deficit of approximately &euro;9 billion or 4% of national income for 2021, following higher than expected tax returns in the second half of the year. </p><p>Of course, the pandemic is not over but our management of it is changing and that will continue to evolve to deal with the ongoing impacts and to respond to any fresh threats.  Through the Cabinet committee structures, we will continue to assess longer term impacts and responses across public services.  My Department will also continue, for as long as is necessary, to co-ordinate communications for the whole-of-government response to the pandemic, keeping the public informed about current public health advice, vaccination and booster programmes, and economic and other supports.  Clear and consistent communications across national and regional press, national and local radio, digital display, social media, television and online video have been a core focus of the pandemic response from the beginning.  Those Covid-19 public information campaigns will continue to ensure we reach all those who are relying on information, guidance and advice to underpin our recovery.</p><p>As we continue to live with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is important as a people that we pause and reflect, take time to remember those who have lost their lives and pay tribute to everyone who has contributed to how we have faced and are facing the challenges together.  The public holiday to be held on 18 March is in recognition of the efforts of the public, volunteers and front-line workers during the Covid-19 pandemic and in remembrance of those who lost their lives during that time.  A national day of remembrance and reflection is also planned for 20<sup></sup>March to reflect the experiences of all those who have suffered loss during the pandemic.</p><p>The 2021 economic recovery plan, which was published last June, is being progressed through the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  The plan sets out renewed supports, investments and policies for a new stage of economic recovery and transition, with an overarching ambition of 2.5 million people in work, which will now be achieved by the end of the year, well in advance of what was originally set out in the plan.  It is helping to drive a jobs-rich recovery and will support the economy in transitioning towards a decarbonised and digital economy.  As part of the plan, a new artificial intelligence, AI, strategy was launched in July, and in the past week a new digital strategy, Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework, has been published.</p><p>The Irish economy, like many other advanced economies, is, as we know, also experiencing a surge of inflation driven by supply chain difficulties and rising energy costs.  Unfortunately, this is a global phenomenon.  The Government is examining a number of ways to alleviate pressures on people from the rising cost of living.</p><p>Like all sectors, housing and construction have been impacted by the pandemic.  The housing crisis will take time to resolve and the strong economy will mean continued pressure on prices and rents in the short term.  It is a priority for the Government and for my Department.  My Department chairs the Housing for All delivery group of Secretaries General and provides the secretariat.  There are three subgroups, each chaired by a Secretary General.  These are working on three key areas: investment, industry capability and public service delivery.  The Housing for All Plan is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State and contains a range of actions and measures to ensure more than 300,000 new homes are built by 2030.  This figure includes 90,000 social, 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes.  Last week, the Government published the second quarterly progress report for quarter 4 2021.  It shows significant progress towards the fundamental reform of the housing system, setting the course to increase the supply of housing significantly and provide a sustainable housing system into the future.</p><p> The end of January marked two years since Brexit, a process that started almost six years ago with the referendum in the UK in June 2016.  Throughout that period, Brexit has remained a key focus of Government.  I want to place on the record the importance of engaged cross-party support in the Oireachtas for the Government&rsquo;s key objectives and approach to safeguarding Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the context of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  Officials in my Department were deeply involved in the negotiations and the preparation for Ireland&rsquo;s national response.</p><p> While Brexit has brought ongoing disruption, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, together with the withdrawal agreement including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, means that Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives in the Brexit negotiations were achieved.  In particular, these agreements ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process and include: avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland; facilitating the maintenance of the common travel area; enshrining the best possible outcome, given UK choices, for trade and the economy, notably tariff- and quota-free trade with the UK; protecting Ireland&rsquo;s place in the Single Market and the Single Market itself; and ensuring fair competition and a level playing field for Irish businesses.</p><p> The Government has worked hard to support businesses exposed to the British market to prepare and continues to do so.  I pay tribute to the effort that so many businesses have made to diversify markets, make supply chains more resilient and adapt where necessary.  Our work on the implementation of the protocol will continue.  The EU has listened closely to concerns in Northern Ireland and is working in good faith to minimise friction.  The current talks between the EU and the UK must be given every chance to succeed.  The Commission has put forward serious proposals which directly address the concerns about outstanding issues on implementation of the protocol.  Our joint focus should be on achieving positive progress.  We remain confident that solutions exist within the parameters of the protocol for the issues that have arisen.</p><p> I am deeply concerned about recent developments in Northern Ireland and the resignation of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, First Minister, Paul Givan.  I have consistently stated that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should not be undermined and that politicians from all sides should respect this.  I urge the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid any action that could damage peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</p><p> The Government&rsquo;s shared island initiative is progressing on an ambitious and whole-of-government basis and through all-island partnerships with the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government, and local authorities and civil society across the island.  The shared island unit established in my Department in 2020 acts as a driver and co-ordinator of this whole-of-government initiative.  The Government allocated &euro;50 million from the fund in 2021 to move ahead with key cross-Border investments, including new phases of the Ulster Canal, the Narrow Water bridge project and a major new North-South research programme delivered by the Higher Education Authority.</p><p> We are also continuing the shared island dialogue series to foster deeper civic engagement on how we can work across all communities in practical meaningful ways for a shared future.  In 2021, there was participation by over 1,000 civic representatives across all regions, communities and sectors in eight events.  In-person and regional events will be convened during 2022 as part of the series, now that this is possible.  A comprehensive research programme is also under way, working with the ESRI, the National Economic and Social Council, Irish Research Council and other partners on publishing a stream of high-quality work through this year, to inform discussions and engagement by all communities and traditions on the island on the opportunities of our shared future.  </p><p> Since assuming our seat at the start of 2021, Ireland has played an active role on the UN Security Council.  Together with Norway, we successfully led efforts to secure the renewal of the mandate for cross-border delivery of humanitarian assistance in Syria.  We are closely involved in work on women, peace and security, and on upholding the Iran nuclear deal.  At the September UN meeting, I spoke about the urgent need for a concerted multilateral response to climate change involving all organs of the UN.  A key theme of the Irish presidency of the Security Council was the link between climate and security.  Climate change is a major contributor to unrest across Africa and the developing world.  Some 80% of UN peacekeepers are deployed in countries that are most exposed to climate change.  Ireland, along with 60 other countries, is an active member of the wider group of friends on climate and security work.  The Government is determined to continue to play its part on integrating climate-related security risks into the work we do to prevent conflict and build peace.</p><p> My Department supports whole-of-government efforts to combat poverty and disadvantage, improve the position of vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, promote diversity and inclusion, tackle inequality in all its forms and provide ongoing support to children and families.  Through the work of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, we are overseeing implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, equality and public services, including matters relating to justice, policing reform and community safety.  The Cabinet committee receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers the implementation of commitments and reforms.  The Government is due to publish its new strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence next month.  The Cabinet sub-committee will be responsible for its implementation.  The strategy will be underpinned by clear actions, timelines for reforms and robust accountability mechanisms, including a delivery board, to ensure that all organisations deliver on their obligations under the new strategy.</p><p> We will continue to support the work to build stronger and safer communities through reforms in policing and community safety, including oversight roles in the implementation of A Policing Service for the Future, the piloting of the local community safety partnerships and the Dublin north-east inner city initiative.  There are also pilots of local community safety partnerships in Waterford city and county and Longford county.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a human rights unit and established the strategic human rights advisory committee.  The Government will continue to implement the reform programmes outlined in A Policing Service for the Future.</p><p> Through the work of the Cabinet committee on health, we will continue our investment in an expanded public health service and embed the lessons learned in the pandemic into community and primary care services.  2022 will see the biggest ever investment in the health system in order to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare, reduce waiting lists, increase capacity, protect the most vulnerable and address inequalities.</p><p> The Government is committed to building a world-class education system from early years to higher and further education.  Through the work of the Cabinet committee on education, we are overseeing major reforms to the funding model for early learning and childcare services, the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for higher level education, and the development of a new ten-year strategy for adult literacy, numeracy, and digital skills.  We will work through the National Economic and Social Council and other new engagement structures to ensure that a full range of views can input into the development of economic and social policy.</p><p> Tackling climate change and transitioning to a climate-neutral economy remains a key focus of this Government.  My Department plays an important role in driving implementation of our ambitious climate agenda, including by co-chairing the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change and reporting on the implementation of the Climate Action Plan 2021.  That plan is the latest in a suite of measures introduced by this Government to fundamentally alter our approach to climate change.  Our new climate legislation, carbon budgets and annual climate action plans provide for clear targets, actions and accountability.  This puts climate action at the heart of all of Government&rsquo;s plans and policies over the next decade and beyond.</p><p> The Government has agreed to establish two citizens&rsquo; assemblies to run concurrently.  One will be on biodiversity and will examine how the State can improve its response to the issue of biodiversity loss.  The other will consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.  It is also our intention to set up a citizens' assembly on drugs later this year.  A resolution setting out the terms of reference for these assemblies will be put forward to the Oireachtas for its approval.</p><p> Provision is made in the Revised Estimate for a number of independent inquiries, including the Moriarty tribunal, the Cregan commission and the Cooke commission.  The estimated cost of the Cregan commission to date is &euro;11 million and the cost for the Cooke commission it is approximately &euro;3.9 million.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates with Deputies.</p></speech>

I could only find minutes of the meetings in 2016.  Has the Civil Service accountability board met since then?

The Taoiseach is before us today and as he is the chair of the Civil Service accountability board, I thought it was important to ask him about that.  However, he said that the board has not met since 2016.</p> <p>  Some &euro;15 million was spent on Covid-19 communications.  We do not have a full figure-breakdown of the number of public communication campaigns etc. that have resulted in that amount.  We are all aware that a lot of money would have been spent on Covid-19 communications; that is clear.  I would like to see greater detail and a breakdown of what the spending was on campaigns, including spending on private media organisations compared with the State broadcaster, and if any external PR companies were hired to assist in this.  If external companies were used, did they go through a competitive procurement process?  We know that did not happen in some cases during Covid-19 because of the nature of the pandemic.  Does the Taoiseach have that information?</p></speech>

The Office of Government Procurement runs a procurement process for media buying and contracts are put in place from which Departments and Government offices can draw down.  When the Office of Government Procurement runs various campaign advertisements, the Department of the Taoiseach liaises closely with it on all matters relating to public procurement.  It has procedures in place.  It monitors all areas of expenditure.</p> <p>  On the question the Deputy asked, there were about 68 separate public information-campaigns in 2021 under the Covid heading, with campaigns using a combination of national and regional press, national and local radio, digital display, social media, television and online video.  Campaigns provided, as the Deputy knows, information on public health measures that were in place at different stages of the pandemic.  In addition, a wide range of business, social welfare and community supports had to be advertised and communicated.  There were also targeted initiatives such as the #Antiviral campaign, which was a Covid-19 communications campaign that was designed by and for young people, allowing them to share their experiences of the pandemic while reinforcing key public-health guidance.  There was also the RSVP campaign, which we used more recently.  It encouraged people to be risk aware and assisted them in assessing the relevant riskiness of activities, and it supported them to take steps to mitigate the risk of contracting and transmitting Covid.</p> <p>  The total Covid spend in 2021 was &euro;12.1 million.  The breakdown shows, more or less, an even split across national and regional media outlets.  The Department will continue to co-ordinate this throughout 2022.  As I said, the oversight is provided by the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

In 2021, on national radio &euro;2.1 million was spent; &euro;2.4 million on regional and local radio; &euro;1.3 million on national print press; and the same amount, &euro;1.3 million, on regional print press.

In the Taoiseach's opening remarks, he spoke of his intention to have a citizens' assembly on drugs, and he mentioned two other citizens' assemblies.

The programme for Government has identified a number of citizens' assemblies that we have committed to, including on a Dublin mayor, biodiversity and drugs.  We are committing to one on drugs in the latter part of this year, with education.</p> <p>  I will give my view on a citizens' assembly in terms of the island of Ireland.  The shared island unit is a worthwhile initiative that, without prejudice to the constitutional situation, allows us to engage with civic society on the island on a range of issues outside the constitutional question, including on biodiversity, climate change, health, education, infrastructure and so forth.  On the research area, we have had a successful subscription to the idea of joint research projects North and South.  Some &euro;40 million will be allocated to joint research initiatives between researchers in the Republic and researchers in Northern Ireland to which there has been a great response.</p> <p>  On the constitutional issue, having been involved in this area all my life, and since I became a Deputy, my view is that I am not convinced the future evolution of the island and relationships on the island can be resolved through a citizens' assembly.  Rather, I believe it takes the painstaking engagement of people to people, the building of relationships, and that requires a lot of detailed work.  It can take weekends.  It requires constant engagement with all traditions and people from all backgrounds.  It is consuming but it is necessary.  We have all been on a journey of understanding in regard to Northern Ireland; I certainly have been since I became a Deputy and, indeed, before then.  I honestly can say that the best insights I got were from talking to people who I perceived had completely opposite views and different perspectives to me.  I met them at weekend gatherings organised by facilitators where we learned more about their backgrounds and issues.</p><p>I did it through the British-Irish Association.  During the 1990s and the early 2000s in particular, it did invaluable work in drawing people from different backgrounds together.  Those weekend meetings were held in Cambridge or Oxford alternately.  I attended a reconciliation event in Ballycastle at which I meet 12 public representatives from the unionist and loyalist tradition to get a greater understanding.</p><p> The Deputy is speaking about a citizens' assembly in terms of designing the structures.  To be honest, from a republican perspective, it really is about people engaging on a constant basis.  This is what will enable us to develop and evolve beyond the Good Friday Agreement into a meaningful accommodation.  This is what I believe.  I am not yet clear in my head that a citizens' assembly can accommodate this.</p></speech>

This is something on which I have engaged.  I have taken part in the type of weekend meetings the Taoiseach described.  It is very important to have engagement and to speak to people from different backgrounds who have different points of view and different lived realities.  This is extremely important.  It is something I would in no way want to diminish.  This work is something on which we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been very active for a long period.</p> <p>  What I am saying with regard to a national citizens' assembly is that the conversation in respect of our future has progressed.  I do not mean just among the people in this room who deal with politics every day; I am talking about people who, before Brexit and Covid, never necessarily had that much of a thought about or interest in the constitutional future, but it has become far more of a daily reality for them.  People do bring this up and they do discuss this.  I am not just speaking about people who have had strong points of view previously.  The idea of a national citizens' assembly would be to move the conversation on and have a forum for people to have these conversations.  The idea of a national citizens' assembly would be that people from all backgrounds and all perspectives would be able to come together and have this conversation.  We all know that the only way we can move forward in any capacity is through conversations.  I agree with the Taoiseach on this.  There is a role for a national citizens' assembly in this regard.</p></speech>

I am not sure that all traditions would come to a citizens' assembly with this as the agenda item.  Even on the shared island initiative political unionism have not engaged.  To be fair, it has not put any obstacles in its way either or has not campaigned or articulated against it.  Civic society in Northern Ireland from all persuasions has engaged in the dialogue, which has been very valuable.  Projects are progressing.  Funding is being allocated to sensible projects that can bring benefits to people North and South.  There is a considerable distance to go before we are at that stage.  It is not about simply convening a citizens' assembly; it is about the participation required to make it meaningful.</p></speech>

For the Taoiseach, is it about the timing of a national citizens' assembly rather than a national citizens' assembly in general?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#Q00500"><p>It is about the mechanism.  The fundamental point I offer, and I am open to engaging in further discussion, is that the alternative route I suggested is better.  It is a longer route but a more engaging one.  A citizens' assembly in itself will not facilitate constantly meeting and engaging with people in a short period of time.  Think of all of the work that went into the Good Friday Agreement, even the constitutional framework that emerged from the Good Friday Agreement such as the need to amend Articles 2 and 3 in the Republic and changes to the Government of Ireland Act.  It involved the British Government, the Irish Government and the unionist, nationalist and republican and loyalist parties in Northern Ireland.  It took enormous work for years to get to the stage we ultimately got to.  I was a backbencher for part of it.  I was a Minister for the concluding parts of the Good Friday Agreement.  Perhaps I am influenced by the experience that it took that length of time and engagement to sound people out in order to identify what would be possible and not possible.  A citizens' assembly is a different type of mechanism and I am not clear it lends itself to the type of work that was required for the Good Friday Agreement and the advances made prior to the agreement.  I hope this explains where I am coming from.</p></speech>

I am glad to have him before the committee.  I will pick up on the questions Deputy Farrell has asked.

He accepts the Good Friday Agreement is a legally binding agreement on the Irish and British Governments and parts of it are judicially reviewable, does he not?</p></speech>

That part of the Good Friday Agreement is also judicially reviewable.  Is this not the case?</p></speech>

In the most recent opinion poll, 51% of people in the North said that they want a referendum within five years.  I would not dare to extrapolate that this would mean 51% would support it.  Some will want a referendum for different reasons.  Support for Irish unity has been growing, particularly among younger demographic groups.  The point I am making is that the transition to a new type of Ireland is outside of the hands of politicians, including the Taoiseach or whoever holds his office or whoever is Prime Minister of Britain.  We have all agreed and signed up to it being up to the people North and South in two referendums.  The courts could force the Secretary of State to trigger the mechanism in the Good Friday Agreement if the courts believed the terms of it were reached.  We could have a situation in four or five years where we have a series of opinion polls that show more support for Irish unity and, therefore, somebody would go to the courts and we would have a referendum.  Is this possible in the Taoiseach's view?</p></speech>

Ultimately, politicians will have to work out the future of this island.  If we go back over the 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement, for half its lifetime the institutions have been down for one reason or another.  This is problematic and illustrates the need for people to work the institutions in the first instance and to try to get normal politics applied within the institutions.  They have never really been given a chance for any long period to do things the people want done on bread and butter issues such as housing and health.  I remember George Mitchell talking about what he expected to see when he brought his son to the assembly.  He said he expected to see the normal toing and froing of politics.  This has not quite happened with the Good Friday Agreement, and this needs to be reflected upon.</p> <p>  There have been various polls and surveys.  My view is that of Wolfe Tone, namely, that there is not a reconciled people.  We have a lot of work to do on this.  I said that an immediate border poll at the time of Brexit would have been counterproductive.  We can see what is happening, in my view unfairly, with regard to the protocol and its impact.  I believe the protocol is advantageous for the entire island, including Northern Ireland.  We can see how certain people have elevated it to a constitutional level to which it should never have been elevated.</p><p>That would be my response to that.  </p></speech>

I agree with the Taoiseach's view concerning the dialogue and engagement that must happen to ensure any referendum and any transition that would take place in the future would be as smooth and seamless as possible at that point in time.  That is an important but different point.</p> <p>  In a conversation with a former Secretary of State when we raised these issues with him at the time, he made the point that if he was to call a border poll under the Good Friday Agreement, he could be judicially reviewed and the courts could find him in breach of an international agreement.  The point I am making is that the opposite can happen.  We could have a situation where the courts find that the Secretary of State is acting against the Good Friday Agreement because the desire could be there and represented and there would be a breach of the Good Friday Agreement in respect of not triggering the poll.  He pointed to opinion polls as an indicator.  The problem is that we need to have the preparation work done and part of that involves engagements and discussions that need to happen among all of us who believe in a new and shared island.</p> <p>  Part of that work needs to involve a separate work about an understanding for those of us who believe in a new Ireland regarding what our taxation system will look like, what our new health system will look like and how the transition of the Six Counties to the EU will take place, as is already allowed for by the EU.  What will the economy look like?  What will a new constitution look like?  How will the identities and traditions of 1 million people who identify themselves as British or unionist not just be recognised but cherished on a new island?  All of these tricky and sensitive questions must be asked and they cannot be asked just in terms of building relations.  They must be asked formally.  This is why it is really important regardless of whatever mechanism we find such as a Green Paper, a constitutional convention, a new Ireland forum or an all-party committee to thrash those issues.</p> <p>  There is a real danger because of the momentum that is growing, and discussion is really rampant concerning the question of unity, that a referendum takes place and, from my point of view, is won and the people of the North and South agree to constitutional change and a new Ireland but we have not done the work we should have done.  We have always made it very clear that it is this work that needs to begin immediately.  The discussion leading up to the referendum is crucial, just as it was in the Scottish referendum.  Opinion polls can vary.  They can go up and down as we saw in the last election.  Those supportive of Scottish independence failed to achieve above the mid-30s before the debate on Scottish independence happened.  We know the result of the referendum, which was very close.  The debate is really important - not just in terms of winning hearts and minds but reassuring those who are not in any way supportive of the idea of Irish unity.  I think every political party believes there will be a referendum.  Does the Taoiseach believe there will be a referendum on the constitutional change in the next ten years?  Does he see this as a possibility?  If so, when do we start that other type of work in terms of what we think are the changes that would be required?  This needs to be as inclusive as possible while recognising that some people may not be up for that discussion at this point in time.  Others will, including some unionists.</p></speech>

What is very interesting in the current discussions around the protocol is that nobody has told me they do not want to have continued access to the European Single Market, which is significant notwithstanding all the objections and opposition to the protocol.  My genuine view at the time of Brexit was that it was the wrong time to draw up a border poll.  We had our views on that.  My view was that it would put people into the trenches and people would have strong views either way.</p> <p>  Probably one of the most important developments in my lifetime was the New Ireland Forum.  I was not in politics at the time.  I would have been an observer of politics.  What the forum did to some extent was bring constitutional nationalism together to work out the best options for a unitary state.  Options included joint sovereignty.  We heard Margaret Thatcher say no, no, no to all three options.  In retrospect, it was a good exercise.</p> <p>  The other one I thought was important was the Opsahl Commission which went through a range of scenarios regarding how to demilitarise the North.  That was well in advance of the peace process.  I do understand that point.  The question is whether we do it in the Republic and just have our own rethink about where we are.  What does that do?  What impact does that have on unionism, loyalism and other traditions such as the new Irish?  There is a centre ground view in the North.  I think Andrew Trimble said on that programme that he sees himself as Northern Irish, so the Deputy is right in talking about all the traditions because there are many of them.  I just do not think one would get buy-in to that in a citizens' assembly.  Perhaps there is a case to be made for political opinion in the Republic.  What do we mean?  What are we talking about?  One thing we do need to reflect on are the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  </p> <p>  It seems we are in a very difficult space.  Again, the institutions have been pulled down - wrongly, in my view.  I think this is undermining the institutions in terms of public esteem and people's buy-in to those institutions.  Whatever happens in the future must be grounded in the Good Friday Agreement foundations, which are three sets of relationships.  They are that the British-Irish relationship would continue regardless of whatever evolution takes place.  Other factors include the North-South relationship, the two traditions plus new traditions and parity of esteem between traditions.  In my view, devolution in the North will be here for quite a while and should be engaged in.  The Executive is another factor.  These are only observations.  I accept that these things need to be talked through but the issue is whether we do it in the most inclusive way possible or we do it just in the context of the Republic for the moment.</p></speech>

The problem is that if one believes the only way we can have these conversations is when everybody is included and political unionism is at the table, that is not likely to happen in the short term because unionism, by its nature, believes in the union, which is a legitimate view held by leaders of unionism who worked alongside Sinn F&eacute;in in better times and recognised the legitimate views of nationalists, republicans and Governments in the South.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments.  I think there is further thought in this other than just figuring out the structure.  The structure is not the important part of it.  The important part is a discussion so that we are not talking to ourselves but instead are talking together and trying to figure out the best way to go forward because there is tricky work to be done.  I agree with the Taoiseach's point.  Some of the heavy lifting has been done by the Good Friday Agreement because many of the issues were resolved in terms of parity of esteem and equality.  Those fundamental principles in the Good Friday Agreement will outlast any constitutional change or decision in a referendum.</p></speech>

I am not sure of the next time it will meet.  The Taoiseach reiterated that the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality will be fully utilised to bring dedicated focus to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, to ensure oversight of the issue from his Department and that he would take a role in this.  Has the Taoiseach allocated any budget or resources to this new oversight function for the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence to the Cabinet committee that is now charged with bringing forward that focused view?

It is sharp in the public focus right now, following a series of attacks, which have occurred in recent days.  The committee will meet in March.

This is because I think this will turn out to be an unprecedented time for actual delivery on issues that, unfortunately, have been around for a long time and with which the previous Oireachtas could not deal.

If the Secretary General has spent a part of his time over the past year and a half investigating this matter, there will be a cost to that, just as would be the case if we were to put in a freedom of information, FOI, request to look for documentation.  It would tell us that we would have to pay &euro;300, because the FOI will take up however many of a person's hours.  Can the Taoiseach inform this committee, as part of the Estimates, how many man-hours or how many work hours has the Secretary General  put into this investigation?  How many people and documents were scanned as the output - which is part of the Estimates process as well - has happened over the past year and a half? </p></speech>

There is the whole history and journey of relations between Ireland and Britain.  The British and Irish Governments have avoided that type of litigation or legal process in modern times.  Let us be clear, the relationship between the two Governments has been transformed over the past 30 years.  That is a very good thing.  We have to work hard to maintain those relationships, notwithstanding the challenges and tensions that may arise from time to time.  Brexit has created significant challenges to that relationship.  The British Prime Minister and I have engaged, and we continue to engage.  We have made it clear to the British Government that it would be wrong to have an amnesty for anybody who was involved in any killings, any murders or any atrocities.</p></speech>

We believe that it would be very damaging indeed if the British Government were to pursue this.  There is, as the Deputy knows, a mechanism in the agreement and in the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has engaged in that process and on that specific issue with his counterparts, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and the political parties in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  There was a meeting on 24 June.  Following that meeting, the Government joined with the British Government and with the Northern Ireland parties in a process of intensive engagement on these issues.  Discussions began in July.  We have said that the victims must come first.  I think that the Deputy would agree with that.</p></speech>

As for the relationship between Britain and Ireland, that relationship has reversed significantly in recent times.  Britain actually started to take unilateral decisions with regards the relationship between the two countries.  It would not be unusual for a participant of an agreement to state that they would seek to uphold that agreement up to the point of even using the courts to do that.  It would send a strong message to the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday, of Ballymurphy, of the Springhill massacre, as well as the victims related to Operation Greenwich, following the report that was reached yesterday.  At this juncture, a strong message to the British Government is needed to state there is a line that cannot be crossed when it comes to upholding the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.558" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022020900002#T00600"><p>The majority of the people in the North of Ireland voted for the Good Friday Agreement.  Most polls show that a majority of people of the North support the protocol or could live with the protocol.  The DUP is a minority party and unionism is now a minority political view in the North.  I believe the DUP has put itself in a strategic cul-de-sac at the moment.  At every juncture of Brexit, it has misstepped.  It now finds itself in the past ten days pulling down Stormont, playing its trump card, which is its last card.  The British response yesterday was just to say it would implement the Irish language Act.  I do not believe the Irish language Act should be politicised in anyway in this entire process.  It was interesting that in a debate in Westminster yesterday, Ian Paisley Jnr. basically said the Tories had no real interest in the North.  He said they were an English nationalist party, more interested in the red wall than in the border on the Irish Sea.  The DUP has created this situation.</p> <p>  I welcome that the Taoiseach said that no party should pull down Stormont on the basis of its own political agenda.  I fully agree with that.  If we allow Stormont to be pulled down by one single party in the future, is that not a recipe for dysfunction?  It is actually undemocratic because there is a majority in favour of the Irish language Act in Stormont.  There is a majority in favour of the protocol in Stormont.  Do we not now need Stormont to be reformed?  The rules of the institution itself need to move beyond where Stormont is at the moment.  Even if there is an election in May, there is a serious likelihood that the DUP will not participate in the Executive.  We cannot put ourselves into a two- or three-year hiatus when 44,000 people are on waiting lists for houses in the North, 250,000 people are in poverty and another 250,000 people are waiting for hospital beds for more than a year.  Surely the Irish and British Governments now have a responsibility to rewrite the rules of Stormont.</p></speech>

The DUP represents a very important constituency.  It represents people of particular views in Northern Ireland.  That needs to be respected as we must respect the UUP and the views it represents.  Notwithstanding that we might disagree with some of the policies the parties might present, we need to respect that they have electoral mandates.</p> <p>  If there is to be broad community-based faith in the elections of the institutions, the results of the elections must be accepted on all sides.  That part of it must be fulfilled.  The Deputy has raised broader points that are valid regarding how it is operating.  The First Minister's office and the deputy First Minister's office of course are two equal offices.  Issues have surfaced over how business gets done and the role of other parties, and those issues are worthy of discussion.  There can be no equivocation.  There must be an election and whatever way the votes fall we have existing agreements and everybody who has signed up to those agreements should adhere to those, accept the result and take up their roles in the institutions.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that no institutions should be taken down for political reasons.  As I said earlier, I believe they have been down for half of the lifetime of the Good Friday Agreement.  There is an enormous difference between the esteem in which the Scottish assembly is held among Scottish people and the position in Northern Ireland based on surveys carried out.  Based on my experience of having been in the North during one election recently, they do not like abstentionism; they want their politicians to do things for them in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  They want people to work them.</p></speech>

I understand that the North now has the ability to institute a corporation tax and potentially to equalise that rate with the South, which obviously would be a massive boon for the development of the economy in the North and would be a step forward in taxation equalisation on both parts of the island.  Have there been any discussions with the Department of Finance in the North on that?  What is the position of the Irish Government and the Department of Finance in the North on excise duty and minimum pricing on alcohol?</p></speech>

There are challenges with movement over how to make up the revenue foregone.  I will check with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to see if there have been any discussions between the two Departments of Finance and the two Ministers in respect of corporation tax.  I understand there have been discussions on the minimum pricing of alcohol between the two Ministers for Health; I can get clarification on that.  Again, that would need to come through the Executive.</p> <p>  Suffice it to say, the Oireachtas passed the legislation on minimum pricing for alcohol almost unanimously.  We did it for public health reasons.  It was done in Scotland first.  The results in Scotland appear to have been beneficial for public health.  I take the point that the optimal way to do it is on an all-island basis.  We would like the Northern Ireland Executive to implement it when it can.  Obviously, now it is not in a position to do that because the Executive is no longer in place.</p></speech>

Aont&uacute; will shortly bring a Bill to the D&aacute;il to investigate what happened in nursing homes and hospitals over that time.  The majority of people who died from Covid caught it in those locations.  I would like details on that commitment.  When will those investigations take place?  Under which Department will they take place?</p></speech>

That means taking on board all the issues the Deputy has outlined.  We need to learn how we have managed Covid-19 and whether we could have done it better.  What lessons can be learned from our experience over the past two years in dealing with a global pandemic, which was the first in 100 years?  That would mean we would be in a better and stronger position if another pandemic or emergency arose.</p> <p>  The Minister for Health has established a public health reform expert advisory group.  It will focus on identifying lessons from the public health components of the response to Covid-19 with a view to strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness.  We are not just talking about hospital capacity, etc., but also the Sentinel system within the GP network.</p> <p>  We have doubled the workforce of public health doctors and support staff.  For the first time ever, we have brought consultants into the public health area, which had been denied public health doctors for a long time.  We need to get the public health side right because that should be the first line of response to any new pandemic.  The key players on Covid-19 need to be at the wheel even still because we need to monitor what is happening with Omicron and where we go towards the middle of the year.</p><p>There will be a meeting of the Cabinet committee dealing with Covid-19 shortly to assess where we are right now.  The key players are the leadership of the HSE and our leadership in public health.</p><p> The model I envisage will draw on different disciplines in the first instance.  They would consider the different phases of the pandemic, and what happened in nursing homes would come under the first phase remit.  We would have to set ourselves terms of reference, indices and how we compared internationally.  I wanted to keep the key players working in the field, so to speak, during the pandemic, so we have not yet settled on a model.  I have ideas in how to progress it and at the next meeting of the Covid-19 committee we will discuss the best model.</p></speech>

Do not get me wrong, as I understand that governance in this period was extremely difficult.  The issue was live and it was very hard to make decisions, as information may not have been fully at the disposal of the Government.  There is much information coming out now on the massive increase in domestic violence that occurred, in part, because of the restrictions and the length of their imposition.  There was also the cancellation of cancer care and consequences for diagnoses, as well as the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of BreastCheck appointments.  There were difficulties for the mental health of younger people especially.  In the first quarter of 2021, only one country in the whole of Europe had stopped building homes, and that was Ireland, despite it probably having one of the worst housing crises in the whole of Europe.</p> <p>  There is a necessity for a real investigation into this.  I am not looking for heads or individuals to lose their ability to do their jobs.  It is really important, nonetheless, with the benefit of hindsight and understanding of the real costs, to measure them against the necessity to protect against a live virus and conduct a robust investigation into what happened.  In nursing homes, 10,000 people were moved from hospital beds to nursing homes in the first six months of 2020 and many of them were never tested for Covid-19.  The nursing home sector sought to close its doors to visitors in March and April 2020 but the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, said the doors to visitors should be kept open for visitors to circulate in hospitals.  The HSE took personal protective equipment and staff away from nursing homes in 2020 when those nursing homes were crying out for staff.</p> <p>  A range of decisions were made that had a significant impact on the health and well-being of individuals and we need more than an analysis of that.  We need to be able to have a proper, detailed, forensic understanding of those decisions and the impact they had to ensure we do not repeat them.</p></speech>

To me, the fundamental objective was always to save lives and people from becoming severely ill.  We also wanted to protect our health services from being overwhelmed.  The mortality question is important, and as I said in my opening address, we have the sixth-lowest mortality rate in that respect in Europe.  We counted almost everything when it came to Covid-19 deaths and our data are very comprehensive.</p> <p>  We were very conscious of many of those matters throughout the pandemic.  The Deputy mentioned domestic violence and mental health.  I do not want to go back over old issues but on one occasion we were accused of differing from the NPHET opinion.  At that meeting there were presentations from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on well-being and mental health, and all of that informed our view of the time.  I have remained very concerned about mental health and particularly the impact on young people through the pandemic.  The effect on domestic violence, for example, was not unknown to us and it would have been reported to Covid-19 committee meetings that during the first lockdown, domestic violence rates increased.</p> <p>  These were very difficult decisions of life and death in deciding whether to lock down.  I was very concerned about construction but we must remember where the alpha variant had us.  That alpha wave was the worst moment of the Covid-19 pandemic, and it really stretched us.  It was a variant that ran through us and we did not have vaccination to protect us.  In hindsight we tend to look at things differently.  I genuinely believe the absolute game-changing nature of vaccines has not been fully appreciated.  I can look back at the Alpha wave and we did not have vaccines so people were getting very sick and dying.  This time around, with the Omicron variant, we were vaccinated and doing far more socialisation even before Christmas than the previous Christmas but hospital beds were not filling up to the same extent.  The vaccine story is the key to what happened in 2021 and how we go out of this.</p> <p>  There should a robust inquiry and evaluation of this.  I use the word "evaluation" because I do not want future public officials - or private sector personnel who worked very well with us - looking over their shoulders.  The Irish Business and Employers' Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were very good on the return to work process and we saw some really good collaboration.  We needed decision makers and for people to take decisions in the middle of a crisis like a pandemic.  They will take what comes with that.  We need an international comparator as well and we should have an international person or two in such a process.</p></speech>

The truth of the matter is that the Omicron variant spread at a rate of 500,000 per week towards the end of the last wave.  In many ways, it is the spread of Omicron through the population that led to it having nowhere else to spread.  That contributed to the end of that wave as well.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, came before this committee recently to discuss the salary of the Secretary General in the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt.  This is a burning issue in the minds of many people around the country because we could not create a bigger contrast between the experience of the general population and that particular salaried individual in the public sector.</p></speech>

We are talking about an approximate &euro;100,000 increase in salary over a period of a year for one individual with no process or international benchmarks.  Last week the Minister said this was an isolated incident that will not affect other salaries but how can we say to people seeking wage increases in the next year due to cost of living hikes that wage increases are not for them but are only for others?</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is about a specific post and a position of Secretary General in the Department of Health.  When I was questioned, I made the point that given my experience in health, there is merit in the Secretary General position in the Department of Health having a higher salary than other Secretary General positions.</p><p>Why would I say that?  At that time and in the few months before that appointment, we were in the middle of a global pandemic, we had allocated enormous sums to the Department of Health and we had emerging issues with the children's hospital that summer.  If I am honest about it, the Department needs fundamental reform and change to be fit for purpose.  That was the motivating factor.  Something similar happened regarding the HSE position, the Garda Commissioner and other positions.</p><p> I understand fully the points the Deputy has made.  I understand people may not agree with me on this.  We are all entitled to have views.  I have no personal interest in this other than, as Taoiseach, I have to act in respect of the health portfolio.</p><p> The Government set itself three fundamental objectives when we came into office and, to be blunt about it, we do not have time to be hanging around.  Climate change is one issue.  Housing is another, and health.  Of course, there is a range of other issues.  We want to get things done and we want change.</p><p> People may disagree with us on an issue such as the filling the position of Secretary General of the Department of Health but I am clear that more needs to be done in health.  The Department of Health needs to be the go-to Department in the public service.  It was not that for the past number of years from what I am hearing.  There are many very good people working in the Department.  They have been working extremely hard during Covid-19.  I pay tribute to the public servants in the Department for the work that they have done above and beyond the call of duty.  It is so enormous.  It is relentless in terms of issues that arrive on the desks of civil servants in the Department.  It needs expansion, it needs capacity and then the relationship with the HSE is one that has to be developed.  However, the expenditure we have allocated to health generally is exponential in its growth.</p></speech>

You were answering that in respect of the specific wage increase for the Secretary General.  In your opening remarks and in the Estimates, you referred to Cabinet sub-committees which I was interested in.  They are dealing with the disability sector and improving the lot of people with disabilities, and equality and justice, etc.  I was not going to mention this but, in contrast, I put it to you that Ellie, who is three years of age, was accessing services through an agency funded by the HSE and she was doing very well.  She has a particular diagnosis which is rare, genetic and so on, but she was doing well.  Then the HSE reconfigured its delivery of services and it went from that agency back into the HSE and Ellie lost 75% of the services that were improving her lot in life.  Her mother was told that she should reassess her expectations of what Ellie can achieve.  She said: "If we get her to a place where she can creep and perhaps shuffle around on her bum, then I should celebrate this and be happy with that."  That is from a letter that parent sent to your office, to mine and to others.  I looked at it and I found what the mother was saying was absolutely true.  I raised it last night with two Ministers in the Department of Health at a meeting.  I cannot fathom why services that were working - that is not the only one and I have lots of correspondence here to do with the disability sector - when they are changed would result in that young person losing out to that extent.  I am saying this to you in the context of the Cabinet sub-committee on disability.</p> <p>  There is another case where the young chap has been 28 months lying on a couch.  I do not expect you to know anything about this.  I am just giving you the general thrust of what is happening out there.  The allocation from the HSE is &euro;54,000 for the services that he requires.  He is a child with autism who has not been in school and has not received any supports whatsoever for his condition, and there is no intervention.  When I inquire as to why it has stopped and why the parents are put under such pressure, I do not get an answer.  That is the difficulty.  I am presenting this to you to explain things from my end.</p> <p>  Likewise, a family in Glanmire, County Cork do not have services for their child.  I cannot understand given the amount that is being spent, that services are in such a state of almost collapse.  It concerns me.  This young man, Joey, is receiving services from Praxis, a company, I understand, being paid for by the Department.  The services were closed in Douglas and they were moved to Monahan Road in Cork.  Praxis has refused to pay for the transport of that young person to the services.  As some of these services are transferred from the private sector to the HSE, people who require them are just not getting them.  It is difficult to explain to those parents why that is happening.</p> <p>  When I listened to both Ministers last evening, I was struck by the level of bureaucracy that prevents them from delivering the funding effectively to the end user.  I am wondering, in terms of the sub-committee, whether that the type of issue that is discussed.  I do not expect you to deal with individual cases but you are aware of all of this.  When can people expect that there will be a response?</p></speech>

That is my point.  That is wrong.  No professional should say it and no official should say it because they never know the potential of a child.  Parents know best, not professionals.  I do not decry professionals.  Sometimes even the best of professionals should listen, listen and listen.  They should listen to the patient and listen to the parent.  That can be soul-destroying and devastating to a parent and that is not acceptable.</p> <p>  We did decide policy-wise to move disability from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and to have a specific Minister for disability, the reason being to try and give it more focused attention because the stories you articulated have been experienced by many of us.  I am impatient with this in terms of a more direct link between funding and action.</p> <p>  I would argue - not everyone might agree - it is much better in the Department of Education.  At least when funding is allocated for SNAs, they will be allocated to schools.  It is similar with psychologists, through the National Educational Psychological Service, although people may argue about the capacity, etc.</p> <p>  The Department of Health has an overly bureaucratic system.  We must work on that relationship between the HSE and the Department, and link it to the Cabinet committee.  That is work that the Cabinet committee has to do.  The challenges of Covid have not helped in the transfer of responsibility for disability from the Department of Health over to the new Department.  That is key.</p><p>On the relationship between education and health, the Progressing Disability Services programme has been going on quite a long time and, as I have said before, we have argued that existing services and multidisciplinary services in schools should be retained, particularly in special schools.  Notwithstanding Progressing Disability, we need to look at what more we can do within the school environment.  From what I can see, we can get a lot more done through schooling than we can through health services at the moment, so long is the entire journey for parents and children.  There is a lot of good work being done also, and we must acknowledge that.</p></speech>

The Cork Enable Ireland centre has been a tremendous success in Curraheen.  That came out of Progressing Disability and it is an excellent service. Provision in general, however, is too patchy.  We have evolved a non-governmental organisation provision, with various charities, that in the past has provided services when the State was not providing services.  In some instances, the State is always negotiating with agencies and negotiating with service providers, and this tug-of-war that goes on is not productive or constructive.  For example, when we were trying to set up classes or schools for children with autism, some service providers might have said they did not want any more, that they had enough, and that they were not going to facilitate an expansion.  That is going to have to change and the State is going to have to become more involved in providing services directly.  I take the point, however, that it should not be done at the expense of other services.  If the child already has an existing service, he or she should retain that service.  If somebody wants to create a new service, there are many other children who will avail of the new service.  The quality of service should not be diluted.</p></speech>

My point to the Taoiseach is that we cannot let time go by for these children.  It is simply wrong.  They are progressing, then there is a lack of service or a hiccup with the service or whatever it might be, and they just go backwards.  It is having a devastating effect on families.  Some of these families are on the verge of separating because they cannot manage it any more in their lives.  It is not that the HSE is not getting the money.  In these cases the HSE actually has the money.</p></speech>

There must be an integrated single pathway for children and the provision of services.  On the aids and appliances, some areas are now simplifying.  No child should have to wait four years.  The funding is there to make sure the child should get such a specialist bed.  I remember in the southern area when there was rationing when five children would be done this month, for example, and then another five children would have to wait another three months for the next quarterly meeting or something like to be allocated.  That is not good enough.  The money is there.  I believe that legacy funding needs in some organisations has, again, been picked up on by us in the context of provision.  The reconfiguration of the HSE has to deliver.  Work is going to be done there with reconfiguring the HSE but it simply has to deliver multidisciplinary teams.  Every child needs multidisciplinary input.</p></speech>

I am not sure which page it will be in the Taoiseach's Estimates, but he referred to the number of staff in the Department.  There are two blocks of information where it describes the number and type of staff in the Department.  At the end - and there may be information missing - it says the remainder of staff includes service staff and those assigned to the private office, the constituency office and the internal information and records management unit.  No figure is given for that.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give the committee that figure.  If he does not have it to hand, perhaps he will send it on to the committee.</p></speech>

In light of the number of different cases I have read about, does the Taoiseach believe those offices are appropriately funded in the context of the number of cases they have and given the most recent decision not to prosecute in the Grace case?  Is that the end of it?  Is there a learning from that as to how the case was brought forward, or from the information or evidence?  What causes something like that not to proceed given the huge context of Grace and the 47 other people?  The Taoiseach will also be aware of the Shane O'Farrell case.  Lucia O'Farrell had a lot of criticism of how that family was treated.  In learning from that, what sort of reforms does the Taoiseach believe might be necessary in those offices?</p></speech>

It has gone up 12% for the director and her staff, and it provides for the recruitment of extra staff to deal with the increased workload in the office and for the payment of increases arising from the Building Momentum public service pay agreement.  The DPP's office will always be looking for additional resources, and I believe there was a need for additional resources.  We provided those this year and we will keep it under review.  It is a fundamental office.</p> <p>  The DPP's office is independent in the conduct of its work.  To be fair, I know the Chairman has been a very strong advocate in the Grace case and in the Shane O'Farrell case.  I cannot comment on that and I do not know the context of the inner workings for what leads the Director of Public Prosecutions to make a decision on whether particular cases are to be prosecuted.  That is beyond my remit.  It is an independent office.  It has to be independent in how it does its work.  It has been a long-standing principle that we do not interfere with the Office of the DPP.  Most democracies maintain that divide.</p></speech>

Within every organisation, there should be robust systems.  If a whistle blows or someone has an issue or a serious complaint, that person should be dealt with properly within the organisation and there should be an appeals mechanism to deal with that quickly and expeditiously.  This does not seem to be happening in the State, however, and we end up with a lot of cases that are brought to the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  There was a particular case raised today by a Deputy with regard to the Irish Prison Service.  I was not familiar with the individual case but the very fact it is being raised in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is telling me something about the systems we have in place in organisations.</p><p>The Women of Honour and other groups I have met have been clear: they all agree on the need for change.  Some believe in what the Government has been doing, namely, facilitating an independent review, without ruling out a statutory inquiry.  Others want a statutory inquiry.  All are clear that the minute they reported sexual assault against them, that was the end of their careers.  That is what they said to us.  That is the terrible reality of what happened to women in the Defence Forces over the years.  It indicates that something is not working.  A statutory commission of inquiry will not provide early closure or resolution in respect of the issues.</p></speech>

It then escalates into some sort of a demand for a commission or a State investigation.  There are so many agencies and Departments that if they were actually told to engage and sort out the cases, they might not get as far as they do.  My point about Shane O'Farrell and Grace is that there was no explanation and there is no method by means of which these offices can give an understanding to people who are close to the cases as to why, generally, they did not proceed.  The State needs to learn from that and from what people such as Lucia O'Farrell have articulated about the justice system in general.  The investigation might not get to the end of everything but surely there is a way of dealing with human beings in a different way from how they are being dealt with now and thus preventing further demands of one kind of another for investigations and allowing people to go on with their lives.</p></speech>

The O'Malley report in respect of domestic violence and Supporting a Victim's Journey speak to that in the context of the journey of a victim of sexual or domestic abuse.  They address how the criminal justice system liaises with and works with the person.  If the Chair saw the programme earlier in the week, he will know that the victims spoke about the criminal justice system not serving their needs in some instances and the pressure that they came under.  I will check that out with some people.  The Chair is saying that if something does not progress, the families should be told.  Garda&iacute; are much better at liaising with families in the context of crimes and what is happening.  Strong liaison work is being done by garda&iacute; for the victims of serious crimes.</p></speech>

It is taking into account the facts established in phase one of its work.  Phase 2 will commence following consideration of the phase 1 final report.  The Chair probably knows this from the commission's written statement and the scope of its further investigation.  Many lessons have to be learned from the Grace case.  Notwithstanding the Chair's concerns about the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions has not initiated prosecution proceedings, there will be engagement with the relevant organisations and care providers to discuss those families.

When an agency under the Taoiseach's remit found out that a senior person was autistic and suffered from epilepsy, that person's employment was to be terminated.  The Minister did not allow that to happen, but the matter is being fought before the courts.  This goes back to the Revised Estimate.  The family does not want to be in court.  The agency apparently sees it as the only route and will not use mediation.</p></speech>

It never even knew that he might have been affected by autism or epilepsy, but when it found out, it wanted to fire him.  The matter has ended up in court.

If someone is appointed to a board, as in this case, where there is a representative of the Taoiseach's office on the board, is there a reporting mechanism within the Department that nominated a person to alert the Taoiseach to something that might be wrong with governance or an issue such as this?</p></speech>

I know that when people are appointed to certain boards, their legal duty is to the board, which may prohibit them from reporting to individuals about matters relating to the board, governance and so on.  That is problematic for public officials on boards because their ultimate loyalty should be to public service.  Nonetheless, if a public servant is on a board, the nature of the board means that the person has to behave properly in the context of that board.  I do not know the specifics of this case.  Some opportunities would arise for people to alert me about certain issues.</p></speech>

I will give the Taoiseach the details.  I will not dwell on it now.  I have a question on the Cabinet sub-committee on enterprise.  Does the Taoiseach envisage any change regarding employers being allowed to bring in truck drivers or mechanics from other EU countries or beyond?  One cannot get truck drivers, bus drivers or mechanics.  Employers have come to me in the south east to ask if someone can change the regime so that if people are found, they can be fast-tracked in.  I was struck by the preparations for the Irish Open.  The applications for chefs are waiting to be cleared in the Department.  I would have thought that for major events such as that or indeed major bus companies or hauliers that there would be some method of fast-tracking applications to bring in people from outside the country to fill the vacancies that cannot be filled here.  This is a significant problem.</p></speech>

There is a significant issue with vacancies and the difficulty in attracting workers for a whole range of sectors, especially hospitality, truckers in the haulage industry, and construction, although the capacity for construction is back to where it was before the pandemic, which is a good story.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been apprised of the fact.  We have engaged with the Department to accelerate work permits and visas for people living outside the European Union area.  It needs to be kept under constant review.  I know that, in respect of foreign direct investment, there has been a long-standing arrangement to try to accelerate critical companies' capacity to bring in non-EU or non-EEA workers.  Given the level that the economy, employment and resulting vacancies are at, there is a need to accelerate and to review our existing practices with regard to attracting workers from non-EU countries.</p></speech>

Everything possible is being done to speed it up.  Representatives of many of the sectors have told us they cannot get workers.  One issue with hospitality related to the income thresholds that existed for work permits.  In the interim, we will have to examine that because hospitality has taken a significant hit as a result of Covid-19.  We will need to come up with a medium-term plan for hospitality arising out of Covid-19, and that speaks to the issue of skills and talent.  To be fair to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Minister of State at his Department, Deputy Niall Collins, much work is being done in that regard to expand the field of apprenticeships and develop a range of skilled courses to get people trained up.  As I said earlier, 2.5 million people are now in employment.  When we produced the economic recovery plan more than a year ago, we thought it would take us until 2023 to get to that figure, yet we are almost there.   There is an issue there.</p></speech>

As part of the programme for Government, &euro;3.5 million is required, between the two schemes, to move them forward to the next phase.

Similarly, ours was one of the most successful vaccination programmes globally.  The booster campaign, too, was vital in dealing with the Omicron variant.  I think we have placed sixth in the European Union in terms of lowest mortality rates.  As for the economic recovery and employment, there has been a very significant bounce-back, which means the economic interventions the Government made during the pandemic worked.  They have got people back to work quickly as we have emerged from the pandemic.  Even so, there are all sorts of issues arising as we bounce back from the pandemic in regard to inflation, which is a big issue.  Fundamentally, however, we are back to 2.5 million in employment, which underpins the success of our economic and employment policies.  The Bloomberg resilience metric, which measures a range of factors such as health, mortality and socioeconomic impact, for quite a while was ranking us as number one.  Nevertheless, there are lessons to be learned and we will have to conduct a proper evaluation of the response.</p></speech>

I accept that the fuel issue and the potential unrest in eastern Europe have had an impact.  Is there any other way the Government can intervene with a view to lightening the burden of inflation that now presents itself and at least trying to ensure the trend will not continue?</p><p>My next question relates to Brexit, the Northern Ireland protocol and the suspension of the Northern Irish Assembly.  To what extent can the Taoiseach advance the cause of dialogue and, perhaps, the shared island initiative while only the barest of political institutions are operating in the North?  Does it present an opportunity to progress that area?</p><p>The Chairman made a point about women serving in the Defence Forces.  My theory has always been that a duty of care applies within the body where an alleged offence occurs.  Are the frameworks that are in place robust enough to deal with such matters as and when they arise?</p><p>My final question relates to due process.  As we know, there was a case where public perception found against Members of the Oireachtas and private citizens who were employed elsewhere.  By virtue of the public perception and the presumption of guilt, several of them ended up losing their jobs.  The event was not a small thing and people will argue that is politics for you, but they were not all politicians.  There was a difference of legal opinion and legal opinion was sought.  As we know, every legal opinion is subject to challenge.  Nevertheless, is there a case for the need to ensure due process and natural justice will prevail, rather than proceeding to a summary execution, as it were, whether or not a <i>prima facie</i>case could be established before the ultimate taking place?</p></speech>

We are very conscious of the need for ongoing engagement with experts, particularly in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure best practice operates as it relates to all aspects of cybersecurity and information security.  In the Department of the Taoiseach, we have factored in a significant review of our security posture in our plans for 2022.</p><p>Overall, for operational and security reasons we are advised by the national centre not to disclose details of systems and processes that could in any way compromise information systems.</p><p> More generally, we do not want to assist any criminals.  It was clear to us following the cyber attack on the health service that there is a need for European solidarity.  It was interesting how countries such as Poland and the UK came to our assistance very quickly.  We will not do this on our own; European member states must share experience and knowledge and work together to combat cybersecurity problems, which will be a major threat in the future.  The attack had an enormous impact on the health service.  Considering the nature of the event, it could never be fully presented.  I paid tribute to all the senior officials in the HSE who worked for 24 hours a day to try to get the system back.  It took many weeks and months.  It affected the front-line clinicians, who could not get scans.  It was a very difficult time for all working in the HSE and the Department.  I was critical regarding systems but I must pay tribute to the staff in this case.  On top of Covid, the attack was the last straw for those on the ground and in the system.  That people had to work so hard to save the system had an impact on their health.  That is the truth, and that needs to be said too.  I thank the staff for the work they did.</p><p> On inflation, the Government has said it is going to have a package of measures.  Again, we must not fuel inflation inadvertently through our measures.  Oil and gas prices have increased exponentially globally.  The opening up of societies and the economic rebound across the world have meant an imbalance between the supply of products and demand, which is driving up inflation.  Quantitative easing in America and Europe has been unprecedented during this pandemic.  All of these factors combined are leading to inflationary spirals.  We can see this in respect of both fertiliser and microchips for cars.  It is manifesting itself in many ways, so we must now take measures to cushion the blow for affected people as best we can.</p><p> With regard to Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol, the shared-island dialogue is working.  Without prejudice to anyone&rsquo;s constitutional views or perspectives, it is reaching out.  The dialogues have been fantastic.  There have been well over 1,000 participants.  An All-Island Women&rsquo;s Forum has been established on foot of the dialogues.  An All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Network has been established as a result of them also.  Great research has been done by the National Economic and Social Council and the ESRI on various systems, including primary care systems, and on educational curriculums etc.  That is good and we will continue with that.</p><p> On the duty of care issue, I do not want to pre-empt the independent review, but my sense is that the review is important and not statutory because we need to safeguard serving and current members of the Defence Forces.  We need to be satisfied that the duty of care is applied now.  We cannot wait for a couple of years for a statutory inquiry that could take a long time.  It will not give us the reassurance we need that existing systems in the Defence Forces are robust enough and that the culture is right.  In that regard, the independent review led by the judge, human resources person and senior counsel is important.</p><p> Due process should always apply.  Reference was made to public representatives, judgments and so on.  Due process should always be allowed.  I take the point that the pressures on politics sometimes create a shortcut through due process.  As parliamentarians, we should guard against that.</p></speech>

Everybody has a right to due process and natural justice.  The ultimate decision, which is made in the courts, could be subject to appeal, but the point is that the axe has fallen and the decision has already been made.  Regardless of whether the individuals in the case to which we refer feel they had due process, they lost their jobs.  Therefore, it is a serious issue.  There is sometimes a tendency to say in the public arena that it is all about perception.  Of course, it is not all about perception; it is about substance.  Therefore, whatever we do, we need to ensure that we assume people have a right to their good name and to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty.  That is one of the basic tenets of our system.  However, maybe there are some lessons to be learned from these matters.  Would it not be a good idea to learn them?</p></speech>

We have one piece of housekeeping before we hear from the witnesses.  Are the draft minutes of our public meeting on Wednesday, 2 February 2022 agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Today's meeting will be split into two sessions to discuss issues relating to home care.  In the first session, the committee will engage with representatives of Age Action, the Care Alliance and Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI.  I welcome Ms Celine Clarke, head of advocacy and communications and Mr. Nat O'Connor, senior public affairs and policy specialist, Age Action; Ms Bereneice O'Rourke, director, and CEO of Communicare Healthcare; and Mr. Joseph Musgrave, CEO, HCCI; and from the Care Alliance, Ms Adrienne McAvinue, home care co-ordinator with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, and Ms Catherine Cox, a representative of the Home Care Coalition.</p> <p>  Before we hear the opening statements, I need to point out to our witnesses that there is uncertainty as to whether parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence if given from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  If, therefore, I direct them to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter, they must respect that direction. </p> <p>  I call Mr. Musgrave to make his opening remarks.  </p></speech>

HCCI is the representative body for the private home care sector in Ireland.  Our members, and their 10,000 carers, enable more than 20,000 people of all ages who need support to stay living in the comfort of their own homes.  We welcome this opportunity to speak on home care issues with a particular focus on the current recruitment crisis.  Our chairman, Jim Daly, a former Deputy and Minister of State, sends his apologies.  He cannot attend today&rsquo;s session due to a prior commitment in the European Parliament.  I am delighted to be joined by the director of HCCI, Bereneice O'Rourke, who has 17 years' experience in the industry.</p> <p>  Members of the committee, and the wider public, should be in no doubt that we are in the midst of the most acute recruitment crisis home care has experienced in its history.  In autumn 2021, the Government was quoting waiting lists for home care of 800 people.  As of the end December 2021, the national waiting list was in excess of 5,000 people.  This is an astonishing, and worrying, rate of growth.  We currently project that our members alone need to hire 3,000 additional home care workers in 2022 just to reach the goal of providing 24 million hours of home care.  This does not include the additional staff needed by the HSE and other home care colleagues.</p> <p>  What this means is that thousands of people with conditions ranging from dementia to post-fall rehabilitation must appeal to the kindness of friends or family to get them out of bed in the morning or suffer the indignity of asking for help to shower or use the bathroom.  For others, it means being forced to leave their home and local community and be admitted into a nursing home against their wishes.  This is the hard reality of a sector that, for too long, has not received the focus its workforce challenges require.  This Government has made clear, in the programme for Government and in public statements, that it supports a home first policy.  </p> <p>  We recognise that this Government and its predecessor have substantially increased funding for home care by a total of &euro;150 million since budget 2020.  While HCCI argued for this funding increase, we made clear that a workforce strategy would be needed to ensure our members could recruit enough home care workers to meet the projected increase in funded hours.  In response to the HSE winter plan for 2021-22, we issued a document with workable solutions to ease the recruitment crisis to members of this committee, the HSE and the Government.  That only the HSE and, indeed, some members of this committee engaged with HCCI, while the Government did not, is not good enough.  Ireland still lacks a national home care workforce strategy.  Most countries have a professional carer strategy and, indeed, the EU is currently developing its own care strategy.</p> <p>  HCCI gives credit to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Mary Butler, for announcing, at our annual conference in October last year, the creation of a cross-departmental workforce advisory group.  The group&rsquo;s composition, however, has not been published nor have its terms of reference.  In private meetings with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we have been told that action on items such as employment permits for home care workers will not be advanced until the advisory group produces at the very least interim recommendations.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, the group is welcome, and we recommend that it develops solutions in at least three key areas.  The first of these concerns recognition and career.  Front-line home care workers were the first line of defence keeping 50,000 home care clients safe from Covid-19 and preventing them going to hospital.  We very much welcome the confirmation that they will receive the &euro;1,000 bonus recently announced by the Government.  We would like to see the work of the advisory group supported by a public awareness campaign to boost the profile of the sector and explain how rewarding it can be to enable people to retain their independence to stay in their own homes.  We strongly believe that there should be a graded career structure in home care so that care workers can advance their careers and benefit from the rewards of taking on increased responsibilities that follow in other lines of work. </p> <p>  The second area where solutions are needed is in access to the sector.  There should be more training options for home care workers, with earn-as-you-learn models such as apprenticeships.  Currently, anyone interested in becoming a home care worker must either have two Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, 5 modules or be told to get into a classroom before they can start working.  This barrier to recruitment needs to change.  During the pandemic, when this same QQI 5 requirement was relaxed by the HSE, recruitment doubled.  Other countries, such as England and Australia, maintain high educational and training standards for their home care workers, but it is done on the job: there is no reason Ireland should not follow their example.  Indeed, HCCI has developed just such a model in concert with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, although this has not yet gained approval from the HSE.  We also believe carers from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, should be eligible for employment permits to work in the home care sector in the same way they can in hospitals and nursing homes.  We must also correct the absurdity that home care workers lose out on certain social welfare entitlements if they take on extra work.</p><p>For this cohort of workers, merely taking on one extra hour on a Wednesday to help someone get out of bed could cost them their medical card.</p><p> The third area is pay and conditions.  HCCI believes home care workers should be paid a minimum of the living wage and that this should be included as a condition of the next home care tender.  The workforce advisory group the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, announced should also consider how we can ensure home care workers are paid both travel expenses and travel time.  This will increase the cost of providing home care but it is the right thing to do.  As described in previous sessions before this committee, the reality is that the HSE sets the conditions of the market.  That carers do not receive payment for travel, except in rare circumstances, results from the current procurement practice.  </p><p> Exacerbating the crisis is the fact that Ireland is more than two decades behind other countries in developing a professional home care sector.  The statutory scheme for home care, which would offer a right to all those living in the State to access home care, was first due to come into force last year.  We are now expecting it will not be introduced until 2023.  It is HCCI&rsquo;s view that had the State been obliged, through a statutory scheme, to focus on home care then a clear recruitment strategy would have been developed alongside it.  </p><p> Members of the committee will be acutely aware of Ireland&rsquo;s aging demographic.  They will also be conscious of how severely the Covid-19 pandemic has affected those receiving care.  The pandemic should herald a sea change in how we provide support to these people and lead to the sort of far-reaching reform to our healthcare system as the financial crisis had on banking.  </p><p> Throughout the pandemic home proved, time and again, to be the safest place to provide care for those who need it.  During the last two years we never saw cases exceed 1% of our client base of 20,000.  That statistic reflects the hard work, adaptability and tremendous effort of home care workers, their office support staff and colleagues from across the HSE, and Government.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them for their dedication and collaboration. </p><p> While some delay in developing the scheme in light of Covid is understandable, the pandemic is a reason to accelerate work on the scheme rather than pause it.  Until recently, the team at the Department, the reform unit, has been understaffed and rotated through three principal officers in less than 12 months.  HCCI has confidence in the current team but it should be given every resource needed to ensure its work is completed by the end of this year.  In an unfortunate irony part of the reason for the delay in developing the scheme is the fact that three of the four pilot sites are struggling to recruit the needed home care workers to staff them.  </p><p> If we are to truly realise a home first vision, one where anyone who wishes can be cared for in the safety, comfort and familiar surroundings of their own home, then the workforce advisory group must move into action swiftly.  It should make interim recommendations by May at the latest, with final recommendations by July, which should give sufficient time to inform budget 2023.  Alongside this, the statutory scheme for home care cannot be any further delayed; committing to a definitive date for its introduction is critical. </p><p> We stand at a major intersection for home care in Ireland.  One route leads to further delays, inequities and acrimony.  This road will lead to the collapse of a home first vision and condemn thousands of citizens to be forced out of their own homes to receive care.  The other road, the one the Government purports to follow, is one where access to home care is made a statutory right early in 2023, where being a home care worker becomes a true profession worthy of the name, and where partners work in collaboration to solve the inevitable challenges that will arise.  HCCI and our members are ready and willing to do all we can to make this latter vision a reality. </p><p> Once again, I thank the members for this opportunity to appear before the committee and we look forward to answering their questions.</p></speech>

Age Action advocates for a society that enables all older people to participate and to live full, independent lives.  There is a growing consensus that the direction of policy must be to support people to age in place in their communities and to live in their own home with dignity and independence for as long as possible.</p> <p>  The issue of home supports was raised by many people responding to Age Action&rsquo;s pre-budget survey of their lived experience.  Many people told us they wanted to see more supports to allow them and their loved ones to live at home for longer and many said they did not want to be forced into a nursing home.  As one person said, what is needed is "...big movement on the expansion of home care.  This is critically important for older people who do not wish to be warehoused for the last years of their lives.  Older people need to be valued rather than be seen as a burden.".  As another person said: "The thousands of carers in Ireland should be more respected and rewarded, not taken for granted.&rdquo;  We need to place greater value on care in our society.  If we appreciate the value of care, we will also properly value care workers, paid and unpaid. </p> <p>  Regarding the long-term system in Ireland, the European Commission&rsquo;s country report highlights many of the problems the statutory home care system needs to overcome.  One major difficulty it identified is the lack of national data on the provision of care and on the need for care, including the volume of unmet care needs.  While it is important to develop training for and focus on investment in staff we also need a nationwide analysis of what exactly is needed in order that we can reimagine home care, not just patch up a system that is fundamentally not working for many people. </p> <p>  Another problem the European Commission report identified was the inequity between different HSE regions, where different levels of resources are available and different rules apply, for example, with respect to compensation for travel.  It also raised concern about the level of unregulated care activity, including informal employment within people&rsquo;s homes.  It also identified, bluntly, that "the challenges ... are huge in Ireland".  Specifically, the challenges it identified are to ensure "a quantitatively and qualitatively adequate ... [long-term care] workforce to meet the rising demand for ... [long-term care] and providing a choice and support for informal carers".  It specified the training infrastructure and degree of professional recognition of the value of the sector are low, there are low levels of training in the sector and there is a high level of informal work in the sector.  A number of barriers need to be overcome.</p> <p>  In October 2021, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, reported that waiting lists for home care were greatly reduced due to extra funding during Covid but that the HSE now faced difficulty in recruiting care workers.  We heard that in the earlier presentation and on the RT&Eacute; News this morning we heard that in the early years sector four out of every ten staff are actively seeking to leave the sector and nine out of ten cannot make ends meet on low pay and conditions.   Clearly, in terms of home care, this will be a problem as we move forward unless care jobs come with decent pay and conditions, commensurate with the significant value of care work, as well as the opportunities people need for training and career progression.  </p> <p>  It is also important as we build the home care standards and training, that the provisions of the International Labour Organization's Domestic Workers Convention 2011, which Ireland has ratified, and other labour conventions about migrant workers, be adhered to and built on to ensure decent working conditions and protections.  Given that Ireland, historically, has relied heavily on EU and non-EU workers in the social care field, there is a need to protect workers from exploitation, particularly in a situation where a person&rsquo;s right to remain in Ireland is tied to a single employer.  Equally, we should ensure any existing workers who are outside of the formal migration system have a pathway to full documentation. </p> <p>  The World Health Organization&rsquo;s Global Report on Ageism warns there is evidence of ageism in the provision of long-term care to older people, for example, in terms of controlling language, patronising patterns of communication or making unfounded assumptions about older person&rsquo;s preferences, sexuality or capabilities.  Standards for home care and staff training must ensure address these issues. </p> <p>   Services delivering home supports, whether voluntary, private or public, should all be explicitly brought under the scope of the public sector equality and human rights duty.  That, in turn, requires that staff are sufficiently trained to be able to prevent discrimination, including age discrimination, and to protect the human rights of those receiving services.  Similarly, staff need training to be able to work with the decision support service under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act&rsquo;s provisions.  There needs to be training and standards in order that staff can do that.</p> <p>  Most important, the recipients of home care should be included in the co-design of the specific service and type of support they wish to receive.  Services being delivered in people&rsquo;s homes should fit around those people&rsquo;s lifestyles and preferences and not force people to comply with a one-size-fits-all model imposed from outside.  This requires sophistication in how home supports are managed in order that staff are given the necessary permission to be flexible and responsive to people&rsquo;s needs.  At the end of the day, home care services should never lose sight of the fundamental goal of providing people with care so that they can live with dignity and independence as long as possible.  I look forward to members&rsquo; questions.</p></speech>

I would like to begin by reading the opening statement for Care Alliance on behalf of the executive director, Liam O'Sullivan:</p> <blockquote> 	I would like to thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend this morning...  Care Alliance&rsquo;s focus is on family carers and on supporting our member organisations and others to better support such families.  For many families, home care can be a key support in keeping people well at home.  <br /><br />Over three years on from our attendance at this very committee, progress in the area of home care regulation has been slow.  The ESRI&rsquo;s recent reports on topics are welcome, and we look forward to the imminent publication of its further report on the complex matter of the financing of home care.  <br /><br />Our research from a few years ago highlighted the lengthy waiting times that existed for accessing home care.  These lengthy waits continue today.  We also know that the demand is estimated to increase by between 70% and 126% by the end of this decade.<br /><br />Covid-19 has clearly impacted on home care provision, but it has also highlighted the invaluable role played by home care workers and the wider family carer community, in minimising vulnerable people&rsquo;s exposure to Covid-19.  This is to be applauded. </blockquote> <p>I will now move on to my own statement.  As I mentioned, I am a home care co-ordinator and I have been working with The Alzheimer Society of Ireland for the past 21 years.  Home care has the power to radically improve people's lives.  Our organisation welcomes this opportunity to speak to the committee about staffing issues affecting home care. <br/><br/>As we know, it is the preferred option of most people to continue living in their own homes for as long as possible, in a familiar environment linked to their communities.  Home care requires more resourcing in terms of time and investment in professional and personal staff development programmes.  Due to a low funding base, some organisations are unable to offer any non-essential learning and development opportunities to home care workers.  This impedes on their career progression and results in them leaving for better-funded agencies that can often offer these opportunities.  A standardised training package for carers across the board, with various levels of training, should be provided.<br/><br/>Home care is highly skilled, yet it is generally low-paid and undervalued work.  The additional skills and expertise required in delivering dementia-specific home care are simply not reflected in the remuneration.  There is a critical need to standardise home care rates of pay and benefits.  With respect, we have lost countless home care workers to the organisation that funds us, the HSE.  We train our teams and nurture them.  As a co-ordinator of home care service, it is so disappointing and frustrating when our team members leave for better terms and conditions that our funding simply does not allow us to offer.  <br/><br/>Our struggle to retain staff has a real impact on continuity of care.  Trust between people living with dementia and their families with their home care workers is essential.  High staff turnover does not facilitate that trust.  Home care work is most often undertaken by a person working alone.  There are risks involved in lone working, and home care workers miss camaraderie and social support from colleagues.  <br/><br/>Home care workers are not paid for travel time.  This challenge is increased in rural areas where more travel is required between home care recipients.  Similarly, many home care workers would like to work additional hours, but this is not possible with travel time. <br/><br/>In the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, we mitigate this by offering blocks of hours.  While it is a solution to the fractured nature of home care work, it is also quality care.  A block of hours gives the person with dementia a meaningful interaction and allows care to be person-centred and not simply task orientated or delivered in a rushed manner.  This also provides the family carer with a significant break, which is so important for their mental and physical health.  <br/><br/>To conclude today, I would like to speak about how we recognise and value home care workers.  We must consider how committee members, as policymakers, value home care workers.  If I were a bank manager or financial consultant looking after members' money, I would be handsomely rewarded.  Yet, if I were a carer looking after the most precious people in members' lives, I would be on a wage that is just above the minimum wage.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, we either value this work and its people or we do not.  In home care, our most valued commodity is our people.  We should stop talking about how we value them and instead show them. </p></speech>

It has a policy supporting home first, and has, to its credit, boosted funding.  However, it has not explained or set out how we can hire the necessary staff, which includes many of the points raised by other contributors here around travel time and also qualifications, which I mentioned.</p> <p>  Our disappointment is that although the Government has a nexus cross-departmental working group, nothing has happened.  It has not met.  We have not been invited, other than to give a brief enumeration of issues.  We have not been invited to attend a session.  We have not been told its timeline.  We have been talking about this for 18 months to two years.  With the HSE, I get a sense of urgency.  I met with Ms Anne O'Connor and Ms Sandra Tuohy on Monday.  When the deputy head of the HSE is meeting me to talk about home care recruitment, I get a sense that the HSE understands the depth of the problem.</p></speech>

We have both asked the Department to engage with us to help us on everything, such as apprenticeships, qualifications and engaging around expanding the tender to include things such as travel time.  The HSE cannot unilaterally decide to change the procurement practices.  It has to get sign-off from Government because extra money will have to be found in order to fund increased pay and conditions.</p></speech>

While I work for Family Carers Ireland, I am representing the Home Care Coalition today.  The Home Care Coalition is a group of more than 20 charities, not-for-profit organisations and campaigners that was established with the aim of ensuring the implementation of an adequately resourced, person-centred statutory home care scheme in Ireland, with equality of access and availability across the State regardless of age or condition.  Care should be based on need rather than means.</p> <p>  Members of the Home Care Coalition have identified a number of challenges regarding home care, which I will outline.  We are looking specifically at recruitment and retention.  To begin with, we believe an urgent review is required to provide a balance between State, NGO and private sector providers.  This would mean an equality of approach to the pay and terms and conditions of employment for home care workers.  The constant transfer of the NGO home care workforce to the HSE is a critical factor for the retention of staff because of this inequality of terms and conditions between the State and the NGO sector, in particular with regard to pay for travel.  This is a primary obstacle in recruiting people and also retaining them within the home care sector.</p> <p>  Staff in the NGO sector can only be offered low-hour contracts due to organisations not having certainty over the number of hours they are required to deliver by the HSE.  This in turn leads to lack of job and income security and significant challenges for home care workers and individuals applying for loans and mortgages.  This uncertainty also impacts on organisations' ability to adhere to the Employment Act 2018, which enables part-time employee to request their employer to place them on a particular band of working hours.  Additionally, if a home care worker is issued with a banded hours contract and the client goes into hospital or long-term care, the provider must shoulder the financial burden by paying for these hours to ensure compliance with the banded hours.  Home care workers do not receive payment for missed hours if a client goes into hospital.  This means they are not guaranteed payment if they are not on these banded hours.</p> <p>  Many home care workers work part time on short-hour contracts, with some in receipt of welfare and other benefits such as the medical card.  Government Departments need to take this into account and acknowledge the impact that increased working hours could have on a lower paid sector and employment.  An issue that is particularly relevant is that under social protection rules for jobseeker's benefit, casual workers can currently work three days or less in order to receive jobseeker's part payment for the days they have not worked.  In plain terms, a person can work three full days, which is 22.5 hours, and still get jobseeker's benefit for the other two days.  Where a home carer works only one hour per day for five days or even two hours per day, which would be ten hours per week, he or she cannot get jobseeker's benefit because the payment is based on the three-day rule rather than hours.</p> <p>  The coalition believes that workforce planning measures must be established to ensure the workforce has enough skilled staff to support the demand for home care, with particular consideration needed in the areas of dementia and palliative care.  We need to clarify the different skill levels within the home care workforce and identify training and education requirements for each of these levels.</p> <p>  The pandemic has meant there is a much smaller workforce to draw from.  People in Ireland have been supported to work from home during the pandemic.  This was not an option for home care workers.  They served on the front line of the Covid 19 pandemic, supporting people who were receiving care and their family carers through times of immense pressure, frustration and stress.  Like many front-line workers, burnout is common and the pandemic had impacted on home care staff in a very personal way.  Home care organisations have learned that a personal response is important to support their staff through this, and to reflect incidents so that all in the organisation have an opportunity to input and learn from them and maintain quality care provision.  Further time and investment are needed for similar initiatives.</p> <p>  The issues I have outlined, as well as many others, such as the non-payment of travel and mileage by the HSE when outsourcing home care hours and the issue of work permits for non-EEA workers in the home care sector, present significant challenges that are impacting on the lives of people receiving care, their family carers and home care workers in the sector.  The Home Care Coalition is calling or a clear plan of action that addresses these key issues, particularly around recruitment and retention of staff and also training and development of our home care workers.</p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the recruitment crisis in the home care sector.  Many of the issues raised by all of the groups are common and may of the solutions proposed are similar.  I cannot ask questions of every group.  Unfortunately, each member has a strict time limit of five minutes.  I hope we will reach all the witnesses in the questions asked by all the members of the committee.</p> <p>  I will start with Mr. Musgrave and refer to some of the points he made in his opening statement, which I believe we would all agree with.  The first point was that home care is in the midst of the most acute recruitment crisis it has experienced in the history of the State.  Mr. Musgrave also spoke about the need to hire 3,000 additional home care workers in 2022 just to stand still and provide the current level of 24 million hours of home care.  This is before we look at any additionality in the years ahead.  That is the additional workforce needed.  Mr. Musgrave also spoke of the need for a national home care workforce strategy.  Other groups called for something similar and, again, I agree with them.</p> <p>  One paragraph of Mr. Musgrave's opening statement is important.  He rightly gave credit to the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, for announcing the establishment of a cross-departmental workforce advisory group.  I will ask a number of questions based on Mr. Musgrave's opening statement and the opening statements of the other groups.  Will the advisory group that has been established look at graded career structure?</p></speech>

This matter has been highlighted by HCCI.  We will have representatives of trade unions before us later.  They and other groups are seeking changes to the complicated centralised system that they say is failing and does not work.  Again, I imagine Mr. Musgrave's answer is that he does not know if the advisory group will look at recruitment.</p></speech>

We are in the middle of a crisis.  The Government provided additional money that we all supported to provide additional home help hours.  Budget 2021 provided for 5 million hours.  Obviously, Covid had an impact on delivering some of those hours, but so too did the lack of staff.  That recruitment crisis is one of the reasons we cannot deliver the level of home care we need.</p> <p>  Through the Chairman, I make the point that the committee needs to write to the HSE and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to get answers to these questions.  Is the working group formally up and running?  What is the composition of the group?  Does it have terms of reference?  Can those terms of reference be provided to the committee?  To what timeframes is the group working?  When will we see progress?  It strikes me there is an urgency coming from our guests today and from the committee.  We have agreed to shine a spotlight on this issue because of the work our guests have done, their lobbying and the correspondence we have received from their groups.  We are here to get answers to these questions.  Our time is limited.  I will leave it at that because we will also have an opportunity to contribute in the second session.  The best thing the committee could achieve today is to find out what that group is doing, how urgently it will report back and what are its terms of reference.  If the terms of reference are not right, we will not solve many of the problems that have been identified.  I apologise for not being able to put questions to the other groups; it is due to the very strict time limit we have.</p></speech>

A member of my family was in receipt of private sector family home care and that care was second to none.  The employees were an absolute credit to the provider.  I wish to put that on record.</p> <p>  I am told the HSE pays, on average, &euro;30 to &euro;32 per hour to the private companies.  I ask our guests from HCCI to provide a breakdown of the costs of the private companies.  We know they pay considerably less per hour to employees than the HSE does.  They pay between &euro;10.50 and &euro;12.50 per hour, whereas the HSE pays, on average, &euro;16 per hour.  What is the breakdown of the costs differential?  Let us take the lower end of it, that is, &euro;30 per hour, and the higher end of the payment, that is, &euro;12.50 per hour.  That is almost &euro;18 of a difference.  The costs of HCCI providers are 75% more than what the employee is getting.  What are their costs?</p></speech>

It is a 1:1 ratio.  By that, I mean the HSE pays between &euro;16 and &euro;17 an hour, let us say, to its employees, but it costs it the same amount to deliver the care, so the total cost to the HSE of delivering care itself is approximately &euro;36 to &euro;40 an hour.  It is a similar cost in the private sector.  By that, I mean the average wage among HCCI members is approximately &euro;12.80 and it costs approximately the same amount again to deliver the care.  There are insurance costs and back office support staff - Ms O'Rourke may be able to address that if we have time.  It is insurance, training and recruitment costs, as well as the office staff who help to support the infrastructure to deliver care.  I can follow up with precise breakdowns to the Deputy by email if that would be helpful.</p></speech>

There is so much to get through.  The representatives of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland raised the issue of the low levels of training.  There is a specific aspect of that I wish to raise.  I am wondering what is being done about it because it came up at a meeting of another committee that I attended in respect of gender equality.  It is quite a significant issue.  Typically, I cannot find the reference in question.  It can be grouped under the heading of respect.  Is that a big piece of training across the sector?  I think it was actually Age Action that raised it.  Is it a big piece?  The written submission provided by Age Action refers to a warning from the World Health Organization, WHO, that:</p> <blockquote> 	there is evidence of ageism in the provision of long-term care to older people, for example in terms of controlling language, patronizing patterns of communication or making unfounded assumptions about older person&rsquo;s preferences, sexuality or capabilities.  Standards for home care, and staff training, must ensure address these issues. </blockquote> <p>Obviously, that feeds into our guests' observations on the overall need for a national framework in respect of that.  What steps do HCCI members, as private organisations, take to address those kinds of issues in training in order to neutralise prejudices and ensure home care workers act respectfully in all cases?</p></speech>

I am representative of many of HCCI members across the country.  My organisation has been in business for 17 years.  In fact, we were one of the founding members of the HCCI and have been calling for regulation since day one.  In the area of training and development, we put a large emphasis on respect and dignity in the workplace and for our clients.  Obviously, our clients are at the centre of everything we do.  We have regular training on the issues the Deputy mentioned.  That includes how one speaks to people, such as how one addresses a person of a certain age, for example.  We have many carers across the country from all over the world who come and work with us.  We have rural and urban offices, so are representative of that divide as well.  We have our own in-house academy, as do many HCCI members, and there is a significant emphasis on mental well-being for staff and clients.  We have regular reviews on that.  Supervision and mentoring are significant in the community.  We carry out regular visits to the home while staff are present to watch what the staff are saying to their elderly clients and to be respectful in that regard.</p></speech>

It only came up last year in the context of another issue.  It took me by surprise but it is actually quite obvious.  Particularly with older people, it can be a very private and personal thing because of the generation from which they come.</p></speech>

We try to match carers to suit the client.  The majority of our staff across the sector are female and aged over 40.  On the recruitment issues we have, I have never seen anything like it and I have been in the business a long time.  Even before the pandemic, trying to recruit male carers, for example, was a real struggle.  For the past two years in particular, most of my day is spent dealing with the issue of recruitment and how we are going to recruit staff.  We place a strong emphasis on that gender piece to ensure we recognise the personal nature of home care and the importance of respecting the client, whether male or female, and his or her preferences.  As all present are aware, the world has changed, and we have to move with that.  We have done so.  In fact, we brought in our own expert on gender equality to train up our supervisors who, in turn, do a lot of training on the ground with staff.</p></speech>

It surveyed 55,000 people around the world, including across Europe, and found age prejudice or age discrimination is very common and occurs in many different ways.  That is the root issue the training has to address.  As a society, there can be obvious age discrimination, but there is also an internalisation of age discrimination, where people are ageist towards themselves, if one likes, and reduce their own expectations of what they are allowed to do, particularly in a care environment.  As such, it is very important the care is designed to empower the person to live as independently as possible.  Quite a sophisticated level of training is needed.  Of course, the fast turnover of staff, as described by other witnesses, means it can be difficult to build up staff training.  One can inculcate those values among staff only to see the staff leave again.  It is a challenge as part of the training piece.</p></speech>

All their presentations have described very well the scale of the issues and the challenges in ensuring we have a fit-for-purpose care service to meet the needs of our ageing population in a dignified way and that we afford workers in the sector a viable, fulfilling and properly rewarded career.  We are very far from that at the moment.  Much important time has been lost on this.  There was an undertaking to introduce the statutory home care scheme but time is just ticking by on that.  It seems incredible that we have not got to the point of setting up the group to consider all of the many issues involved in this &mdash; the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group.  In response to a parliamentary question I submitted in December, the Minister of State said she hoped to set it up in early 2022 and that, in the meantime, she would be consulting for a month or so.  Have all the groups made submissions to the consultation?</p></speech>

I agree that we now need to have the Minister of State in to see about establishing that group and determine its terms of reference, because time is of the essence.</p> <p>  The critical point is the waiting list that exists.  All of us, as Deputies, know that the bar is set pretty high in respect of qualifying for home care.  There are currently 5,320 people who have been approved for home care but who are being denied it because of staff difficulties.  That is just intolerable.</p> <p>  I raised with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the question of work permits for people in this sector.  Effectively, he said there was not a skills shortage and that the problem was that the contracts of employment being offered are not sufficient to attract people into the sector.  It strikes me that there is a bit of passing the parcel here.  The contracts of employment are not attractive enough, yet the terms offered by the HSE do not allow for attractive contracts.  There seems to be no meeting of minds regarding the HSE and the needs of the sector.  Of course, the Government determines all that.</p> <p>  There is much talk about an apprenticeship model.  It is up to the commissioning Department to request places for an apprenticeship model.  There is now a lot of money available for apprenticeships but the HSE has not put in the requests yet.  Do the delegates all agree that we should operate on the basis of an apprenticeship model?</p></speech>

We have been involved in a level-6 apprenticeship and have been told by the HSE public health nurses that they have hesitations regarding employing that in the home care service.  We were part of the consortium.  Again, it is a bit like the point on passing the parcel regarding work permits in that we are getting the same thing regarding apprenticeships.  Everyone says it is a good idea but when we engage with people we are told this and that are not suitable.  It is quite frustrating.</p></speech>

It did work very well and was quite successful.  We would welcome the opportunity to engage with something like that.  However, there are some other issues that could be addressed.  One that I highlighted was the three-day rule.  That is a crucial one to address and change.  Somebody can work in a shop for 22.5 hours per week and get two days' jobseeker's benefit whereas-----</p></speech>

If there were a change to hours rather than days, it would improve the quality and continuity of care.  A home care worker could get somebody up every morning and support him or her in getting to bed every evening.  It is about better quality and continuity of home care as well as allowing the worker to get more hours.  It would be a win for everybody.  It could and should be changed.</p> <p>  The other aspect concerns non-EEA workers.  They can work in nursing homes but cannot work in the care sector.  They are being encouraged into nursing homes, sometimes for less pay, but they are doing it because they cannot work or get work in the home care sector.</p></speech>

There is a huge challenge concerning home care at the moment, and there always has been.  I was a home care worker for a long time before I was elected to the D&aacute;il, so I have an insight into the home care setting.  It is a very rewarding job but it can be very challenging in some cases.</p> <p>  I have some quickfire questions.  Regarding travel time and travel expenses, what is the additional cost to the provider?  Obviously, this would have a bearing on the worker.  What is the hourly rate the HSE gives to a private provider?</p></speech>

On the point on travel, it would be either half an hour's travel or one hour's travel.  Therefore, one could be talking about that same rate again for that hour.  It could be a considerable cost but, at the same time, the HSE is providing it for its workers, as we mentioned.  I would imagine it would work it out based on mileage rather than on the basis of an hourly cost.  It would depend on how far the person is travelling and how long it would take to travel.  Mr. Musgrave might answer from the perspective of the private sector.</p></speech>

Some 10% to 20% is delivered by the non-profit sector.  I am not sure of the exact figures right now.</p></speech>

They are not necessarily working for an agency at all, or even for a non-profit, meaning there is no regulation or supervision at that end of the spectrum regarding the employment relationship.</p><p>It is simply that a person has directly employed someone to work as a carer in the home.  If we are going to have a statutory home care system, which perhaps provides funding, how will it interact with the informal care that goes on to make sure it is regularised and regulated?</p></speech>

When there is a haemorrhaging of staff it is for a number of reasons, mainly to do with pay.  There are also other factors but pay can be a major factor.

The question is why staff, who are very motivated by the work they do and in a very responsible position, are leaving the sector.  It is usually down to pay and conditions.  The private sector has to look at this.  Otherwise staff will not be retained and we will have a perpetual situation with regard to keeping staff.</p></speech>

It would appear that co-ordination is urgently required on the provision of services.  In other words there is a multiplicity of organisations all providing services, whether they be public, private or not-for-profit.  There is a necessity for a co-ordinated approach.  Otherwise it becomes very unwieldy and I think it is unwieldy at present.  How do the witnesses respond to this suggestion?</p></speech>

She needs to be given the staff to have the co-ordination oversight in a national home support office.</p></speech>

A total of 22 organisations have come together on supporting the implementation of a statutory home care scheme for care in Ireland.  It is very much a co-ordinated approach.</p></speech>

How quickly can this be administered?  How quickly can the application be processed?  Who does the processing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Cox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#G02000"><p>It depends.  Home care packages come through the HSE.  In some cases the HSE may provide the care.  In other cases the care is contracted out to approved home care providers who have tendered for it.  Is it quick and swift?  Sometimes it is not.  It depends on whether the agencies or organisations can meet the demands.  For example, they will need to have staff in the area.  Given that we are speaking today about the lack of staff and recruitment it can be difficult to fill a care package very quickly.  If the first organisation the HSE goes to cannot do this, it moves on to another.  It is not as quick as it could or should be.  What is very important is that quality care is provided and that the organisation has staff who are properly trained and equipped to provide that level of care.  It is not perfect.  Perhaps Mr. Musgrave would like to respond on the private sector.</p></speech>

There needs to be a model to which everybody can operate.  That way the consumer is likely to be best served.  Travel time has been mentioned.  We politicians have our own way of assessing travel time because we do what we call clinics and the public call various other things.  Travel time is hugely important.  Reference was made to travel time of an hour between situations.  That is totally unacceptable.  We have to find a way to get around this.  That is an hour when patients' needs cannot be addressed.  Whatever happens, some means has to be found to address this down time and travel time.  Anything between 20 minutes and half an hour is the maximum that is tolerable to give a proper service.  Do any of the witnesses want to comment on this?</p></speech>

A top-up payment is given depending on how rural an area is.  I do not think we would always be able to eliminate an hour's travel in a rural location but we should be able to limit the amount of travel in urban locations by offering a small supplement to incentivise providers to keep the travel time low and to pay for it properly.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the various services to try to ensure that recruitment and retention are possible.  Is there a way to deal with the competition between the HSE and the care sector for employees?  I have mentioned co-ordination.  A co-ordinated effort should mean people do not bump each other in the course of seeking employment.  Some people could be forced out or put at a disadvantage.  To my mind a huge degree of co-ordination is necessary in this area if we are to provide a service.</p> <p>  The purpose of the exercise is to provide a quality service to the patients.  This is my issue with travel time.  It is down time and a way has to be found to narrow it down as much as possible and provide services where they are needed.</p></speech>

It is vital.  Weekend care has been a major issue.  The Chair has already dealt with a significant amount of the work.  The work advisory task force has to recognise that pay, conditions and expenses are not cutting the mustard.  I have had interactions with the Minister of State on this matter.  There have been a number of informal meetings but this group has to lay out what needs to be done.  In fairness, the Minister of State has spoken about the many alternatives, including offering tax breaks and allowing people who work in healthcare and who would be able to do this work to do it as a nixer.  We have to look at all the issues across the board in respect of visas and so on.</p><p> Something has come up to which I would like an answer.  It is the issue of weekend care and the expenses, including travel expenses.  There seem to be differences in payments between different community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  Mr. Musgrave is probably the most likely to have a significant amount of detail on this matter.  Could we get a layout of that issue and the associated difficulties?</p></speech>

We have records of four CHOs that commonly pay travel expenses, that is, mileage.  These are: CHO 2, Galway; CHO 4, Cork; CHO 5, Wexford-Waterford; and CHO 8, Laois-Offaly-Louth.  Of the nine CHOs in the country, only four have a record of consistently paying mileage.  In other CHOs, it is discretionary.  Our members tend to pay an additional supplement to workers to work on weekends and to work unsocial hours to incentivise them and to get as much care to people as possible.  The main impediment to continuing that level of service is a simple inability to recruit enough staff.  Every group has enumerated the issues we have had with that.</p></speech>

CHOs 2, 4 and 5 pay between &euro;3 and &euro;5 as a mileage supplement per home visit.  CHO 8 sometimes pays a flat rate of &euro;30 per day to healthcare workers.  Again, that is only in parts of the CHO 8 area.  It varies quite widely between the four CHOs that have a history of paying it.</p></speech>

That is why we are not able to retain people.  It is as simple as that.  Obviously, the contracts are not fit to do the business we need to have done.  We all welcome the fact this work advisory task force is now in place, but it has work to do.  I will ask each of the witnesses to tell us, as quickly as possible, what is the minimum we need to deliver for people, to create a sustainable system and, beyond that, to provide people with training and other things they need with regard to their work.  If I can be greedy, I will ask everyone to give their view.</p></speech>

We have carers who come to us for interview and who ask whether there is room for progression.  Without the training they need, there really is not and, because we are a charitable organisation, we do not have the funding base to offer non-essential training.  Pay and conditions need to be looked at.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Cox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#H00900"><p>To add to that, it is a matter of pay, conditions, the terms and conditions of employment and being able to offer guaranteed hours.  Mileage is a very significant issue.  There is no doubt about that.  To go back to the issue of non-EEA workers, if they could get work permits, it would certainly help.  There is no one solution.  Combined efforts are necessary.  Again, with regard to the three-day rule, if workers could do their five or ten hours over five days, that would help.  Given that I come from Family Carers Ireland, it is important for me to state that, as we said a few moments ago, this is about caring for people in their homes, maintaining their independence and dignity for as long as possible, working with their family carers, which they most often will have, and supporting them to continue caring safely for their loved ones.  Home help and those services provide a crucial support to allow that to happen.</p></speech>

We have had a number of reports on the difficulties we have and on how we are not addressing elder care as we need to.  We need to facilitate people who want to stay in their own homes.  If it is possible, I will ask Mr. Musgrave to come in on the wider issue of the contracts required.  I accept he is representing private care operators, which obviously intend to make a profit.  That is on the record.  There is no question about that.  However, it is still part of the system and is very much required at this time.</p></speech>

As an organisation within the sector, we call on the joint committee, Government and the HSE to work together on this.  We do not have all the answers.  We have come with recommendations we think are workable.  We need to work through them collaboratively.  As I have said, we have been in business for 17 years and have seen great change.  I have never seen a crisis in recruitment like we have now.  However, we do have solutions.  We want to make caring a protected profession like nursing and social care work.  We need to move on that fast.  There is a real opportunity here.  I am very hopeful we can make progress if we strip it back, look at what needs to be done, be practical about it and put value on the carer.  The client is at the centre of everything we do, but without the staff we have nothing.  We would welcome exploration of the recommendations we have made.  That echoes through all of the witness statements we have heard today.  There is opportunity here and it is good to see we are talking about these matters.</p></speech>

On the Covid payments, what is the attitude of members of the various organisations here to the fact they were not included in the Covid recognition payment?  Does that play into the lack of self-worth many of those members may feel?  We are all aware people were going into homes and did not know whether Covid was present.  Let us be honest about it; they were on the front line.  Is that lack of recognition another factor?</p></speech>

We employ up to 500 home care workers and, when the news hit, first there was joy, then there was disappointment and then there was sheer frustration.  Again, they felt home care workers were not being recognised for the work they do.  We fought for that payment to be paid to family carers as well.  They were not recognised or included either.  As front-line workers, home care workers were going into multiple homes.  They were up to their ears in personal protective equipment and doing very similar work to that being done in nursing homes and hospitals.</p><p>At first, they felt they were not included.  Now, we have been told they are included, but it has not been confirmed in full so some organisations are still querying it.</p></speech>

One significant issue for many families is the assessment of home care support needs.  We have not really touched on it this morning.  It is a big issue.  Families often come to us and ask how it works out.  Perhaps their loved one only needs an hour or half an hour of home care.  One complaint in previous years was there was a system-wide roll-out of a single assessment tool in the HSE.  There were concerns about various practitioners within the HSE being quite liberal with it in some areas.  Is the assessment tool working properly?  Is it State-wide?  Is it one of the outstanding issues?</p></speech>

We receive core funding.  I manage home care for south Dublin and we receive core funding.  I am inundated with phone calls from families about the tool that is used to determine whether someone with dementia and living at home can have a home care package.  The tool is used to determine people's ability to shower themselves or go to the bathroom themselves.  One could visit somebody in the morning who has dementia and that person could really need somebody in to help with all of those things, but by the afternoon, he or she is really looking for company.  It is determined based on whether people can go to the bathroom themselves or need assistance.  There is no room for allowing the primary carer time and much-needed respite.  I hear that home care packages of a maximum of 21 hours will be delivered, with an hour in the morning, an hour in the afternoon and an hour in the evening.</p> <p>  Much of the time, people would benefit much more from somebody coming in for a block of three hours to give primary carers respite.  For example, a couple of years ago, I went to visit the home of a 92-year-old man who was looking after his 86-year-old wife.  They had a home care package of 21 hours.  That man cried and said he had a home care package of 21 hours.  He asked for more to allow him time to go to do shopping on a Friday, collect their pensions and so on.  Those 21 hours did not allow that man to leave his home.  We need to look at how we deliver and how we assess people for hours of care.</p></speech>

Only one of those sites is currently in operation.  The single assessment tool is being trialled as part of those.  One of the two single assessment tool parts is not up and running because staff cannot be recruited to do it.  That should in theory solve the problem that is being talked about.  There would be a national tool for the first time, but it is still pending, in the pilot stage.</p></speech>

To elaborate on what Ms McAvinue said, 48% of spousal care involves people caring for their loved ones during every waking moment.  Some 54% struggle with mental health and 40% have physical health issues.  That has a significant impact on individuals.</p> <p>  Does anyone want to elaborate on the matter of hours?</p></speech>

How does somebody who needs care, who is in the middle of that discussion about what we deliver, feel about it?  It is desperately important those older people participate in the conversation about what they need.  It should not be done through digital means, since they cannot participate.  Some 65% of people over the age of 65 experience digital exclusion.  Most of what we do is done online.  They should be in charge of the determination of what they need.  At no point in our lives do we diminish ourselves such that we cannot determine what we need or participate in the conversation about our needs except when we are over the age of 65 and need care.  We fundamentally need to root out the ageism in our society, our processes and our institutional approaches to how we manage our ageing population in general.  Until we do that, we will not value care or the carer and we will not resolve the problem.</p></speech>

F&oacute;rsa represents more than 30,000 health workers working in hospitals, the community health system and residential and social care settings, as well as at the corporate centre of health service planning and delivery.  We represent workers in direct public service employment, such as the HSE and section 38 voluntary hospitals, as well as workers in section 39 agencies and the private sector.  Our members include health and social care professionals as well as clerical, administrative, management and technical staff.  We consider it one of the many strengths of this union that our members are central to the delivery of the full array of health and welfare services in Ireland.  F&oacute;rsa is unequivocally on record as being a strong supporter of the community health intervention and servicing model proposed by the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Indeed, F&oacute;rsa and our members played a pivotal role in the process that established community health networks.</p> <p>  I refer to the current landscape of home support services.  Home support services are currently delivered in a fragmented manner by the HSE directly, the not-for-profit sector and the for-profit sector.  A recent Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report entitled Demand for the Statutory Home Support Scheme, authored by Dr. Brendan Walsh and Dr. Se&aacute;n Lyons and published in March 2021, showed that in 2019, 65,346 people accessed home support services amounting to almost 24.7 million hours.</p> <p>  I am having some difficulty with my vision, so I will ask my colleague, Ms Keogh, to complete our opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.777" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Keogh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#K00300"><p>We will see how good my eyesight is.  I did not realise I would be delivering our opening statement.  Of the home support hours referred to by my colleague, more than 18 million hours were funded by the public purse, with the HSE providing access either through the direct provision of 8.2 million hours by HSE staff or by funding the purchase of hours from private for-profit providers.  It is noteworthy that HSE standards for the home support service only apply to services received either by or through the HSE.  Where home support hours are privately purchased, there are no similar standards.</p><p>This presents a real risk to both home support service workers and service users.  In a position paper entitled, Regulation of Homecare published, in December 2021, HIQA called for immediate reform, including the introduction of regulation, of Ireland&rsquo;s homecare services.  It is very clear that all commentators, including F&oacute;rsa, agree that there needs to be reform of the home support services in advance of the legislation to put home support services on a statutory footing, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and as set out in the current programme for Government, to ensure a modern, dynamic, fit-for-purpose, adequately funded and standardised service.  <br/><br/>F&oacute;rsa members carry out a number of key roles and functions in home support services.  Our home support resource managers, formerly home help co-ordinators, are responsible for the day-to-day delivery of home support services within primary care and social care.  Just over 100 home support resource managers manage the work of more than 5,000 directly employed healthcare support workers, which currently equates to approximately 10 million hours, as well as administering the complex home care package scheme.  F&oacute;rsa members working as health and social care professionals, including occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, dietitians, social workers, orthoptists and podiatrists, also form the majority of the multidisciplinary teams that are central to ensuring the evolving needs of home support service users are met. <br/><br/>When the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for 2021 provided for 5 million additional home support hours introducing additional capacity for long-term care avoidance and waiting list reduction, it fell on the shoulders of home support resource managers to incorporate these hours into an already overburdened system.  The lack of a standardised approach was highlighted by widely differing approaches taken by the nine different community health organisations, CHOs.  Some CHOs adopted the view that the increased budget was solely for the additional hours without any additional resources to support the administration of these hours.  Other CHOs could see that to ask a home support resource manager to appropriately and effectively maximise the benefit of these hours to the benefit of people on waiting lists meant ensuring ancillary supports were put in place. <br/><br/>Our members working on the front line in delivering this essential service have expressed to us their absolute frustration at the lack of investment in the service over the past 20 years and the effect this has had on recruitment and retention of staff as well as on waiting lists.  F&oacute;rsa has been highlighting to the HSE since 2018 the necessity for the introduction of a national IT system that will allow for the prompt payment of wages and travel time to the thousands of healthcare support workers who day in, day out are ensuring that people can stay in their homes for as long as possible.  It is not acceptable that five years later, the HSE is only in the planning stages of this system and that laborious time-consuming manual systems are still the norm.  When I counted five years, I was going &quot;2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022&quot; so I was not adding an extra year.  I was counting them as calendar years.  <br/><br/>The HSE has also established with unions and the Labour Court an ongoing commitment to the direct employment of home helps to maximum effect for those with the appropriate skill set.  This commitment can only be honoured if those tasked with managing, and those working in, the service are resourced properly.  Our members have also reported that they are often working with no clerical administrative support while they are carrying out a complex role with multiple demands.  Furthermore, they inform us that the<i>ad hoc</i>approach to recruitment and the inordinate time delay from job offer to start date is a key inhibitor to recruitment of healthcare support workers, particularly in such a competitive job market.  While direct employment with the HSE is seen as the gold standard in home care work compared to the terms and conditions offered by the private for-profit service providers, the delays in recruitment processes are a significant factor in the HSE&rsquo;s ability or otherwise to increase its capacity to meet the growing needs of the population and to upsize to be ready to meet increased demands that will follow the introduction of the statutory scheme.<br/><br/>The solutions to the problems I have set out are clear.  There needs to be a standardised approach across all CHOs to the provision of home support services.  There needs to be appropriate support structures in place both in terms of a dedicated clerical-administrative resource and a national IT system and there needs to be a streamlined recruitment system.  It is important to remember that a great debt of gratitude is owed to the workers in the home support services for their outstanding performance throughout the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.  Through their work, they were able to ensure that as many people as possible received care safely in their own homes at the height of the pandemic.  This made a crucial difference to the lives of the people to whom they provide the service and to the communities in which they live.  Once again, I thank the committee for its attention and time.  We will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I am here with my colleague, Ms Aideen Carberry.  SIPTU's health division represents 40,000 workers across private and public health organisations.  SIPTU has significant membership across the community home care health sector.  When looking at the strategic workforce challenges in front-line home care roles in home support, we must accept at the outset that each is delivered in very different environments with different levels of autonomy and responsibility.  Services are delivered through one-off direct HSE public services, voluntary not-for-profit services, which are also known as section 39 organisations, and private home care providers.  Organisations compete for home care hours via a tender process.</p> <p>  Our population demographic is getting older.  Over the next two decades the proportion of those aged over 65 will increase from 14% of the population to 22.4% and the ESRI predicts that the demand for home support services will rise by 48% in the years ahead.  The HSE national service plan for 2021 set a target of 24 million hours for home support services, an additional 5 million hours on the 2020 allocation. </p> <p>  The predominant role within the home care sector is that of health care support assistant, HCSA, formerly known as home help.  The HCSA reports to the home support co-ordinator or organiser.  He or she provides direct patient care to members of our community in the client&rsquo;s home environment.  With the continued roll-out of community-based services, the demand for this type of role will only increase.  The HCSA plays an integral role in the delivery of health services as without same, a larger percentage of our community would require inpatient hospital or nursing home care.  Our members were not found wanting during the Covid pandemic.  </p> <p>  When we discuss recruitment, we must first look at the different pay arrangements across the sector.  Within the direct HSE-run services,significant progress has been achieved for our members in recent years through a number of agreements involving the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, the Labour Court and HSE circulars.  The agreements provide for full access to contracts of employment, recognised travel time, superannuation and sick pay for our members.  The hourly rate now established for HSE HCSAs ranges from &euro;14.52 to &euro;18.72 per hour, which is the same as our healthcare assistants in hospital settings.</p> <p>  Staff terms and conditions of employment vary in section 39 organisations.  In many cases, pay was linked to the public services until 2008.  The HSE cut funding to these services arising from the economic crisis, which resulted in pay cuts being applied.  A WRC agreement in 2019 for section 39 organisations approved restoration of pay cuts over three phases.  A new ICTU-led campaign for further pay movement within the sector has launched as there remain differences in the terms versus those in the HSE.  There is limited, if any, access to paid sick leave, travel time, etc.  Section 39 providers have anecdotally cited difficulties with the HSE&rsquo;s tendering process.  They have cited being in competition with for-profit providers, which offer lesser terms and conditions of employment, and, therefore, lose out on tendered work as they cannot afford to offer the work for less than private providers.  They also have cited losing out on HSE tenders as being a rationale for not being able to afford to increase the terms and conditions of our members. </p> <p>  Staff working in private organisations are facing significant challenges with regard to their terms and conditions.  There are concerns around precarious contracts of employment.  Hourly rates start from just above minimum wages rates.  Staff have limited, if any, access to sick pay, maternity pay and pensions.  The private sector operates on a for-profit model.  Workers are not covered by any collective negotiating agreements.  In most cases, there is aggressive resistance to trade unions and workers trying to organise.  There is evidence to suggest that due to the lack of regulation of the sector, there is large-scale turnover of staff and lack of continuity of care to clients.  </p> <p>  It is evident that pay and conditions are mutually inclusive.  The development of quality jobs across the sector will result in better service, less attrition, user confidence and, ultimately, quality care.  The Sl&aacute;intecare principle of providing the right care at the right time in the right place will only be achieved when the front-line home care roles are recognised, developed, and paid appropriately.</p> <p>  Recruitment and retention of staff are paramount to the delivery of services.  Quality jobs provide quality care.  Despite significant progress, we continue to see challenges with recruitment of new HCSAs within the HSE.  This results in significant vacancies within the service.  The rosters are then filled by agency or private providers.  The staff working for the private providers are on reduced terms and hourly rates.  It is also evident that there are vacancies in the private and not-for-profit sectors due to high turnover and staff morale within the sector.  In recent years, the percentage of homecare provided by HSE is reducing with an increased dependence on private providers.</p><p>In some HSE CHO regions, the private provider will potentially be the dominant provider if current trends continue.  There is no logic to this from an employee perspective when one considers the terms and conditions outlined above.  Why would somebody apply for a role in the private sector first when a similar role is available in the public service with better terms?  It does not make sense that a private provider is able to recruit staff on lesser terms while the HSE has numerous vacancies across the regions.  Our members have identified vacancies in several regions throughout the country, as outlined in our written submission.<br/><br/>Information suggests that difficulties with the current recruitment model are resulting in vacancies across the HSE.  Recruitment is centralised and removed from the home support office.  Sometimes it is outsourced.  Issues highlighted include a lack of information on upcoming campaigns, delays in progressing campaigns, and unrealistic offers of employment, for example, roles not offered within local catchment areas or contracts offered on significantly reduced hours, such as ten hours.  A return of recruitment to local home support offices is required.  More home care management resources would assist and ensure localised recruitment campaigns can be progressed in a timely manner.  An increase in resources would also address issues raised regarding delays in implementing Workplace Relations Commission agreements, rosters and pay awards within HSE home support.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we would like consideration to be given to the following areas going forward.  The improved conditions of employment <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>public versus private facilities should ensure the HSE is in a better position to attract staff to provide home care services.  A renewed emphasis on HSE recruitment campaigns is required with local-county focus - wider national panels have not worked.  Continued investment in the roll-out of home care packages is needed in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and HSE service delivery plans with a focus on delivery of hours via direct HSE employees.  We are seeking the implementation of the roster element of the HCSA agreement.  This would provide stability to workers while also assisting in addressing some of the other issues raised.  Offers of permanent contracts of employment with guaranteed hours, including flexible family-friendly rosters are required, as the workforce is predominately female.  Progression of the HSE steering groups established under the WRC agreement is also requested.  Career progression options need to be considered to encourage retention through a career pathway for home care workers with ongoing supported training.  Increased funding for training is also required to ensure the availability of a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5 workforce to meet growing demands.  There needs to be more engagement with stakeholders on securing directly provided home care jobs for workers in tandem with the increased service plan funding provided to meet the growing demands.<br/><br/>Failure to deliver the key element of increased community services, as proposed under Sl&aacute;intecare, will have knock-on implications for the rest of the rest of the health system.  A clear commitment from Government to directly provide home care support is required.  A more focused emphasis on HSE recruitment of HCSA doctors should go some way to removing the race to the bottom in the tender process.  There should be a review of the current tendering process to determine actual costs.  It is estimated that the cost of providing private home care is equal to, if not greater than, the cost of HSE care despite the low wages applicable in the private sector.  We need to remove profit from the provision of home care.<br/><br/>We would welcome the establishment of a collective bargaining forum for staff in the private home care provider sector.  SIPTU remains available to engage with parties to ensure the full implementation of the above recommendations and conclusions.</p></speech>

We all have experience within our families of the important and valuable work home helps provide.  My first question is directed to Mr. Donnelly or Ms Keogh.  The need for a standardised approach across all CHO areas was mentioned.  Which CHO has the best model or approach?  Is that information available to them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#M00400"><p>I would not say there is any great CHO that has a great model.  Let us look at the way recruitment is done for an organisation the size of the HSE.  There is a recruitment hub in Manorhamilton that was part of decentralisation, which does great and fantastic work, but it only has the capacity to handle what needs to be done.  One cannot decide to strip Manorhamilton of that function because a different societal problem would be created, therefore, the hub needs to be there.  Our view is that CHO recruitment should migrate into the CHO regions.  That would leave the Manorhamilton facility to be a real recruitment hub for the non-CHO elements and each CHO would have an agile recruitment system that is capable of recruiting people more quickly and they would be more fit for purpose in each area.</p></speech>

As is the case in other jobs, such as teachers or cr&egrave;che workers, it is predominantly female staff who are working as home helps, although not exclusively female.  What needs to be done to attract more men into the profession?  We are dealing with trying to recruit a sufficient number of home helps from half the population effectively, although recruitment is obviously open to both sexes.  What can we do to encourage more men into the profession?</p></speech>

From the public sector perspective, the foundations have been laid with the establishment of terms and conditions of employment that finally recognise the role of the healthcare support assistant in the community.  For years, they were underpaid and undervalued.  Therefore, we welcome the developments within the HSE.  To build on that, where staff are established and loyal to the service, a career pathway that includes supervisory and additional manager positions would assist our colleagues in F&oacute;rsa in the delivery of the rosters they have been asked to manage.  It is the staff on the ground who know the service, know the geographical area and know the clients' needs.  With the incentive of a career pathway, they would be more inclined to stay within the service.</p></speech>

F&oacute;rsa has been working with the HSE to establish a deputy home help grade.  It is a new title.  The role was called home help co-ordinator.  Now it is called home support resource manager.  We have been looking to establish a deputy grade.  It would make sense that a career pathway is developed for people who know and work in the system and who will stay in the system.  At the mention of career pathways, people think that we are just talking about promotions, but it is not about that.  It is about capturing the knowledge in a service and making sure it is used to the betterment of the service.  We support SIPTU in seeking that career pathway.</p> <p>  On family-friendly working, Mr. Ginley's point is well made.  One of the key barriers for our managers who are involved in the recruitment process, in terms of the interviewing piece rather than the Manorhamilton piece, is not having sufficient hours to give appropriate contracts to people who would take the contracts up if they could balance them against their family commitments.  We ask the HSE to be agile.  Agility is what we need in this regard.  Many home support services are needed early in the morning and late in the evening, but people do not want split contracts.  The managers of the service and the workers need to have a system that reacts to the needs of service, the needs of the clients and the needs of the workforce.</p></speech>

Can they make the decision to work part-time hours?  I assume the system accommodates that because it would make perfect sense.</p></speech>

There is flexibility within the rosters at present to allow people to reduce their hours.  If adequate resources are not available, the ability of the HSE to provide the full range of service needed becomes challenging.  Therefore, we would arrive in a situation where hours are contracted out and that brings its own challenges.</p><p>What we are seeking is a fully resourced, direct labour home support service, and those flexibilities would be provided within that in greater arrangements.  The same arrangements apply in the private sector where people in some cases start on quite low hours and try to build their hours.  There is flexibility there, but the employees say it is less or more limited in the private environment.</p></speech>

We had many of the advocacy and representative groups before the committee earlier.  I am not sure if the witnesses heard their presentations and the issues they raised, but they were very similar to the issues both trade unions have raised.  Obviously, there is a consistency across what trade unions and the advocacy groups are seeking.  The representative of Home and Community Care Ireland said, "we are in the midst of the most acute recruitment crisis home care has experienced in its history".  Would the witnesses agree with that assessment?</p></speech>

There is a lot of common ground between the two unions here.  We have to value the work that home support workers do.  That is a key issue.  These roles were originally known as the home help co-ordinators and the home helps.  The key to part of this issue is the names we use to describe the work that was carried out.  It was seen as just a job in the parish where somebody went in and did a couple of hours, not as the major function of social care that it actually is.  That is part of the reason we are in this recruitment crisis.</p></speech>

He said that vacancies in the private and not-for-profit sectors are due to high turnover and staff morale within the sector.  Is it fair to say that there are problems in recruitment in both the public and private sectors and that the HSE is also struggling to recruit, and that this in turn, as well as the issues Mr. Ginley raised, is putting major pressures on both private providers and the sections 38 and 39 organisation providers in recruitment?  Is it a problem across the sector?</p></speech>

The genesis of our submission is to ask the Government to clarify exactly how it wishes home care to be provided.  We have finally established terms and conditions of employment for healthcare support assistants that give them an annual salary ranging from just under &euro;30,000 to just under &euro;40,000 per annum for full-time work.  They are finally being recognised.  Despite that, we are still hitting barriers from a recruitment point of view in the HSE.  In fairness to the HSE managers we are engaging with - for example, there was a recent meeting with CHO area 8 - there is acceptance that there has to be a localised approach to try to speed up recruitment because delays in the HSE magnify the situation.</p></speech>

The Government has to decide how home care is going to be provided in Ireland because it is the clients on the ground who are ultimately losing out.</p></speech>

In the CHO meetings that have been set up to deal with this issue we have called for a localised campaign.  To give a quick example, in the midlands-east region people are being offered opportunities, but they are being asked to travel into a different county to avail of those opportunities.  It is not practical based on the hours that home care workers are being offered.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for both unions.  The first relates to the level of representation they have in the home care sector.  How does the representation of public sector workers compare with that of the private sector?  The other relates to the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group being set up by the Minister.  Have the unions received an invitation to participate in that group apart from making a submission?  Our understanding is that the group is being put together at present.  Has either union been invited to attend?  Those are my opening questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.809" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damian Ginley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#N01900"><p>From the point of view of representation, we have significant levels of density in the public service and we have been able to use that and the ability and strength of workers uniting together to improve immensely the terms and conditions of employment there, as outlined in the submission.  In the section 39 organisations we have a limited, but fairly okay, level of density but we are challenged in respect of what we can do.  Ultimately, those organisations can only pass on what they get from a funding point of view.  That is the race to the bottom and the challenge associated with that.  In the private sector, it is much more challenging for the trade unions and our workers who would like to have a voice in that sector.  In our submission we have called for a collective bargaining negotiation forum to be established in that regard.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, I can double check but it is my understanding that we have not received a formal invitation to engage in any forum in respect of the advisory group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.810" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aideen Carberry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#N02000"><p>To add to my colleague's comments on the representation issue, it is important that the committee note that in the voluntary sector, in particular, which receives a great deal of public funding, we have received some resistance to collectively bargaining on behalf of workers in that area.  We have examples of particular employers that have not necessarily been willing to engage with the trade union on that part.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.811" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#N02100"><p>Could the representatives of F&oacute;rsa respond to those two questions?</p></speech>

No, we have not been invited, similar to what Mr. Ginley said, unless something has come in during very recent days.  We were asked for the submission, but that was it.  It is important to F&oacute;rsa that it would be invited to such a forum.  We have established good working set-ups now within the HSE where the people who are involved in the service are now finally getting to have an input into how current service delivery is planned.  However, and we have said this repeatedly to the HSE, it makes no sense to come back to the workers after one has designed the system.  It is necessary to talk to the workers when one is designing the system to make sure it is future-proofed and it starts off working well, rather than us pointing out the flaws after the event because nobody asked us.</p> <p>  With regard to representation, from a F&oacute;rsa perspective we represent the managers of the system, 99% of which are based in the public sector.  We would not have the issues that our colleagues, Mr. Ginley and Ms Carberry, reference.  It is key to remember as well that while much of the hours are provided by the for-profit sector, and we referred to this in our submission, that is still funded by the public purse.</p><p>Our home support resource managers co-ordinate both the 8 million direct hours and the 10 million purchased hours.  We referred to direct employment.  From F&oacute;rsa's perspective, direct employment is the way to go to ensure that this service is standardised and fit for purpose.</p></speech>

First, Mr. Ginley spoke about the distinction between the terms and conditions in the public sector and those in the private sector.  How is that determined?  Who determines the split between public and private?  Is it done on a county basis or across CHOs?  I sense that much more of the services, certainly in the greater Dublin area, are provided by the private sector.  What is the basis on which those decisions are taken?  Why does the HSE not provide more services in, say, the Dublin area?</p> <p>  My second point relates to the comments Mr. Ginley made on the WRC and Labour Court success SIPTU has had for public sector workers.  What would it take to extend those terms and conditions to the private sector?  Would it require a sectoral employment order, and is any progress being made in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.815" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damian Ginley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#O00300"><p>In response to the Deputy's first question, my understanding is that a lot of how home care packages are currently allocated and provided is based on the historical arrangement.  As she rightly said, many of these services are provided via the section 39 not-for-profit organisations.  We have experienced a significant challenge with that in the greater Dublin region.  My colleague, Ms Carberry, has vast experience there.  Section 39 organisations tender for work and the problem is that their experience is that they are tendering against organisations in the for-profit sector, which offer lesser terms and conditions again.  It has proven very hard for our members in the sector to make any inroads.  Ultimately, organisations say the level of funding will determine the rate of pay.  We have highlighted in our submission our concern that the public service agreement signed in 2010 commits clearly to the direct provision of labour to the greatest extent possible.  In that context we will ask the HSE to ensure that, now we have established HCSA terms and conditions that are respectable, based on the role and the level of responsibility, etc., we build on that.  If we do not, and if the private sector is not managed, staff will leave home support services, and that will have a knock-on implication for the wider health arrangements.  The whole principle of Sl&aacute;intecare, as the Deputy will be acutely aware, is about care in the community and at home.  If we do not deliver on that, it will end up hitting the hospitals, nursing homes, etc.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.816" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#O00400"><p>If I may add to that, we have discussed the section 39 providers previously in this room, probably in a different forum.  The answer there is to have a systemic funding model for section 39 providers.  We cannot keep going to the well when we have a few bob and then, when we are economically regressing, taking back those services.  All that does is create a bed of straw for what is an essential service.  As Mr. Ginley said, and as envisaged by Sl&aacute;intecare, this care should be a right of people and must be provided on a systemic basis.</p></speech>

That process is ongoing.  Ultimately, however, it will take a funding commitment from the Government for this to happen because there are significant differences in the rates of pay.</p></speech>

This is a very important matter.  It is a fact that 50% of home care hours now are publicly provided and probably more than 40% are from the private sector.  SIPTU's opening statement states that this trend is moving towards a model of private home care.  There is a huge downside to that in respect of pay and conditions.  I have just worked out that the mean hourly pay under the HCSA terms is probably &euro;16.50 while in the private sector it is &euro;12.50.  That is a considerable difference per hour.  A worker is paid probably &euro;4 extra, if not more, in the public sector.  Home care providers in the private sector get enormous amounts from the HSE to provide home care.  Obviously, they are for-profit organisations and make their profit from that difference while also putting pressure on the pay and conditions of their workers.  There is a reason workers are leaving the sector, particularly the private sector, and it is those pay and conditions.  There is also a retention issue in that regard.  There is no getting away from that, and it spills over into the public sector as well.</p> <p>  My main question is whether that is the case.  There is a worry about what we have seen in the nursing home sector.  Fifteen or 20 years ago, 80% of home care was provided by the State; now that share is 20% and the roles of the public sector and the private sector have reversed.  In the same way as has happened to the nursing home sector, could the private sector essentially take over the home care sector?  This should be a service for public good rather than profit.  The latter brings with it a downward pressure on workers' wages, which is a really bad thing.</p></speech>

Not alone is the hourly rate significantly less for our members in the private, for-profit provides, they do not have access to guaranteed hours, sick pay, a superannuation scheme, maternity pay in a lot of cases, etc.  It is, in our view, a race to the bottom in respect of terms and conditions of employment.  We would therefore be anxious that, given we now have established terms and conditions, the role and responsibility and the efforts of our workers in providing home care be recognised.  That is important.  We all have family members involved and have seen the benefits of this care.  There should not be a race to the bottom and it should not be a matter of securing hours based on how little the worker is paid.  The HSE, the Department of Health and the Government have now established these rates with us through the third-party machinery.  Our aim is to maximise those hours available to avoid the scenario to which the Deputy has alluded.</p></speech>

It could, but it would not if we all were to get on board the Sl&aacute;intecare bus; it is as simple as that.  It would be treated as a different type of citizen's right and would be delivered in that way.  In the nursing home sector it happened almost by degree and death by a thousand cuts because the for-profit organisations were lurking around looking for this type of business.  I do not mean to be disrespectful, but this is a profit-making industry, and we should not allow that to happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Keogh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#O01100"><p>I see a very real threat to the service at the moment, that is, the fact that the HSE is already unable to fulfil people's needs and giving 10 million hours a year to the private, for-profit sector.  As everyone has said, the difference between wages is the profit the private sector has to make.  If the HSE does not resource the sector properly with the willingness of the Government, Sl&aacute;intecare, the Department of Health and so on, we will see that happening.  One thing that worries me about nursing homes is that there were some obvious tax incentives that made the area a very lucrative one in which to invest for a long time.</p><p>This is why it is so important that this conversation is happening now.  We need to resource the sector properly through direct labour to ensure there is no opportunity for the private sector to tell an organisation that it is on a statutory footing, that it will provide statutory home care to every person in the country over 18 years of age now that such a right exists, and that people should not worry about getting it.  That is why we are so delighted to be here today to raise these issues.  It is vital that we move on this now.  I will again echo what Mr. Donnelly said.  Sl&aacute;intecare is the way forward.  That is our view.</p></speech>

How profitable is the home care industry?  I ask SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa to answer that question.</p></speech>

The number of providers is growing and competition is increasing.  There is obviously something of benefit to providers.  From our understanding, the cost of providing home care via the private sector to the State works out at a similar cost to providing it directly.  We then have to ask where is the difference going from the point of view of hourly rates, etc.</p></speech>

These services are not provided by profit-making organisations out of pure benevolence; it is a combination of providing a service out of benevolence and the fact they are ultimately in existence in order to make a profit.

I happen to be the director of a social enterprise.  We are not big on social enterprise in Ireland.  In Ireland we tend to associate enterprise with profit, but there are many people who are enterprising and would be interested in establishing businesses that are not for profit.  I have come across a very interesting organisation in my constituency in Tallaght which provides after-school care for children with special needs.  It is a social enterprise.  It is a halfway house between private care, which everybody thinks is for profit.  </p> <p>  According to the evidence we have heard in this committee, it costs around the same amount for private providers to provide home care as it does for the HSE to do so, if not less.  Have we ever considered the social enterprise model?  It would mean a service could be provided on a not-for-profit basis but people would be paid reasonable salaries and remunerated accordingly.</p></speech>

As per our submission, there is already quite a substantial voluntary sector providing home support.  However, that sector is not providing similar terms and conditions as our colleagues in the HSE have.  We addressed that somewhat in our submission.  Providers have cited the tendering process, whereby they are in competition with private providers, as creating a difficulty for them in terms of maintaining the terms and conditions of employment and the recruitment and retention of staff.</p></speech>

A PhD student in my constituency came to me recently with a very detailed and interesting questionnaire about our housing stock.  I thought it was about social housing stock, but it was about housing stock in a particular part of the constituency from the point of view of people being able to remain in their homes in the long term.  As we know, new home builds have completely different building regulations.  The survey included things like stair lifts, getting wheelchairs indoors and the fact the required width of houses built in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s is nothing like it is now.  The Government retrofit plan has been launched today.  There is a retro aspect to making houses livable, in particular older houses, and making it easier for carers to care for people, as opposed to houses having large steps which require ramps to be installed and so on.  It is something that the witnesses could make a very rich contribution to.  Housing is associated with the caring issue.  Do the witnesses have any views on that?</p></speech>

From our perspective, F&oacute;rsa has health and local government divisions.  We represent workers in local government.  We are aware that housing departments in local government provide grants to adapt houses for people as they get older or those with special needs.  The Deputy is correct in that a holistic approach to this has to happen.  One of the key factors to remaining in one's home is the ability to live, move around and be cared for in it.  We see the link between health and local government in terms of providing that service.</p></speech>

All of the witnesses who came before the committee today could offer something really valuable in terms of how the State could anticipate that in order to ensure it is possible for people to stay in their homes for as long as possible.  What is the experience of the witnesses of unregulated care activity, such as the informal care of people in their home?  Is it widespread?  What does the committee need to know about that?</p></speech>

I understand it is reducing in the context of the increasing number of regulations.  Carers are now being formally recognised from a terms and conditions point of view, which means the sector has become more formalised and structured.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about choice.  If people were coming to my home environment, I would like them to be paid appropriately, not to have to worry about things like sick pay and to have access to a pension scheme, maternity care, if needed, and guaranteed hours of employment in their contracts.  I know when such people come into my home they are committed to me and the organisation and are well settled and structured.  That is the choice I would like, from the point of view of a provider of home care.</p></speech>

Carers are predominantly female.  Depending on when shifts end, in a 24-hour shift divided between people, a young woman could leave a house in a particular area at 10 p.m. or midnight.  Given the focus on events arising in the past month, what kind of concerns do care workers express about that?  I am sure there is some kind of preference for walking or cycling rather than using public transport or a taxi in order to save money.  What anecdotal evidence do the witnesses have in that regard?</p></speech>

It is well established there.  Compensation is paid to people who use their cars in the form of mileage.

Advances in technology are also being considered in the HSE to assist people, such as access to phones, etc.</p></speech>

For example, I could see eight clients today and each client may take 30 minutes but the time taken to travel between client A and client B is not included in many organisations.  However, the Labour Court assisted in determining travel being included as part of the working week.  In the public service that is now established, so staff get recognition for the amount of time they are spending working.  Going back to the race to the bottom concerns we have, our carers were offered contracts with clients that may have been only 30 minutes or 15 minutes in duration but the time spent travelling between those appointments was not included in the working day, creating major challenges for our members in those sectors.  I am thankful that in the public service we have progressed.</p></speech>

This is a follow-up from the previous meeting this morning.  We are in the middle of a recruitment crisis and there are families who cannot get the carers they want.  On some level I also accept these people probably do not care where the service comes from, whether it is the private or public sector, once their loved one can stay at home.</p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses that what we do not want happening here is what happened in nursing homes.  The investors were ready to invest and tax breaks were given so - shock and horror - the obvious happened.  I suppose at this point there is a recruitment difficulty even with the HSE.  There is another element to the crisis in the sense that we are also reliant at this point on private providers, which cannot recruit.  We all welcome the workforce advisory group and it has had informal meetings but I am not entirely sure who attended those.  None of this will matter until we see some action.  There was talk about bespoke solutions that may suit certain people with the likes of tax breaks, for example.  That is not necessarily the overall solution but it is a stop-gap answer because we are under pressure.</p> <p>  What is the view of the witnesses of those proposals or what the Minister has alluded to?  We could be looking at tax breaks and ensuring people do not lose out on SUSI grants.  We might be facilitating people to work in the health service and, for want of a better term, to do "nixer" jobs at the weekend.  We also have to deal with the fact that travel expenses are a complete disaster.  It seems that with private operators there is an inconsistency across all CHO areas with respect to terms.  Will the witnesses speak to that, although we accept that the ultimate solution is for the State to put clear pathways for workers to deal with pay, conditions and expenses so the required service can be directly offered?</p></speech>

There would be a tipping point if that became too expensive.  The State has a duty of care to provide home care.  It is a different world than what it was 30 years ago.  The population is getting older; people are getting more able but there is more sickness.</p></speech>

We have all of that to consider.  The solution is not to say it should all be provided by the State and nothing else but rather that this industry should be regulated that is able to attract people.  The terms and conditions should be resourceful enough to be able to provide care in a structured way to meet people's expectations.  If people have choices, that is okay.  The one point I want to make is that having a choice is grand until it becomes too expensive and then a person no longer has that choice.</p></speech>

In fairness to the Government, it has increased the funding allocation and the number of hours in this year's budget.  If we do not attract people to carry out those duties, we go nowhere.  Tax breaks and all these other measures may be considered but we seek an overhaul.  Why put arrangements in place that throw good money after bad when we just need to consider the root problem?  Similar evidence is growing in the childcare sector, despite the inroads being made there.  We face a similar crisis in that sector.  In our submission we have called for the opportunity for a collective bargaining mechanism for the private home care providers.  That would allow us to establish terms and conditions of employment that could be deemed suitable.</p></speech>

We are reliant on these private sector operators that have built in their profit.  HCCI indicated earlier this was between 5% and 10% for companies, on average.  They would state there would be a difficulty with the tendering process.  If they build in their profit, the State is probably trying to get this on the cheap.  Workers will make a determination and go somewhere else where they will get better pay and conditions.  I get this.</p> <p>  I can accept short-term fixes for what they are but if we are serious about this, the only action that will keep people in this particular type of work is ensuring the right pay, conditions and ensuring expenses.  We could not survive without them and the amazing work they do.  The witnesses have spoken about finally valuing the work and this is a type of work that has lost out on the basis that it has largely been a female workforce over many years.  We are starting from a bad place and we need to improve the position.  If we do not do it, we will be under serious pressure.</p> <p>  What are the big requests from the witnesses?  They have said the State must step up on some level.  What do individual workers need?  I know what has been said about the recruitment system and we need something that is agile, fit for purpose and which can deliver.  Beyond that Mr. Ginley said, there are still difficulties with the tendering process.</p></speech>

Terms and conditions of employment have been established in the public service so we do not see why somebody should be doing the same job but be paid significantly less.  There is no explanation for that other than it is for profit.  The role of home care support is key to the roll-out of Sl&aacute;intecare because the principle of Sl&aacute;intecare is care in the community and at home.  It is about caring for people who do not need to be in facilities such as hospitals or nursing homes.  It is what people want.  They want the care delivered in their home where it can be provided.</p> <p>  We ask the HSE to ensure any recruitment issues are addressed and to continue the engagements with us on that.  We are asking for the provision of localised campaigns to speed up that process.  Separately, we are seeking a process with the Government to establish a collective bargaining mechanism to allow us to engage on behalf of the private and the not-for-profit sector on their terms and conditions.  That is to try to get a foundation we can work from.</p></speech>

We echo everything that our SIPTU colleagues are seeking and we do not need to repeat them.  Everything unions seek has a cost but I remind everyone of the astronomical difference between the cost of keeping someone at home compared with the cost of long-term care.</p><p>The difference between the two is absolutely astronomical.  There is value in investing more in home support services.  It makes good fiscal sense, apart from the points that we have made today.  </p><p>  Chairman: The point is that families come to home support service providers.  Politicians, in particular, make that point all tha.  We heard earlier on that in the submission in relation to people being burnt out, spousal care - they are looking after their loved one day and night.  The difficulty of - it was mentioned about people going to the post office, going out to the shops - that head space if your hours are not together.  In the SIPTU submission, it mentioned the different CHO 7, CHO 1 and so on and the different vacancies in each CHO.  What is the reality of those vacancies not being filled?  What is the impact on the ground in relation to those families who are - those vacancies that are there.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.  </p></speech>

Politicians make that point all the time.  We heard earlier in the witnesses' submission how people are suffering from burnout.  In the case of spousal care, people are looking after their loved ones day and night.  It was mentioned that people go out to the post office or to the shops to get some headspace if the hours are not together.  In its submission SIPTU notes that there are vacancies in different CHO areas.  What is the reality of those vacancies not being filled?  How does that impact the families on the ground?  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that point.</p> <p>  The other point I wish to raise relates to the announcement of the provision of 5 million extra hours.  The witnesses have made the point about there being no administrative supports for management.  What does that mean in reality for those hours or for the smooth running of that service if the providers do not have that clerical support?  The witnesses have stated that the role of managers is complex and has multiple demands.  It is not just about the provision of the hours; it is about the backup package in relation to that.  I ask the witnesses to give members a sense of what is involved in that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damian Ginley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022020900002#R00300"><p>I will try to answer as best I can.  On the question of the hours, in our submission we just gave examples of a snapshot of information we receive from colleagues on the current level of vacancies.  My understanding is that there are efforts afoot to try to address those vacancies around the country.  The impact of the vacancies, from the point of view of the organisation, is twofold.  Obviously, there is also a knock-on implication for the client availing of the service or trying to avail of the service.  What our members are saying to us is that in the offices where they do not have fully resourced staff, they are trying to juggle people around, cross cover and they are making decisions as to who is most in urgent need of care or prioritisation.  They are making calls on whether somebody can be - I do not like using the word "skipped" - left today and prioritised tomorrow, and taking measures like that.  We understand that where urgent care needs exist, the hours are then going to the private providers, who are backfilling where they can.  To assist the smooth operation of the service, which is key for the person who is availing of the service, we need these posts to be filled, because then, our colleagues in F&oacute;rsa and their team there could populate rosters to ensure that there are no gaps or fewer gaps in them.  They would have the resources available to ensure that if, for example, a worker is unavailable because he or she is on sick leave or annual leave, there is cover in the numbers employed.  That way, we can get away from that response reaction, as opposed to a planned approach.  As I said, the impact on the ground is that decisions are being taken on whether a full hour or a half hour can be provided to a particular client on a particular day, based on resources.  That is the real impact of not having full recruitment.</p></speech>

I am just getting to the new title; it was only agreed on Friday.  A typical day in the life of those managers could be that on a Sunday evening, he or she receives a a call reporting that one of the home support care assistants is a close Covid contact and he or she cannot go into the home or somebody has symptoms.  That worker is there trying to juggle hours.  As Mr. Ginley alluded to, it can be so much that they are ringing up a family, with whom they have personal relationships, and asking them, for example, whether they can cover the morning hours for their mam because someone who lives three doors down is in dire need, so the home healthcare assistants are being moved there to do the work.  The knock-on effect is that the same resource manager is trying to contact the multidisciplinary team that is dealing with a discharge from a hospital and perhaps contacting a social worker to tell them that the home support package cannot be provided on a particular day, as planned, because they do not have the resources.  That frenetic pace of work and the <i>ad hoc</i>, fragmented approach show where the real deficits are.  As the Chairman rightly pointed out, at the back of all that are families who are desperate for these resources to be put in place for their loved ones to keep them at home.<br/><br/>I know we keep talking about resourcing the service properly, but it has to be done and it has to be done properly.  It has to be done at a national level and it has to be standardised.  The members of SIPTU within the public sector now get paid for their travel.  It was agreed and it was the right thing to do.  However, what the HSE did not do behind it was to bring in an IT system that would create a streamlined function, in this day and age.  Instead, there are home support managers who, without any clerical administrative support, are trying to manually update hours on a day-to-day basis as people hand them in a sheet while they travel to a number of homes.  It is not right for a worker in this day and age to be waiting on payment.  It is also not a good use of HSE resources.  Sometimes, because F&oacute;rsa proudly represents clerical administrative workers, people say that there are too many managers in the system and there are too many clerical administrative staff.  I am often the one who says that there needs to be more.  The reason I say that is that the appropriate people should be doing the appropriate work.  It makes sense to me to resource home support with a proper clerical administrative function so that the resource manager who is juggling the needs of the clients, the workers and the multidisciplinary teams has somebody there inputting timesheets.  A senior manager, with all his or her skills, should not be having to spend three hours of his or her evening updating timesheets because the resources are not there.  That is a bad use of money.  The actual impact of all of this, because we are all citizens and family members and we all have personal experience of this, is people at home not getting the service they need.  It is stark.  That is why I made the point that investment in home support services is actually a really good use of taxpayers' money.  </p></speech>

We are very proud of the fact that the much-maligned managerial cohort that we represent are generic and agile, and can move across the health system.  However, as with the civil registration service, there needs to be consideration that when we get a bank of expertise in organising home care, we should probably try to hold on to it and not let it migrate out into the generic system.  There may be a case for some specialisation of the management function there, given the wealth and bank of knowledge.  Many of these people come and develop that knowledge in an industry that is moving at a frenetic pace, as Ms Keogh has described.  All of a sudden, they are off somewhere else, they are lost and we must start from scratch.  There is a case for looking at that.</p></speech>

That must create a lot of tension.  Staff talk to each other and discuss what is happening in one area that is not happening in another.  That creates all sorts of problems within the system itself.  It seems to be a crazy system.  One can understand that the Minister was under pressure to announce the provision of extra hours, but we also need that backup.  We all accept that we need more hours in the system.  Is this one of the boxes that we need to tick if we are seeking to deliver these far-reaching solutions to the challenges that are out there to ensure that we have the basic supports in place?</p></speech>

It is good that there is increased investment from the point of view of more hours, but that needs to be supported properly and funded.  Hours need to be structured and fit for purpose.  There are good practices out there.  I am not going to sit here today and say that it is all bad.  However, we must learn from the lessons we have.  We must accept now that there are accepted terms and conditions of employment for the sector and afford people access to permanent contracts with guaranteed hours.  All that falls into place then and improves the delivery of care that is being provided.  Ultimately, we are strong in our call for the removal of profit from the delivery of home care.</p></speech>

In some cases, workers have not received a pay increase in ten years and do not have a pension, and so on.  I do not know whether it is the same here, but in other sectors, what happens is that section 39 workers are headhunted by the private sector.</p><p>Is that also another factor in relation to this area?</p></speech>

Both SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa are engaging nationally in respect of section 39 organisations and trying to improve the pay issues but we are being met with resistance.  Unfortunately, unless a principled position is adopted by the Government, as Mr. Donnelly alluded to earlier, we will continue to be chasing organisations.  The impact of that is that the good people will move on.  They will vote with their feet and move elsewhere.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is a little bit of food for thought.  Notwithstanding the fact that we need a regulated sector, that it should not be a profit-making sector and all of the points on which I share the views of others, I am not so sure that having a different approach from CHO to CHO is altogether a bad thing.  The reason I say that is there are different demographics and societal factors in each CHO.  If we are moving towards the Sl&aacute;intecare vision, we are eventually supposed to end up with integrated care areas that have a devolution and an autonomy.  We must prepare ourselves for that day.  I am not so sure that a different approach across the CHOs is necessarily problematic.  What is problematic is differences in standards and standards of employment.</p></speech>

What we find anecdotally with section 39 voluntary sector organisations, across Dublin in particular, is that they may have longer-term members of staff who are more than happy to stay but the real difficulty they are facing in respect of recruitment and retention is with younger staff.  In many cases, they do not offer the likes of guaranteed hours contracts.  Where they do, the number of hours guaranteed is quite low.  Younger people coming into the sector are obviously looking for good terms and conditions.  We are hearing a lot about the cost of living crisis and the housing crisis at the moment.  As a result, these individuals are going to the likes of the acute sector and the HSE.</p></speech>

Cuideoidh seo leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s a chuid spriocanna a bhaint amach faoin strait&eacute;is nua a sheol m&eacute; an tseachtain seo caite.  Leagann an strait&eacute;is f&iacute;s don Ghaeltacht amach do na c&uacute;ig bliana amach romhainn, strait&eacute;is a rachaidh chun tairbhe phobal labhartha Gaeilge, phobal fiontra&iacute;ochta agus ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; forbartha pobal na Gaeltachta.

Leithdh&aacute;ileadh 36% den chiste faoi chl&aacute;r C6 idir 2020 agus 2022 agus ar C7 t&aacute; difr&iacute;ocht mh&oacute;r freisin.  Leithdh&aacute;ileadh 42% idir 2020 agus 2022.  T&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh an infheist&iacute;ocht san &uacute;dar&aacute;s chun an strait&eacute;is seo a chur i bhfeidhm.  T&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach go mbeimid in ann buis&eacute;ad n&iacute; b'fhearr a dh&eacute;anamh gach bliain a bheidh an Rialtas seo ann.</p> <p>  Maidir leis na ceisteanna ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; fosta&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeltacht agus an obair at&aacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s, is fi&uacute; a n&oacute;t&aacute;il gur th&aacute;inig ard&uacute; ar an leibh&eacute;al fosta&iacute;ochta i gcliantchuideachta&iacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;is na Gaeltachta anuraidh.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an r&aacute;iteas deireadh bliana, a eis&iacute;odh le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, gur crutha&iacute;odh 825 post nua i gcomhlachta&iacute; Gaeltachta le linn na bliana.  Sin glanmh&eacute;ad&uacute; 446 post, an glanmh&eacute;ad&uacute; bliant&uacute;il is airde &oacute; 1996.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn an difr&iacute;ocht seo an obair an-mhaith a rinne s&eacute; anuraidh agus leis an strait&eacute;is nua t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh an f&iacute;s nua a chur i bhfeidhm agus infheist&iacute;ocht a dh&eacute;anamh i gcomhair na strait&eacute;ise seo.  F&aacute;gann s&eacute; seo go bhfuil os cionn 7,800 post l&aacute;naimseartha agus 485 post p&aacute;irtaimseartha san ioml&aacute;n ag deireadh 2021 i gcomhlachta&iacute; a fuair taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Chomh maith leis sin, bh&iacute; an leibh&eacute;al is airde fosta&iacute;ochta riamh i stair na heagra&iacute;ochta i nGaeltachta&iacute; na Gaillimhe, Chorca&iacute; agus Phort L&aacute;irge.

Is cuimhin liom go raibh an Teachta liom nuair a rinneamar an obair seo agus chuir s&eacute; a l&aacute;n oibre isteach chun an geall seo a chur sa chl&aacute;r.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; seo an-t&aacute;bhachtach do Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il freisin.</p><p>Maidir leis an athbhreithni&uacute; ar an bpr&oacute;iseas toghch&aacute;in agus roghn&uacute;ch&aacute;in do bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, rinne an Oifig um Shol&aacute;thar Rialtais com&oacute;rtas a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il, ar iarratas mo Roinne, don dara huair le gairid i dtreo sainchomhairleoireacht a aimsi&uacute; le tabhairt faoin athbhreithni&uacute; agus molta&iacute; ina leith a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id na Roinne.  &Oacute;s rud &eacute;, &aacute;fach, nach bhfuarthas aon tairiscint de thoradh ar an dara com&oacute;rtas seo, t&aacute; na ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;imeanna eile &aacute; mbreithni&uacute; ag an Roinn faoi l&aacute;thair i gcomhair leis an Oifig um Shol&aacute;thar Rialtais i dtreo sainchomhairleoireacht at&aacute; c&aacute;ilithe go cu&iacute; a aimsi&uacute; don ch&uacute;ram.  Mar chuid den athbhreithni&uacute; sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist ag an Roinn pr&oacute;iseas comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in phoibl&iacute; a eagr&uacute;, faoina dtabharfar an deis don phobal tuairim&iacute; agus molta&iacute; faoin &aacute;bhar a roinnt i scr&iacute;bhinn leis an Roinn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist an pr&oacute;iseas seo a sheoladh go r&iacute;ghairid, chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir.  T&aacute; eolas eile agam faoin socr&uacute; at&aacute; i bhfeidhm faoi l&aacute;thair maidir le strucht&uacute;r bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  T&aacute;imid ag tos&uacute; an phr&oacute;isis comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in phoibl&iacute; chun na tuairim&iacute; a fh&aacute;il agus t&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach go mbeidh muid in ann an teagmh&aacute;il leis an Oifig um Shol&aacute;thar Rialtais a chr&iacute;ochn&uacute; freisin.</p><p> Maidir le col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, chuir mo Roinn roinnt taca&iacute;ochta ar f&aacute;il &oacute; th&uacute;s na paind&eacute;ime chun cabhr&uacute; leis an gc&oacute;ras.  Anuraidh, chuir mo Roinn ciste &eacute;igeand&aacute;la ar f&aacute;il agus &iacute;ocadh thart ar &euro;2.7 milli&uacute;n le h&uacute;dar&aacute;is na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; chun iad a chur ar a gcumas t&aacute;ill&iacute; n&oacute; &eacute;arlais a ais&iacute;oc le tuismitheoir&iacute;.  Chomh maith le sin, &iacute;ocadh thart ar &euro;1.6 milli&uacute;in leis an tuairim is 700 teaghlach Gaeltachta at&aacute; cl&aacute;raithe faoi sc&eacute;im na Roinne.  Chaith mo Roinn beagnach &euro;4.5 milli&uacute;n faoi sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge anuraidh.</p><p> Bh&iacute; s&uacute;il ag gach aon duine go mbeadh na col&aacute;ist&iacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; an samhradh seo caite ach tar &eacute;is comhairle le p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara, idir lucht l&oacute;ist&iacute;n, lucht sti&uacute;rtha na gcol&aacute;ist&iacute; agus lucht sti&uacute;rtha halla&iacute; pobail na Gaeltachta, rinneadh cinneadh i mBealtaine anuraidh nach bhf&eacute;adfadh na col&aacute;ist&iacute; feidhmi&uacute; don dara bliain as a ch&eacute;ile mar gheall ar Covid-19.  Agus an cinneadh sin &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh, t&oacute;gadh san &aacute;ireamh an imn&iacute; shuntasach a bh&iacute; le sonr&uacute; faoi shl&aacute;inte phoibl&iacute; agus faoi sh&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht teaghlaigh Gaeltachta agus pobail &aacute;iti&uacute;la i dtaca le Covid-19 d&aacute; re&aacute;cht&aacute;lfa&iacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; samhraidh.  Chun teacht i gcabhair ar ruda&iacute; ar&iacute;s, bhunaigh mo Roinn tr&iacute; chiste faoi leith anuraidh ar leas na hearn&aacute;la ar fi&uacute; &euro;4 milli&uacute;n in ioml&aacute;n iad.  Bhain ceann acu, ar luach &euro;2.2 milli&uacute;n, le lucht l&oacute;ist&iacute;n.  Cuireadh ciste ar luach &euro;200,000 ar f&aacute;il do na halla&iacute; pobail agus bh&iacute; suas le &euro;1.7 milli&uacute;n ar f&aacute;il do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; f&eacute;in chun cuidi&uacute; leo le costais riarach&aacute;in, &aacute;rachas agus mar sin de a chl&uacute;dach don bhliain.  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach gur chabhraigh s&eacute; seo leis an earn&aacute;il teacht tr&iacute; na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in arbh &eacute;igean don phobal a iompar le beagnach dh&aacute; bhliain anuas de bharr na paind&eacute;ime.  T&aacute;thar ag s&uacute;il le filleadh ar an ngn&aacute;thshaol i mbliana. </p><p> Maidir leis an mbliain seo, is &eacute; &aacute;r mbun&uacute;s agus &aacute;r dtn&uacute;th&aacute;n go mbeidh na col&aacute;ist&iacute; &aacute; oscailt i mbliana.  T&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in, an Roinn agus an c&oacute;ras tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile ag feidhmi&uacute; d&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin.  Tr&iacute;d an gc&uacute;namh lean&uacute;nach a chuirtear ar f&aacute;il faoi sc&eacute;im na bhfoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge, beidh muid ag teacht i gcabhair ar an earn&aacute;il mar a bhaineann s&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; maoinithe i mbliana.  Coinneoidh mo Roinn an sc&eacute;al ar fad faoi bhreithni&uacute; i gcomhar le p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara de r&eacute;ir mar is g&aacute;, lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear an Roinn Oideachais, na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is sl&aacute;inte agus sc&aacute;thghr&uacute;pa na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, CONCOS.

Cad faoi nuair a dh&eacute;antar iarracht teacht ar cad as a dtagann an m&eacute;id &euro;15.462 milli&uacute;n?  I gc&aacute;s na bliana anuraidh, t&aacute; figi&uacute;r de &euro;1,334,129 in easnamh.  Ba &eacute; an m&eacute;id don bhliain roimhe sin n&aacute; &euro;787,626.

Today we will be considering 2022 Revised Estimates.  This is a special select committee meeting.  The purpose of our meeting today is to consider the following Revised Estimates for public services: programme D of Vote 29 - Environment, Climate and Communications, and Vote 31 - Transport.  I remind committee members that the committee has no role in approving the Estimates.  It is an ongoing opportunity for the committee to examine departmental expenditure, to make the process more transparent and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues.  I welcome the Minister for Transport and for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, and his officials to the meeting.  They are most welcome.</p> <p>  I will read a brief note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the committee remotely via MS Teams.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via MS Teams that, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that member confirms he or she is on the grounds of Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.</p> <p>  I call the Minster, Deputy Ryan, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.997" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#A00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the 2022 Estimate for the Department of Transport and for programme A of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p> <p>  For 2022, the budget has been restructured to make it easier to monitor and report on how funds are being invested.  The former land programme is now split into three new programmes, namely, programme A, sustainable mobility, active travel and greenways; programme B, carbon reduction and public transport; and programme C, road safety and road networks.  Programme D, civil aviation, and programme E, maritime safety and transport, remain unchanged.</p> <p>  The set of transport Estimates before the committee provide an overall gross allocation to the Department of Transport of &euro;3.432 billion, which constitutes &euro;885 million in current expenditure and &euro;2.547 billion in capital.  Core expenditure has increased by 7% in current expenditure and by just under 1% in capital, in line with the capital ceiling for 2022 agreed as part of the negotiations underpinning the revised national development plan, NDP.</p> <p>  Covid emergency expenditure has fallen by 46%, in line with the gradual recovery in the economy.  Supports are still provided, where deemed necessary, to protect public services.  In total, an additional &euro;238 million in emergency funding is provided in 2022.</p> <p>  This year will see a number of significant milestones as major transport projects continue to advance and the number of active travel schemes in the pipeline continues to grow.  In the budget, we secured additional funding to assist our investment agencies to continue to scale up to deliver on projects within their remit.  The responsibility for greenways has been transferred to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which is in a position to utilise its knowledge and expertise to advance interurban networks.  In addition, legislation is now before the Oireachtas which will, if passed, make it easier for local authorities to experiment with active travel proposals.</p> <p>  Turning to active travel and greenways, &euro;358.6 million is allocated under this programme.  Major urban projects to commence construction include the Clontarf to Amiens Street route in Dublin and the MacCurtain Street scheme in Cork.  In all, an estimated 1,200 active travel projects will be funded.  Some 170 schools are participating in the current round of the safe routes to schools programme.</p> <p>  Construction will continue on significant greenway projects, including Clifden to Recess and Midleton to Youghal.  In 2022, an estimated 150 km of greenway will be under construction and 900 km in pre-construction.  As bicycles take up, on average, one tenth of the space of a car, cost a fraction of a car to purchase and use, and properly designed networks have much higher capacity to carry people to their destinations than congested roads, their impact over short journeys simply cannot be underestimated.</p><p> Under programme B, sustainable mobility, carbon reduction and public transport, approximately &euro;1.475 billion has been allocated, &euro;102 million of which is allocated to carbon reduction measures, including supporting the continued rate of growth in the number of electric vehicles, EVs.  Under this programme a number of schemes are funded, including the very successful electric small public service vehicle, ESPSV, scheme and the EV grant scheme for private cars.</p><p> Some &euro;780 million is allocated to public transport investment.  This year will see a number of key milestones in public transport projects presently under development.  Just before Christmas, the preliminary business case for DART+ was approved, with DART+ West the first project scheduled to enter the planning system.  The contract for the DART fleet was signed, a major step in facilitating the increase in fleet capacity.  In the coming months I expect to bring the preliminary business cases for BusConnects and MetroLink to the Cabinet.  The Cork commuter rail project, part-funded through the EU's national recovery and resilience programme, will also be progressed.  Some &euro;538.8 million is allocated to public service obligation, PSO, services.  Included in this allocation, emergency funding of &euro;205 million will continue to support PSO services and to remediate the impacts of the Covid-19 emergency measures.  New routes will be rolled out under the BusConnects, rural transport and Connecting Ireland network plans, and the new youth travel card scheme will be rolled out.</p><p> Under programme C, road safety and road networks, approximately &euro;1.423 billion is allocated.  This funding will maintain and renew national, regional and local road surfaces; assist in undertaking safety works and bridge maintenance and rehabilitation; meet our contractual obligations under public private partnerships that delivered parts of our motorway network; fund the construction of new national, regional and local roads; and fund vital safety-related services.</p><p> Construction continues on a number of major roads, including the Dunkettle interchange and the N5 Westport to Turlough road.  The Listowel bypass and the N59 Moycullen bypass will commence construction in 2022.  Projects with planning approval that will continue to progress towards construction phase include the N28 Ringaskiddy road and the N6 Galway ring road.  Some &euro;825 million has been allocated to protection and renewal.  As for road safety, as well as funding for driver licensing services, additional funding has been provided to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to support its vital work in detecting drug and alcohol misuse by drivers.</p><p> Under the civil aviation programme, &euro;67.417 million is allocated to the sector.  As the sector continues to recover, the amount of funding in emergency supports is significantly down in 2022.  The regional airports programme provides targeted supports to regional airports that handle fewer than 1 million passengers per annum.  Cork and Shannon airports are eligible to participate in the programme in 2022 alongside Knock and Donegal airports.  Funding of &euro;5 million is available in the event that customer refund or repatriation is required following the failure of a travel or tour operator.  Some &euro;10 million is available in additional travel trade industry supports, and &euro;11 million is allocated to fund services such as air accident insurance and membership of key international organisations.</p><p> Under programme E, maritime transport and safety, &euro;108.81 million is allocated for 2022.  Most of that funding is directed to the Irish Coast Guard, and the main cost in this regard relates to the search and rescue helicopter contract.  The programme also funds the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which operates buoys and lighthouses and keeps seafarers and their cargoes safe while in Irish waters.  We also cover various administrative costs associated with the Irish Maritime Administration.  We will continue the Coast Guard building programme to ensure the volunteers have adequate facilities for their operations and equipment.  We are investing in IT  infrastructure to enable the teams to enhance further how they work together.  Some &euro;1 million has been provided to Wexford County Council to assist in the cost of environmental remediation works at Rosslare Europort as part of the transfer of the port to management by the local authority.</p><p> I now turn to the connectivity and communications delivery programme of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The aim of the programme is to deliver world-class connectivity and communications.  Over &euro;255 million is being allocated to the programme in 2022, consisting of &euro;19.95 million in current expenditure and &euro;235.2 million in capital expenditure.  The current expenditure relates mainly to the Department's digital economy programmes and the National Cyber Security Centre.</p><p> The biggest item of capital expenditure within this programme is the national broadband plan, at &euro;225 million.  The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of high-capacity and reliable broadband to ensure people, communities and businesses throughout Ireland can avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy.  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has continued the roll-out of the new high-speed fibre-optic broadband network under the national broadband plan, NBP.  Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across every county in Ireland, with almost 292,000 premises surveyed or undergoing survey as of 14 January.  More than 34,000 premises have been passed and retailers are now able to resell high-speed broadband services via the National Broadband Ireland, NBI, network to those premises.  In excess of 54,000 premises are able to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband service, and nearly 5,500 premises are now connected.</p><p> The 2022 Estimate includes &euro;3 million for Eircode postcodes.  Since their launch in 2015, their usage has continued to grow and they are now used widely among the public, businesses and the public sector.</p><p> The Estimates also include &euro;5.1 million operational funding for the National Cyber Security Centre and &euro;3.5 million for the National Digital Research Centre.  The National Cyber Security Centre is the central cybersecurity authority in the State, its key roles being to monitor and to respond to cybersecurity incidents and to manage and to share intelligence relating to threats to network and information security.  In line with the Government decision of July 2021, the 2022 pay Estimate for the programme includes an allocation to increase staffing at the National Cyber Security Centre by 20 to 45 in 2022.  The National Cyber Security Centre will continue to develop its incident response, threat intelligence, monitoring and research and development capabilities.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions on the 2022 Estimates of expenditure for the services provided by both Departments under this programme.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his presentation and the work he is doing.  I know there is an awful lot going on in the areas of mobility and sustainability.  I compliment the active travel measures.  It is welcome to see such focus put on that area, which has been neglected for an awfully long time.  For the coming financial year, it will be important for the Minister and his Department to put pressure on the local authorities to spend the money available to them.  That comes up quite a bit.</p><p>Another thing I find deeply frustrating is when there are projects that those of us who have served on local authorities know and that may be extremely expensive to undertake.  There is sometimes a degree of fear on the part of local authorities in that they do not want to undertake projects of such large scale, such as long footpaths and pedestrian schemes.  It might be nice for the Department to allow some Oireachtas representation on large-scale projects.  We may want the Minister to report to the local authorities rather than it being <i>vice versa</i>the entire time, with local authorities reporting to the State agencies that have the responsibility to allocate that funding down.  That would be very welcome.</p><p>As for the transition to greener modes of transport, we are in the midst of an enormous shift in vehicle patterns in respect of the types of fuel required to drive vehicles on Irish roads.  Does the Minister think the Department, with this year's expenditure, is doing enough to realise and meet targets we have set down for the removal of diesel vehicles from Irish roads?  Something I have a degree of concern about is that many families may be buying soft hybrid diesel vehicles, which have become quite normal, but where will they be in five and six years' time, when it comes to trading in and perhaps purchasing new cars?  What will the knock-on ramifications be for the value of those vehicles?  Will it still be legal into the 2030s to drive those vehicles on Irish roads, despite their being less than ten years old?  Will the Minister give us some guidance on that?</p></speech>

Covid interrupted a lot, but, hopefully, this year we will have a clear run.  I expect all budgets will be fully utilised.  In everything, I will be pushing for acceleration.  This Government has to be about delivery and getting good value for money in that delivery.  Applying the same urgency we saw in regard to Covid to the housing crisis, the climate crisis and the reform in the health system is the key metric for the Government.</p> <p>  With regard to diesel vehicles and the future - I do not have the statistics in front of me, but if my officials have them I will be happy to share them - the proportion of diesel vehicles within new purchases has fallen significantly in the past two to three years.  I expect that to continue and to accelerate in its own right for a variety of reasons, but in the main because we are going to see battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric and full electric vehicles take off.  All of the manufacturers are going to start providing such options.  During an engagement I had yesterday with the SEAI on a separate issue, we were in agreement that we are not far away from the point of comparative life-cycle costs.  They are actually more economic and, therefore, their use will start to accelerate.</p> <p>  The Fit for 55 plan, which I support, provides for the ending of the sale of combustion vehicles by 2030.  I think it was the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, who introduced that in his climate action plan.  That type of message and signal is very appropriate to give to the Irish public so that people and retailers and garages can start to plan for that.  As I said, the EU Fit for 55 package contains a proposal around that timeframe.  The signal that we are switching from combustion vehicles, particularly for passenger cars, is important.</p></speech>

I am particularly concerned that tens of thousands of vehicles using traditional methods of combustion are still being bought and put onto Irish roads on an annual basis.  The reality is that in the 2030s we will be in a new era when it comes to how we fuel our cars.  There will be a financial burden and impact in terms of the trade-in value of vehicles, if it will even be permitted to trade them in.  We all want to see a degree of clarity brought to this particular area.  I ask that over the course of this year the Minister would work on a comprehensive scheme that will allow people to transition from diesel to hybrid vehicles.  The schemes that are currently in place are very small in terms of the proportional cost of purchasing hybrid and fully electric vehicles, which often are significantly more expensive that their diesel and petrol counterparts.  This is an area that needs to be worked on.</p> <p>  We had a lot of drama over the course of the past 12 months around the National Cyber Security Centre, and rightly so.  As Minister with responsibility for communications, what assurances can the Minister provide that the Irish defence system, in terms of defence from cyber attacks into the future, has been strengthened by way of the actions he has taken in the context of this year's budget?</p></speech>

We did have lessons to learn.  There were mistakes made and networks were not secure.  Work has advanced on closing those loopholes, but it is important that we learn from that attack.  I am confident that with the additional resources, the additional staff and the willingness to learn the lessons from that cyber attack, we will have a more secure network.  No system can be completely fail-safe, but there were significant lessons that we needed to learn and have learned from that crippling event.  I am confident those lessons will be learned.</p></speech>

The ask was for the optimal staffing with skills as well.  It is not just about numbers; it is about skills as well.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was immediate in providing us with the necessary resources.  Staff are being taken on, bringing total staff numbers up to 44 this year.  That was optimised on the basis of best international expertise advising us.  That is what they felt we needed.</p></speech>

It is not about staffing on its own.  It is interesting that the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which has been published today, recognises that the Department of Defence also has a key role on the cybersecurity side.  That Department will, I am sure, be looking to enhance its capability.  The other lesson is that we need this capability in the agencies and the main corporate entities in the State.  It is not just about the National Cyber Security Centre; it is about the HSE and the Departments as well.</p></speech>

It has to be acknowledged that the people working within this space are extremely committed and working very hard and they have been put through the wringer in the past 12 months, but 44 personnel is fewer people than work in a busy McDonald's restaurant or a major supermarket.  For an economy worth hundreds of billions of euros, where we have tens of thousands of people working in the tech industry, is it not the case that we are in a better position than any other small developed economy in the world to bring in experts in encryption and the other people who are necessary?</p> <p>  I have an additional concern with regard to pay.  If these people are expected to be paid salaries that are merited for their expertise - what they would get in the private sector is probably many multiples of what they would expect to get working in the public service - has the Department done any analysis from a pay perspective in terms of dealing with this particular issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1013" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#C01100"><p>I was involved in helping to oversee the management in response to that cyber attack.  What we saw in terms of the calibre, dedication and sense of duty among the people we had was beyond compare.  The Deputy is correct that a lot of the time these people would be earning significantly higher salaries within the private sector, but many of them come with a history of involvement with the state.  Some are Defence Forces personnel and they have that patriotic sense.  They also learn a lot in this role.  There tends to be a relatively constant flow of staff from the private sector into the public sector and back out again.  That can be healthy in terms of mixing skills and learning new skills.</p> <p>  As I said, when it came to beefing up the National Cyber Security Centre, there was no restriction in terms of what we needed to do around pay or positions.  We went about that in a way that, first and foremost, involved increasing resources on an urgent basis.  We have taken on a director, a principal officer and an assistant principal officer and competitions are under way for a whole range of different cybersecurity operations roles.  I am confident that we will fill those roles and that we are able to get skilled people.  The National Cyber Security Centre is a very good agency.  In terms of the manner in which it shares information, it is an open and trusted organisation internationally, which means for anyone who is working there it tends to enhance their reputation.  That makes it an attractive place for people to work in.  </p></speech>

It sends a chill down my spine, and that of anybody who is committed to State security, that this area is going to become an increasing risk in years to come.  The world is becoming a more unstable place, unfortunately.  Over the past few years, we have seen that pattern starting to emerge.</p><p>Arguably, an individual group could do more damage using a hacking method to damage the capacity of a state in terms of its IT systems in times to come.  I very much advocate the Minister doing all he can in that regard in the year ahead.  I appreciate him taking the time to answer questions.</p></speech>

The first is that when the national cybersecurity issue arose with the HSE, the committee wrote to all Departments to ask that they isolate cybersecurity costs.  The Minister referred to the fact that each Department now has a role in the context of cybersecurity spending.  I know the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, is under the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, but has the Department of Transport looked to isolate the costs involved in cybersecurity?  The committee wrote to all Departments so that the Estimates, when they come out, will include a heading under which the costs within the Department that are incurred in dealing with cybersecurity are outlined.</p> <p>   The Minister referred to the Commission on the Defence Forces and its recommendations.  He stated that all Departments have a role to play in this regard.  I do not know whether he or his officials are aware that the Irish Aviation Authority appeared before the joint committee last week to discuss the Russian situation.  The presentation from its representatives was excellent; their knowledge was second to none.  They were asked about the fact that if planes without permission to come in beyond the 12 nautical mile limit do not have their transponders switched on, the IAA cannot detect them.  Does the Minister see a role in terms of the purchase of primary radar equipment?  It was a recommendation under the White Paper, as well as the updated one, that the State now needs to make that large investment in primary radar equipment in order that planes can be detected whether they have the transponder on or not.  There is an issue that planes can fly very close to our coastline and if the transponder on a plane is not turned on, it undetectable by the IAA or even by the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The first point is a housekeeping one; I ask the Minister to make an observation on the second point.</p></speech>

The NCSC has a particular role, however.  It does work with Departments and-----</p></speech>

When the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, appeared before the committee, he made the point that the amount that is down as spent on cybersecurity is probably far higher than what is allocated to the NCSC itself, so the committee made a recommendation.  We wrote to all Departments to ask that they isolate as a spending item money spent on cybersecurity.  One would then get a holistic view with all Departments.</p></speech>

The Government has agreed to give it a number of months before we respond to the report of the commission.  It was independently published, in effect, today.  The one point I will make is that the biggest economic development of this country in the coming two decades will be the deployment of offshore renewable power.  It will be at the centre of our economic, energy security and climate strategies.  I refer to the scale in particular.  With 30 GW of power generation, we have a competitive comparative advantage that we can turn to industrial policy.  Much of that will be beyond the 12-mile limit.  It will be in the Atlantic off the north-west, west and south-west coasts and our interest-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1028" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#D01400"><p>That was an interesting exchange on the need for radar and so on.  I was very interested in the response of the Minister.</p> <p>  Before I crack into my questions, I note the &euro;3 million for Eircode was mentioned in the report and there was reference to how successful it has been after a rocky start.  It is worth mentioning that when we invest long-term in these things, they can bear fruit.  I remember it being described as a big waste of time.  It was claimed that no one would use it.  I think everyone now knows their Eircode off by heart.  I assume the &euro;3 million is for new builds and that kind of thing.</p> <p>  Many Ministers in various Departments through the years have pointed to increased funding and investment in certain areas that the public do not see.  The investment may be very real but it certainly is not visible to the naked eye.  I do not think that can be said about active travel, to the credit of the Minister.  It is clear there is significant investment going into active travel, such as measures in respect of segregated and other cycle lanes and pedestrianisation.  It is a very positive move and certainly represents in real terms where the people of Ireland, particularly young people, want to go.  They want more active travel options.  They want the Government to invest in it and it is doing so, which is to be commended.  Two weeks ago, we discussed objections to housing and other matters.  Have there been many objections to active travel measures?  Has the Minister been disappointed by such objections, be they from stakeholder groups, councils or politicians, such as councillors?  Is it an issue?  Is it increasing the cost of the provision and roll-out of these pieces of infrastructure?  It may be too early in this mass roll-out we are seeing for him to comment in detail in that regard, but I would be interested in hearing his thoughts on it and just generally around the whole culture of objecting to change.</p> <p>  Subhead 5.2, dealing with public transport infrastructure, covers light rail projects such as Luas and metro, as well as and public service obligation bus replacement and fleet enlargement programmes for BusConnects and next generation ticketing.  Does the Minister have a more detailed breakdown of that?  Obviously, I am very interested in how much will be spent on MetroLink in the coming year in terms of pushing it forward.  In response to my question on Questions to the Taoiseach yesterday, the Taoiseach was very strong in terms of the Government being supportive of MetroLink.   Representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland who appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week stated that 2035 is the earliest it will be delivered.  That is disappointing.  I would be interested in the response of the Minister to that projection.  It seems like we are baking in as a given an awful lot of imponderables such as judicial reviews, environmental impact assessments and procurement timelines.  It is like we are baking in the longest possible time those could take rather than trying to be positive and forward-moving.  In fairness, what we are hearing from the State agencies is not what I am hearing from the Minister or from the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il.  I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on that.</p> <p>  On bus replacements, fleet enlargements and the electric buses we are now seeing in Dublin, I ask the Minister to comment on the investment in that regard into 2022 and what we will see in terms of these replacements.  These buses can actually be seen now.  It is another example of seeing things happen rather than just having figures on a spreadsheet.</p><p>I am very interested in the accessibility retrofit programme for which &euro;15.3 million has been allocated.  Could the Minister provide further comment on what that is going to deliver and where we will see the money being spent?  I have a young disability activist in my constituency, Conor Dillon, who has been working with Dublin Bus.  He has been taking trips on Dublin Bus to highlight just how difficult it is for wheelchair users to use public transport.  This is someone with a great desire to use public transport but is frozen out of it.  It would be great to hear about where the money is going to go and what we are going to see from it.</p><p> I echo the comments of Deputy O'Connor about a scrappage scheme.  That is something we will need to see down the track in advance of 2030.  Whether it is next year or two, three or four years from now, it is something we are definitely going to need to see.</p><p> The Minister mentioned the national broadband plan.  There have been delays with it due to Covid.  Has there been any impact on the cost from the Department's point of view and is he disappointed in that?</p><p> The Minister said that our economic future will be based on the Atlantic in terms of renewable energy.  We hear a lot about renewable energy, wind energy and offshore energy on the east and south-east coast.  I assume all parts of the coastline will be important in that regard.  This is the first time I heard the Minister being so definitive about the west coast.  There is massive expectation that the east and south-east coasts are going to play a major role as well.</p><p> On a more local and regional level, the Athy distributor road is included as well.  The sod-turning ceremony is due to happen in early March.  I assume that is still going ahead.  Are there any timelines for that project?</p></speech>

Contracts have been signed.  My understanding is that it is proceeding.</p> <p>  On the Eircode, one of the other innovations or investment here is having shorter update and renewal of the Eircode system.  Previously it was quarterly, and it is moving to monthly.  A lot of people used to give out that it took a long time to be registered.  One of the benefits of that is to speed up the registration.</p></speech>

He is correct about where the people of Ireland are, in particular younger people, but not only that group.  I will be honest.  My frustration is that we need to go faster.  The Government must come out of Covid with the same sense of urgency and speed of delivery that we showed during Covid in three areas: housing, further healthcare reform and climate.  The three key aspects of climate to my mind that require immediate acceleration are: retrofit, which we announced yesterday, offshore wind and sustainable mobility.  I have been talking to the officials and my colleagues in government about how we can establish teams within Departments and evolving agencies that accelerate delivery.  Our job is all about delivery.  We have good plans in the climate action plan and the national development plan, but we need to be quick in delivering them and also make sure we get the most for the money we have.  The &euro;35 billion we have in transport will not cover all our needs or anything like it.  The same is true of the &euro;360 million we have in active travel.  While we have had difficulty ramping up spending in the past year or two, very soon we are going to have many more projects ready to go than we have funding for, so we need to get good value for money as well.</p> <p>  Anyone could look at their own example of delays due to a variety of reasons, but I might just take three examples.  They are not in any way inclusive.  I refer to the likes of what happened in Strand Road in my constituency and the likes of what is happening at the moment in Salthill.  I am touching wood thinking surely the good councillors in Galway will see the benefit of having a spectacular seafront facility for their people and for visitors to the city.  I might also take an example from Kerry where we have had an issue on the Kerry greenway, which was one of the earliest projects, based on the old railway line to Cahersiveen.  There are different aspects to all three examples.  I hope some of the concerns will be addressed by the planning reform review the Attorney General is carrying out, for example, on Strand Road.  I must be careful.  I do not want to question judgments.  It is not going against a court decision, but there is a real issue as to whether we sometimes over-apply the likes of the application of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.  I do not think many other countries in Europe apply it in some of the ways that we are applying it and I do not think it was designed in that way.  Often, projects that would help the environment are being delayed and have to go through hoops that I do not think the original directive was designed for them to go through.  I say that without any criticism of any individual decision.  I hope the Attorney General's review will help make it a lot clearer and a lot easier, whether one is an objector, a developer or just a citizen who wants the services.  That could provide significant certainty.  The same applies in the Kerry decision.  I hope the court decisions there will help us to get to good agreements with all landowners across the country quickly and not necessarily to gilt-edge everything, but to be able to deliver as many kilometres of network as we can.</p> <p>  When it comes down to it, the decision in Salthill is probably the most immediately interesting one, because a lot of what we need to do will not always be popular.  There will be a lot of benefit for people, but if we are to provide a safe space, which is what we need for active travel, it does require taking space, whether that is from car parking or taking a lane out.  That is where we need to go more than building out.  Building out is expensive and it requires compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, and additional land.  Covid gave us the opportunity to free up space because people were not commuting as much.  We must use some of that space quickly to provide a safe space, in particular for walking and cycling.  Those decisions are political decisions for local councils in particular.  I hope councils across the country will see this as an opportunity and they will be willing sometimes to make hard decisions.</p> <p>  With regard to the metro, the exact same thing applies in terms of speed and urgency.  Our public procurement process is so long and drawn out that it adds cost to projects.  Increasingly, in this current inflationary environment, time is money.  I have full confidence in Peter Walsh and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  I have seen the business case which we are getting ready to go to the Government.  It is a very good business case.  TII is highly capable.  It is probably the best agency in the State in terms of delivering large infrastructure projects.  I will be honest.  I am not certain that we must have this sequential process where we have two or three years in planning and then two or three years of procurement and then X number of years.  What I would be looking to see is if we could not co-ordinate in some way and do some of that work concurrently.</p></speech>

We want the big transport infrastructure projects built.  It does take a long time to build.  The physical reality of getting from Lissenhall to Ranelagh is not a small project.  It is huge and the complexity of it is not insignificant.  I do not believe that people should look on the 2035 date as an inevitability.  I believe it is our job to shorten that and to deliver it sooner if we can at all possible.</p></speech>

They are very much city orientated.  To date, electric buses are not working on the long distance Bus &Eacute;ireann routes.  That is one of the reasons we put three trial hydrogen buses on the longer distance routes.  To date, the battery electric buses are more suited to shorter distances.  A total of 165 electric buses are being contracted.  That is the big investment in public transport this year.  I refer in particular to the purchase of new battery electric trains, the intercity railcar, ICR, the rail carriages and the electric buses for rural and regional services.  We will have a significant increase in capacity.  We need it to coincide with BusConnects, which will require greater frequency and new services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and the National Transport Authority, NTA, are going to have to be clever because the patterns of demand may be changing post Covid, so there will be a fair bit of flexibility as to where they go.  The more those buses and those rail carriages go in, the more we can increase the capacity on the overall systems.  That is what they are designed to do.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of questions.  Am I right in saying the overall Department budget is down by 6%?  Is that a trend the Minister expects to continue?  What is the headline figure in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1039" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#F00200"><p>That is due to Covid support.  We had an enormous budget and as that declines, the budget decreases but not in the underlying sense.  In the national development plan, a political decision was taken that for the first four or five years of the plan, housing will scoop the full pot.  That is an appropriate political decision.  However, in the second half of this decade - and my colleagues from the Department of the Environment, Communications and Climate may wish to close their ears before I say this - spending on transport will ramp up.  That is appropriate because it will take time to get some of those projects, particularly the public transport projects, ready to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1040" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#F00300"><p>On a related point, will the Minister give me a sense of what he will do to encourage people back onto public transport?  He said the Covid supports account for a significant part of that 6% budget decrease.  We have provided &euro;208 million to subsidise the public service obligation, PSO, routes on top of what would normally be given.  It seems strange there would be such a massive additional subvention for our public transport services at this time.  It was fair enough during the pandemic when people were encouraged not to use public transport.  Should we take this opportunity to encourage people onto public transport?  It is fair enough to encourage people back onto public transport but it would be better again to encourage people onto public transport for the first time.  That would align well with our climate objectives and modal shift.  I understand a piece of work has been done on the youth travel card, and the Minister might give us an update as to when that will happen and how it will affect the private operators, but is there a big idea from Government to reduce fares or anything else to encourage people back onto public transport in 2022?</p></speech>

Does public transport have a big role to play in that regard?  The Minister is dealing with the dual issues, one of which is encouraging people onto public transport, which has considerable benefits for climate change.  I often use the train and am a great believer in public transport.  The other issue is that of the cost of living.  Does the Department of Transport have a role to play in the Government's measures and the announcement it will make around the cost of living for people at the moment?</p></speech>

On the wider point, Deputy O'Rourke is right.  I will go back to what I said about this moment as we come out of Covid-19.  Hybrid working and working from home have become realities, which is a positive development for towns and suburbs around the country because people will increasingly be working, living and staying in what might previously have been a commuter town for Dublin, Cork, Galway or Limerick.  Life will be brought back into those towns as people work from home, shop locally and so on.  That is positive.  However, it will lead to very changing transport patterns.  The reality is we are going to have to adjust our public transport system to suit that.</p> <p>  We are still providing significant Covid supports this year, to the tune of over &euro;200 million, as the Deputy said.  One of the reasons we expect to fully utilise that money is that our public transport numbers, according to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to whom I spoke during the week, are still only approximately 60% of pre-Covid numbers.  As we all know, the level of commuting is not back to anything like the level it was.  Tourism numbers are not there and even the level of socialising is probably still below what it was historically.  Our numbers are still down and the job is to get them back up.  How can we do that?  The youth travel card is one perfect way to do it because it is fundamental for those under 24 that we provide a 50% reduction in fares.  It has taken some time, and will still take a number of weeks, to roll it out.  We expect it before the end of April, initially on the PSO routes.  They are much easier for us to administer and manage in this way because they are interoperable and fully accounted for, as it were.  Commercial bus operations are useful and brilliant services but we do not set the prices for commercial bus operations.  Those operators set their own prices and, understandably, the same accounting mechanisms do not apply to them as those which apply for PSO services.  We are going to concentrate on the PSO routes first.</p> <p>  I will return to something I spoke to Deputy Duncan Smith about.  My belief is that we need to look at some of the BusConnects measures, which are starting to be rolled out.  Three more BusConnects routes in Dublin will be rolled out this year, two of which are already up and running.  As soon as we get BusConnects through planning in different cities, I will be looking for political support in councils across the country to look at some of the elements that can be accelerated.  There might be some instances, for example, where a bus gate could be put in.  That does not mean any trees must be chopped down or anyone's front garden will have to be taken or any pavement has to be broken up.  It may involve those areas where we can reorganise the traffic management system in this post-Covid time to give public transport a massive boost through more efficient timing, greater priority and so on.  That does not require huge budget expense.  It requires political commitment.  To put a bus gate into Rathmines main street, to use an example from my constituency, does not cost anything.  It is a traffic management measure and I will be looking to see are there examples such as that which we can accelerate ahead of what was originally planned.  If we do not, what will happen is traffic volumes will increase to fill the road space and make it difficult for the public transport system to work.  We are already seeing that happen.  We need to give the system a leg-up and more than anything else, we can do that through the allocation of space.</p></speech>

They are and remain a significant barrier.  If we are already providing additional subsidies to the public transport network when they are running well below capacity, there is real opportunity to do something in that regard.</p> <p>  The Minister pointed to the issue of hybrid working.  Another issue that frustrates people is the lack of flexibility in the tax-saver scheme for people who are working in the city two or three days a week.  There seems to have been no movement from the NTA or the Department in that regard.  Is that something that is being considered and on which there will be movement?  Can we expect to hear about that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1050" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#F01300"><p>I happened to have discussions with some of my officials on that topic this week.  Everyone recognises that the old system, which assumes everyone is commuting five days a week for 30, 40 or more weeks per year, is no longer most people's lived experience.  The NTA is engaging with partners to look at options to deliver more flexible projects.  Everyone wants to do that.  I was explaining one of the difficulties in this area to Deputy Nash in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  Let us apply that notion to the Luas, for example.  In that case, it could be done tomorrow because with the Leap card system, which is a swipe-in and swipe-out system, people could easily measure how many days a week they are using it or allocate a certain amount of days and use it up to that threshold.</p><p>On a rail or bus system, we do not have those swipes on and off.  We do not have the data on the number of days per week or what journeys people take.  The absence of that data is a complication that makes it difficult.  We would ideally have a two- or three-day week taxsaver system.  Currently, the infrastructure is not there to back that up, which is why the NTA is taking time to look at every option and come up with a practical workaround solution.</p></speech>

I have experience of trying to be committed to public transport while working part-time.  The minute one moves away from it and back into the car, one saves time and money.  From a policy perspective, that is the wrong incentive and needs to be addressed.  There is huge opportunity to encourage people onto public transport if we make it make sense for them.  If people are increasingly hybrid working, the option of public transport will be more attractive than if they worked and commuted full time.  It behoves the Department, the NTA and all the stakeholders to do everything to resolve that.</p></speech>

Cost is a factor for many people.  At one stage, Irish Rail was pushing people to go online.  It brought the fares down and there was a huge uptake.  It is something that I ask be considered.  I take it the Minister has a submission gone into the Government from his Department on the issue.  I wish him well with that.  I will respect his decision not to comment.</p></speech>

It does not seem to operate exclusively across the board.</p> <p>  I want to get my head clear on something on page 3 of the briefing document.  In the programme for Government it says the ratio of spending on public transport to that on roads will be 2:1.  That is under the capital programme.  I am seeing that active travel is &euro;356 million and sustainable mobility is &euro;900 million.  That is roughly 50% of the capital budget.  Will the Minister elaborate on where the 2:1 is at?</p></speech>

Many are close to construction or in construction and there is ability to deliver on all those.  It is not the same in public transport.  We have not had a history or policy of promoting public transport in the State.  As a result, projects are only now coming to the planning phase, including DART+, metro and BusConnects.  Without being critical of any individual, there was a mistake in allowing a gap to open where we had no public transport projects in construction in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick or around the country.</p> <p>  We are turning that around.  The Connecting Ireland bus programme is one of the most significant and important new projects in public transport in the history of the State.  The BusConnects projects for all five cities are hugely significant and will be delivered.  Going back to what I said in the previous discussion, we can start delivering some of those elements.  We are already starting to roll them out.  Irish Rail was starved of investment over the years but that is being reversed.  There are the likes of the DART+ programme and the Cork metropolitan rail.  We will build DART for Cork in a short number of years.  I think we can do the same in Limerick.</p></speech>

The number of new grant-aided vehicles purchased will go from 6,000 to 18,000 this year.  There were 5,000 or some huge number purchased in January.  That would represent a threefold increase.</p><p>The number of grant-aided electric vehicle charging points has only doubled from 400.  Could there be an acceleration of the roll-out of charging points in terms of their location and the speed at which people can charge?  There is a public appetite to switch to electric vehicles.  It is clearly evident.  One of the features people mention is the lack of charging points.  There is a level of insecurity that people may not be able to make a full trip without stopping at a charging point.  The journey from Limerick to Dublin is an example.  What can be done to expedite the roll-out of charging points?</p></speech>

The Department will be publishing or finalising in the coming weeks to two months a full electric vehicle strategy on the best way to do it.  We are working in particular with local authorities.  We have to start looking at experimenting.  In rural areas this issue is much less of a problem.  In a one-off house in the country home charging is very easy and an immediate solution.</p></speech>

I actively go out and ask people.  In every estate we go into someone has a car charging.  The one issue that is raised is the location of charging points and the speed at which cars can be charged.  There is a belief that being on a motorway, for example the motorway from Limerick to Dublin, eats into the battery and uses it a bit quicker.  The only way we can overcome this is with additional charging points.  The batteries are getting bigger and they will get stronger.  What can be done at a policy level to expedite this if people are buying electric cars?</p></speech>

I believe petrol stations will have to switch over to cater for electric vehicles.  I will detail my personal experience without promoting any one brand.  Over the past year I have driven around the country a fair bit in an electric vehicle.  Those stations with high-speed fast charging are out there and they are the ones I am using.  They are the ones that will get the patronage.  The revenue will be in the coffee dock and in the shop.</p></speech>

There is a spend of &euro;225,000 this year.  National Broadband Ireland came before the committee recently.  Is the Minister satisfied with the pace of the roll-out of broadband?  Does he believe the taxpayer is getting value for money?  What is his overall perspective on where the roll-out of broadband is at present?</p></speech>

It is our job to kick everything on.  From my experience, and I said this in opposition as well as in government, the team we have in place in the Department is world-class in terms of skills, composition and dedication.  National Broadband Ireland is giving it full throttle.  It is in its interests for this to accelerate.  It wants to get customers.  It wants to pass as many houses as possible.  There have been obstacles.  The committee knows this better than anyone.  Many of those obstacles have been overcome.  We had obstacles with regard to getting planning permission for poles to go in.  Through very active engagement with local authorities, in fairness to them, they were overcome.  There is a very particular and significant obstacle at present in terms of the quality of some of the ducting and the need for resolutions on a far more frequent basis than had been predicted or expected.  The delay in getting some of these ducting issues cleared is one of the reasons it has been delayed.  I am confident these difficulties will be overcome.  The structure and teams involved are highly capable and highly committed.</p></speech>

The Minister is probably aware that Shannon Airport has no European hub connectivity.  It does have flights to Heathrow.  Aer Lingus was supposed to go ahead with a route from Shannon to Paris Charles de Gaulle in March 2020.  Covid intervened and we have also had Brexit.  Because of Brexit, Shannon Airport is exposed because we do not have direct hub connectivity with Europe.  The Minister is aware of the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  It is for dealing with the impacts of Brexit.  Is the Department willing to consider Shannon Airport making a case that the Department would apply under the Brexit adjustment reserve fund in Europe for funding under a public service order for a route to be established to a hub such as Amsterdam?  There would not be a cost to the Exchequer.  It would be a cost to the Brexit adjustment fund.</p> <p>  Ireland has been allocated &euro;920 million overall.  It is the largest single contribution.  This funding is available for Departments and the Government to make an application.  I understand any application would have to come from the relevant Department.  I am trying to find something that would not be a charge directly on the Irish Exchequer.  This would come from a fund that is there.</p> <p>  Shannon Airport has been heavily impacted by Brexit.  We are the only Irish international airport that does not have direct European hub connectivity.</p></speech>

Throughout the Covid pandemic, we have looked, on a number of occasions and in a variety of ways, at what we can do to help some of our airports, particularly Cork and Shannon.  We looked in real detail at what can be done.  Even though the Chairman's suggestion involves funding coming from Europe and so on, it would, in effect, still be a PSO-type operation.</p></speech>

I am always impressed when he comes here and can rattle off the names of villages and various places.  He has a very good geographical knowledge and I was brimming with optimism when he mentioned Cratloe and some of the other stations on that rail line.  We hope to see progress in this regard and that the Minister will plough on with it.  We really want to see some of those projects in the mid-west delivered.</p> <p>  At the previous meeting he attended, I referenced the pricing of rail tickets.  I hope he will forgive me if this is repetition but it is an important point.  For my family of two adults and three children, a return rail trip to Dublin this coming Saturday to visit the zoo would cost &euro;150.90, which is the lowest fare I could find.  That is a return journey of four hours and 20 minutes.  It would cost &euro;152 to take me and my family from Amsterdam to Munich on a sleeper train, involving overnight travel.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the chronically high cost of rail services in Ireland.  I have already bought my ticket to travel by train to Dublin next Wednesday to attend the D&aacute;il because I know what time I need to be there.  It is possible to get cheaper fares when making travel plans a week or two weeks' ahead.  However, for parents who want to load all the children onto the train, it may cost &euro;150.  The same journey would cost me approximately &euro;40 in fuel if I were to drive from door to door.</p> <p>  People will only make the modal shift the Minister and all of us in this room want them to make when it makes sense from a pounds, shillings and pence point of view.  I know much of the answer is to be found beyond this room.  There is a role for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and it is to do with PSOs.  There really is a need for the Government to lead on this, grasp the nettle of expensive tickets and work to make rail travel cheap and viable.  The Minister is a fan of the train, as am I, and our colleague, Deputy Matthews, who is often at these meetings, is an even bigger fan.  In continental Europe, one can get across several countries for the same cost as travelling from Ennis or Limerick to Dublin and back.  That is wrong.</p></speech>

He should by all means share his thoughts with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He has a tough job, as do we all, in allocating scarce resources.  It might be useful for the Deputy to share some of his thinking with him.</p></speech>

I want to talk about new aviation.  I had a meeting in Shannon Airport yesterday and the people there are very excited about the return of transatlantic routes in March and the new summer routes out of the airport.  As the Chairman said, they want to build more routes and more connectivity.  One of the areas of real potential for Shannon, of which we are only scratching the surface, is new aviation.  Last October, FedEx launched a drone from Shannon, which delivered a parcel across the Shannon Estuary to Foynes.  We have a hub of testing facilities around Shannon looking at new aviation.  The one issue we have not looked at yet is hydrogen-powered flight.  We saw the first such commercial flight take off in December and many European countries, particularly Italy and Germany, are seizing all available European money to look into sustainable aviation.  It is where people are going.  There is a crazy irony that teenagers will go on the Internet and buy a pair of jeans that has to be shipped across the world but they may feel guilty about travelling on an aeroplane because of the environmental footprint.  People will increasingly look to sustainable travel, particularly for international journeys.  Is there anything the Minister hopes to lead out from his Department beyond scratching the surface in this area?  We need to go deep and ensure we are leaders, as we always were in the Shannon region, on sustainable aviation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#J01000"><p>Again, I agree with the Deputy.  We are only at the concept stage in this area, as are all countries.  When we read all the reports about great hydrogen plans, and there is evidence going into it now, we must remember that we are all at an early stage.  It is not yet clear and certain what exactly the alternative fuels will be.  There is a variety of potential options as well as different modes and capabilities, including, as the Deputy mentioned, hauling goods across the Shannon Estuary with a drone.</p> <p>  I said on the radio earlier that I am looking forward to my visit to Shannon Airport on Friday.  Shannon may have more potential than anywhere else to be a location for developing and testing such new solutions.  It has a great history, including the use of flying boats, and was, in effect, our first real point of connection.  Looking further south to Valentia Island, it was the first telecommunications connection with north-west America.  Shannon has a very long runway and can take very heavy payloads, which can increase efficiency.  It also has a small geographical benefit in being furthest west.  If we are looking at the very large volume of transatlantic traffic from Europe to America, Shannon, even just at a concept level, has a comparative competitive advantage.  As it happens, it is also in a location that will probably offer one of our greatest sources of clean renewable energy, with offshore wind that can be brought ashore and a very strong grid, the Moneypoint lines being very close.  It has very advanced manufacturing and a very large transport industry hub.  For that variety of reasons, there is great potential there.</p> <p>  At the Glasgow COP conference, I made the case for Shannon to the chief executive of United Airlines and a number of other people involved in the industry.  We started initial talks about whether they would be interested if we had some sort of hub where we could test latest technologies.  Governments providing that sort of safe-place location to test new sustainable transport systems makes a lot of sense.  It is only at a concept phase but it may be something that gives Shannon an advantage over other airports and destinations.</p></speech>

He is pushing an open door in Shannon.  There is a lot already happening, he and the industry are interested in it and there is funding in Europe to guide and steer it forward.  I hope it will be pursued further.</p> <p>  I must leave shortly to attend the D&aacute;il but I have two more brief questions.  The EU directive on the common system of VAT was amended in December, which potentially paves the way for action on the cost of bicycles.  I cycled here today, as I am sure did the Minister.  However, bicycles are still very costly.  In fact, they have become more costly at a time we want more people using them.  Is the Minister looking seriously, with his colleague, the Minister for Finance at having zero VAT on bicycles?</p> <p>  My final question relates to wind turbines.  I know this straddles two Departments and we had a chat about it only a few weeks ago.  I understand the guidelines are in the Minister's Department before they go back to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is crucial that they be updated.  The current guidance is grossly outdated, going back to 2006.  There are two sides of the coin when it comes to people's views on turbines.  In fact, most of us take a middle position in that we embrace renewable energy but are concerned by what we are seeing in some locations.  In parts of County Clare, there is a proliferation of turbines, some of them twice the height of Big Ben, the famous clock in the heart of London.  The siting of turbines in Gougane Barra in west Cork was on the news last night.  They are springing up everywhere.  They are positive on one hand but there is a proliferation of them in some parts of Ireland.  When I get the train, once I pass the Curragh towards Dublin, I do not see a single one.  They all seem to be dotted along the west coast.</p> <p>  When will we get the updated guidelines?  People will tolerate a certain number of turbines but it has now got to the point of proliferation and dumping on communities.  We need more rigorous guidelines that allow the industry to function - it, too, wants updated guidance - but also give some safeguarding to communities.  At the moment, we are nowhere.</p></speech>

There is a wider strategic move to offshore and away from onshore.  There will still be onshore wind development but there are certain capacity limits to that, including the needs of communities, the requirements of the grid and the fact that the efficiency, capacity and power resource is in the north-west Atlantic in particular.  The further north and north west we go, the more that power is available.</p></speech>

There is a real difficulty regarding how they would be applied.  There is real uncertainty as to how they could be applied.  That is the reason there has been such delay and difficulty.  What we do not want to do is add to confusion, uncertainty or public controversy by having guidelines we cannot enforce, measure or monitor.  That is the reason why they have been delayed and why there is such difficulty around them.</p></speech>

VAT rates are not easily adjusted or changed.  The Minister for Finance rightly protects that because it is often seen as such an easy solution to every problem.  My experience is that VAT rate reduction is not the easiest one to get over the line and it is not centre stage in the plans.  The key thing for active travel is safe space.  That is what is holding people back from taking to bikes in even greater numbers.</p></speech>

Being environmentally minded is in some people's DNA and they are already making modal shifts in their lives but for others, it will not be until it changes what is in their pockets - pounds, shillings and pence.  The cost of living has been a national debate this week.  As many people will make the modal shift when it makes sense economically, in that regard, there needs to be a bit of carrot and stick - more carrot than stick, of course.  Things like reducing VAT and making the train to Dublin much cheaper than going in the car will eventually get families and individuals off the armchair and on to the bike rather than taking the diesel or petrol engine car.  I think pounds, shillings and pence still matter to a lot of people.  I hope the Minister can lead that within Cabinet.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about people feeling safe.  Obviously, we saw the terrible tragedy that befell Ashling Murphy.  I was reflecting on the security aspect of greenways earlier today.  If people are to use greenways, they must feel safe.  Obviously, councils are rolling out most of the greenways.  What is being done in terms of the planning and design of greenways in terms of installing cameras and making areas safe because that is the one core element in terms of encouraging people to engage in active travel - walking, running or cycling?  People must feel safe.  Has policy changed in this area?  Are there areas the Minister can change or put resources into in order that when a local authority is building anything relating to active travel, a core element of that must be the provision of a safe environment for the public using it?  The acid test for me is whether a man, woman or family - obviously women are particularly vulnerable - feels safe.</p></speech>

It is not just about active travel.  It also relates to public transport in particular.  There was a very good research paper on this issue.  It is by design from start, particularly around bus stops, stations, public transport itself and active travel routes.  We need incorporate this thinking at every turn in everything we do.</p></speech>

There is a need for the Department to ask all local authorities to carry out an audit of their current active travel facilities, including greenways, to ensure they are safe.  I am not in any way questioning whether local authorities have done it but at the same time, certain points come along.  The murder of Ashling Murphy was utterly tragic.  Her parents were down in Limerick.  They are exceptional people.  Is it something the Minister is looking at?</p></speech>

There was a considerable amount of conversation around the investors.  Peter Hendrick has told us that on some level, the investor profile he has is not the investor profile he wants.  He spoke about two things.  One of them was how at some stage, NBI would become some sort of European super-telecoms outfit - I am not entirely sure how.  Beyond that, he also spoke about ensuring that one had somebody who was in it for the long haul.  I imagine this would be a telecoms investor.  Anyway, that is what it is.  Has there been discussion with the Minister about any of those possible investors or ensuring the viability of the entire project?</p></speech>

It has some of our best journalists and does really good reporting.  Obviously, there was real concern in some of the stories.  They raised issues around ownership structures and so on.  In response to that, we immediately commissioned independent legal and accounting review advice at the highest level to see whether we need to act and go further.  I have to be straight up.  There was a quick turnaround but the response from the independent review conducted by the lawyers and accountants, EY and William Fry, was that what had happened was as per the contract and normal business practice.  We responded immediately by asking for an independent assessment, which told us that it was within the contract and within business norms.</p></speech>

I know there were certain fears around performance bonds being paid early and people thought it was a possible cash flow issue but I accept the argument that this was not the case.  Has there been any further communication relating to any possible future investors?  Perhaps we are not that far along.</p></speech>

Nobody is happy that this has not reached the deadlines.  There is an acceptance regarding the Covid delays.  I will ask a couple of questions rather than have a couple of pieces of paper cross over.  Are we fairly sure 60,000 premises will be reached by the end of March?  Do we have what will be the new figure for the end of this year?  I know it was somewhere between 100,000 and 130,000 but it was to be firmed up.  Are we still talking about June for the piece on the acceleration?  I know it is twofold.</p><p>It involves the catch-up owing to Covid, the figure for which is a little higher than it was, and reducing the timeframe for the whole project to what NBI has said is six years.  We had all hoped it would be five but at this stage we need to ensure it can be reduced to six.</p></speech>

Despite the best of intentions, several areas will not see broadband rolled out for some years.  There may be interim solutions, some of which may involve engagement with providers, including those providing low-Earth-orbit satellite broadband.  I suppose it is getting to a point whereby we can say to people that we intend to get to them in year four while also presenting them with the available alternatives.  That task force may be the body capable of doing this work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#L01800"><p>May I make a point on working with industry?  It concerns the wider, national picture.  Almost ten years ago, the idea of task forces and collaboration in what is an inherently competitive market was touted.  The approach involves open-access networks, shared ducting and such elements.  That approach has actually delivered for us as a country.  While we have had some difficulties and delays in the roll-out of broadband nationally, the wider national picture - it is important to be aware of this - shows we are shooting up the international league tables in terms of high-speed broadband access.  The really significant investment being made across a variety of operators, which are competing to get to the householder as quickly as possible with fibre, means we are starting to see really high-speed broadband roll-out right across the country.  Obviously, the national broadband area has specific characteristics; that is why it exists.  The decision on it was the correct strategic decision.  It will be delivered upon.  That will put the country in a remarkably strong position.  Whether delivery is in five, six or seven years, it will happen.  Practically universal access to high-speed fibre broadband affords us the potential to be transformative because it means we can roll out public services, educational and other services-----</p></speech>

In some cases, there are plenty of people who will have the capacity and ability and who will do the due diligence work and research.  What we are talking about is just engaging with those stakeholders that might provide interim solutions for those who will be waiting several years.  Could the mobile phone and broadband task force be the body that could do some of this work?</p></speech>

We want it to consider this work and the idea of getting the State to do it, probably resulting in better engagement between constituents and Deputies on broadband provision.  This is an alternative to our submitting requests to telecommunications companies on the basis of what they cannot do, particularly regarding the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  I realise I am probably out of time.  I want to follow up on Deputy O'Rourke's remarks on the NTA.  We are all aware of the value of remote working and we all realise people are considering the idea of hybrid working.  A flexible tax-saver scheme is logical in this regard.  The NTA seems to have jettisoned this idea in the past while.  I accept what the Minister is saying about obstacles but we knew about those beforehand.  The NTA had said it was working on the matter and at times gave dates for completion.  What is the timeline?  Before we even have the infrastructure in place, could we not consider offering people the facility in question?  We could introduce the tests afterwards.</p></speech>

I would be very open to members of the committee showing me technological solutions that we could implement realistically at the railway stations in Dundalk and Drogheda.

Is it not possible in the short term to go back to something that is almost prehistoric, such as the practice of clicking tickets?  Is there not a viable short-term solution?</p></speech>

The extension of the Leap card areas, such as into Mallow, could be considered.  There are possible initiatives and we should consider all options.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked why the commitment was not delivered upon and whether the complexity was not understood.  It required an examination of how to proceed to find there were technical problems.  That is the only reason-----</p></speech>

The Minister will not die of shock if I speak about electrification, particularly in respect of the Enterprise line.  We are still talking about 2027 as the date for delivery on that.  I am working on the basis, whatever the outworkings of this review, that the resources will be in place to deliver it, with all the caveats surrounding planning, etc.</p></speech>

It was a very large consultation, especially in the North and, as I understand it, in the desire for connectivity to the north west, which makes a lot of sense, including quite radical solutions-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#M00300"><p>Anybody who has ever looked at that map will see there is no rail in the north west.</p></speech>

That would require UK Government funding.  Nichola Mallon and I had meetings with Sir Peter Hendy twice on this issue to make the case.</p> <p>  Separately, the reality of the rail review is that it expanded from initially looking at the high speed Dublin-Belfast-Cork line to a much wider consideration of freight and other underutilised rail lines, such as Waterford-Limerick and the western rail corridor.  It will be very all-encompassing.  I am looking forward to seeing the results.  As we just talked about, I hope it will come up with innovative solutions to optimise the existing network and, where appropriate, expand it.  It is very expensive to expand the network but, to go back to the issue of Limerick and four underutilised rail lines in and out of a city, it is about whether we can optimise existing assets under the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, strategic direction.  I do not think we are making the best use of the existing network.   </p></speech>

We will have a level of engagement regarding it.  It is interesting what the Minister said about local authorities, EV infrastructure and the fact that there has probably not been a sufficient amount of work done.  That is something we probably need to butt into, for want of a better term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#M00600"><p>We need to get some understanding of the whole issue of the grid and the ESB.  There are technical issues, but the one thing that is coming across from the general public is there is a major appetite for the purchase of electric cars.  People are now, in many cases, holding back.  There is a tide in the affairs of men and, at present, electric vehicles are something the public has very much bought into, but there is a reluctance in some quarters regarding how far they can go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-09a.1181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2022020900002#M00700"><p>In fairness, somebody came to me from the other perspective.  He is a mechanic and a car salesperson who was clear in saying to me that he has an agenda in that he wants to sell more cars.  I know he had approached the local authority.  I assume a greater number of those conversations need to happen, but they have to go beyond that and towards putting operational projects in place wherever we can.  If we do not, especially if the funding is there,  it will be a misstep and we will all miss out.  Even when someone looks at buying a car, the first consideration is not being caught out in the sense of not having the infrastructure to deliver.  This will probably be fine in two, three or four years, but that will only be the case if we do that groundwork now.  We have to do a chase on that.</p> <p>  I will very quickly raise a few issues before I leave the meeting.  There have been a significant number of conversations about cybersecurity.  The Minister also spoke about the likes of the wind energy investments we will be talking about into the future.  Some of this may necessarily fall under defence, but it is that difficulty of cyber to physical and ensuring that we have all the capacity necessary.  The last thing I will ask the Minister relates to the An Post taskforce.  Where are we on that piece of work?  It is all about the sustainability and viability of the network.  </p></speech>

An Post is facing a difficult transition but one it is successfully managing as letter post decreases and parcel deliveries increase.  The company is expanding significantly in the latter area.  The real key is also expanding the post office network as a supplier of government services, for example, the one-stop shop capability we announced yesterday.  An Post has already gone into the market for retrofitting, where it brings the pieces together, which are energy expertise, finance and the management process.</p></speech>

One of the bigger issues in Adare has been the lack of a bypass.  I know the Minister has tried to get through Adare.  Once again, rail and road are not mutually exclusive.  We also need to bring people from other areas of the country, such as Cork, via the M20.  I am once again saying, and it is a philosophy of mine, that road and rail are not mutually exclusive.  I totally buy into rail but, equally, there is a serious problem in Adare with the lack of a bypass and the bottleneck.  The bypass is before An Bord Plean&aacute;la at present and we are looking at the M20 project coming forward as well.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that Adare has a serious problem with traffic.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with Adare and it is clogged with traffic.  When that bypass goes in, and it is in planning at present, we should be radical in looking at mechanisms to really reassess the public space and possibly move away from through traffic.  A village like Adare would really benefit from that sort of space.</p></speech>

It is due to come through An Bord Plean&aacute;la imminently.  I presume it is something that the Department will very much factor in.  I know the Minister is under time pressure.</p></speech>

I have concerns about regional balance, how it will be achieved and how it is playing out in practice.  I am looking at two issues in particular.  The first is the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, review.</p><p>As I understand it, DART+ and MetroLink are included in that review.  My colleagues in the west of Ireland are concerned that the proposed western arc project is not included, and that that does and will put that region at a considerable disadvantage between now and 2030 in respect of accessing European funding.</p></speech>

Subject to the strategic rail review, however, we will be able to go back to the European Commission and reconsider this aspect.  If the rail review were to come up with recommendations in that regard, then that would help us in being able to go back and reopen this issue with the European Commission.</p></speech>

The concern is that this TEN-T review closes the door for a considerable period.  The Minister is saying that is not the case.</p></speech>

The strategic rail review is designed to give us that capability.</p></speech>

On a related point, we asked specific questions about the NTA funding for active travel projects undertaken in 2021, broken down by local authorities and other bodies.  We did the same for cycling and walking projects in 2021.  The geographic spread of such projects is incredibly stark in respect of the advantage enjoyed by certain areas.  I appreciate that we are not always comparing like with like.</p> <p>  To give some examples, University College Dublin, UCD, in the south of Dublin, got &euro;607,389 in funding.  Meanwhile, County Laois got &euro;413,100 and County Westmeath received &euro;205,000.  Those are the smaller figures.  As might be expected, the Dublin local authorities got significant allocations.  Those local authorities that I mentioned in the midlands, however, are in the just transition area, which is most impacted by the effects of the transition away from fossil fuels.  They are particularly disadvantaged in this transition and they seem to be faring poorly in the allocation of State funding.  I wonder how the Government will ensure that there is going to be an element of fairness and equity in these schemes.</p></speech>

To a certain extent, however, much of this is in some ways demand-led, although that might not be the right word.  It does require-----</p></speech>

I refer to this being a case of the survival of the fittest and of first up, best dressed.  When it comes to local authorities competing to see who will be the best dressed, for me it is no coincidence that these schemes were launched in the Dublin suburbs.  I say that with the greatest of respect for those areas; they are as entitled to fight their case as anybody else.  There is a particular challenge here, however, that must be recognised and addressed.  I refer to ensuring there is capacity at local government level to avail of these schemes and to put them to use.  I say that because everybody has an equal right to have liveable towns and villages.</p></speech>

In the broader context of this planned climate transition, the fundamental underlying political reality we must live up to is that every place and every person matters.  It cannot be a situation of rural versus urban.  We must try to provide for both.  Much of this would come down to local authorities saying they are not resourced and that they do not have the resources to be able to apply for these schemes.  It is not because of a lack of will or a lack of interest.  If that were the case, then they would have a real problem.  We provided significant new numbers of engineering staff, particularly for active travel projects around the country, and, to be honest, it was not just the rural local authorities that were slow in this regard.  Dublin City Council, DCC, did not fill its positions either.  It beggars my mind as to why that was the case.</p></speech>

Having spoken to people in my region, they would say their local authority got additional staff, but they came from the local authority next door.  In turn, that same local authority which got the extra staff might also have lost staff to its neighbouring local authority.  Therefore, I understand that this endeavour will take time.  What I am saying, in the context of an initial exploration of the practical outworking of this significant State investment, is that it does not seem to be equally distributed across the State.  This is something that may require intervention in future</p></speech>

Greenways are connected to active travel; they are not separate.  That body does undertake its considerations and operate in a national context, and that may help in connecting everything up.</p></speech>

We can be frustrated by projects not having reached particular stages, of course.  Those interactive maps exist for the Twenty-six Counties.  The Minister already has a long list of things to be done in this area, but I think we should map the projects now under way in this context and have them interactive in respect of where they stand in the context of this roll-out.</p></speech>

It is under great pressure and hauliers took to the streets before Christmas.  The Minister met with members of the representative bodies, and he indicated that some moves would be made after Christmas.  What is he doing for that sector and what does he intend to do for it?  Will anything be included for this sector in the cost-of-living proposals to be announced?  Equally, has consideration been given to supporting the sector in making the transition to using engines and fuels which give rise to low carbon emissions?</p></speech>

They have a good reputation in respect of how they represent their members and how they have worked with the Department over the years.  Even recently, in the context of some of the Covid-19 measures, the members of the IRHA played a helpful role in the context of the flexibility we needed.  The same applied with Brexit as well.  This issue of high fuel prices is not an easy one to resolve, to be up front and honest about it.  We have had extensive discussions with the Department of Finance and we are looking at a range of different options in this regard.  I do not think the cost-of-living proposals to be announced tomorrow will be the time to deal with this aspect.  What will be announced then will be a small number of more general measures for the wider population.</p> <p>  We have, however, committed to talking to the representatives of the road hauliers again to explore what we can do for the sector.  Whatever it is we do, it must help in the decarbonisation of society.  There is no point in us going down the wrong road and delaying this transition.  I am keen to try to support the haulage industry in adapting and to help it thrive.  It is typically often a low-margin industry, with many good small family businesses.  The supports the Deputy referred to will not be contained in the measures to be announced tomorrow.  As I said, we must go back to the hauliers to drill down further into how we can work together on this issue.</p></speech>

The hauliers have protested on the streets twice now.  The economic challenge posed to them has not got any easier.  There are aspects that could be addressed, including, for example, the fuel rebate and the alternative fuels excluded from that measure.  If one speaks to hauliers, they will point out the types of supports they require to move towards Euro 6-compliant vehicles, or an alternative.  Equally, some of the schemes we have are oversubscribed.  There is an opportunity here to undertake both endeavours, but the hauliers must be supported.</p></speech>

The European transport plan is to move away from such fuel rebates.  It is effectively being said that they will come to an end.  Therefore, there are no easy silver-bullet measures in this regard.  I refer to the use of alternative fuels and alternative engines.</p><p>My own view is we should look to see whether we can make the journeys quicker and help hauliers through improved journey times in a variety of ways.  It is not just about the fuels.  We could also look at our haulage system in the context of the ongoing wider haulage strategy, in addition to the rail strategy review.  Can we devise new haulage systems that mean hauliers are running empty less and so are getting paid more?  We need to look at a whole range of different options.  Can we look at alternative vehicles?  They are very expensive at present compared with diesel vehicles, but we will have to look at a variety of options.  The existing rebate scheme is the easy option, while even European directives and legislation are coming to an end.  We will have to be more creative and look at a variety of options. </p></speech>

Does that mean we have to have major capacity motorways in all cases?  To my mind, no, but we have to first and foremost focus on towns.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, launched our towns first strategy this week.
