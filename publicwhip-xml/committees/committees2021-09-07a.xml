    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#A00200"><p>I have received apologies from Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile and I welcome Senator Lynn Boylan who is substituting for him.  Our agenda is a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, on the appointment of special envoys.  We meet again this morning with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, as a follow up to last week's meeting in respect of the appointment of special envoys.  He is very welcome here today.  I also want to welcome officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, namely, Mr. Niall Burgess, Mr Joe. Hackett, Secretary General, Ms Alma N&iacute; Choigligh and Mr. Chris Donoghue.  I wish to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs for the comprehensive file of documents received before this meeting.</p> <p>  As we all know, there has been much comment in the weekend press and otherwise and about this committee.  Indeed, there has been some comment about my role as Cathaoirleach.  I wish to state that I take my responsibilities seriously as Chair of the Committee of Foreign Affairs and Defence.  Indeed, I know that all of the members of this committee take their responsibilities in a most serious manner.  The committee carries out its functions in a careful, considered and impartial manner.  This committee is very conscious of the fact that this month Ireland holds the chair of the United Nations Security Council.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Ireland's permanent representative at the United Nations, Geraldine Byrne Nason, and her team have the full support of this committee in their work.  This work is most important for Ireland and the United Nations.  Ireland can take pride in the fact that we have diplomats of the highest calibre working for Ireland and international organisations such as the United Nations.  </p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is here today at his request to provide further information and clarification on the sequence of events surrounding the proposed nomination of Katherine Zappone as a UN special envoy.  I intend to ensure that the Minister is given a fair hearing and that members of the committee will have adequate opportunity to question the Minister on matters relating to the sequence of events leading to the appointment.  I expect these proceedings to be carried out in a dignified and respectful manner.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that following the opening comments of the Minister I will open the floor to questions from members.  Each member has an eight-minute slot today to ask questions and for the Minister to respond.  There will be no grouping of members.  I will take members in order by party and group.  Should time permit, members will be called on again and allocated one minute for questions and the Minister will be allocated one minute to respond.  I remind the Minister and members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically based and located within the Leinster House complex.  I now call on the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to make his opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#B00100"><p>On a point of order, last week, following the Minister's appearance before the committee, I and other members wrote to the Chair stating, and it was certainly my belief, that the Minister gave misleading information before the committee.  I asked that he would arrange to bring the Minister back before the committee.  Subsequent to that request the Minister sent a letter to the committee on Thursday of last week.  That letter appeared in certain media outlets online before committee members received a copy of that letter.  It appears the letter was leaked to the media in advance of it coming to the committee or committee members.  This is very serious.  Not alone is it very disrespectful but it also calls the integrity of the committee into question.  What needs to happen immediately is that we write to the Business Committee and express our disquiet or unhappiness with the way the process happened.  The media had this very important letter before committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#B00200"><p>I will make two points on that, if Deputy Brady does not mind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#B00300"><p>We should also brief the Ceann Comhairle because it is totally unsatisfactory.  It shows sheer contempt by the Minister and his officials towards the committee and committee members.  I propose that we write to the Business Committee and the Ceann Comhairle to find out exactly how this happened and the exact timeline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#B00400"><p>I will make two points on this.  First, it is not a point of order.  Points of order deal with proceedings and processes of the meeting.  My next point is that I had the opportunity to speak with the Deputy directly on this issue.  The submission of any document to members of the media before members of the committee was not an issue for the committee.  It did not happen on the part of anybody in the committee.  I do not believe there is any issue to be taken further to the Business Committee or the Ceann Comhairle as far as the disposition of this committee is concerned.  We are under time constraints, as Deputy Brady well knows because he also mentioned to me the two-hour rule.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#B00500"><p>Sorry Chair, I do not accept that.  We as a committee have a duty and an obligation to find out why the media had an important piece of correspondence before this committee did.  I accept the Chair or the secretariat did not have this letter before the media did.  I accept that point.  Somebody in Fine Gael leaked this important letter to the media before it made its way to this committee.  It is incumbent on the Chair to find out how that happened and why it happened.  I am asking him as Chair to write to the Business Committee and find out how and why that letter was leaked to the media before it made its way to us as an Oireachtas committee.  I am asking the Chair and calling on other members-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#B00600"><p>That exercise will be done but I remind Deputy Brady this is not a point of order.  I also remind him that some valuable committee time is already being expended on this extraneous issue.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to make his opening statement without interruption from any member of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#B00700"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the opportunity to come before them again today.  The first thing I want to do is to apologise to all committee members for creating the circumstances that require a second hearing in a week on the same issue of the appointment of a special envoy.  Due to the sloppiness of some of my answers to their legitimate questions last week we are back here again in order, I hope, to bring clarity to outstanding issues once and for all.</p> <p>  Since last week, I have asked that all documentation available in my Department be publicly released early, in advance of the previous commitment of 8 September, to facilitate as detailed, accurate and comprehensive a presentation as possible today.</p> <p>  In recent weeks, a lot has been said and written about me in the context of Katherine Zappone and her proposed appointment as a special envoy.  The fact is that I have contributed to much of that criticism and commentary.  I have had the privilege of being in public life for 23 years as a TD, MEP and Government Minister.  I have made mistakes on that journey but this is the first time my integrity has been questioned on political actions.</p><p>While the Taoiseach understandably has sought to put some context around the political controversy of a part-time temporary appointment, in truth this has rumbled on for far too long and should have come to an end on the basis of a clear and credible explanation well before now.  A number of members asked me last week for a structured chronology of events, meetings, contacts, reports and decisions in relation to this appointment.  I was not in a position to give that level of detail last week but I certainly am now and my Department has published the files to do just that.  Before taking questions, I would like to directly address a number of issues that for understandable reasons have been raised in public commentary.  </p><p> First, Katherine Zappone did not ask me for a job at any stage.  She did text me for advice on 22 February about the possibility of working with USAID on women, gender equality and LGBTQ issues and on whether I could make an introduction for her.  That is all she looked for from me at that point and I did not respond.  Second, the idea of Katherine Zappone playing a role for the Irish Government came about from a short conversation I had with my Secretary General on 24 February after a meeting, when I raised the question as to whether she might be of use to our team at the UN.  I had not spoken to Katherine at that stage.  The Secretary General responded positively but said that he wanted to take some time to think about it.  I told Katherine Zappone of that conversation in a phone call on 26 February and agreed to come back to her when the Secretary General had any update.  </p><p> Niall Burgess subsequently came back to me a few days later, as he informed this committee last week, to say that the Biden Administration would be appointing a special envoy for LGBTI+ rights and that he was interested in the Department exploring the benefits of such a role for Ireland.  It was in that context that I raised the possibility of a special envoy with Katherine Zappone and asked her if she would be interested in such a role, should the Department develop and recommend it.  That phone call was on 3 March and triggered a text to me from Katherine the following day, enthusiastically thanking me for the opportunity.  It was not a job offer at that stage, as I made it very clear that the concept needed to be developed by the Department, which is exactly what subsequently happened as the files will show.  Looking back now, I should have been clearer with Katherine on the extent of the work needed in the Department before a formal role could be offered to her.  </p><p> I did not speak to Katherine Zappone again until 19 July, despite the fact that she had been looking for updates, and that brief conversation was just to confirm her meeting with Niall Burgess in Dublin to try to finalise matters.  In the meantime, the Department did extensive work, including a food for thought paper on 25 March, a paper on envoys in the EU, US and UK on 29 March, an initial concept note on 18 April and ultimately, a special envoy terms of reference document in July.  </p><p> I have made mistakes in recent weeks in failing to convincingly explain how this role came about, therefore contributing to what has become a political embarrassment for the Government.  Despite that, I hope that the documents before the committee today will confirm the Department's due diligence on the potential benefits of this role for Ireland and the clear suitability of Katherine Zappone for the job proposed.  My Department is now reviewing the role and appointment process of special envoys for the future.  I agree with the Taoiseach that from now on, should a special envoy be recommended, we should ensure an open, competitive process to fill any such position.  Once again, I thank members for their time and in particular their patience on this topic and I look forward to trying to respond to all of their questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister and now call Deputy Cowen.  I remind the Deputy that we are very keen to have questions to the Minister in a direct and concise manner, to which the Minister will reply.</p><p>The Deputy has a total of eight minutes in this session.  I will remind him on the expiry of seven minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chair and I thank the Minister for making himself available again.  I said at the committee last week that this appointment was wrong from the get-go.  Irrespective of blindsiding the Taoiseach or the Cabinet, it should never have been accepted.  It was not accepted, which was inevitably the case after a public backlash when questions emerged.  Many questions, as the Minister said, remain.  That is despite subsequent and extensive interviews on the "News at One", the Minister's appearance in front of the committee for more than two hours last week and texts released subsequent to that meeting by the T&aacute;naiste under a freedom of information, FOI, request, which, as the Minister said, were eventually responded to yesterday.  The perception remains that Katherine Zappone lobbied the Minister for Finance and, thereafter, the Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and, indeed, the Irish ambassador to the UN looking for a job in the UN.  It appeared from that documentation that the Minister offered her a position in March and, thereafter, officials prepared credible documentation to support the need for such a role.  Officials agreed terms with Katherine Zappone and the Minister then informed the T&aacute;naiste 12 days before the Cabinet meeting that she was very happy with what had been approved between her and Niall Burgess, the Secretary General.</p> <p>  Hopefully, as the Minister rightly said, we can finally begin to consign this saga to history and bring what some have described as melodrama to an end.  This is melodrama the Cabinet failed to nip in the bud initially and ever since because of lack of clarity, failure to adhere to FOI requests and failure to understand that Government business by text is State property and not private data between Ministers and former colleagues that can be deleted.  Is the Minister now saying that when Katherine Zappone texted him to say she was delighted with the offer, the offer was a concept which she interpreted as a job offer?  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Did officials in the Department know anything about this position prior to the Minister offering the concept to Katherine Zappone?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#D00600"><p>I am conscious that I have eight minutes and of the Chairman's warning to me because there are more questions.</p></speech>

I did not respond to that text but I spoke to the Secretary General, as he confirmed to the committee last week.  He is here again today if the Deputy wants him to make an intervention.  We spoke on 24 February and I raised the issue of whether Katherine Zappone could be of use to our team in New York.  He responded positively to that because he had worked with Katherine in the past and she was previously a special envoy, do not forget, in relation to the Security Council campaign, but he said he wanted to think about it.  I spoke to Katherine Zappone after that conversation, which is why she texted me on 26 February effectively outlining her curriculum vitae, CV, in terms of how she could be useful but there is no reference in that text to a special envoy role because there had been no discussion on a special envoy at that point.</p> <p>  Niall Burgess came back to me in early March to say the Biden Administration was putting in place a special envoy role to promote LGBTQ+ rights.  He thought it was a good idea and he wanted to explore that concept for Ireland within the Department.  That was in the context of the previous conversation we had.  I then went back to Katherine Zappone on the back of that conversation, as I said to her I would once Niall Burgess had come back to me.  I had a conversation with her on 3 March to say that the Secretary General had come back to me with a concept around a special envoy role, that that was what the US was doing and we now needed to explore it in the Department.  I asked her if she would be interested in that kind of role should it develop and should the recommendation come through.  She was very positive and excited about that possible role and that is clear in her text the following day.  However, as I said in my opening statement, it would have been helpful if I had responded to her text to clarify that it was not a job offer at that stage but simply a concept that may materialise later on, which it subsequently did.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#E00100"><p>So she was delighted with the opportunity the concept offered or potentially offered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#E00200"><p>That is what she says when she said, "Thank you so so much for offering me this impressive opportunity-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#E00400"><p>No, but I will ask Mr. Burgess to comment on that.  I know Deputy Cowen cannot ask him questions directly but I think it would be helpful if he did because it is important to say that at no point did I discuss terms and conditions with Katherine Zappone.  I specifically asked the Department to do that.  If it is helpful, I can ask Mr. Burgess to confirm that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1591" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#E00500"><p>We can do that later.  Katherine Zappone conducted work for Ireland at the UN, a fact alluded to by the Minister when he spoke about her role relating to the effort to ensure we were successful in respect of our place on the Security Council when she was a Minister in the Fine Gael-led Government.  Was the Minister given any advice by Department officials or did it occur to him whether she was entitled to seek to look, suggest or investigate the concept of a position within the UN in light of the fact there is a one-year cooling-off period for Ministers during which they are not allowed to engage in any such discussion around the prospect or concept of working within the UN or public bodies with which they interacted as Ministers?  As the Minister is aware, the handbook contains a provision and, as the Standards In Public Office Commission, SIPO, would allude to, there is legislation around a cooling-off period.  I know it caused some controversy in the past year when former Deputy John Deasy initiated the concept of lengthening that cooling-off period.  Was the Minister aware this possibly contradicted the thrust and detail of that legislation and that this may still be an issue?</p></speech>

Like any other former Minister, she must comply with legislation.  This came about on the back of Katherine Zappone reaching out for some advice from me.  I understand she spoke to the Minister for Finance late last year.  He suggested she contact me because I am Minister for Foreign Affairs.  She was clearly trying to develop a career in the UN.  She was living in New York-----</p></speech>

He claimed that at no time did he feel Katherine Zappone was lobbying for a job.</p><p>Yet it is abundantly clear that Ms Zappone not only sought a plum position that would grant her access to the UN but also undertook a campaign to lobby for that position.  She lobbied the Minister, Deputy Coveney, she lobbied the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, she lobbied the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, she even lobbied senior diplomats such as the Irish ambassador to the the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his ministerial colleagues delivered for Ms Zappone.  What has been revealed is nothing more than plain, old-fashioned political strokes which, when uncovered, led to a scramble for cover by the Minister, his officials and indeed other Ministers, deleting messages, changing stories, changing their narrative and providing misleading statements, as the Minister did last week, which has ultimately taken us to where we are now.  The Minister sought to downplay his role in the entire process.  As for other senior Fine Gael people it is eminently clear now that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, knew exactly what was going on around this appointment at least four months before Cabinet and the T&aacute;naiste knew at least 11 days before the Cabinet meeting.  As I said, the Minister misled the committee last week when he said clearly that he did not relay anything to Katherine Zappone - "I did not speak to her when she was in Dublin";  that in and around 21 February was the last time he spoke to Ms Zappone; and that he essentially left the entire process up to his officials at that point.  The published data now graphically show an entirely different story from the yarn the Minister has tried to spin not just to the committee members but to the public as a whole.</p><p> I have a number of questions I want to put to the Minister.  I want to follow up on that initial point on the cooling-off period, which is very important because in the Minister's evidence last week he stated that in a conversation he had with Katherine Zappone last summer she had offered her services in a private or professional capacity to his Department, to him and to the work the Department is doing at a UN level.  Again I put the question to him: What exactly did he do at that point to challenge Katherine Zappone in terms of the lobbying, the legislation and the requirement for cooling off?  Did the Minister point out at that stage that this was a breach of the legislation?</p></speech>

Last week the Minister stated that he had a conversation in and round 21 February when he spoke to Katherine Zappone.  The released data now show that it was actually a text message from Katherine Zappone on 22 February.  It is stated in that text message that the Minister had spoken to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  Ms Zappone says, "I know Paschal has spoken with you about my interest...".  When did the Minister, Deputy Coveney, speak to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and what records are there of that conversation?</p></speech>

I have three questions and may avail of the opportunity to come in later.  Will the Minister explain the interplay between himself and the Secretary General?  It sounds and reads as if this is something that they brought forward together.  I ask the Minister to elaborate and comment on that.  What other units of the Minister's Department or entities other than the Secretary General were involved in assessing the role being offered to the former Minister, Dr. Zappone, and were they positive on it?  Last week, I was the first on the committee to raise with the Minister the possibility of this committee being initially involved in a shortlisting process for future, similar appointments.  Time was an issue then but please God the Minister can answer the question now.  Will the Minister comment and give his view on this and can he give members a commitment in that area?  I think we could do important scrutinising work.</p></speech>

I refer to the inference in the previous series of questions that I somehow instructed the Department to create a job.  That is not the case.  Anybody who knows the former Secretary General of my Department and how my Department functions knows that it says "No" to me when it does not agree with a decision or it is not comfortable with it.  That was not the case here.  I worked with the Secretary General.  We saw an opportunity for a special envoy role.  It was what many other countries were doing at the same time.  The UK also announced a special envoy for LGBTQ rights and other countries have been doing the same.  We saw it as an opportunity.  We saw Katherine Zappone as an experienced person who was suitable for that role.  We developed that concept robustly in the Department and got no negative feedback from our team in Geneva, who are the human rights experts, from our team in New York, which works with the UN, or from our team in Dublin.  I ask the Secretary General to make a brief comment to back up what he already said to the committee last week.</p></speech>

Shortly after our initial conversation in February, I came back to the Minister and told him that I had seen that the Biden Administration was appointing a special envoy for LGBTI+ rights.  I said that I was going to explore whether value could be taken from a similar mechanism in the Department's work.  That work was initiated quickly and was under way through March.  I did so while conscious of the scale of work across the Department in supporting LGBTI+ rights.  The committee has an indication of that scale in tab 16, which contains a report with an update to the implementation committee on LGBTI+ inclusion on the work across the Department.  That work continued until near the end of March.  When that work was concluded, I asked our political director to examine that further through the prism of our wider human rights work.  That work took about another month.  During those two months, the Minister and I had no further discussions and there was no political input into the tasking or development of the mandate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#J00100"><p>As the former Secretary General said, there was no political input on the work that the Department did on this.  This was technical work from experts in different sections of the Department.  There was a food-for-thought paper, prepared in the context of Department of Foreign Affairs responsibilities as well as of the implementation of the national LGBTI+ inclusion strategy, which was finalised on 25 March.  There was an overview prepared of practice in other EU member states, in the UK, and in the US on the appointments of ambassadors and envoys with human rights responsibilities.  The committee will have that detailed paper, which shows that virtually every country in the western world was developing similar kinds of roles.</p> <p>  On 18 April, after exchanges between the political division and the team in Geneva and in Dublin, a concept note was prepared which set out the rationale and scope for the appointment of an envoy in the human rights sphere.  In July, a special envoy terms of reference, rationale, tasking, timeframe and support was emailed.  There was extensive work in the Department, which I was not involved in but I knew it was going on because the Secretary General had told me so.  That is the position.</p> <p>  On the final question from Senator O'Reilly around the future involvement of the committee, I said this last week and I say it again today: mistakes have been made by me, here, that have undermined the credibility of appointing special envoys in the future.  I would like to depoliticise that process in the future and try to get all-party agreement on how, or if, special envoys should be appointed in the future.  Certainly, I am happy to work with the committee on that.  </p></speech>

Katherine Zappone was not offered a job in March.  However, on 4 May she texted the Minister saying, &ldquo;Hi Simon, hope all well.  Any news yet?  You had mentioned June as start time."  The Minister mentioned in his contribution that he did not speak to Katherine Zappone between March and July.  If they did not speak between those times, why did Katherine Zappone text the Minister to say he had previously mentioned June as a start date, if no job was offered in their communication before then?</p></speech>

I asked her what she was doing.  She confirmed she was working with the UNFPA until the middle or the end of June.  When I came back to her, I said we were looking to develop potentially a role of a special envoy position, and would she be interested in that.  That conversation also referred to the fact it would take some time to do that.  She said to me she was working within the UN system and the UNFPA until the end of June.  I said it was going to take us time to develop this role anyway, but that it may materialise after that.  That is where that came from.</p></speech>

There is no record of the Minister dissuading her from that notion.  There are two text messages.  She said thank you for the job on 4 March.  Then, on 4 May, she had a start date for a job that was not designed and had not been offered to her.  It barely seems believable.  I want to go to another part-----</p></speech>

The end of June was Pride week.  When I said to her the Department was going to work on this, I did say to her I hoped we would be able to have the process in the Department done by this summer, by Pride week.  She clearly took from that that she wanted a job to be announced at that point.</p></speech>

Last week, the Minister specifically brought the word &ldquo;lobbying&rdquo; into his contribution to the committee.  He specifically said that he did not feel Katherine Zappone was lobbying him for a job.</p><p>Does the Minister want to reflect on that statement and change any part of it for the committee?  Does he still believe Katherine Zappone was not lobbying?</p></speech>

I never felt pressure from Katherine Zappone in relation to this job.  If I had, I would have been responding to her.  If anything, I could be potentially criticised for largely ignoring her texts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#K00300"><p>This is necessarily a criticism.  It is in keeping with regulations that are clearly laid out.  What exactly is the Minister's understanding of lobbying?  Does he accept that seeking to influence senior Ministers in relation to the awarding of a plum job constitutes lobbying?  In the case of Katherine Zappone, we know she contacted the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the T&aacute;naiste.  She contacted Ireland's ambassador to the UN, Geraldine Byrne Nason, and she also contacted the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the job and asking for an introduction to Samantha Power.  She contacted both Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Coveney.  How does the Minister not believe that to be lobbying?  It makes me wonder who else is contacting him that we do not know about if he does not interpret that as lobbying.  Why does that not appear in the register of lobbying?  Katherine Zappone contacted the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who then contacted the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and that does not appear in the lobbying register.  When the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, contacted the Minister, there was an obligation on him to place that on the register of lobbying.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is a friend of Katherine Zappone.  I do not know how many times he has spoken to Katherine at various different times in the last year, but she asked him for advice at some point late last year.  The Minister suggested to her that she make contact with me to get advice on a career in the UN because I am the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p></speech>

Friends of Ministers, who were previously a Minister, do not come under the same conditions as the rest of us simply because they are friends.  I am alarmed-----</p></speech>

To be fair, I am sometimes contacted by people who I do not know at all seeking advice in relation to career choices and so on.  I did not see this as any different from that.  I certainly did not see it as formal lobbying.</p></speech>

The Minister has been a Minister for more than ten years.  For how long has he been deleting text messages from his phone?  Is he aware that if he deletes texts which record official Government business without making a copy, he is in breach of the Freedom of Information Act?</p></speech>

There is a security element to that.  I do not want to overplay the security issue but it is an issue for me.  As a matter of course, when I do not think it is necessary to have text messages on my phone because something has concluded and we are moving on from it, I often clear the phone of those text conversations.  That is what happened.</p></speech>

On what date did he delete that text message?</p></speech>

I went to Africa the following day and I certainly did not hang on to that text because I thought there was a start and an end to it; he asked a question and I responded to it.  If I was trying to hide the existence of text messages, I would not have made all my text messages available through the FOI request.  If I was trying to hide the text messages - if I could finish, Deputy Gannon, I will be brief - if I was trying to hide the existence of a text exchange with the T&aacute;naiste, I would not have introduced it to the public in this committee last week, which is what I did.  I have not tried to hide anything here and I certainly did not delete texts in an effort to hide anything.</p></speech>

I am somewhat surprised by the apparent unguarded manner in which the Minister oversaw his ministerial responsibility for the security of the information communication from and to his phone, issued to him by the State, as Minister for Foreign Affairs but, more especially, as Minister for Defence.  As Minister for Defence, he has ministerial and political responsibility for the Defence Forces, one of the two organs of the State directly responsible for State security and intelligence.  His role as Minister for Defence may well have been more crucial to would-be illegal interceptions of his voice and text communications for a more significant reason.</p><p> Is the Minister familiar with the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 which authorised the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces to seek an order from an authorised officer, a judge of the High Court, to intercept postal and electronic messages under section 6 of said Act?  Was the Minister's phone issued to him by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces?  If it was issued to him by the Defence Forces, I believe it would have been an encrypted phone from the Defence Forces' communications and information systems corps, as befits the role of a Minister overseeing one of the two security and intelligence services of the State.</p><p> Given the Minister's role and Ireland's seat on the United Nations Security Council, did the communications and information system issue him with an encrypted phone?  Did he request an encrypted phone?  If the Minister is not working off an encrypted phone, does he accept this would be reckless behaviour in the extreme, betraying and compromising State security and the messages from a foreign minister of a country on the UN Security Council? This would beggar belief.  I ask the Minister straight out - yes or no - whether the political gravity of the interceptions of his voice and text messages occurred to him at all.</p></speech>

The phone that I use has been issued to me by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am cautious about the use of that phone because it has been compromised.  It is a matter of public record and was featured in the media last year in that in August 2020, I was subject to a phishing attack via the Telegram messaging application on my mobile phone.  Using credentials created on this platform, my identity was used to contact several foreign-----</p></speech>

He asked me whether I was aware of the political consequences of that and I was.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence determined that this incident fell into the realm of a cyberattack and made the appropriate notifications to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I handed my phone over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at that point and the National Cyber Security Centre and I took extensive advice from the head of the National Cyber Security Centre on that incident.  I remind members that security relating to mobile phones in the context of foreign ministers or prime ministers is an issue of which most people would be aware.  It is no secret that Chancellor Merkel would have had her phone hacked as Chancellor of Germany.  Unfortunately, in the world we live in today, despite security arrangements, there are some who will try to hack people's phones and access information.  I am cautious as a result, which is why I do not hold onto data unnecessarily on my phone.</p></speech>

I want now to turn to the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I want to know when the Minister, or his Department, first contacted the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, about the costs of the special envoy, the role of that envoy, the salary and, in terms of travel arrangements, whether he or she could travel anywhere in the world at any time and be fully expensed and paid for the days he or she would travel.

In relation to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department did not seek sanction from the Department in respect of this position.  My Department has a pay and staffing sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that did not require additional approval for this post.  Having said that, my Department did make contact - I think it was the day before the Cabinet meeting - to seek clarification on a pension issue, as far as I am aware.

We had 12 envoys at that time.  We were campaigning to be on the UN Security Council.  The Deputy might remember it was a very competitive campaign, with Norway, Ireland and Canada, three very prominent countries, in the UN system.  We were competing against each other for two places.  Many people were surprised that Ireland got more votes than Canada, but part of the reason for that is that we had a dozen special envoys, most of them diplomats, travelling to different parts of the world.</p><p>We decided we would ask Katherine Zappone because she had been quite involved in that lobbying with our Department in terms of some of the human rights work she was interested in and some of the travel she has done.  That was the position.  She was asked to be a special envoy for the nine months.</p></speech>

The descriptions in the correspondence have what I would call a very US-centric flavour.  We heard the Secretary General talking about how the Biden Administration was making appointments.  We see a memo in the correspondence which talks about the role of a special envoy being a somewhat  US-specific one.  EU member states typically use "ambassador-at-large" as a title instead.  All of this circles back to the assumption or presumption that Katherine Zappone was heavily involved in writing this job description herself and, indeed, in pitching it.  How does the Minister respond to that?</p></speech>

At no point in any of the correspondence or in any of the documentation does Katherine Zappone ask me or the Department to make her a special envoy.  The contact came the other way, as I have said and as the former Secretary General has confirmed.  I spoke to him about whether or not we could use Katherine Zappone in our team in New York because we felt she could be an asset.  We did not quite know how to do that.  Niall Burgess came back to me a few days later to say the US was developing a special envoy role and, as it subsequently turned out, lots of other countries are doing something similar.  I then went to Katherine Zappone to say, "Look, I spoke to the Secretary General about this; there is a possibility if the Department approves it and develops this role."  She was very excited about that and I think that is very clear from her texts.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.  Another one of her texts earlier in the process asked for an introduction to Samantha Power, who, of course, is a close aide of the Biden Administration.

I did not even respond to that message.  Samantha Power, of course, is the head of USAID and she is a very prominent Irish American.  I know of Samantha Power but I certainly would not know her well enough to make an introduction like this and I do not think it would be appropriate anyway, so I did not do it.</p></speech>

Indeed, the CAO points are coming out today and many of us will be contacted by young people in our constituencies, but we are not usually in a position to make up a tailor-made job and appoint them to it.

I understand why the politics of this have been controversial.  All I can say is that the Department went through a pretty rigorous process to develop and recommend the role that subsequently was offered to Katherine Zappone.  I mentioned it to her early in the process to see whether she would be interested and, as I said before, she enthusiastically responded to that in a text, which certainly makes it look like it was a job offer earlier on, but it was not and she should have known that as a previous Minister.</p></speech>

That certainly is apparent.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about his phone being hacked and deleting messages.  Did he delete messages on advice, perhaps from a cybersecurity adviser or the Garda, or did he take it upon himself to do so?  I refer not necessarily to these particular messages, although I am talking about them as well, but, in general, does he have a particular protocol he uses to determine whether it is public or private business?  Does he just clear down his phone every week or how does that work?</p></speech>

In other words, if I have had a text conversation with somebody that is done and dusted and I am moving on from it, I would often clear that unless there is a reason to hold onto it.  Certainly, when I had the text exchange with the T&aacute;naiste, I regarded that matter as closed and I removed it from my phone in the same way I would do with lots of other text exchanges with people.</p><p>I was subsequently very pleased that the T&aacute;naiste published those texts because they backed up the thrust of what I said to the committee last week when in response to questions from Deputy Cowen I volunteered the information - and I was the first to do so - that there was any text exchange at all between myself and the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>

Last week, I asked the Minister about how the Taoiseach came to have knowledge of this issue at the Cabinet meeting.  At the time, we thought this issue had emerged a week or two previously.  Given we now know that the specification had been discussed and perused in detail by Secretaries General and a number of Ministers over three, four or five months, it seems incredible that nobody thought to alert the Taoiseach to this appointment.  This was clearly a political move, something about which the Department was, by all accounts, excited, something which the Minister saw as a significant positive at the time and something which would be of political interest as Dr. Zappone is a former Minister.  How can it be that through March, April, May, June and July nobody involved thought it was worth advising the Taoiseach about all of this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#O00700"><p>That was a mistake by me.  I should have personally told the Taoiseach that this appointment was coming up.  I honestly did not see it as a controversial appointment.  There were a lot of other things on that day that many people would have thought were much more substantial than this part-time appointment.  It was mistake by me, however.  A Taoiseach should never be hearing something for the first time in a Cabinet meeting.  I telephoned the Taoiseach the evening after that Cabinet meeting and apologised for allowing that to happen.</p></speech>

It is clear that he offered Katherine Zappone the job as UN special envoy very early in March.  It is also clear that, as the Minister has acknowledged, he knew Katherine Zappone wanted a role in the UN and he made that happen.  He made it happen for a friend.  It is clear Dr. Zappone wrote the job description and the terms of employment that were attached to it.  That left the Minister's Department justifying the making of that appointment.  That is absolutely disgraceful.  On 30 July, the Minister told national radio that the job was not made for her but the documents released yesterday tell a vastly different story.  The reality is that she wrote the job specification, that she influenced the duration of the role and that, when the brief came to be finalised, Katherine Zappone literally submitted her own brief and told the Minister by text that a concept note was being developed.  The Minister also told the media that Fine Gael Ministers knew nothing of the appointment until 20 minutes before the Cabinet meeting.  That is also not true because we now know that the T&aacute;naiste knew 11 days beforehand and that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, knew much earlier.</p> <p>  I put it to the Minister that he misled the Cabinet and that he misled this committee through extreme economy with the truth.  I also put it to the Minister that he was not truthful then and that he is not being entirely truthful now, despite being given two opportunities by this committee to do so.  As a member of this committee, I am deeply concerned that any Minister would seek to use this committee in what appears to be an effort to save his own political neck because that reeks of the sense of entitlement that has brought us here today.</p> <p>  I will move on to another point.  A lot of communication traffic between Katherine Zappone and key players has been released which shows the access she had to the Minister, his Department, the Cabinet and the Government.  The Minister can deny it but there was pressurising.  In my world, repeated messages represent pressurising.  Dr. Zappone was pushing for this job to such an extent that, when she was not getting the response she wanted, she approached our representative at the UN, who raised the matter for her months before the Government knew about it.</p><p>We know that Katherine Zappone had direct access, and that she used that access to the Minister, to the Department, to our representative at the UN, to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  Who else, then, does the Minister know of that she had direct access to?  In that use of soft power, she used her exposure to high-ranking officials to her own ends and her own gain and the Minister played a central role in that.  How can he sit here today and continue to justify his statement that there was no lobbying, because very clearly there was?</p></speech>

She is essentially accusing my former Secretary General of lying as well, if what the Deputy has just outlined is her position.  All I can say is that the sequence of events as they happened is as I have outlined them today.  The FOI release backs that up.  I was the one who mentioned a special envoy role to Katherine Zappone for the first time.  She did not raise it with me and did not look for updates on that potential role until after the conversation I had with her.  The conversation I had with her was triggered by two conversations I had with my Secretary General in relation to discussing whether she may have been of use to our team in New York.  That is how it happened.</p></speech>

To me, it is explicitly clear what has happened here.  There has been a clear exploitation of the weaknesses which exist in the FOI legislation and that was done for nefarious reasons.  There can be no other way for any reasonable person to interpret this.  The public and the media were met with a continued wall of silence which started on 12 August when the documents, which were released yesterday under FOI legislation, began to issue with the acknowledgments of requests.  They continued like a flow from there on.  That was an orchestrated and deliberate act to erode public access to information regarding how public money is spent and how Ministers, like Deputy Coveney and others, and Government Departments operate.  This Act is designed to contribute to transparency and openness, but in this case it was categorically used to limit the release of information in what I believe was an orchestrated plan by the Minister and others in Fine Gael to control the narrative of what happened around the Katherine Zappone appointment and to seek to confuse, to distract and to double down on the underhanded nature of this appointment, which was clearly made in March.

The reason I did not delete the text messages from Katherine Zappone was because I wanted to be, first of all, absolutely transparent and they were still on my phone.  As far as I was concerned, the conversation with Katherine Zappone, which was primarily around this role that we are now discussing, went on for quite a long time.  I did not have an obligation to release the texts around the Biden election and so on under FOI because it does not relate to Government business, but I wanted to release all texts between myself and Katherine Zappone that I had on my phone, and that is what I did.  Unfortunately, I did not have the text exchange with the T&aacute;naiste still on my phone for reasons that I outlined earlier.  That is why I was very pleased that he published those texts which were consistent, in terms of content, with what I said to the committee last week.</p></speech>

I have three questions.  They are technical in nature.  Perhaps the Minister or his team might be able to answer them over the next few minutes.  I acknowledge the large treasure trove of documentation that was uploaded onto the Department of Foreign Affair's website yesterday.  It was very useful and helpful.  We appear to be missing one record, which is 094_90.  We move from No. 93 to No. 95, but there is no record for No. 94.  Are we still waiting for a text message screen grab to be uploaded?  Perhaps this is just an administrative oversight where there was a typo in the sequencing of the record numbers.</p> <p>  A lot of email traffic related to whether a contract of employment was going to be finalised for Katherine Zappone.  There were terms of reference and a concept paper.  Was a contract of employment ever finalised for Katherine Zappone?  Did she sign or date anything?  Was there any formal arrangement from that point of view?</p> <p>  Finally, there was some email traffic in relation to whether the 50 days a year that she would work for a two-year period was going to be reckonable from a pensions perspective.  Was there any final decision on whether the temporary, short-term job that she was doing would be reckonable from a pensions point of view?  To be fair to the Minister, they are the only questions I have.  If he could answer them or perhaps even cover some of the other questions from the other members, it would be much appreciated.</p></speech>

I suspect it probably should have gone straight from 93 to 95.  I am not sure.  If there is anything in that, we will come back to the committee in writing directly on it.  Certainly, people are shaking their heads here in relation to that being an issue.  Everything that we have has been published and is on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p><p> In terms of the email traffic and the finalisation of the job spec and the contract of employment, I am going to ask Niall Burgess to deal with that because he was the one who dealt with Katherine in person when she was in Dublin on some of those issues.</p><p> Third, in terms of the pension issue, we did clarify that, I remember, after the Cabinet meeting because it was raised.  This role and any payment linked to it were not going to add to her pension entitlements.  That is my understanding, but I will ask Mr. Burgess to give a brief outline on the finalisation of the job spec, if you like, and then the discussions in terms of the contract of employment.</p></speech>

Again, the tasking that was agreed and finalised was prepared wholly by the Department.  There was one amendment, I should say, to the arrangements as a result of my meeting with Katherine Zappone, and that was on the duration of the mandate.  She proposed that a two-year mandate would allow more time for the mandate to establish itself, to build up a network and to show results.  I felt that was a reasonable point and I proposed that to the Minister, but the tasking as agreed was wholly prepared by the Department.</p> <p>  The work had begun on the development of a contract before the Government meeting and had continued in the days after the Government meeting.  There are exchanges with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Although we had delegated authority to create this position, we were in touch with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform around ensuring best practice in the development of the contract.  That contract was never finalised because Katherine Zappone withdrew before anything could be put to her and signed.</p></speech>

It would be remiss not to commend the Chair and the members of the committee.  We know that, today, there is a lot more information in the public domain on this matter than there was the last time we met, so I think we are going through a very valid exercise in regard to this questioning and this type of interrogation today.</p><p>I have a few questions and comments.  I find it quite dochreidte - I use the Irish word because I will be commenting from a programme this morning - that a narrative is being peddled that Katherine Zappone misunderstood what the Minister was offering her on 26 February.  She is a very capable woman, a former Minister, and it just beggars belief that she would get the messaging wrong on whether a role was being offered to her.  I note other Members of the Oireachtas were on radio this morning and, on the &quot;Adhmhaidin&quot; programme, one of my colleagues said nach raibh an post le tabhairt ag Simon Coveney agus mar sin gur m&iacute;thuiscint a bh&iacute; ann agus n&aacute;r gh&aacute; an bu&iacute;ochas &oacute; Katherine Zappone.  The suggestion is that she completely got this wrong.  It would be interesting to find out from Katherine Zappone now if that is the case.  Does she believe she got the messaging on 4 March wrong and, if so, I wonder has the Minister been in touch with her, or if anybody has been in touch with her, on what her thoughts are on this.</p><p>The second misunderstanding I would like to raise with the Minister is that of the T&aacute;naiste.  We know that, on 28 July, the T&aacute;naiste said he understood Katherine Zappone asked the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for the role.  This was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>and on RT&Eacute; news.  Repeatedly today, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has said it is clear the role came from him.  He stated to my colleague, Deputy Lawless, that the communication was very clear one-way from his Department to former Minister Zappone and that he asked her specifically if she would be interested in the role of a special envoy.</p><p>I am quite interested in how the T&aacute;naiste also came to this misunderstanding.</p><p> There is another matter as well.  This is going over a lot of ground that has been covered but it relates to the text messages.  The Minister says he is very glad the T&aacute;naiste published the text messages the Minister deleted because it completely backs up what he said to the committee.  I disagree with that.  At last week's meeting, the Minister said that the text from the T&aacute;naiste stated that the Minister was speaking to Katherine Zappone and he was wondering if there was anything he needed to know when, in fact, the T&aacute;naiste texted the Minister asking specifically about the special envoy role.  The Minister informed the committee last week that he wrote back to the T&aacute;naiste stating the special envoy role was just a concept, whereas the texts from the T&aacute;naiste go further and there is a lot of detail in them in relation to the type of contract.  I put forward that there is a large discrepancy between the Minister's version of the texts and the actual texts.  I would go so far as to say they are not consistent with what the Minister said last week.</p><p> The final issue I raise has been mentioned by many of my colleagues.  Does the Minister still believe he was not lobbied for this role?  That is an important question to ask and it is important that the Minister answer it.  It is remarkable how many people were contacted in relation to the role.  Everyone at home will be imagining going for a job interview for a role they were able to come up with and write themselves.  It is astonishing.  People deserve answers and a bit of transparency and today is the time for that.  We are giving the Minister an opportunity to come clean and let us know exactly what happened.</p></speech>

On the initial one, that the narrative is being peddled that Katherine Zappone misunderstood what was on offer, the Senator asked me whether I spoke to Katherine recently.  I rang Katherine Zappone on Sunday but it was a courtesy call to say the Department was going to release an extensive file on Monday.  It was not a long conversation.  She asked me what was being released and I went through the text messages she had sent to me that I was releasing.  That was to give her the courtesy of letting her know that.</p> <p>  In terms of the text exchange with the T&aacute;naiste, first of all, if I was trying to hide this exchange, why would I have raised it?  I was the first person to raise this in the committee last week when I was asked the question by, I think, Deputy Cowen but maybe Senator Ardagh and others as well.  I volunteered that information to try to be helpful.  It was helpful that the T&aacute;naiste subsequently published those texts, which he still had.  The text he sent to me was: "Hi.  Seeing Katherine Zappone on Wednesday.  Do you know anything about her becoming our LGBT envoy?".  It was not in the text that I was offering her a job.  The T&aacute;naiste was simply asking the question because he did not know anything about it.  That backs up what I said, which is simply the truth, that the T&aacute;naiste had no hand, act or part in this.  He did not even know it was going on but Katherine Zappone had raised it with him and so he was asking me what was going on.</p> <p>  I did not have the benefit, when I spoke to the committee last week, of the text exchange between Katherine Zappone and the T&aacute;naiste.  I simply recollected that he had told me he was meeting Katherine Zappone and wanted to be up to speed.  Last week I said, I think, that I did not recall the exact text of those exchanges.  I think I said that twice actually because I wanted to cover the fact I was relying on memory.  Certainly, the thrust of those texts are the same as what I outlined to the committee last week.  I would like to have had those texts and I would have been more accurate, certainly, after the T&aacute;naiste published them.  I am glad to clarify that.</p></speech>

On lobbying, again, all I can do is say to the Senator what I experienced during this period.</p><p>I saw the text messages that came from Katherine Zappone to me as from an enthusiastic person who wanted to get an update.  I did not see it as lobbying.  I did not feel any pressure and if I had, I probably would have responded to those texts and I did not.  Instead, I simply left the Department to deal with the matter of whether we would move ahead with the process.  It did extensive work on that.</p><p> She sent me a number of texts over a number of months following a conversation I had with her because she was enthusiastic about that role.  I can absolutely see why, given the narrative that has since developed, many people would see that as lobbying.  I certainly did not see it as that.</p></speech>

A question that has been bugging me a little is that this started because the documentation arrived at the Cabinet table without going through meetings prior to that.  I am a bit of a loss as to how that could happen.  How is it that this did not appear at other meetings first, either with party leaders or advisers, as would be normal?  Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#T00400"><p>That is a very fair question.  This was the final Government meeting before breaking for the summer and I was bringing six memorandums to Cabinet that day, I think, on a range of matters.  There was a Brexit briefing and an update on the UN Security Council.  There was a memorandum around the possibility of competing for a sports event and one on the appointment of ambassadors to key roles.  In the build-up in the days before a Cabinet meeting, there is always a briefing between advisers to ensure everything is planned.  It would also be normal that when briefings are given, names are not necessarily included as attached to appointments out of fears of leaks or whatever before that Cabinet meeting.  That is what happened here but that would be normal.</p> <p>  The mistake I made was simply that I should have given the Taoiseach or his key adviser a heads-up.  There would have been detail on the ambassadors but there should have been a heads-up on the Katherine Zappone appointment.  I did not do that and as a result, when this arose in Cabinet the Taoiseach was surprised by it.  He was not annoyed but he was surprised.  I subsequently apologised to him for that because it should not have happened.  As I stated earlier, the Taoiseach should never be surprised by something that comes up at a Cabinet meeting.  It was an error that should not have happened.</p></speech>

Currently we have two other special envoys, Mr. Tom Arnold and Mr. Kenneth Thompson, who are doing very important work, although I was not aware of it up to now.  It is very valuable.  I assume both of these envoys were appointed in a similar way to the proposed appointment of Katherine Zappone.  The process involved due diligence in the Department and the work was identified as being important before the appointments were made.</p> <p>  There is the concept of a special envoy versus ambassador-at-large.  I do not believe we have any ambassadors-at-large but other EU countries do.  Approximately ten countries in the Union have roles similar to that proposed for Katherine Zappone.  They see it as very important that such a civic space is represented.  It was quoted in one of the documents that Ireland's voice should be heard loud in the area.</p> <p>  The LGBTI strategy mandates the Department of Foreign Affairs to work internationally to promote LGBTI+ rights.  Will the Minister indicate, on foot of all that and given this role is so important, whether there is a proposal to nominate or find somebody else for the proposed position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021090700002#U00100"><p>There were a number of questions there.  First, with regard to international practice, the paper of 29 March shows that Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK have a series of special envoys in a series of different areas, as do the United States and Canada.  All the countries that are in the same foreign policy space as Ireland were doing this, which is why I never saw this as controversial.  That may have been a mistake, but I thought the nomination of a special envoy in this area was consistent with our foreign policy and with what other countries were doing.  I thought that Katherine Zappone's appointment would be welcomed because she has, effectively, campaigned all her life on some of these issues.  That is where I was coming from on this.</p> <p>  It is slightly different with regard to Tom Arnold and Ken Thompson.  The appointment of Tom Arnold as a special envoy for food systems came from two Departments, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Tom Arnold is an expert in development, nutrition and sustainable food production and he has done extensive work in that space, particularly in Africa, so he was an obvious choice.  The way special envoys work is that when one wants a specific job done, generally, somebody gets hand-picked because of the skills set he or she has to do that job.  It is often a temporary position.  Sometimes it is not paid and sometimes it is paid; it depends on the circumstances.</p> <p>  It is different with regard to Ken Thompson because he was a special envoy for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  As that special envoy role was not a Government special envoy, but a Department of Foreign Affairs special envoy, it did not go to the Cabinet.  The reason Ken Thompson is in that role is that we do not have any ambassadors or embassies in Francophone Africa.  That was a big part of our Security Council campaign so we asked him to work in that geographical part of Africa, and he has been doing a good job there.</p> <p>  That is the context for what we were doing.</p></speech>

Everybody who is watching this at home would say that it stinks, and I do not believe anything we have heard today would change their opinion.  In fact, there are now questions for the Minister for Finance as well as to what his role was in this process.  For the ordinary Joe and Jane Soaps watching this, what they see is somebody who has access to very senior politicians availing of that access to secure employment for herself.  The Minister says that is not lobbying, but most people at home would say it is lobbying because it is seeking to influence the outcome.</p><p>It seems it is not just the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, who delivers for his friends.  It seems this is the way Fine Gael does its business.  We know from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, that Katherine Zappone called him about an introduction to Samantha Power and he suggested she should talk to the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  Did the Minister make that call or did Katherine Zappone phone him?</p></speech>

She texted me on 22 February, which is on the file, and she refers to USAID and the possibility of working with it on women's, girls', gender equality and LGBTQ issues.  She went on to say that US President Biden had promised to appoint LGBT folks at high levels and so on.  That was the first contact I had with her since I spoke to her briefly to wish her well when she was leaving Ireland many months earlier.</p> <p>  After that, I spoke to my Secretary General on 24 February and, at the end of a meeting which was dealing with other things, I said to him I had got a text from Katherine Zappone.  I pointed out she was in New York.  I asked him if he thought she could be an addition to our team in New York and if that would be a useful possibility.  He was positive on that and said he wanted to think about it, so I said that was fair enough.</p> <p>  On 26 February, I had a missed call from Katherine Zappone.  I called her back and said to her I had spoken to the Secretary General about whether she could play a useful role in New York.  I made no mention of the special envoy role at that point because I did not know anything about it.  A few days later my Secretary General came back to me to say the Biden Administration was moving ahead with the special envoy role.  Afterwards I had a brief conversation with Katherine on that.</p></speech>

That was a conversation previous to that on 24 February.  I had not spoken to Katherine Zappone when I spoke to the then Secretary General, Niall Burgess.  The text messages and their chronology show that.</p></speech>

Katherine Zappone believed - mistakenly, according to the Minister - she had been offered a job but it was subject to a Department review of whether such a role was required.  Yet she queried the time period of the appointment and what the next steps she needed to take were.  For any of us watching, the Minister is honestly asking us to believe that Katherine Zappone, somebody who was a Minister, had mistakenly believed she had been offered a job, because she was asking the Minister, Deputy Coveney, what the time period of this appointment was and what the next steps were.  The Minister is saying the conversation they had was around a concept role she would have and that she would engage with the Department around the role.  The Minister says it would have been helpful to have clarified at that point that it was not a job offer, and he did not do that.</p> <p>  In May, Katherine Zappone asked if there was any word of the job and a June start date, which should have set off alarm bells within the Department that this woman clearly thought she had a job and it had not been finalised.  When was she offered the job and how was that done?  Was it done over the phone, through email or through a WhatsApp message?  How and on what date was Katherine Zappone officially informed she had a role as a special envoy?</p></speech>

It was a matter for the Department, which is why I asked the Secretary General to deal with those issues with her, and he did.  In the normal way, a memo would then come to me to sign off.  From recollection, I was in Africa when it came.  I signed off on it, it went to Cabinet and Cabinet gave approval for the appointment.  That is important to say.  The controversy erupted afterwards.  This was a Government appointment and went through the appropriate build-up in terms of assessments, recommendations and so forth.</p></speech>

Did nobody in the Department at any point think it would be good to contact Katherine Zappone and say there was no job yet?</p></speech>

It would have been helpful if I had done that and I did not.  However, if members look at her texts they will see that at no point did I go back to encourage her, to say things were concluding or anything like that.  If anything, I did not correspond with her and left this issue in the hands of the Department, which was the appropriate place to leave it.</p></speech>

If she was to be involved in a conceptual process to explore whether there was to be an envoy, what role would the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, have had in that?  Why would she have needed to speak to him and to tell the Minister, Deputy Coveney, she had done so?</p></speech>

I remind members of a statement issued by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, yesterday afternoon.  If it has not been circulated to everyone, I will ensure it is.

I thank the Minister and his officials for coming here to talk to us.</p><p>Is the Minister familiar with section 7 of the National Archives Act 1986?  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Subject to the provisions of <i>sections 19(3) </i>and <i>19(4)</i>, Departmental records shall, unless they are transferred to the National Archives in accordance with <i>section 8 </i>or are disposed of under<i>subsection (5)</i>, be retained and preserved in the Department of State in which they were made or are held, and shall not in any case be disposed off except in accordance with<i>subsection (5)</i>; provided that, where more than one copy of such a record exists, the retention and preservation of the original or, if the original is no longer available, of an accurate and complete copy thereof shall suffice. </blockquote><p>How does the Minister&rsquo;s practice of regularly deleting text messages involving Government business, which form records of his ministerial activities, not breach this Act?  Where is there more than one copy of his texts to Katherine Zappone in the documents released yesterday afternoon?  Why does there appear to be no copy or record of his responses or exchanges?  Is he still deleting texts to do with Government business conducted on his phone?  That is the first group of questions.</p></speech>

I have already referred, in response to a number of the Senator's colleagues, to the security issues I must be aware of in my job.  I have to factor in that issue in terms of trying to be prudent with how I manage data on my phone.  That is what has resulted in me clearing text exchanges that I regard as concluded and over.</p> <p>  In terms of the responses to Katherine Zappone's texts, I have published all exchanges with Katherine Zappone from a text perspective.  It looks as if I have not published my responses to her texts.  By and large, I did not respond to her texts because I felt that this issue was being managed by the Department and that was the most appropriate place for it to be managed.  That is the simple explanation and it is backed up with the documents.</p></speech>

I do not have any facility for time added on because of Covid restrictions but I did say that I would try to revert to members on the matter of very brief supplementary questions.  I will do so with the indulgence of the Minister.  I am going to call for one brief question each from Deputies Gannon, Clarke and Brady, Senator Craughwell and Deputy Cowen.  I will group the questions and ask the Minister to respond briefly.</p><p>We have had a two-hour session.  We have had many questions to the Minister and many issues clarified.  In the interests of ensuring that everybody has an opportunity, I call Deputy Gannon to ask a brief direct question to the Minister.</p></speech>

The Minister might confirm two points from his statement.  He stated he did not know Samantha Power well enough and it would have been inappropriate anyway to refer a text message he got from Katherine Zappone asking for an introduction.  Despite believing that the text message he received on 22 February looking for an introduction was inappropriate, the Minister still considered her sufficiently worthy of being appointed as a UN envoy that he asked his Secretary General, on 24 February, to go off and develop the role.</p> <p>  The Minister does not believe that Katherine Zappone was lobbying as he did not feel under pressure.  As a Minister for the past ten years and a Member of Parliament for over 20 years, does he accept that seeking to influence senior Ministers - the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Finance and T&aacute;naiste - and the ambassador to the UN in relation to the awarding of a prestigious jobs constitutes lobbying?</p></speech>

Why is there no record of any communication between the Minister and his Secretary General regarding this appointment?  There are no texts, emails, minutes of meetings or anything.  Is it the case that text messages between the Minister and his Secretary General have also been deleted?</p></speech>

On 19 July, in a text communication between the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste, when the latter inquired about the LGBT envoy position, the Minister stated: "Yeah, I spoke to Katherine tonight.  She's meeting Niall Burgess on Wednesday to finalise a 12 month contract to be an Irish Govt Special Envoy ...".  We now know that changed to a two-year position.  Mr. Burgess, in his interaction earlier, stated that a two-year rather than one-year contract would be better for the envoy role and that this was what Katherine Zappone had said to him at the meeting on 21 July.  Not alone had we Katherine Zappone writing the terms of her own contract for a position that the Minister had clearly offered her on 4 March, but we now have Katherine Zappone going into that meeting with the Secretary General and dictating the duration of the contract, which the Minister clearly believed was a 12-month contract.  She went in and negotiated a two-year contract.  When was the Minister made aware of that?  It is bizarre that there are zero communications between the Secretary General and the Minister - emails, text messages or minutes.  Nothing exists.</p></speech>

Last week, the Minister misled the committee on why he deleted text messages.  He stated it was for data storage reasons but that quickly changed to his phone being hacked.  I have specific questions on that alleged phone hacking, which I deem to be a potential national security breach.  Why was that not communicated to the Taoiseach?  There is national Cabinet confidentiality here and the Minister did not communicate that to the Taoiseach.  Why was it not communicated to the Data Protection Commissioner or the data protection officer within the Department?</p></speech>

The fact that we delete messages does not mean they are gone.  What steps has the Minister taken to recover the messages that were deleted?</p> <p>  Will the Minister release the report from the Garda and cybersecurity people?  Will he also release the note he gave to the director of intelligence and the director of the communications and information services, CIS, corps in the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

The Minister said &ldquo;No&rdquo; but he had an idea, which would allow Ms Zappone to work in the UN and more or less said, "Leave it with me".  She thanked the Minister and stated that she would help put it together with his officials in the meantime.  The Minister believes that the initial conversation around the concept and her prompting for a role in the UN was not lobbying.  We have to accept that, although I do not necessarily agree with it, but the Minister stands by his understanding of the legislation associated with lobbying.</p> <p>  Thereafter, Katherine Zappone subsequently sought updates, clarity and input into that concept being realised and honoured both from the Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and the US ambassador.  That would clearly appear to be pressure being applied for the concept, the offer and the commitment to be realised as initiated by the Minister.  If it was not lobbying initially, does he believe or at least begin to see the reality emerge on foot of the Minister&rsquo;s initial concept offering that there was clear and obvious lobbying on the part of this person to those mentioned to realise the commitment, concept and offer that he had made initially?</p></speech>

In any event I ask him to deal with the questions of the five members as directly and as succinctly as he can over the next few minutes and I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

On Deputy Gannon&rsquo;s question as to whether I thought that Katherine Zappone was a suitable candidate to work for the Government as a special envoy, I thought that she was.  Katherine Zappone is not a person with whom I have a close personal relationship but is someone for whom I have a professional respect.  I and my Secretary General thought that she could assist our team in New York.  We had to go through a long process before that could be confirmed and that is what we did.</p> <p>  On Deputy Clarke's question as to why there is no record of texts between the Secretary General and myself, that is because he and I speak all the time.  His office is below mine and we talk in person all of the time.</p></speech>

The records will show that it was the Secretary General who then asked for and instructed the Department to develop this concept further and we got a very positive response from other experts in the Department on that concept.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked the question, which is a fair enough one, but former Secretary General, Niall Burgess, answered it during this meeting.  This related to how it came about that a 12-month contract - which was my understanding - changed and then became a two-year contract and there was a clear reasoning around that.  That was supported by the Department, which believed that moving from 12 months to 24 months made sense as to the objectives that we had attached to this role.</p> <p>  On data storage, I am somewhat limited in what I can say around that security breach and I hope that Senator Craughwell will understand that.  All I can say is that after that data security breach, I spoke both to my Department and to the Department of Defence at the highest level and got advice and expertise as to how I should proceed and that involved An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Cyber Security Centre.  I am not sure what more I could have done on that particular issue.  I have not seen individual reports on that but I certainly do not believe that the Garda is likely to release anything.</p></speech>

All I can say is I got this initial contact and I regarded that I was trying to develop something that could be an asset to the country in the context of the work we were doing around foreign policy, particularly through and around the UN.  The Department developed that with my support and that of the Secretary General.  Katherine Zappone was hugely enthusiastic about the opportunity and clearly was looking for regular updates in terms of whether it was going to materialise and where it was going.  That is the way I saw it.  I am not sure there has ever been an appointment that has had the level of scrutiny this particular appointment has had.  I can certainly understand why other people would see it differently.  I think the facts show the account I have given today is actually what happened.  This is what I am trying to explain to the committee today.</p><p> Once again, I apologise for the fact this committee has had to sit a second time on this issue.  To be perfectly honest, the committee should not have had to sit for even one sitting on this issue.  I should have been able to clarify these issues a lot earlier and I did not do that.  I regret that and I thank the committee members for their patience and their time.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee and on my own behalf I acknowledge in the first instance the Minister's apology to the committee, which was tendered at the outset.  I thank the Minister for meeting with us again.  I thank him also for dealing with the members' questions in such a comprehensive manner.  I thank the Minister's officials for attending and for their contributions.  If there are any further issues that require any further elaboration arising from this meeting, I would ask that matters be committed to writing and tendered to us in the normal way.  In bringing matters to a conclusion, I thank members for their questions and for their input and contributions.</p> <p>  The committee will meet again on Tuesday next at 11 a.m. in private session to discuss our autumn schedule of meetings and our work programme for the remainder of the year.

It is incumbent on us as a committee to correspond with Katherine Zappone to invite her before a committee meeting at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

Attendees are very welcome to this meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Today we are going to commence pre-legislative scrutiny of the residential development Bill.  We are joined by Mr. Peter Hogan, chief planning adviser, Mr. Colin Ryan, Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Sullivan and Ms Ciara Gallagher from the planning division of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The briefing material and opening statement have been circulated to members.  I will first ask for the Department's opening statement.  We will then circulate through members and take five minute slots of questions and answers.</p> <p>  I will read the note on privilege.  Members attending remotely from within Leinster House are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such a request.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in the public meetings.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Mr. Hogan is very welcome.  I invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

By way of introduction, my name is Paul Hogan and I am chief planning adviser in the Department.  I am accompanied by my colleagues Mr. Colin Ryan, senior planning adviser, Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Sullivan and Ms Ciara Gallagher from the planning division of the Department.</p> <p>  The primary purpose of the proposed legislation is to replace the fast-track planning arrangements introduced in 2017 in respect of strategic housing developments, SHDs, allowing for the submission of planning applications for such developments directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to largely restore - with some modifications - decision-making to local planning authorities, in the first instance, with the possibility of subsequent appeal to the board.  As members will be aware, the SHD arrangements were introduced against the background of the housing supply shortage situation then pertaining, the delays being experienced in the obtaining of planning permission for such developments and the associated need to accelerate planning decision-making in respect of such developments.  They were designed with a view to facilitating increased housing supply and providing greater certainty around the planning timelines for considering and determining planning applications for such developments.</p> <p>  The SHD arrangements delivered on their core objective of delivering fast-track planning permission for such developments.  All pre-application consultations on SHD proposals between the board, the relevant local authority and the developer have been concluded within the prescribed mandatory nine-week period while up to the end of July 2021, all decisions on subsequent planning applications, with the exception of two, have been made by the board within the mandatory 16-week timeline, or 24 weeks where an oral hearing was required.</p><p>As of end of July last, the SHD arrangements had resulted in the approval of 210 development proposals comprising 13,199 houses, 29,938 apartments and 9,174 build-to-rent properties, giving a total of 52,311 residential units, as well as 13,091 student bed spaces and 1,330 shared accommodation bed spaces.  It is worth noting that the number of apartments approved annually under the SHD arrangements trebled since their commencement in line with the Government's aim under the national planning framework to secure more compact growth in our cities and towns.</p><p> While successful in their primary objective of delivering speedier planning decisions for housing developments, the SHD arrangements have, however, been the subject of some criticism.  First, while the number of number of housing units granted planning permission has significantly increased, the actual subsequent activation rate of these permissions has been less than might have been expected given the benefits associated with the fast-track SHD process.  Second, they have reduced local authority involvement in final decision-making on planning applications and, third, the only mechanism against planning decisions under the SHD process is by way of judicial review, resulting in a significant increase in the number of judicial review challenges against large-scale housing developments than was previously the case, particularly over the last year or so.</p><p> In light of the foregoing factors, the new programme for Government committed not to further extend the SHD arrangements and instead restore the previous and more standard two-stage planning process while also seeking to retain some of the positive elements of the SHD arrangements, namely, mandatory pre-application consultation and decision timelines.  Further to the programme for Government commitment in this regard, a SHD consultative forum, chaired by the Department and comprising representation from a range of relevant stakeholders, including the Local Government Management Agency, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Construction Industry Federation-Irish Home Builders Association, the Irish Planning Institute and other groups representing the property sector, was established in December 2020 to formulate new planning arrangements to replace the SHD arrangement.</p></speech>

In terms of timelines, the new large-scale residential development proposals, as outlined in the general scheme, will require planning authorities to complete the final consultation meeting aspect of the pre-application consultation stage, including the provision of an opinion as to whether the proposals constitute a reasonable basis for moving to the next phase and submitting a planning application within eight weeks of receipt of such a meeting request from the developer or project promoter.</p> <p>  The new arrangements will further require planning authorities to determine LSRD planning applications within eight weeks of receipt, with limited scope for further information requests during the application stage which in the past have resulted in considerable delays in determining planning applications.  In this connection, prior to the introduction of the SHD arrangements, decisions on large-scale housing development planning applications were often delayed by the issuing of further information requests by local authorities, with multiple such requests being issued in respect of some development proposals.  These further information requests primarily related to factors such as the capacity of existing infrastructure to service the proposed development, impacts on adjoining developments, height density design issues, open spaces, traffic impacts, including ingress and egress to proposed developments, flood risk, Part V social housing requirements, etc.</p><p>In order to avoid such delays under the new large-scale residential development arrangements, the general scheme proposes that all of these issues should now be front-loaded and addressed by the planning authority and the developer at the initial pre-application consultation stage, while giving a small degree of flexibility to planning authorities by allowing for the possibility of no more than one further information request at the subsequent planning application stage in case an issue or issues arise that were not addressed at the initial pre-application stage.  This is a significant streamlining of the arrangements previously operated by local authorities prior to the introduction of the strategic housing development arrangements.</p><p> With regard to the appeal stage, the board will be required to determine large-scale residential development appeals within 16 weeks of receipt, again with similar limited scope for further information requests.  These streamlined large-scale residential development arrangements, involving mandatory timelines, have the potential to be almost as time efficient as the strategic housing development arrangements they are replacing, while also returning the primary decision-making function to local level.  The reintroduction of an appeal mechanism to the board should assist in reducing the number of judicial review challenges against large-scale residential development planning application decisions.  It should also be mentioned in relation to the appeal stage that the board has committed to maintaining the internal structures it operated for strategic housing development planning arrangements, availing of the same dedicated resources and expertise it had under its strategic housing development team arrangements, to ensure the prioritised determination of large-scale residential development appeals under the new arrangements.</p><p> The current strategic housing development planning arrangements are due to expire by 25 February 2022 at the latest.  Consequently, it is necessary to ensure that the new provisions for large-scale residential developments will be enacted and in place well in advance of this date so the relevant sectors, including local planning authorities, the board, developers, architects, planners and surveyors, can make the necessary preparations to transition smoothly to the new arrangements.  In this regard, head 13 of the general scheme outlines indicative transitional dates and timelines for the termination of the various phases of the strategic housing development arrangements and their replacement by the new large-scale residential development arrangements.  In light of these indicative timelines, it is important that the necessary amending legislation is in place as early as possible.  In this connection, the Department intends, further to completion of pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme, to publish during the month of October a Bill relating to the new large-scale residential development arrangements with a view to its consideration and progression in both Houses of the Oireachtas and, if possible, ultimate enactment of the Bill by December.</p><p> I thank committee members for their attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to respond to questions or comments that committee members might have on the proposals in the general scheme.</p></speech>

We are aware of the time constraints on the Bill.</p> <p>  I now invite members to ask questions.  We should not comment on live planning applications or strategic housing development applications that are before the courts or at pre-application stages.  I ask that we keep the discussion to strategic housing development in principle rather than itemising individual applications that may be out there at present, if members are agreeable to this.  We will begin with questions from Fianna F&aacute;il.</p></speech>

It is very welcome.  When I was a public representative at local level I complained loudly about the strategic housing development process.  I hope this new Bill will address many of the issues that created great concern for communities.  I was concerned with the centre of Dublin city.</p><p>Mr. Hogan talks about the SHD process and the speed of same and it certainly delivered that.  I am encouraged that there will be fixed timescales in the large-scale residential development legislation.  I am also encouraged that it will be time bound but that the initial decisions will be taken at a local level.  That is important.  In terms of the workings of the local authorities, one aspect of the SHD process that the local authority members found useful was this statutory meeting and briefing for the elected representatives.  I want to ensure that we have a commitment that the statutory meeting and briefing of local authority members and area representatives for each LSRD application will be maintained.  The dedicated website should be kept up after a decision is made.  That is important to the elected local members, as well as to the local communities.</p><p> Some 52,000 residential developments gained planning permission but the judicial review processes delayed a significant number of them.  That speaks for itself but in giving developers and the sector dedicated resources, a time-bound process and the efficiencies, we need to ensure they also have a bit of a stick to deliver and use the precious, important and valuable planning permissions they will receive through this accelerated process.  I would like Mr. Hogan to comment on that element as well because the legislation is one part of the process but capacity and delivering increased capacity in homes is important to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#D00200"><p>The statutory briefing for elected representatives operates in most local authorities because elected members receive the weekly list and can call certain applications for discussion at municipal area or area committee meetings.  We are open to looking at how that level of interaction can be maintained.  We have to bear in mind that the large-scale residential developments are a reversion to the system within the central eight weeks where the planning application is made.  Within that time, local elected members have the facility to make an observation on a planning application free of charge and they can have that recorded within the five weeks.  That is something that already exists and will continue to exist, whereas it did not previously operate with SHDs.  If the committee is considering making a recommendation or suggestion on that, it should bear in mind how that would fit into the five-week period during which submissions are made, how it would align with that and how it could be taken into account.  The briefing information about files and large-scale developments needs to be disseminated and that can easily be done.</p> <p>  It is proposed to maintain the website, particularly for large-scale developments, and that is something that has proven useful and effective.  One of the criticisms has been that the website comes down once the application has been determined.  That is a useful facility and we would have to have a look at that.  It is part of the proposal.</p> <p>  On the delivery side, I do not want to get too much into a whole other area but there are proposals in Housing for All to deal with those issues more separately.  We would accept that the level of delivery is not commensurate with the level of planning activity, decisions made and units permitted.  Delivery is important but as the Senator is aware, firm decisions have been made and matters are being advanced on foot of Housing for All with regard to, for example, a tax on what are referred to as vacant sites.  However, that tax will be on zoned development land that does not come forward.</p><p>That is happening, therefore, and it is being pursued.  The response has been generally positive to all those aspects and things can be incorporated as the legislation moves forward.</p></speech>

I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#E00600"><p>I thank the Chair and confirm that I am in Leinster House.  I thank Mr. Hogan for his presentation.  The understatement of the day is the description of there having been some criticism of the SHD process.  Most of us are of the view that it has been an absolute disaster in the context of the lack of commencements of grants of permission, the level of judicial reviews and just the general sense that it has exacerbated the adversarial nature of the planning system.  None of this is necessarily the fault of the Department, but I wish to put that point on the record.</p> <p>  In general, I welcome the return to a two-stage process, and local authorities being at the centre of that, but I will express some extreme caution concerning some technical aspects of the heads.  I will rattle through a bunch of questions very quickly.  If Mr. Hogan cannot answer all of them during the meeting, I ask that written responses be forwarded to the committee in advance of our pre-legislative scrutiny report considerations.  That would be helpful.  Of the 51,000 or 52,000 units of accommodation approved under the SHD process, what percentage have been commenced?  How many of the judicial reviews lodged were based on claimed breaches of city and county development plans and how many of the reviews which have been heard were decided in favour of the applicants?  I ask those questions by way of obtaining background information.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Hogan confirm that my reading of the heads of the proposed Bill is right in that there is no change to the statutory timeline for local authorities in the context of what would have happened previously with the process?  There is the same two-week period from notification to submission, the same five-week period for submissions from third parties and the same eight-week period for local authorities to decide.  That is my reading of the proposed Bill, but I would like Mr. Hogan to confirm that there are no changes in that regard.</p> <p>  A beefed up pre-planning application process will have staffing implications for local authorities.  Will Mr. Hogan tell us if there have been discussions with local authorities, particularly the large urban ones, regarding that aspect.  In addition, a stronger LSRD pre-planning process could have implications for mid- and small-sized planning applications.  Will Mr. Hogan comment on whether that point has been considered and what has or will be done to mitigate any impact on applications for planning permission below the threshold in this regard?</p> <p>  Turning to fees, will Mr. Hogan confirm that when we get the Bill, we will know what the proposed fees are going to be?  I ask that because I am sure there are people behind the scenes furiously lobbying to have the fees reduced for the industry.  I would like to know that fee information before we are asked to consider the Bill.</p> <p>  Moving to the heads of the proposed Bill and running through them very quickly starting with head 4, will Mr. Hogan explain the rationale for the 30% retail or commercial requirement?  I am not concerned by it, but I would like to know the reason for that percentage.</p> <p>  Regarding head 5, there is a real missed opportunity because there is no consideration of public participation or public access to documentation during the pre-planning consultation.  I believe strongly that if we want to reduce the number of third-party objections and judicial views then the earlier we involve local communities and interested third parties, including environmental non-governmental organisations, the better.  Was consideration given to allowing involvement at that stage?  If not, why?</p> <p>  Moving on to head 6, subsection 14 of the proposed new section 247A to be inserted in the principal Act states that "A person shall not question the validity of any action taken or opinion formed by the planning authority under this section".  Will Mr. Hogan explain what that provision means and what its scope is?</p> <p>  Turning to head 8, the accompanying explanatory note states this is "to allow the Minister to prescribe the specific issues which can be addressed by way of [additional] information".  How does that point relate to our international and EU legal obligations concerning environmental directives, Aarhus directives and-or framework directives, for example?  Are we at risk of being too restrictive regarding the capacity of local authorities to request additional information?  If we are too restrictive in that regard, could we - as we so often do with some of our rushed planning legislation - end up with a conflict in that regard?</p> <p>  Under head 9, why is it proposed to give the board extra time when it cannot meet the statutory timeline?  That seems to defeat the purpose of it.  We do not let the local authority have that.  What is the rationale for allowing the board to decide on its own terms if it is going to meet its statutory deadlines or not?</p><p> Will Mr. Hogan provide more detail on head 12, exclusion from entitlement to compensation?</p><p> On head 13, I am surprised at the generosity of the transitory arrangements.  Will Mr. Hogan explain the rationale for allowing a full SHD to be submitted until February?  Given that the decision will not be taken until some time after that, what is the rationale for leaving such a wide window of opportunity for those?</p></speech>

My colleagues might respond on one or two issues that they could better and more briefly explain that I could.</p> <p>  There have been 210 grants of permission under the SHD system, 72 of which have commenced.  We can get the figures from those.  The number is not insignificant by any means but 138 projects have yet to commence.</p> <p>  There is not a very large number of judicial reviews of development plans.  A whole range of issues have been deployed in relation to judicial review.  They are not all environmental by any means.  The ratio as between environmental versus planning is roughly 50:50.  On the planning side, a small number of judicial reviews relate to development plan breaches.  I do not have exact figures but we can address that.</p> <p>  I can confirm that there is no change in statutory timelines.  It is largely a familiar system and will not give rise to significant changes.</p> <p>  Staffing implications are important for local government.  We are aware of that and we have asked the County and City Management Association, CCMA, with regard to this matter and a range of other measures, to review its planning resourcing with a view to identifying what its needs will be, not just in relation to this issue.</p></speech>

I note the CCMA will be before the committee later in the week.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Hogan and his team for all of the work that has gone into this Bill.  SHDs were introduced to accelerate housing.  While the initiative delivered on the fast-tracking of planning applications, judicial reviews slowed many down and, as Mr. Hogan outlined, 138 sites remain undeveloped despite being granted planning permission.</p> <p>  I was a county councillor for almost a decade and I must admit that SHDs were very much a cause of frustration for me.  They were often viewed by councillors as a way of bypassing councillors, councils and development plans.  Judicial reviews are seen by resident associations as an unaffordable and unobtainable appeals mechanism.  For these reasons, I welcome the sunsetting of SHDs and this new legislation, which I hope will accelerate the delivery of housing supply, as I believe it will.</p> <p>  I welcome the strict timelines associated with each of the planning phases and that the timeframes for consultation remain the same.  It makes an awful lot of sense that the pre-application is to be used to iron out issues rather than giving rise to further information requests, which would ultimately cost more time.  The paperwork, drawings and technical material provided by the applicant must be thorough enough to make that work.  There is, therefore, a big onus on those who submit planning applications to ensure they come to that initial first phase absolutely prepared.</p> <p>  To build on what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, will these time phasings increase the burden on staff in planning departments?  What plans are being made to ensure efficiencies in the areas of staffing and the processing of planning applications and to see what can be done to ease that burden if additional resources cannot be made available?</p> <p>  As Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned, Housing for All refers to a tax on vacant zoned sites.  I know the Department and the Revenue Commissioners are engaged in ongoing work on this matter.  Does Mr. Hogan have an update on that?</p><p> There has been much talk here about the SHD websites and how they were a very useful tool from the public consultation perspective.  We have touched on that a little, but I am still unsure as to whether that facility will be transferred into the new LSRD system.</p><p> In summary, my three questions for Mr. Hogan and his team are around resourcing, the vacant site tax and the public consultation element.</p></speech>

As things stand, there is, perhaps, an underestimated or unrecognised burden on local government officials in regard to the SHD process because there is the pre-planning stage that happens locally and then tracking the development into An Bord Plean&aacute;la and having to attend meetings there.  While the final decision does not rest with local government staff, there is a lot of work, including much upfront work, to do.  Certainly, former colleagues and officials in various authorities have said that.  There is a need, across the board, for planning resources to be looked at in any event.  I am sure it will be confirmed by the CCMA that this is happening.</p> <p>  In regard to vacant sites, we are looking at trying to link zoning and the capacity of servicing to taxation.  It is something of a use-it-or-lose-it situation but, obviously, we have to iron out all the issues to ensure what is there is reasonable and proportionate and can give rise to the levels of activation we need to see.  If someone has a zoned site that is serviced for development, what is the reasonable period for him or her not to do anything with it?  Clearly, there are market ups and downs but after a certain point of time, it seems inefficient to have it vacant and it needs to get moving.</p> <p>  The Deputy's last question was on public consultation.</p></speech>

He made a very good point, which I had not thought of before, in regard to the burden that is already there from an SHD perspective.  It makes a lot of sense, and I hope it is something about which we will have further conversations with the CCMA.</p></speech>

I took the time this morning to look back at the discussions we have had on these issues at previous meetings.  I draw the witnesses' attention to the meeting of Tuesday, 10 November 2020, which was attended by Mr. Hogan and his colleague, Mr. Terry Sheridan, and witnesses from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  All along, there has been a consistency from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in stating that it has enough resources to do the job, yet it clearly did not deliver on some aspects of it.  The members of the board must think that aspect is important.</p> <p>  I welcome this pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  Members of the committee will recall that the Minister wrote to us on 23 July 2021 suggesting that we waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  If we have learned anything over the summer months - various media commentators have talked about this - it is that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  I am glad, therefore, that we took a decision to have this pre-legislative scrutiny.  It was not a given and, as I said, there was a request to waive it.  I am glad we did not accede to the Minister's request.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  I thank the committee secretariat for circulating the regulatory impact analysis, RIA, before today's meeting.  It makes for very interesting reading.  I saw it for the first time last night and the commentary it contains is particularly interesting.  The regulatory impact is something we always must keep an eye to when we are looking at new legislation.  We had a mid-term review of the SHD process, so the issues being raised should not come as any great surprise to the Department.  All of these problems were raised and discussed.  We know there were 22 recommendation in this report, which was published by the Department in September 2019.  The issues were discussed by councillors and, indeed, by Senators and Deputies.</p><p>As a committee, we should revisit this report and look at every detail of it because a lot of work was done there and the people who made those submissions felt they were dumped.  It is very interesting to see that the recurring themes about which we are talking today were in this report.  As far as I am concerned, the SHD system was a total failure.  Yes, it fast-tracked planning applications but this was not reflected through the commencements we expected or the delivery of housing.  That is an important point and we have to accept that did not happen.</p><p> There was a concept and suggestion that An Bord Plean&aacute;la should somehow become a one-stop shop which would cut times and so on.  It did nothing like it.  It ultimately cut out locally elected representatives, local authorities and planning authorities.  It had a very bad impact.  It also cut out third-party appeals.  I have always maintained that it was in breach of the Aarhus Convention.  It was not acceptable as regards public engagement in the planning authority.  I will, in some way, acknowledge the Green Party.  While it did not get it over the line during its discussions on the programme for Government last year, it did get a commitment that it would end.  I hope it will end fast.  The main fast-tracking we need to do is the fast-tracking of an end to this process.  It is a bad one.  </p><p> I will make one call.  The County and City Management Association is coming in next week.  I note that the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, were not invited to participate in this process.  The Chair has indicated that we will have more meetings on this.  That is really important.  I understand that the president of the AILG, Councillor Mary Hoade, wrote to the Minister and the Department to make two asks, which I will now reiterate.  The first was for a mandatory consultation channel for elected councillors similar to that included in sections 8(4) and 8(5) of the 2016 Act.  That worked.  Let us look at something that worked.  That engagement worked.  </p><p> The second ask relates to a really controversial issue, that of the prohibition on characteristics conflicting with a planning authority's development plan being included by the applicant, that is, the developer.  I refer to applicants coming out and saying that they are going to contravene the plan.  There should be a prohibition on that.  The AILG has written to the Department, as Mr. Hogan may be aware.  I believe these two asks are very reasonable.  I want to see them met.</p><p> I am delighted that we are welcoming back the two-stage process.  We should never have got this far.  We have to accept that the Government got it wrong.  Some of the people on this committee were there at the time.  We said it and pointed out all of these pitfalls but I just want to make the point that mistakes were made and that it was wrong.  I hope the Department will take that on board.  Will Mr. Hogan comment on those two objectives of the AILG?  What is the likelihood they will be achieved?  I hope he will be positive and supportive on behalf of the Department with regard to those two requests.</p></speech>

It came in through the Minister's office.  We are considering it in the course of developing this legislation.  As I mentioned, we need to be careful about how the mandatory consultation with elected members fits into the process.  It must be borne in mind that the elected members make the development plan so, as the planning authority, they are the policymaking body.  The making of decisions on planning applications is delegated to the executive.  As I have mentioned already, elected members are in a privileged position in that they can make submissions on an application within the five weeks, to have those submissions recorded and to take it further from there if need be.  How elected members interact with the process and at what point needs to be very carefully considered given that balance between that policymaking role, the duty of the executive to implement the plan and the existing right of elected members to make submissions and to appeal.  We do not want to overload the process but we do want to enable people to lead a response.  There is a very careful balance to be considered and we think we have already struck that balance.</p> <p>  With regard to the second issue, the prohibition on conflict with a plan, separate from all of this discussion, we want to strengthen local development plans, including county plans and local area plans.  We want them to be more meaningful and more detailed to get away from everything riding on the planning application and allowing that to be the point at which matters are decided and decisions come as a surprise to people.</p></speech>

We have to move on to the next slot.  My apologies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1574" speakername="Francis Noel Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#J00200"><p>I confirm I am on campus.  I thank Mr. Hogan and his colleagues for briefing the committee on the new legislation to replace SHDs.  Since 2017 I have encountered many issues relating to SHDs which have already been discussed.  Mr. Hogan commented on councillors being able to call up planning applications, which was the case in the past, at least in South Dublin County Council, if I am allowed to say that.  If there was a large application, the officials would brief councillors on it, and if there were smaller applications, councillors could request a briefing on them.  However, during the previous council term that practice was brought to an end.  Councillors in south Dublin are not currently briefed on applications and they cannot request such briefings either.  I was of the opinion that the SHD scheme was vague when I sat in on one of those briefings.  It would be interesting if Mr. Hogan could come back on that issue.</p> <p>  The phrase "use it or lose it" has been bandied about quite a bit with regard to SHDs.  Will there be a "use it or lose it" clause in the Bill?  The research we have done indicates that in south Dublin there was a 56% commencement rate for planning applications for between ten units and 100 units, whereas, as has been discussed, the commencement rate under the SHD scheme was in the region of 29%.</p> <p>  My first question relates to councillors being prohibited from asking for briefings on planning applications and my second question is whether a "use it or lose it" clause will form part of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#J00300"><p>I will answer briefly in an effort to stick within the time limit.  It is easy to stray over the limit.  There is a difference in respect of being briefed on a planning application.  Obviously, I am familiar with such briefings.  I think the facility to which the Deputy referred related to all planning applications.  It was not just in respect of large scale residential developments; it was larger applications and those identified by elected members.  It is reasonable that members be briefed.  The issue addressed in the circular to which the Deputy referred related to comments being made on the record and thereby prejudging the decision of the executive.  I think that was the issue.  If there is some sort of in-between situation at which we could arrive, that might be useful.  The issue relates to comments being recorded in the minutes.</p> <p>  As regards a "use it or lose it" clause, that is incredibly difficult to legislate for.  When the State goes to the trouble of awarding a planning application that ultimately is considered acceptable and it wants to be developed, curtailing that application at a certain point when there may be issues that have nothing to do with planning, such as those relating to finance, land ownership or whatever it might be, and going back to square one is counterproductive, particularly in respect of something like housing, of which we wish to see more.  It is incredibly difficult to legislate for that through the regulatory planning application process, but there are other means of doing so.  Taxation is a very important way of influencing behaviour with regard to economic activity.  That is where we are at in that regard.</p></speech>

He is saying that councillors across the country can request to be briefed on a planning application in a local authority without comment on the record.  Councillors were previously briefed on such applications but that stopped.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.345" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#J00500"><p>If the circular issued in 2018 has given rise to a complete elimination of that practice, I think we can perhaps clarify that because, as I said, it is important to have a briefing, without the application being commented on, and it is important for elected members to understand what is being proposed in their area.  That is utterly reasonable.</p></speech>

If the Deputy does not mind, I will expand on what he has said.  There is a significant difference with regard to councillors being briefed and making comment on a planning application for an SHD which will be decided by another entity, namely, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and on which the chief executive makes a submission.</p><p>There is a difference between councillors making comments or requests to the actual decision maker, who is the chief executive under section 34.  I can see that there would be a difficulty there.  One is making a contribution or submission to another party.  Under section 34, one is making a contribution and request to the decision maker on that.  I can see that might need some clarity.  That might be helpfully done by way of a circular to local authorities, planners and chief executives to make it clear that a briefing should consist of particular things, but to be cautious about particular matters.  That would be helpful to all councillors, planners and the whole process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#K00200"><p>I thank Mr. Hogan for the briefing.  I have a number of questions.  I welcome the fact that the SHD process is ending.  Unfortunately, the Act can be improved on, in particular in respect of community consultation because that is one key aspect where people have problems with the planning process.  Communities are not consulted during the course of the process.</p> <p>  Mr. Hogan did not answer Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on why the figure was 30% rather than the 15% that is already allowable.  I would be interested in hearing the background and thinking behind increasing it to 30%.  We might end up with large commercial developments going through the SHD process when it is meant to be for housing delivery. </p> <p>  Was any consideration given to deleting student accommodation from the process?  It is the same as the SHD application.  They comprise 200 units.  In my area two student applications in recent times have been changed to short-term living applications.  The local authorities have allowed that to happen.  There is certainly a feeling that we have reached peak student applications within Dublin Central and Dublin South-Central, in particular the Dublin 8 area.  I do not see why student applications are not included in the revised legislation.</p> <p>  On community consultation, was any consideration given to beefing up the requirements on applicants to meaningfully engage with communities regarding the very large developments that are taking place?  One of the criticisms of the SHD process has been that it bypasses communities.  Beforehand, even in the case of large planning applications going into local authorities, many communities felt that the community consultation aspect was inadequate.  They certainly were not listened to when they raised concerns.  That has been vindicated in terms of the number of judicial reviews that have been upheld when such cases have gone to the courts.  I would like Mr. Hogan to speak to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.350" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#K00400"><p>The 30% figure came at the request of one of the planning authority representatives from the local government management side.  There is a need to provide mixed-use-type developments that are still overwhelmingly residential, but include employment space, offices, shops, commercial outlets and other facilities such as gyms simply because it allows for a more varied environment where people have a choice of things to do, in particular at ground floor level and sometimes in separate or discrete blocks.  Large-scale developments that are solely residential can be quite limited.  The 30% figure was decided on to try to address that practicality whereby those sort of schemes are still primarily and overwhelmingly residential.  The issue was considered by the working group and that is what came out as a reasonable figure.</p><p> I will ask one of my colleagues to confirm whether the student accommodation matter was considered.  I am not aware that it was but, very simply, the logic is that student accommodation gives rise to a demand for residential accommodation, however that may be, notwithstanding the concentrations the Senator referred to.  We believe that should be addressed, perhaps, through other means such as local housing need assessment.</p><p> On the question of community consultation, that should be taking place at the development plan stage.  I was cut off earlier when explaining that, but the development plans need to be stronger and more directive about certain things.  We need to work on strengthening how that might happen so that when an application comes in, the community knows what to expect and has already been engaged.  We cannot rely on the developers to do that.  It is open to them, but they do not always do it.</p><p> Does anybody wish to add anything further on student accommodation?</p></speech>

It was discussed just on the basis of what was the definition for SHDs.  As Mr. Hogan said, it is a housing need of a certain description, such as in certain locations in the city centres around the country and not just in Dublin.  However, I appreciate that there are local issues in certain areas of Dublin.  It was seen as a reflection of what was already in place at present.</p></speech>

That is an important part of the process and needs to be reinstated, albeit without the facility for comments.</p> <p>  Community consultation is an incredibly important part of the process.  If we want to smooth out many of the delays and the conflicts that happen and if we want to get the benefit of a lot of local knowledge that can often be very important and which sometimes developers do not have, community consultation is very important.  Sometimes that is a way of spotting issues and addressing them before they become a problem.  I agree that the development plan stage should be the framework that gives certainty on this but, in practice, for many local communities these issues only become real and move out of being abstract when they are faced with an actual planning application.  It is more concrete and they are not looking at the entire county level or whatever.  All that information on zonings and different colours on maps can be abstract for people, but actual planning applications are when most people engage.  Consultation at an early stage in the pre-planning process would be very beneficial for everyone concerned.  That has to be examined.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  In terms of additional information, head 8, additional information can be very important in the consideration of more complex and detailed issues and sometimes can resolve issues that otherwise would lead to a refusal of planning permission.  Can the witnesses clarify the areas on which additional information specifically can be sought?</p> <p>  On breaches of local area plans and county development plans, which have given rise to many delays and judicial reviews, this process will still allow that to happen.  That can still happen so can they speak a little on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#L00900"><p>I will ask my colleagues to speak on this as well.  The point of the shift in additional information from the eight-week planning application stage to the earlier level of consideration is so that it just does not arise and that final eight-week part of the consultation is essentially a dry run where everything has been discussed and ironed out.</p><p>Negotiation has taken place.  We now want to see what the developer is going to submit, and whether it is a reasonable basis on which to move forward.  That is when the report on the scope comes back, which relates to one of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions as well.  This is the point at which questions are raised that might otherwise in the past have been for information.  It is clear, then, to the applicant, at the final formulation of their application, what they need to submit to avoid that sort of scenario.</p><p> There has to be a facility, because things may newly arise that might have not been considered.  There could be significant environmental matters that they have just refused to address.  As has been mentioned already, we have obligations in European l terms.  The sorts of things would be covered by additional information would be things that arise that are new, and things that are significant and unavoidable.  We will have to allow some degree of flexibility, so as not to cut things off and not to curtail the process, if it has gone so far.  However, it would have to be practical and enable things to by and large be dealt with before an application is even made.  It should be on the developer&rsquo;s time to get it right, not when the gun is to the head of the officials in the planning authority and when elected members and the public are all concerned that these things have to be considered in a short eight-week timeframe, as things stand.  </p><p> Regarding breaches of local area plans and statutory plans, because An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not deal with the application in the first instance, the local authority is obliged to give effect to its own development plan.  In theory, there should be a better alignment between the planning application and the level of consideration.  Having said that, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is empowered under section 37 of the Planning and Development Act to take a view that is different to the development plan, should that be necessary.  At times it can be, because there may be local policies from previous times that might not align with more up-to-date Government policy.  Again, as plans are updated, this is being ironed out and addressed, and, hopefully we will see less of that.  Certainly, we wish to strengthen development plans and local area plans to bring them more in line with policy generally, so that the board does not have to go down the route where applications end up in appeal.</p></speech>

My question has probably been answered in the replies to Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s questions  I see section 247 and section 247A as the filtering mechanism to ensure that there is not a situation whereby An Bord Plean&aacute;la is seen to give permission that is contrary to development plans, and that it is absent in some instances.  The judicial review, JR, arises from perceived lack of due cognisance to environmental impact assessments and other necessary elements.  Perhaps that is from where JRs arise, as well as from the dissatisfaction with the lack of adherence to a development plan.  Unless Mr. Hogan would like elaborate, that is where my questioning was going to be specifically.  Does he feel that the filtering mechanism is strong?  The word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; sounds weak; when I read it, I thought "opinion, opinion".  How strong will that filtering be?  Could Mr. Hogan please reiterate that for us?</p></speech>

The reality is that there will be an element of bedding in and testing it.  I have mentioned the word "negotiation".</p><p>The pre-planning stage is very much that in that a developer has a proposal and he or she brings it to the planning authority.  There can be a back and forth about different policy issues and different considerations and concerns, but at the end of the day it is up to the developer, as the applicant, to submit what he or she wishes to see developed or feels he or she can bring forward.  It does not always comply with the advice of the planning authority.  Things may be pushed a bit further.  Things may be ignored or cannot be addressed or whatever it is.  It is really important these things are teased out to the fullest extent possible.</p></speech>

It cannot give a decision because it has to make a decision on the planning application, but it can give a view or an opinion on what is a reasonable basis for the making of a planning application.  Opinion is carefully worded in that regard and I take it that it is much stronger in practice than a random view.</p></speech>

I would have seen the SHDs as being a solution, had they operated as intended, to the change management we need to embrace in that we will have to go higher or have greater density and have a change in how people live as well.  Coupled with the strengthened development plan process, the housing needs analysis and that all feeding into the development plan, I can see it as being very coherent.</p> <p>  As a barrister, I am very keen on opinion being strong; it is just being sure.  I have given feedback on SHDs as a councillor in South Dublin County Council and yet found that those inputs from the people on the ground and the representatives representing the people on the ground were completely abandoned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  While respecting the board's independence, at the same time that is very frustrating.  I sincerely hope the 247A procedure takes away that which has undermined this process and it addresses that by being a good, strong filtering and that opinion will be such.</p></speech>

When you look at the number of applications, and I think Mr. Hogan said it earlier, 52,000 were supposed to be delivered, and of the 210 development sites, only 82 were commenced.  How many affordable houses were lost in those developments that were not developed?  The other question that Mr. Hogan might be able to answer is how long will those developers have to develop those other 132 sites?  Is that the figure Mr. Hogan gave earlier?  Some 128 were not started.  I welcome the new legislation because everyone recognises that the SHDs were a failure and we needed to move on.</p> <p>  Community consultation and involving communities and local public representatives is vital.  We want to deliver housing, we want sites, and we want development that is sustainable and meets city development plans and local area plans.  Without consultation, however, that has been a huge problem.  We have seen that with all the different cases that have been taken.</p><p>Reference was made to the new Government plan, Housing for All.  Do the officials have any comment on the Government's U-turn, with Mr. Killian Woods reporting that there could be a loss of up to 10,000 affordable homes with a last-minute decision by the Government to provide an exemption?  There are a couple of questions there.  If I have more time to come back to the witnesses, I will do so.</p></speech>

Anybody can make a planning application at any time and it is really at the discretion of the person who was granted planning permission whether to develop.  That is the normal course of events.  There is the question of how long developers have to implement planning permission that has been granted.  Generally speaking, that is five years, unless there is a specific request for a longer period that is granted.  I suggest that the vast majority of the strategic housing developments that have permission granted and are not yet implemented would have five years to do that, starting from the point of initial granting of such developments in 2017.  Some may have more.  They will run for the next few years.</p> <p>  As I have mentioned, the intent is to implement fairly soon a replacement for the vacant site levy in terms of a development land tax on unimplemented development sites after a certain period.  I am not saying this for sure because the matter has not been finally determined but it is possible that some of those sites may well be liable for such a tax in the very near future.</p> <p>  With regard to Housing for All, I only mention it because it is relevant to the particular question and that aspect of the proposed Bill.  I do not propose to get into the wider aspects of it in this discussion.</p></speech>

My concern relates to circumstances where permission for 52,000 units in an SHD scheme is granted but where only a fraction of that number are developed.  I am dealing with people every day who are crying out for housing - private, affordable private or cost-rental.  People are seeking answers and solutions and the SHDs were meant to form one of those solutions.  People are at their wits' end and we are now looking at new legislation on the back of the Government's launch of Housing for All last week.  What about  the ordinary people watching these proceedings or who are waiting to see what will happen?</p> <p>  Some developers have abused the process by getting planning but not delivering.  We need to take action in order to deliver for people.  We are in the worst housing crisis in the history of this State but developers and speculators are sitting on land in respect of which there is planning permission and are not moving forward with developments.  That is not acceptable.  We must do something about it other than bringing forward new legislation.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others told the previous Government that this system would not work.  We can see now that it did not work.  I hope we will not be here again in five years in the same position.</p></speech>

This is not exclusively related to SHDs, but it certainly relates to any existing planning permission that may well be suitable for acquisition for affordable housing.  There are very firm proposals or decisions now made and brought forward in that regard within Housing for All.  There is also a fund to address extant or unimplemented permissions that are out there.</p><p>If it can make the difference to bringing forward affordable development, it will be deployed for that.  There are positive carrots as well as the stick that I mentioned.</p></speech>

It effectively marks the end of the SHD processes.  It allows communities once again to have access to a two-stage decision-making process and it reverses the attempt to remove them from that decision-making process.  I think it is another example of how the new Government is doing housing differently from the previous Government.</p><p>I echo many of the comments which have been made by, to be fair, those in all parties that this was used in many cases in regard to, and perhaps became more about, site values and planning approvals rather than being about commencements.  Deputy Gould asked how many affordable homes were lost because of the lack of commencements.  I suppose the simple answer to that is &ldquo;None&rdquo; because the previous version of Part V had no ambition on affordable housing and it was purely a social housing model.  The doubling of the obligation on developers under Housing for All in regard to Part V, which will now have 20% - that is, 10% social and 10% affordable - is another example of us leaning into the State being the main provider of homes, and the aggressive programme of delivery of public housing says that too.</p><p>There was one element of the SHD legislation that I thought did work.  This new legislation will see a return of powers to local authorities but it will see a withdrawal of powers from local authority members in the area of the statutory consultation with councillors.  From now on, if councillors wish to make an observation, they will have to make a separate submission themselves.  I often thought one of the benefits of the SHD legislation was that a collective decision or collective discussion could be brought from the local authority through the submission made by the planning authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I would like to see that retained either in guidelines or in legislation.  It meant that broader middle ground of opinion on an application could be represented, and it meant we did not have each local authority member making his or her own submission, which they are obviously entitled to do.</p><p>There are also <i>ad hoc</i>arrangements around how local authority members make submissions in some local authorities.  I know Dublin City Council is very good at bringing forward applications to area committees, although that is not the case everywhere.  In Dublin City Council, local authority members do not pay the planning fee, but in other local authorities they do.  We need to standardise the process around how local authority members consult large-scale developments as that will strengthen the Bill.</p><p>Overall, I very much welcome the legislation.  I welcome the work that has been done on it by the officials and I look forward to it being implemented as quickly as possible by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to ensure we reach the deadlines that are outlined in the Bill.</p></speech>

We can certainly understand from the engagement today that the question of elected member input to the process is clearly an important one.  I would reiterate what I have said already in regard to the streamlined process and the eight weeks and how that could be given best effect, bearing in mind the role of members in making the plan in the first place, the duty of the executive to implement the plan and the fact members have that facility to make submissions.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that it would be very good if there could be a kind of collective view but, again, how that can relate to an eight-week process is not so straightforward, and there are already lots of provisions there.  Any deliberations from the committee need to consider that in particular.  However, we are certainly open to those considerations.</p></speech>

They are about access, parking and where entrances might be or they might be about the impact of adjoining traffic.  These are discussions that just do not happen at development plan level.  I believe that trying to build consensus on planning issues is important because it removes us from an adversarial role.  One of the benefits of the SHD legislation was that it gave councillors a collective opportunity to discuss planning issues.  With the advent of online meetings, we are in a very different world in what we can deliver at local authority level.  Again, it could be by way of guidelines or best practice, but I would like to see opportunities or, at least, the embedding of the practice in some local authorities whereby area committees have an opportunity to discuss large-scale developments.  Those discussions would be recorded by local authorities and submitted as part of the decision-making process.</p></speech>

Why do we need a fast-track planning system?  Pre-SHD, planning applications concerning approximately 80,000 or 90,000 units were being dealt with.  Fast-tracking planning does not guarantee that anything will be built.  For too long, planning has been a whipping boy for why development does not take place.  I am interested in why we need a fast-track planning system at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-09-07a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021090700002#Q00300"><p>That is a very relevant question but the reality is we are all agreed that we need more housing and we need the planning system not to be perceived as a barrier to its delivery.  That is always one of the first things people say when they talk about housing delivery.  The regulatory process should be relatively straightforward when land is identified as being zoned for housing.  We have not changed that.  There is very little difference at the middle eight-week stage to most other types of planning application.  There is still eight weeks for making a decision.  The big difference is in the pre-application stage, which tries to iron out as many things as possible upfront.  That is not unreasonable when it comes to housing development for a whole range of reasons.  We have already talked about the need to strengthen development plans and local area plans.</p></speech>

It needs to be made very clear and imperative to developers that they bring in high-quality documentation and environmental impact assessments, that they comply with every aspect of planning requirements at the pre-application stage and that they do not dip a toe in the water to see what the planning authority says before they take a punt on their application.  They need to be very clear and they need to do their homework.  Many of these judicial reviews have been successful because those matters have not been addressed correctly.  The further information request of a local authority should not be limited.  I accept that it can cause delays, but if local authorities need to request further information there should not be a limit placed on them.  The onus should be on the developer to submit high-quality documentation.  It should be the developer that gets penalised if he or she does not do that.  The planning authority should not get just one shot at it.</p></speech>

If a developer wants to have a smooth passage towards development consent or permission he or she has to submit high-quality compliance submissions.  The better developers always do.  The question is how we embed that in the system across the board to ensure it happens in all cases.  There was some concern, perhaps, that reverting to the two-stage system meant that the initial local government stage might be seen as a sort of trial run for the inevitable appeal.  That can be avoided by ensuring the earlier stage is strengthened.</p></speech>

We do have people with in-house expertise in European law as well who would have engaged with the principals within the planning section - me, Terry Sheridan and others.  It is not that this was not incorporated into the process.  It was just that the consultative forum concerned practitioners.</p></speech>

However, one of the complaints about SHDs is that so many judicial reviews have been brought that I would have thought it might have been informative to state the quality of documentation and things that need to be addressed in the pre-planning application process to hone that process.  Could the pre-planning process documentation, minutes, responses and requests be made available when a section 34 is submitted?  Could this be incorporated in the Bill?</p></speech>

I think we used the term "filter" at negotiation.  People need to understand what the proposal that is being subject to determination is and what the issues are relating to that as opposed to necessarily what might have been discussed at that filtering stage or as part of the overall negotiation that led to the application.  Obviously, at some point, it is useful for all of that information to be available in the public domain.  The question is whether it is better to do this after the decision has been made.  That is generally the way with pre-planning information.</p></speech>

We know this was the subject of much debate.  I think there were a number of freedom of information, FOI, requests and this information entered the public domain.  Is the Department looking at the possibility of increasing the threshold from 100 to 200 units, something suggested by the Minister who was the architect of all of this?</p> <p>  Mr. Hogan will be very familiar with strategic development zones, SDZs.  They are very specific and very set down.  A major concern was expressed in the Department's mid-term review to which I referred to earlier and by people today who live close by these SDZs.  There is a significant degree of certainty about them and, of course, permission must be granted if the general scheme application is compliant and fits in with the criteria.  One of the recommendations to which I referred earlier was that this capacity for the SHDs be removed and the fast track be removed from the SDZs.  Now we are moving on to the large-scale residential developments, LSRDs.  Has the Department given any further consideration to that recommendation?  Does it not see the benefit of not permitting?  I do not believe we should permit any LSRD in an SDZ.  I believe it is wrong.  They are very complex.  Half the thing about confidence building in these schemes is that they are agreed upfront and there is a degree of certainty about them.  I will certainly make a very strong recommendation to this committee in its final deliberations that they would be excluded.</p><p>I would be interested in Mr. Hogan's view on that.  </p><p> Regarding the further information request, I am still concerned.  I spoke to some planners yesterday who told me how they use the mechanism.  I am not suggesting it puts manners on a developer but they have this tool, as does the board, to request further information.  It puts the focus on.  I know the Department is trying to tighten up times and I am all for that and for having a faster process but I have concerns.  We need to look at it and when we explore this with the CCMA we may hear a different story in two days' time.  We must be careful.  I advise some concern around that.</p></speech>

The recommendations of the group in 2019 indicated we might consider making strategic housing developments more strategic for larger scale schemes.  The issue is that, depending on where you are in the country, 200 units is either significant or very significant.  In Dublin it is not as significant as it might be in a smaller town or city.  On balance, it was decided to leave the figure at 100.  That was carried forward in the discussion of the group in relation to the current proposals.  It was felt easier to work with what people understand and keep it as consistent as possible.  I do not know if Mr. Ryan wants to add anything to that.</p></speech>

We thought on balance that it is understood it is 100 units and, outside of Dublin, that is a significant development at this time.  It is about balancing the need for relatively large developments to be accommodated around the country in suitable and appropriate locations.</p></speech>

The nature of what is envisaged to be developed is already set out so that logic applies.

There will be clarity as to what will obviate further information requests.  If significant issues or matters of conflict with policy, particularly environmental policy, arise, they will have to be addressed at that stage.  That might be a make or break for the whole thing and it cannot proceed.  The question will be whether it is something that can be reasonably dealt with by further information or something that has to be refused.  These are not insignificant undertakings for anyone, whether it is the public which has got involved or the developer who has made the application.  There needs to be that sort of outlet, where required.  All the detail is not yet worked out.  We are still on the legislation.</p></speech>

I want to return to where we were in my earlier contribution.  I fully accept the facility that exists for elective representatives to make an observation and the waiving of the fee and all of that.  There is a certain inconsistency in how that is supplied between local authorities.  There is that issue.  It is important there is a uniformity of operation for local authority members in all our local authorities, more importantly now when these huge planning applications will be reverted with the decision-making taking place there.</p><p> The other function the statutory meeting provided was not just an opportunity for a discussion at an area level among the elected representatives.  As those meetings were webcast, it was a very valuable resource for residents, representatives and people interested in the community to see a formal presentation made by professionals who were then able to answer informed questions from the elected representatives.  The recording of those meetings and the availability of that information for local communities, I do not believe can be overstated.  I appreciate there will be an eight-week timescale but I strongly urge that it is an element of the previous SHD process - which I have obviously argued strongly against - that is retained because it is valuable on a number of levels.  The witnesses do not need to reply to me on this right now; I will not take up more time.  That was the point I was trying to make.  I thank the Chair for allowing me back in.</p></speech>

I agree with her.  It was a very good opportunity for the public to attend and, when the meetings were in person, to look at the presentation of it.  I will now go to the third Fine Gael slot and then to the open round, in which Deputy &Oacute; Broin has indicated and I wish to take a second slot.  If members want a third round, they can put their hand up now.  Do we have an indication on who will speak in the third Fine Gael slot?</p></speech>

This has been a very useful discussion.  Senator Fitzpatrick has summed up quite well one of the points that was put forward by a number of public representatives that, perhaps, has not quite hit home at this stage.  I also believe it would be useful if we have those meetings.  One thing that was probably missed in the SHD legislation was around the fact that when those websites were live, sometimes they were hard to find.  If, for example, people typed in the name of the website plus "SHD" but, due to the search optimisation, Google did not necessarily bring them to the site.  That was something which, perhaps accidentally, somewhat limited the opportunity for engagement, for the understanding of the plans and, consequently, for consultation.  What we set out to do here is cherry pick the things that worked from the SHD legislation and bring them into this new piece of legislation.  There is an awful lot of good around the public consultation element, the use of the websites and the use of those public consultation meetings.  I would like to see that reflected in the legislation.</p></speech>

Definitely, the things that work and are positive, we all wish to see them retained with the caveat, perhaps, of not overloading the system bearing in mind that it is somewhat different when it is within the local authority and it is the council that is making the decisions.

Whatever we do not get to, we can return to later.  The witnesses said they will provide some statistics later.  It would be great to get the percentage of individual units commenced of the 52,000 units in total.  Likewise, it would be great to get a breakdown of the judicial reviews of residential SHD applications because obviously there are a lot of judicial reviews out there on environmental grounds that relate to strategic infrastructural developments.</p> <p>  On head 4 of the Bill and the 30%, I presume I am right in saying that while 30% will be in the Act, that will be dependent on what is in the relevant city or county development plan and the zoning for the particular piece of land in question.  This would not in any way trump that.  That is a straightforward yes-no question.</p></speech>

This is part of the deliberative process; there must be some capacity to bring forward ideas and discuss proposals with a degree of confidence.

Will local authorities still have the scope to request whatever information is required to fulfil their statutory obligations under EU law at that stage, notwithstanding what has been discussed at the pre-planning stage?</p></speech>

Why are we giving the board an opt-out from meeting its statutory timeline if it feels it cannot meet it?  What is the rationale for that?  We expect the local authorities who make the principal assessment of the application, which is much more onerous in my view, to meet their timeline.  Why is the board, under head 9, subsection 3, getting that slight flexibility if it does not feel it can meet the timeline?  Am I misunderstanding it?

That makes much more sense to me.</p> <p>  The big question is that it is proposed to allow SHD applications in certain circumstances, according to head 13, which relates to the transitional arrangements, up to 25 February if they are in the pre-planning SHD process.  Surely the logical thing would have been to stick with the original sunset clause in the original legislation as passed by the previous Government to have the cut-off point at the end of the year.  People have plenty of notice, given that this is being published now.  Why are we allowing for that further extension?  It is not unlike the co-living ban.  It means we will still have SHD application decisions being made well into the middle of next year if we allow these transitional timelines.</p></speech>

I have to move on.</p> <p>  I have a question in this open round.  There are time limits on the pre-application process.  The local authority has to agree to a meeting within four weeks of a request and then issue the decision, or its opinion, within four weeks, I think, of that final meeting.  Is that so?  Is the entire pre-application process time-bound?  If a developer applies to go into the pre-application process and puts in a request for something preliminary before that final meeting, is the developer considered to be in the planning process?  I ask that question in the context of land on which development has stalled or is not taking place.  Would that be possibly used as a reason to say "I am in the planning process now so I am trying to develop this land"?  That might create difficulties in applying vacant site taxes or levies.  My question is whether the entire pre-planning application process is time-bound.</p></speech>

There might be just an inquiry about something that might not necessarily be a formal proposal, so there are earlier stages but the application does not become formal until there is a section 247 request and does not become part of this process until the initial eight-week period request.  To respond to the question about this being used as a defence against a successor to the vacant site levy or similar, it is not envisaged that planning activity would be a means to avoid liability.</p><p>Clearly, this is something that is emerging and will emerge separately, but the reality is that what we are trying to achieve is activation and commencement.  Further planning activity is not necessarily the objective.  For that reason, we would not see it as being related.</p></speech>

Effectively, a prospective applicant can engage in the section 247 process and there is no time requirement on them to proceed to the next stage, the section 247(a) process, so they can decide whether to move on to the section 247(a) process and at what stage they do so.  Once they then decide to make an application to the local authority for the section 247(a) final consultation meeting, as we are calling it, there is an eight-week process for the determination of the opinion of the local authority, which has been outlined.  Once that is received, the legislation states the opinion will only be valid for one year. Therefore, once people are in receipt of that opinion, they then have to proceed to make the planning application within one year or they have to recommence the process again.</p></speech>

I take the point made by Mr. Hogan earlier that the development of 100 houses in a large urban area may not have a massive impact, but in a smaller area, it can, and can overload the school system where the system may not even have that capacity.  Is it something that could be sought, whereby in the pre-planning application stage the local authority could require the applicant to show the excess capacity in that school as the development is built and populated and what the demographic requirement would be in that area?  Is  never seems to be a requirement of a planning application.</p></speech>

It should not necessarily be the responsibility of the developer of 100 homes to address an issue of school capacity.</p></speech>

We pay a lot of attention to the utilities that are required for houses; we do not often pay enough attention to the services that are required to make them homes.  We always look at waste water and drinking water capacity, and even road capacity.  Public transport is another factor.  I have often seen an application being submitted, which states that the development is in close proximity to public transport.  It never gets down to the nitty-gritty detail of how often that bus arrives and what the expected modal use might be as opposed to cars and public transport.  In a way, it is tokenistic.  The application will state that there are plenty of schools nearby and there is public transport.  These are the issues that generate difficulty in a local area.</p></speech>

What we need to do is strengthen our intermediate or local plans to address those sorts of issues on a cumulative basis.  Issues such as schools, public transport and recreational facilities for the community should be part of that local planning, bringing some of the better elements of strategic development zones into the normal forward planning system.  That is certainly something we wish to follow up with.</p><p>It should be more to do with development services when you are dealing with a planning application.  I accept that if these other issues have not been considered, clearly there is a frustration and there may be no other outlet but it should properly be dealt with as a planning exercise upfront.  If there are obligations on a particular site or applicant, that is okay and it can then be brought in, but it is not reasonable if it has not been considered earlier.</p></speech>

I appreciate primary legislation is probably not the place to put in those specifics but it is something that could and should be addressed in those pre-planning application processes in section 247.

I thank the officials for being here.  What is clear, and I have not seen this in a long time in this committee, is the cross-party support for continuing to support the consultation channels that have been established for city and county councils.  It is coming over strongly and I expect to see that reflected by the officials when the Ministers are engaged on this issue.  It is a very important thing.</p> <p>  I want to make a point.  Mr. Hogan has stated on a number of occasion that elected members like councillors have a right to make a submission on a planning permission without a charge.  He will recall, or Mr. Terry Sheridan certainly will, that it was a tough battle I had in Seanad &Eacute;ireann against all the Government parties in the previous Administration.  They opposed it.  They did not even produce, were not able to produce, or chose not to produce tellers to count the vote.  That is the reality of it.  There was huge resistance by the officials and by the Minister.  On the suggestion today that this was a great opportunity, while I do not doubt Mr. Hogan's commitment to it, I must say the Department was not supportive of it.  The Official Report shows there was huge resistance by the then Minister and Minister of State to this.  However, we have it now.  By the way, it was agreed for primary legislation but it was not embedded into the primary legislation.  Instead it was a statutory instrument.  Consequently, we almost have to watch that space and guard it.</p> <p>  Mr. Hogan is suggesting that is an important mechanism and I agree, but they are unique people who represent their communities and have a democratic mandate.  What I like about that process is it is a written, open and transparent process.  If we have learned anything from planning tribunals it is that we must have an open and transparent process of engagement with elected members and politicians and the planning authorities.  I propose that be retained and we will watch that space carefully.  We should also continue with the consultation channel that exists under the Act, currently in section 8(4) and (5), so we retain that.  They are the two strong messages I wish to leave with the officials today.</p> <p>  Back in the early days of Rebuilding Ireland we were told one of the key measures would be that we would have a state-of-the-art information technology system for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We still do not have it.  It has gone on for years.  We have been promised by the board and officials from it keep coming in.  They have loads of resources, they have the ability and they have the capacity.  This hinges on my final point that it is about public engagement and about ensuring there is confidence in our planning system and planning processes.  We all agree that needs to happen and be cemented and secured.  The officials may not be in a position to fully tell us today but will someone chase up An Bord Plean&aacute;la so we can get a written briefing on where we stand after all the years of promises about a state-of-the-art system?  Covid taught us one thing, namely, people want to engage, to be smart and to use technology.  We must use technology within the planning systems and that must be a priority for us.  Perhaps the Department will come back to the committee with an updated report on where we are on this aspect of good modern planning.</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been developing its system as well.  Its systems are horrendously complex and they do take time when things are system-wide and you are integrating what has maybe been done separately 31 times.  I am not talking about anywhere in particular.</p><p>It is more that that has been our experience of it.  Covid-19 has been a very important acceleration for all of this and it is happening.  I do not have the timelines or whatever to hand but we will expect to see much better systems for all users including developers, the public, officials, elected members, Deputies and Senators.  Mr. Ryan and other colleagues may wish to add to that.</p></speech>

The Senator raised a very important point on ICT infrastructure and the issue that was raised earlier on as to its streamlining and processes internally within local authorities.  We are working very closely with the Local Government Management Agency and the CCMA to roll out, from a local authority point of view across the 31 local authorities, a new planning system that is currently in development at present.  It is at an advanced stage and we should be trying to test that in the coming while with a view to rolling it out next year.</p></speech>

We are working hard on that.  On Plean-IT, the An Bord Plean&aacute;la system referred to by the Senator, that is being worked through.  Perhaps Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan or Ms Gallagher could provide a short update on that matter.  The issue of streamlining the processes the Senator has raised is very important.  At the same time as well, the quality of information would improve, at least from a visualisation and clarity standpoint as to drawings.</p></speech>

One of the good things about the SHDs, if one is allowed to say something good about them, is that the websites were of quite good quality and they were often much easier to navigate and to see the documentation and drawings than would have been the case had it been a normal section 34 application through one&rsquo;s local authority.  That was my experience, having looked at some of the developments.  Did Ms Gallagher wish to contribute on this point, to be followed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin?</p></speech>

In November last year the board did initiate a system for the online facility of public submissions on SHD applications with a fee.  I think it has made further progress in the months since that time.  It has launched a new website since April this year.  The focus of staff internally is to look at facilitating the submission of online applications again with the associated fee for strategic infrastructure developments.  After that they will move on to ensuring that the facilities are in place then for a public application on a normal planning appeal to be made online.</p></speech>

I have three outstanding questions from the original list of ten and I will rattle through them quickly.</p> <p>  In subsection 14 of head 6, where a person should not question the validity of any action taken or opinion from a planning authority, what does &ldquo;not to question&rdquo; mean in plain English?  Obviously there is a very specific intent in that and I ask for that to be explained.</p> <p>  Similarly on head 12, where it talks about exclusion from entitlement to compensation, for clarity could I have a couple of real-world examples of what that might look like?</p> <p>  The one-year gap between the outcome of the preplanning and the submission of the planning application itself seems very long.  What is the rationale for that length of time given that in the intervening period, other people may come in with other applications and construction may commence that could be materially relevant to the final application?  I would have thought that three or six months would be logical.  If this is about streamlining the process, why are we giving an applicant a year?  I am sure there is a reasonable amount of time but 12 months seems very long indeed.</p></speech>

Having got to that stage, there may well be quite significant requirements that someone may need to reflect on or give effect to.  Coming back to the environmental legislation, for example, a person could have an appropriate assessment issue or an issue that needs to be monitored over the course of one full year or a particular season.  Let us say the issue is bats.  Bats are only active in a certain part of the year.  If an application is made at the wrong time of the year and gets to the stage where that issue needs to be covered off before a final application is made, the applicant might need that year in which to ensure that the right months are available to assess the bat issue, report on it and incorporated that into the final proposals.  The one-year period ties back in with the appropriate assessment consideration of a seasonal year.</p></speech>
