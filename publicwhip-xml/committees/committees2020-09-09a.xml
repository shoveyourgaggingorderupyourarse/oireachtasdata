They are joining us by video link to committee room 2 to discuss legislative frameworks in other countries.  Dr. Gianni Buquicchio is President of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.  Lord Sumption is a retired justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.  Both are welcome to our meeting this morning.</p> <p>  I must highlight for Dr. Buquicchio and Lord Sumption that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses physically attending in the Houses of the Oireachtas before committees may not be extended to witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I call Dr. Buquicchio to make an opening statement, if he is in a position to do so.  The video link seems slightly off.  If he is in a position to give an opening statement, can I ask that he do so now and that he try to limit his statement to five minutes or so to allow time for questions and answers?  It seems there may be technical difficulties.  Can Dr. Buquicchio hear me?  Could it be that the microphone is muted?</p> <p>  Perhaps we will move to Lord Sumption, if that is okay.  Can Lord Sumption give an opening statement?  If he could limit it to five minutes to allow time for questions and answers, we would greatly appreciate it.  Can you hear me, Lord Sumption?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Sumption" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#C00300"><p>I have submitted a memorandum in writing about the framework in the United Kingdom.  It consists of three pieces of legislation, one of which is the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, which is a general emergency powers legislation and covers, among other things, public emergencies.  The second is the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, which, in its current form, dates from 2008 when there was an amendment that introduced the powers which are currently relevant.  The third is legislation passed in March of this year specifically to deal with the coronavirus, entitled the Coronavirus Act 2020.  It is concerned mainly with the financial implications of combatting the coronavirus crisis, but also contains some provisions governing police powers, control of movements and so on.</p> <p>  The United Kingdom has rather controversially opted for the public health Act as the legal basis for the measures it has taken.  The reason this is controversial is that many lawyers, including me, consider that this Act does not confer specific powers on the Government to impose a lockdown.  It contains a number of specific powers, but not that one.  However, there has been no effective legal challenge to what the Goverment has done and that is the basis on which it has happened.  This is the only piece of legislation relevant to what the UK Government has done.</p> <p>  In my memorandum I have suggested that the United Kingdom experience has two main lessons for other jurisdictions.  First, if the Irish Government proposes to impose measures that drastically interfere with personal liberty, it will need to be absolutely specific about it in the primary legislation.  The UK legislation is only specific enough in the case of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.  The Act which the United Kingdom Government has chosen to use is not specific.  I am not an authority on the law of Ireland.  However, my understanding is that the matter is governed primarily by amendments to the Heath Act 1947, which were enacted in Ireland in March of this year, and that section 31(a) of that does confer specific power to impose a lockdown.  That is one mistake made in the United Kingdom that has not been made in Ireland.</p> <p>  The second lesson which I would suggest arises from the UK experience is that if the Government is going to confer extremely drastic powers on the Executive or Ministers, it is extremely important to have a very high level of parliamentary scrutiny.  These powers should only be available subject to parliamentary confirmation and regulation and they should have a very limited duration and be open to renewal.  It seems to me that for democracy it is absolutely fundamental that the Legislature should not forfeit pretty well day-to-day control of what Ministers are doing with powers which in any normal circumstances would be regarded as inconsistent with basic democratic laws.  I have read the Health Act 1947 of Ireland and while I must emphasise that I am not an authority on Irish law, it seems to me that the provisions for parliamentary scrutiny are virtually non-existent.  That seems to me, as a democrat, to be questionable.  I think that is all I need to say.</p></speech>

I will do that.  First, I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  My short presentation will not refer to the Irish response to this crisis but I will instead look at this crisis from a comparative law perspective.</p> <p>  Emergency measures may affect the normal functioning of state institutions and the democratic process.  They often involve additional limitations on fundamental rights and freedoms.  This is inevitable and the Venice Commission has always acknowledged that.  That said, at the Venice Commission we believe in the idea of a limited government based on democratic principles and the rule of law.  Even in an emergency, these fundamental principles should be respected.</p> <p>  Our commission has studied emergency regimes in a number of countries and has prepared general reports on this matter.  I refer in particular to our Rule of Law Checklist and to a more recent report, Respect for Democracy, Human Rights and the Rule of Law during States of Emergency, published last June.  We have elaborated specific benchmarks for exceptions from the rule of law principles in emergency situations that may be tolerated.  I will focus on the most important.</p> <p>  An emergency regime should be laid down, preferably, in the constitution and in more detail in a separate law and, if possible, an organic or constitutional law.  That being said, there are different models on how the constitutional order may deal with emergency cases.  In the members' country, the Constitution does not regulate these matters in detail, besides a mention of war and rebellion in Article 28.  This model exists in a number of other European countries in which emergency regimes are not entrenched in their constitutions.  This is the case, for example, in Norway, Denmark and Switzerland.  The constitutional doctrine in these countries acknowledges the situation of a constitutional necessity but, as far as I know, this doctrine has not been invoked in practice since the Second World War.</p> <p>  Many countries have pre-existing legislation that contains instructions that are more or less precise on what the government may do in case of war, earthquakes, epidemics, etc.  As I have said, it is preferable that these rules be discussed and adopted in advance in times of peace when the normal procedure applies.  The Covid crisis demonstrates that certain situations cannot be foreseen and that this crisis is all-encompassing and is much larger than anything we have experienced before.</p> <p>  There are two possible options.  The first is for a parliament to meet urgently and develop new legal rules or to give new powers to the executive.  Many countries did this during the Covid-19 crisis, including Ireland, which amended its Health Act.  The downside of this approach is that parliamentary procedures may be too lengthy and complicated for a sufficiently quick response.  In addition, in the context of an epidemic, the parliament may be simply unable to meet.</p> <p>  The most obvious solution is to adjust parliamentary procedures. For example, the German Bundestag quickly amended its rules.  It reduced its quorum, provided for electronic voting and closed hearings for the public, etc.  In Sweden, leaders of all political parties represented in its parliament concluded an agreement that only 55 members of the parliament, representing their parties in proportion, would take part in plenary sessions.</p><p>This is a temporary solution similar to the war delegation which is a mini parliament during war time provided for in the fundamental law of Sweden.</p><p> Alternatively, and this is the second option, the government may be given the power to act quickly before parliament can intervene.  Many constitutional orders provide for a declaration of a state of emergency which gives the government the power to adopt decrees having the force of law.  In Austria, for example, if the parliament cannot meet, the president of the country, jointly with the government, may take such temporary measures by way of provisional law amending regulations.  In Italy, under Article 77 of the constitution, the government may adopt decree laws in sudden cases of necessity and urgency.</p><p> If the constitution or the legislation gives the government a broad mandate to legislate in emergency situations, it is important to follow certain rules and provide external checks on the government's powers.  First, the law making power of the government should be strictly limited in time.  Moreover, changes introduced during emergency situations should not have a permanent effect.  The main purpose of emergency measures is to overcome the emergency and to return to normalcy.  Emergency decrees or other emergency measures should not be abused to introduce permanent changes in legislation, especially in institutional arrangements.  Next, it is crucial, as soon as it is practically possible, for parliament to exercise its supervisory function and review these measures.</p><p> In addition, actions of the executive should be subject to effective judicial review.  The courts should be able to assess the proportionality of specific measures taken by the government.  This judicial review will be supplemented by a review of the constitutionality of emergency legislation by a constitutional court where it exists.  Speaking of proportionality, we understand that the state's margin of operation in times of emergency is much larger than during other times.  This is particularly true in the current situation where information about the virus and the most efficient ways of combating it is scarce or uncertain.  However, a larger margin of operation should not make judicial review meaningless.  In particular, the courts should ensure that the crisis is not used by the government to limit rights for ulterior purposes, for example, to silence the political opposition.</p><p> I will shorten my speech.  The members of the committee have received my original text.</p></speech>

I will now open the floor for questions from Deputies.  First, I call Deputy Carroll MacNeill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#E00300"><p>I am sorry, but we lost the connection with the committee room for a few seconds.  I thank the two witnesses for attending and being of assistance to the committee today.  The rule of law and its operation are always important and never more so than when citizens are in real danger from any source, be it an external threat or what we have all experienced in the last number of months.  While this seems like a step to the side for the work of this committee, which has been focusing on sectoral and Government responses to the management of the pandemic here, it is incredibly important that we are talking about the rule of law and the maintenance and respect for the rule of law as well as how we behave predictably as a nation and as nations together based on that.</p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions for Dr. Buquicchio.  I hope I am pronouncing his name correctly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gianni Buquicchio" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#E00400"><p>It is a very difficult name.</p><p>It is a very difficult name to pronounce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#F00200"><p>Thank you.  Dr. Buquicchio referred to the "margin of appreciation".  What specifically does he mean by that, in respect of the judicial review?  Is he saying that governments basically have a large degree of flexibility in the approach that they are taking and as long as they are not actually transgressing on civil liberties they can take a broader approach in these circumstances?  I ask him to clarify what he means by "margin of appreciation".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gianni Buquicchio" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#F00300"><p>This is a large crisis and of course the response to it is exceptional.  The clauses of exceptions are those outlined in the Human Rights Convention of the Council of Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#F00400"><p>Obviously, Dr. Buquicchio has gone through the different parliamentary and executive responses in different parts of Europe.  Our own research in this Parliament indicates that the real difficulty has been the voting arrangements in different parliaments.  Parliaments have come up with different solutions for ways of meeting and for scrutinising executive decisions in the management of the pandemic but the main difficulty has been with voting.  Dr. Buquicchio referred in his statement to taking the long view and the luxury of being in the position of being able to take a long, systemic view on how to plan for these things over time.  Is that correct?  Is that what he is advising parliaments to do now in the context of the next pandemic or the next big issue that might disrupt parliamentary scrutiny?</p></speech>

This will not be the last one.  Unfortunately I fear that we will have more pandemics like this one, if not even more serious.  Therefore, voting and electoral rights are very important.  We studied this issue in our June report on human rights and democracy during the pandemic crisis.  There were different situations at play.  There were cases in Europe where elections were planned and were held.  In Holland for instance, they were postponed for a little but in the end, they were held.  The situation in France is one which deserves more in-depth study.  There the lockdown intervened after the first round of local elections and the second round was postponed for about two months.  This postponement was agreed between the political stakeholders and the Parliament did intervene.  However, if the postponement had been for longer than two months, that would have required a law of the Parliament or the holding of the two rounds again.</p></speech>

That has been a barrier to exercising the required degree of parliamentary scrutiny so we are trying to look to the future to see what arrangements we might make.</p><p>I wish to ask Lord Sumption about what he said with regard to the health Act and specifically what he said on ongoing parliamentary scrutiny<i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the health Act.  Would he like to elaborate further on that?  We will have a number of other witnesses who will speak to that point later. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Sumption" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#F00700"><p>Under the Act which the UK Government should have used, the one which most obviously applied, namely, the Civil Contingencies Act, states that in an emergency the Government can bring regulations forward which have provisional validity for seven days.  That is to say they require no parliamentary approval until the end of that seven-day period.</p><p>Within seven days, they must be confirmed by the Parliament and thereafter must be reconfirmed every 30 days.  That seems to me to be an acceptable compromise. <i>[Inaudible.]</i>That is how the system ought to work in the UK.  However, the decision to use other legislation which was not designed for emergencies of this scale has meant that the provisional validity of the regulations in the UK is much longer than seven days, at 28 days, and the regulations could remain in force for up to two years.

As such, nothing happened for nearly a month after that.  There was then an extra 28 days thereafter to get confirmation.  That was not at all satisfactory.  In the UK, for the protection of the health of Members of Parliament, no more than 60 MPs have been allowed into the chamber at any one time.</p> <p>  I have listened to the comments of Dr. Buquicchio.  I think an important distinction must be drawn between different kinds of constitution.  There are constitutions that work on a party list whereby, effectively, it is the parties that are represented in the parliament.  In that kind of system, one can see the logic of having what may be referred to as a mini-parliament of, in the case of Sweden, 55 members.  However, in Britain and, as I understand it, in Ireland, members of the public vote for Members of Parliament by constituency and not by party.  That gives rise to a particular problem.  If the population of a particular geographical constituency elects a Member of Parliament to represent that constituency, it seems to me to be a constitutional outrage to exclude that Member from the Chamber.  It is possible to have a virtual chamber, but that only works for a limited number of Members.  Under the constituency system, there may come a point at which one must choose which is more important: the health of individual Members of Parliament or their high constitutional calling.  To my mind, the second of those should take priority.</p></speech>

I direct my first questions to Lord Sumption.  Obviously, the pandemic is an extraordinary event, but it is not an unprecedented one.  However, the response of political systems in Ireland and around the world has been unprecedented.  In terms of that political response, has too much emphasis has been placed on public health advice to the exclusion of other important factors that we, as politicians, should also be taking into account?</p></speech>

As a citizen, I do think that is the case.  The amount of deprivation of liberty that is authorised in a democracy is not simply a question of health policy.  Health policy certainly comes into it, but it is also a legal, constitutional, economic and education question.  Above all, it is a moral question.</p><p>Weighing up all these different considerations, is necessarily a matter of political judgment.  The question really is how far should one allow clinical and medical considerations to outweigh the many other factors that make up the vigour of human life in a free and open society like ours?  That simply is not an issue which could currently be delegated to the scientists, even if the scientists agreed, which they do not. </p></speech>

Obviously, we are all politicians in this room and I am conscious that the witness is a lawyer, but the laws that we make are very much moulded by policy decisions and the reaction that we have to the event, namely, the pandemic.  I have a concern that in our response to this pandemic, we are not taking into account other factors, such as the mental health impact that the restrictions are having on elderly persons, the educational impact this is having upon younger people and children, and the impact it is having on other individuals who are not suffering from Covid-related illnesses.  I am conscious that the witness is a lawyer, but he is also a historian.  What, does the witness believe, is it about this pandemic that has resulted in such an unprecedented response from governments and parliaments around the world?</p></speech>

I think the main reason why the response has been unprecedented, certainly in Europe and North America, is that we have got rather complacent about our capacity to overcome natural forces.  We have a very considerable capacity to do that, but it certainly is not unlimited.  There have been epidemics and pandemics before over the last 40 or 50 years, but they have hardly touched Europe or North America.  That has given us a sense of invulnerability, which we are now learning, was a mistake.  We are not actually invulnerable.  There are many reasons the reaction has been so extreme, but by far the most important is that we have come to believe that there is nothing that the state cannot do to protect us.  That is something that is borne of our extremely fortunate experience over the last half century.  It is not going to continue.  We are likely to have more pandemics of this kind and we have to develop a kind of sense of proportion, which I am afraid we have forgotten over the last century since the previous comparable pandemic, which was the Spanish flu pandemic between 1918 and 1921.</p></speech>

As the witness has indicated, that is a legal measure that the state can introduce for what it believes to be the purpose of trying to reduce the spread of the disease.  I ask the witness, legally, in the United Kingdom, is there a basis under the Public Health Act to effect a lockdown, and if there is, what does the witness believe is the impact and the success of a lockdown in terms of suppressing this disease?  Or does it merely delay the spread of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Sumption" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#H00500"><p>The answer to the first of those questions is that, although the Government of the United Kingdom believes that the Public Health Act confers power to impose a lockdown, I do not actually agree with it.  I think it does have such power under other legislation, but that other legislation would subject it to a much higher level of parliamentary scrutiny, which may be the reason it has not chosen it.  As regards the effectiveness, this is essentially a question of epidemiology.  I can only refer to the epidemiological advice which the UK Government received on 25 February of this year, and again on 16 March.</p><p>It was informed by its experts in very clear terms that the effect of aggressive isolation measures, such as a lockdown, was not to suppress the peak incidence of the disease but simply to spread it over a longer period, and it would simply come back once it had become endemic, so it would be sitting there waiting for us when the measures were lifted.  To be effective, these measures would have to remain in force indefinitely until there was an effective vaccine, which in February or March we thought might take as long as 18 months.</p><p> There is a serious question about the effect of lockdowns.  The view expressed at the outset of the crisis by the British experts, which makes more sense and has been borne out by the experience of recent weeks across Europe, is that the virus will simply bounce back when the measures are lifted with the result that the effect of the measures is primarily to prolong the agony and increase the economic dislocation and the social and educational damage without achieving a corresponding reduction in the long-term impact of the disease.</p></speech>

We have that supervisory shroud above us to prevent us going beyond what is permitted by the Constitution.  However, when one looks at the legal framework in place in our response to the pandemic, there seems to be four levels in place here.  First, there is the Constitution, which guarantees personal freedoms and fundamental rights.  Then, as Lord Sumption indicated, there is the statute, namely, the Health Act 1947, which was amended this year and a new section 31A inserted.  It gives the Minister for Health power to make regulations, and there have been a series of regulations that have been made by the Minister for Health over the past four months or so.  Those regulations change quite frequently.  Beyond the Constitution, the Act and the regulations, the Government also issues guidelines.  These have been quite controversial recently when individuals got into difficulty for breaching the guidelines.  We seem to have three active levels of State regulation, namely, the Act, the regulations and the guidelines.  What would Lord Sumption say in respect of an ordinary citizen who is trying to find out what he or she can and cannot do and whether we need to be much more specific in telling them what can and cannot be done under our legal system?</p></speech>

The guidelines issued from time to time by the UK government have gone a lot further than anything in the regulations.  It is clear in the United Kingdom, and I presume also in Ireland, that guidelines are only binding in law so far as they are also reflected in regulations which are within the powers conferred by the statute.  In the United Kingdom, the Government has not been nearly clear enough about what is guidance and what is law.  It is fundamental that it should be.</p> <p>  In the UK, at the outset back in March and early April, the police started enforcing the Government guidelines in circumstances where there was no legislative basis for them.  That came to an end quite quickly, because in the middle of April, the College of Policing, which was responsible for giving general guidance on the exercise of police powers to the police forces throughout the country, produced a very helpful document on a single page which told every policeman in the land what he could and could not enforce.  That was an extremely positive and productive thing to have done, but it was not done by a Ministry but by the police.  The Government would have assisted the process very much had it been much clearer from the outset about what was advice and what was law.</p></speech>

Dr. Buquicchio stated that any measures taken by a state in response to the pandemic should be proportionate.  Proportionality is a principle in this country's legal system and that of most European countries.  When do the laws which have been introduced here and which seem to be consistent with laws throughout Europe extend beyond what is proportionate?</p></speech>

They are indispensable because politicians and members of the Government are not specialists, but political decisions belong to the Government and the Parliament.  The scientists are there only to advise, not to take decisions.  The Deputy is right to stress related problems concerning mental health and education, etc.  These are really serious problems which have not yet been solved.  Next month we will see the impact of these exigencies on the education of students.  Schools and universities in many countries were closed and students lost almost a full year of real education.  Teleworking was available but it is not the same as real participation in the life of a school.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about levels of response and proportionality.  There are three important tests.  The first is necessity, that is, the measures must be necessary.  The second test is proportionality.  Measures must be proportionate to the challenges and problems.  The last test, which is very important, is temporariness.  The measures must not last for a long time.  They must be temporary.  Whether a measure is proportionate depends on the knowledge at the time the measure is taken.</p> <p>  A question about limits to the movement of people was raised earlier.  I refer to paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which allows for limits to the movement of people with the legitimate aim of preventing the spread of infectious disease.  These are the points I wished to add to our discussion.</p></speech>

In Ireland we issued guidance that recommended against travelling abroad.  Public servants have been penalised for travelling abroad.  A constituent of mine who works in the public service in the mid-west was called in and asked to apologise for travelling abroad.  He went to Spain, not to Texas or somewhere like that.  He stayed within the European Union.</p> <p>  Very high-profile people have been penalised for travelling abroad.  This is guidance, but it seems that the coercive powers of the State are being used.  Public servants are being told that they cannot go against the guidance.  If they do, they must take unpaid leave afterwards and may have to apologise.  There is no doubt that they will be shamed.  Is that in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights?  Does a restriction on the right to travel have to be pursuant to law?  Can a Government simply advise people not to travel abroad, but then punish them if they do not take the advice?</p><p>Is that adequate under what is envisaged by the European Convention?  I ask Dr. Buquicchio in the first instance and perhaps Lord Sumption may wish to come in.</p></speech>

The problem is with discriminating between normal citizens and civil servants.  I know that, for instance, in some countries-----</p></speech>

But a generalised permission to travel abroad has occurred in many countries of Europe, especially in France, Switzerland, Germany, etc.  Even for us, in summer we could not cross the border with Germany for several weeks.  This is possible.  Of course there must be a legal basis for doing this but it can be permitted by the European Convention.</p></speech>

In my opinion all these rules must be co-ordinated and harmonised in Europe, the Schengen area and internationally in respect of other countries outside Europe.  As the committee is aware, the epidemic is increasing again in France, Spain and so on.  There are some countries which are again taking new measures to restrict movements between the borders.  I have been informed that the European Union will discuss this chaos, because it has been chaos up to now, on 22 September to try to harmonise all the legislation concerning reciprocity between the different countries.  There must be one European rule.</p></speech>

For the countries within the Schengen area, the restrictions ended in principle on 15 June of this year.  The restrictions as regards relations between the Schengen area and non-members of the European Union came to an end on 6 July.  In both cases, that was without prejudice to the right of individual states to introduce new restrictions if they thought it necessary.</p> <p>  As to your main question as to whether this should be embodied in law or whether it is enough that people are disciplined for failing to accept Government advice, my answer is the same as that of the last witness.  It seems to me to be fundamental that it should be embodied in law, not just under the European Convention but also as a matter of basic constitutional propriety under a common law system such as both the United Kingdom and Ireland have.  Civil servants are citizens as well as employees of the Government.  Where they choose to go on holiday belongs very much to their private lives as citizens.</p><p>I would answer the question by saying that a legal basis for restrictions on where they can travel is absolutely indispensable.</p></speech>

I will continue in the same vein as the Chairman because it is an area of interest.  The issue of foreign travel is particularly contentious in Ireland, and this follows on from the previous questions and the witnesses' responses.  Ireland has a green list.  A similar traffic light system is in operation in other countries across Europe and the world.  We have Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advices and guidelines from the Government.  In the international experience, what is the legal basis for such restrictions?  Are there legal bases in other countries that do not apply in Ireland?  Where do the witnesses believe that improvements can be made?</p></speech>

In the United Kingdom the measures were taken under the Public Health Act, which contains - in addition to the general powers to take steps to control the spread of disease - specific provisions about restrictions on entering at ports, airports and so on.  There was a clear legal basis for them.  Unlike the points I made earlier about the lockdown, it seems to me that the restrictions on travel being imposed by law in the United Kingdom are within the powers of the Public Health Act.  Whether they are effective or proportionate is another question altogether.  It depends, at least in part, upon how effective they are in restricting the spread of the disease, a subject on which there is very little research currently available.</p></speech>

I would add that it is necessary to have a legal basis in order to take these kinds of measures.  I will stress one point that does not apply to Ireland.  In Italy, there was a fight between the central government and the regions because individual regions took different measures from one another.  At the end they decided to co-ordinate everything and there was only one regulation.  I stress that for these kinds of limitations - green, pink or red, etc. - one needs a legal basis everywhere.

This was resolved by agreement when the quarantine regulations were effectively abolished by the creation of wide-ranging exemptions in the course of July.  Those exemptions are now being revisited and we may see a revival of that judicial review.</p><p> Second, there was a far more wide-ranging challenge by a businessman called Simon Dolan, who was refused leave to proceed with his application for judicial review because he was challenging the original lockdown rules back in March and it was said that he was too late.  In a way, I believe that was unfortunate because it has been said that these UK Government regulations are beyond the powers of the UK Government.  This is clearly one of the things that, it seems to me, is something the courts may wish to decide.  That is what has actually happened in the UK.</p></speech>

Indeed, recently there was a decision of the <i>pr&eacute;fet</i>of our region or department to impose the wearing of masks everywhere in public spaces.  This decision was challenged at the administrative tribunal which, in a way, modified the decision of the <i>pr&eacute;fet</i>.  Then it was challenged or considered by the state council, which said that this obligation to wear masks everywhere in public areas was legitimate.  This is one example.  There was also a decision of the federal constitutional tribunal concerning the cancellation of an event.  The tribunal considered that the event should have been maintained.</p></speech>

The challenge of striking the balance between public health considerations and economic, social and other considerations, including mental health and educational needs, is consistently raised.  In Ireland, the Government is advised from a public health perspective by the National Public Health Emergency Team.  In Britain, the Government is advised by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.  Can the witnesses offer an opinion or point to international examples of how other bodies or decision-making forums are used to help inform government decision-making?  Are there models that incorporate opinions other than public health advice that the witnesses can offer as an alternative?  Can we start with Mr. Sumption?</p></speech>

In regard to testing, Article 8 of the convention includes some limitations to the protection of the <i>[inaudible]</i>life when there are situations such as this crisis.

There is no statutory power to compel to be tested people who are not believed to be currently infected.  As to vaccination, there is no power to require people to be vaccinated.  The public health Act expressly provides that the powers are not available to compel people to undergo any form of treatment, and vaccination would unquestionably be regarded as a form of treatment.</p></speech>

In his statement to the committee Dr. Buquicchio outlined the constraints and difficulties that many Governments have faced in responding with adequate legislation during the Covid crisis.  He mentioned particularly that the German Bundestag quickly amended its rules and reduced the quorum required for electronic voting and closed hearings from the public etc., and the leaders of the political parties representative of Parliament concluded an agreement that only 55 members of Parliament representing their parties in proportion would take part in the plenary sessions.  He went on to outline alternative models requiring that the Government act before Parliament does and what kinds of checks and balances may be put in place to ensure Governments do not overreach in their powers.  In the case of the first scenario of Parliament convening under changed rules or in a reduced format, will Dr. Buquicchio outline what checks and balances would be appropriate in a situation where legislation is being passed by a reduced number of representatives?</p></speech>

I have a question for Lord Sumption.  In his report to the committee, he states that in urgent cases regulations under the public health legislation have provisional validity, pending parliamentary approval, for 28 days and for any period when the British Parliament is not sitting, parliament cannot amend, remove or revoke them and that they remain in force at the discretion of Ministers for up to two years.  Earlier in his paper, he makes reference to the Secretary of State's role and later there is a reference to government by ministerial decree.  Is it possible for Lord Sumption to outline, with respect to this section, which Ministers have a decision-making role?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Sumption" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#P00500"><p>In theory, these decisions are made collectively by the British Cabinet.  In practice, in what has been a feature of the way the British Government has worked some decades, there has been a progressive narrowing of the number of people who make these decisions.  We are not absolutely sure how they are being made in the United Kingdom but it very much looks as if they are being made, essentially, by the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Health and a very small number of other Ministers - two or, at most, three - who are very close to the Prime Minister.  My view is that this is not at all satisfactory because the broader the decision-making basis, the greater the measure of discussion, the larger the scope for challenge in parliament and the better the decision-making process is likely to be.  Many people have remarked that the successive policies of the British Government on Covid-19 have chopped and changed.  The British Government seems to have been taken by surprise by every new development and this has led to a loss in support for its measures to a very significant extent.  That problem could have been reduced and possibly avoided if decisions had not been confined to such a very small number of people.</p></speech>

I will put my questions to Lord Sumption.  He is on record as having admitted to not obeying Covid-19 regulations when they began to reach a level of what he termed "absurdity".  What was his threshold for what became an absurd regulation with which he would no longer comply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Sumption" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#P00800"><p>When I said that, I was referring to the fact that the lockdown had originally been justified on the grounds that it was necessary in order to enable the intensive care capacity of the National Health Service, NHS, to catch up.  Although I disagreed with it, I thought it was at least a serious justification and defensible proposition.  By the end of April and in early May, the position was reached where the NHS intensive care capacity had caught up but, nonetheless, the Government, at a very critical moment, decided it would continue with the regulations, although, in light of the epidemiological advice it was receiving, it was very difficult to identify any legitimate purpose for it.</p><p>There comes a point when the moral force of the law disappears and that point had been reached by then.  Of course, anybody who decides not to comply with the law must be prepared to take the consequences, but the reality is that coercion only works if a sufficient number of people accept the moral force of what the government is doing, and we have reached the stage in the United Kingdom where the level of acceptance of what the government is doing is at a fairly low level.</p></speech>

In particular, is he concerned that whatever valid questions there are, and there are many with regard to the legislative framework on which the response to Covid-19 is based, they can be subverted by elements in society that have no interest in democracy, such as far-right elements, conspiratorial elements and anti-health elements?  Does he have any concern that actions such as his and the actions of others are lost and are then corrupted by those forces?</p></speech>

However, it must be remembered that sometimes a person will make a decision for perfectly responsible and morally defensible grounds which other people, who are much less careful about what they are doing, will take advantage of.  I do not believe that is a sufficient reason for keeping silent about what I and many other people regard as a moral and constitutional outrage.  Sometimes, in the interests of truth and honesty, one must put up with the fact that many unpleasant people might agree with one.</p></speech>

I disagree because we are talking about a lockdown as something that is to be feared.  Nobody wants to go into lockdown but I and many people remember lockdown here.  It was a perfectly understandable response to a crisis that was scaring the life out of people all over the world.  Many people felt safe during the lockdown and it served to reduce the numbers.  We cannot live in lockdown forever and the challenge for Ireland, the UK and everywhere else is to get back to some form of normality across all levels while living with the virus.  Does Lord Sumption believe that discussing lockdown in those fearful terms and talking about democracy being threatened and the rise of despots is a proportionate narrative of the reality of what is happening politically in our region or throughout the world?</p></speech>

The way in which we govern ourselves is a great deal more important than the way in which we react to any particular crisis because that will live with us forever whereas the way in which we respond to a particular crisis may be mistaken or misguided, but the consequences will not live with us forever.  I do not accept the Deputy's starting premise that the lockdown saved a significant number of lives.  Over the long term it will be found to have saved very few lives, because unless the lockdown is maintained indefinitely, the infection rate simply rebounds afterwards.  I also believe that in areas such as dementia, mental health and delayed diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the deaths occasioned by the lockdown may in the end not fall far short of the deaths occasioned by the disease.  My answer to the Deputy's question is in part that I think history will look back on this as a monument of collective hysteria and governmental folly.  That is a view many people would reject and I take it the Deputy would reject it, but it is a view that I and others hold.</p></speech>

I have three disparate questions so perhaps I will put them first and whoever wishes can reply.</p><p>Essentially a lot of public health advice is drawn from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDPC, but there is a quite a variation in how this manifests itself across different countries in terms of the advice given or taken.  It was said earlier that it is up to the experts to advise governments but that it is up to governments to make decisions.  Is there much deviation from public health advice across Europe?  There is a very high level of adherence to such advice here and a degree of questioning of that by the general public. </p><p> My second question relates to the variation across parliaments.  As was mentioned earlier, we have a written Constitution which requires Members to be present and voting in our D&aacute;il Chamber.  Remote voting would actually require a referendum which is not something we want to conduct in the middle of a pandemic.  We also have an unusually high number of Independent Deputies so scaling down the numbers proportionately is more problematic in our Parliament.  Are there any similar situations from which we could learn in terms of how to manage this?  I will leave it at that for now but if there is time, I will come back in with a third question.</p></speech>

Looking back, it seems that the advice has tended to change quite frequently and sometimes quite radically but it is quite difficult to determine to what degree Ministers have adhered to it.  Certainly at an early stage, SAGE in the UK advised against coercive measures on the grounds that the Government would get a better response if the public were treated as adults.  When they eventually changed their mind and went for a lockdown, they seemed to have been of the view that the lockdown should be maintained for a very long time, possibly until a vaccine was available.  The degree of adherence to their advice has varied but in general, this has been because the Government has to take into account many factors other than the scientific ones.  There is a limit, for example, to what people can reasonably be expected to put up with and there is also a limit to the amount of economic damage that societies can sustain.  One cannot expect the adherence to be total in any country.</p> <p>  As to numbers of people in Parliament, I do not think I can really add to what has already been said.  It seems to me that in a constituency-based system, especially one with a significant number of Independents, it is extremely difficult to justify a reduction in the number of people who attend the Chamber.</p></speech>

I am not saying that the advice of the scientific groups or councils is being more or less followed by governments.  Of course, as Lord Sumption said, the economy and other important issues must be taken into consideration by governments.</p><p>I refer to the situations in Sweden and Italy.  The Swedish Government decided not to impose a lockdown because cases were not particularly numerous and the number of deaths was also very low.  On the contrary, a lockdown was imposed in Italy because thousands of people were dying every day in March and the following month.</p><p> On the issue of scientific advice, I wish to stress that even the scientific experts are not in full agreement.  Their advice is taken into consideration and followed by the majority of the European Parliament, although there is sometimes deviation from that advice due to other considerations such as economic factors, etc.</p></speech>

I tend to favour a very high level of transparency and information being provided in a usable format such that people can act as adults and make decisions for themselves.  Does providing information in such a manner contribute to public goodwill in terms of adhering to restrictions and driving behaviour?</p></speech>

As I stated, the information or advice provided by scientists must be as transparent as possible.  The problem is that normal people like the Deputy or me do not have a good understanding of what is happening.  The information is not consistent or widespread.  We know how many new cases there are worldwide each day but it can be difficult to find out how many new cases there are in a particular area, such as France, for example.  The information must be provided in a much more transparent way such that everybody can make the necessary decisions.</p></speech>

Unlike three other members who have spoken, I am not a lawyer.  Rather, I am a layman and my interpretation of the rules and regulations may be slightly different from theirs.  In the first instance, my belief is that guidelines are only guidelines and have no legal effect unless they are grounded in law.  Are the emergency legislation and the existence of a declared emergency sufficient grounding to allow the guidelines to be enforceable and punishable?  The Chairman also raised that issue.</p> <p>  I am conscious that Ireland is an island nation with an open economy that is heavily dependent on travel.  The air route between Dublin and London is the second busiest route in the world, which is indicative of the amount of business that takes place.  However, there are two types of travel: necessary and optional.  To my mind, travel may be necessary for the conduct of business.  To what extent can those engaging in business travel be protected in the countries they are travelling from and to?  Can they expect to be treated fairly, openly and honestly and allowed to carry out their business in the current situation?</p> <p>  As previous speakers have noted, Ireland is different from many other counties as it has a written Constitution.  We have available to us an alternative parliamentary venue which can facilitate the attendance of all Members of Parliament.</p><p>All Members of Parliament can vote and have voted several times in recent weeks.  That facility is available to us, unlike some other countries.  </p><p> The common good also plays a role and we must observe what is in the common good.  The question arises whether the measures are adequately taken in the common good and are sufficient to ensure that adherence is statutorily required. </p><p> That is all.  Unfortunately I must go to the House. </p></speech>

To be enforceable they need a legal basis.  For example, there are recommendations on how to wear masks correctly.   These are not enforceable.  The recommendation to wear a mask in public in open space was an administrative decision taken on the basis of legal advice.  These are now compulsory in France, for instance.</p></speech>

In almost all countries, and certainly in Ireland and the UK, the Minister makes these rules by regulation.  If the Minister wants to give them legal force, he or she can do it by making a new regulation.  Therefore, if the Minister wants their guidance to have legal force, they must express it in pure language that citizens can understand and do so in a regulation.  It cannot possibly be good enough that something vaguer, say, guidance given at a press conference, be given the force of law because one of the essential elements of law is that it must be possible for the citizen to find out what the law is.  For the citizen to look it up, it must be coherently expressed in words which allow for the minimum of confusion.  Therefore, on whether there should be a right of power to give legal enforcement to guidance in an emergency, my answer is "no".</p> <p>  On necessary travel, there are serious practical difficulties in defining what travel is necessary as it would differ from one individual to the next.  The law necessarily operates in blocks, it is a one-size-fits-all mechanism.  I find it very difficult to understand how one could define the necessity of travel with any precision in something that was ascertainable as a matter of law or regulation.  </p></speech>

I have a private view on their status and whether they are legally binding in the interim between when the Minister announces the regulations and when the details are actually published.  Will both of our eminent witnesses give their view on whether those regulations have to be adhered to or are binding?  Even though the Minister may have announced the broad parameters of what they contain at a press conference, are they binding before someone can read the detail?</p></speech>

It is a fundamental requirement, not least of the law of the European Convention for Human Rights, that something must constitute law and that it is an essential feature of law that it should be publicly available.  An announcement that the Government proposes to do this or that is not the same thing as law.</p><p>To my mind, as a matter of the law of the European Convention on Human Rights, if a Minister says that a measure will take effect on Monday but is not published until Wednesday, it is not law until Wednesday.  As a matter of domestic law, the measure can apply retrospectively, but that raises very serious problems with regard to the convention.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Durkan, I do not have any legal background, so I will ask a few general questions.  The steps the Government has taken in recent months have been intended to fight a pandemic, as was the case in every other country.  In Ireland specifically, we were also trying to prevent our hospitals from being overrun.  We do not have the capacity of countries like the UK or Germany.  As a result, it was very important to restrict the spread of infection as much as possible.  As Lord Sumption highlighted, as we begin to open up, we are experiencing the increased rate of infection that other countries are experiencing, although this seems to be mostly confined to younger age groups.</p> <p>  Since the beginning of lockdown, we have faced the closure of many sectors of the economy.  I refer particularly to what are called "wet pubs", that is, establishments that do not serve food and just serve alcohol.  Later in the lockdown, the regulations under the Health Act 1947 were softened to allow gastropubs to open.  This allowed people to congregate and eat.  We are hoping for the wet pubs to open in the coming months.  I have spoken about the idea of regionalisation at meetings of this committee in recent months.  At present, Dublin has one of the highest rates of infection in the country.  The constituency I represent has one of the lowest but we have had to adhere to the national health advice.  If there is a very low concentration of disease and if, ultimately, it is found that wet pubs in my constituency could have opened, are there grounds for judicial review?   Could such a thing be considered if this pattern is repeated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Sumption" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#U00500"><p>I can only answer that question in the context of the law of the United Kingdom.  I am not an expert but I believe the basic principles are very similar in Ireland.  The best way to challenge that type of problem would be to claim that a response is irrational.  My view is that, as a matter of public law, the Government is entitled to a very wide margin of judgment in the area of rationality and a claimant would need a very extreme and obvious case indeed for a challenge to be successful.  Having said that, looking at administration from the Government's point of view, there is obviously a lot to be said for fine-tuning the regional impacts of these measures as much as possible.  Most countries in Europe have done this in one way or another.  In the United Kingdom, we now only impose lockdowns in specific areas which have seen higher levels of infection.  France has a system of green, red and orange areas.  This system is under the control of departmental prefects and it seemed to work very well.  For instance, it meant that at the height of the pandemic the scale of restrictions in Paris, where the infection rate was highest, was much greater than in Moselle or Dordogne, where the figures were much more favourable.</p><p>That seems to be a sensible way of doing it.  Ultimately, this is a matter of political and administrative judgment.  It is not easy to deal with it by law, which is essentially a blunt instrument.  Of course, one has to have the power but, ultimately, the decisive factor is going to be the element of clinical, epidemiological and political judgment.</p></speech>

I will speak to Dr. Buquicchio on the issue of air travel.  Ireland's dependence on international access was highlighted.  I know there are probably different protocols but is there anything within Dr. Buquicchio's office that can describe a European protocol for aviation to which Ireland might ultimately be obliged to adhere?  We have most stringent airline protocols in terms of flying into and out of the country, whereas Germany and France have far more relaxed rules.  Is there anything under European guidance that could impose a different scenario in Ireland in terms of aviation and air access?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I cannot answer as it is not within our competencies.  I would like to come back to what Lord Sumption said just before that.  I share his worry regarding the difference between parts of the country where the virus is more active and where it is not active at all.  It was the case in France that after the first general lockdown there were different measures concerning different administrative regions or <i>d&eacute;partements</i>.  Until some weeks ago, there was a local lockdown in one a part of France.  It is possible evaluate all this afterwards.  When the first general lockdown was decided, everybody was afraid of this virus, including the authorities of course, although some regions of the country were completely safe.  Now they have learned the lesson and they are shaping their responses differently in the different <i>d&eacute;partements</i>.  I am not talking about lockdown but wearing masks or allowing people to travel within a certain number of kilometres locally when it is really necessary.</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.  I want to go back to the issue of co-ordination across Europe and in the UK.  Do the witnesses feel that there could have been far more co-operation among member states on having a coherent set of regulations across Europe rather than individual states taking this on alone?  I refer to instances where if something was the regulation in one state, the complete opposite was being done in another.  From a European point of view, could there have been a lot more done in the context of how we tackled this problem?  This is about looking at the lessons to learn from how we have dealt with this issue, the lessons to be learned as we move forward and putting a constructive set of proposals in place that can be implemented at very short notice.</p></speech>

Many of these people, however, came to Italy via Germany or Switzerland etc. and they could not be identified at the border in Italy.  They were Asian but nobody could identify if they were coming from China directly or from another European country.   I have said already that I am very much in favour of the harmonisation of the measures surrounding travel at a European level, within Europe and outside.  I hope Europe will succeed in this task.  It is not easy because each country has its own views and it will not be easy to find a common harmonised solution, but I still hope for this.</p></speech>

We cannot look into the future to see how the virus will further develop.  Do we need to work even harder together rather than as individual member states working on our own?  In Ireland, for example, we have a scenario where a lot more flights are coming from a lot of different countries of origin into Belfast Airport, which is into the island of Ireland, whereas there are many more restrictions for flights into other airports in the Republic of Ireland.  Does this further emphasise the need for closer co-operation between members states and the European Union?</p></speech>

I will not go into the politically controversial reasons for that but clearly the results are extremely unsatisfactory, as everybody recognises.  The main problem about dealing with this is at a European Union level is that the conditions differ in different countries.  It seems to me that the most that could be really agreed at a European level is a measure by which, in time, we could restrict travel.  In Britain we have a loose understanding, which is really not much more than that, that there is a threshold infection rate above which people or countries would be placed on the red list for quarantine purposes.  It would be possible to do that at a European level.  I also take the view that many countries have taken about their national territory<i>.</i>I think that would be a view that is quite difficult to defend given the very different experiences that different countries have with their state of hospital resources and very different social habits.</p></speech>

Let us look forward with regard to co-operation with the United Kingdom and in particular with the Ireland and Northern Ireland issue.  Does Lord Sumption not believe that now is the time for both Ireland and the UK to sit down and come up with a framework for dealing with an issue like this, rather than trying to put it together the week an issue starts to arise?</p> <p>  One thing about Covid-19 was that it needed a fast reaction but there was no framework for dealing with it in most countries across Europe and the world.  Is it not now time, in particular with the UK leaving the European Union, and Ireland being so close to the UK, to have a sense of a mechanism in place to enable work to start immediately an issue like this arises again?</p></speech>

Earlier I talked about consultation and of course we have a common travel arrangement between the UK and Ireland.  The countries of the Schengen Agreement in Europe have a common travel arrangement.  If there is a common travel arrangement, it is essential to co-ordinate the arrangements made for restricting travel across borders or for imposing quarantine rules.  Exactly how we do this is a difficult question.</p> <p>  The main emphasis of Deputy Burke's question is that it is important for the British and Irish Governments to co-ordinate as closely as possible with a view to not having anomalies like those mentioned by Deputy Burke, especially in circumstances where there is a transparent land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.</p></speech>

I was looking at what is happening in Australia, where a national cabinet seems to have been established consisting of the Prime Minister and the premiers of the six Australian states.  Is there a danger in something like this?  I am not saying that people have exceeded their jurisdiction or have taken on more powers than they actually have.  Are there lessons to be learned from what has occurred here in respect of ensuring that, while governments need to react appropriately, at no stage can they exceed their jurisdiction and remove the rights of people, especially the right of people to access the courts?  Can we ensure that the role of the courts in different countries is not restricted?  Are there lessons we can learn from what has occurred during the past six months in this whole area?</p></speech>

I am not conscious that this has been a problem.  Given different national systems of law it is probably difficult to co-ordinate exactly, bearing in mind that judges are independent and form their own views.  Of course we can harmonise the law, and there may be some scope for that, but we are never going to remove entirely the element of discretion that may be necessary to provide for problems specific to a particular territory.</p></speech>

Most things that have happened in the second half of the last century and the early part of this century have related to expanding people's freedoms, allowing people more freedom and trusting people more in society to do things and to be competent and responsible.</p><p>However, this particular pandemic has brought us to a situation where we are reversing slightly.  It has been the case in this jurisdiction for a long time that before a law is made there is deep and proper scrutiny of it.  The pre-legislative scrutiny mechanism here is carried out by the committees of the Oireachtas.  Where a law is proposed, it is first considered by a committee.  In this case, it would be a matter for the health committee and, possibly, the justice committee to scrutinise it.  Various people with expertise of various kinds would appear before the committee and give their opinions and views on it such that there would be a well-informed choice made by everybody before the law would progress.  I would imagine a similar type system exists in most European countries and in the UK as well.  We have had an emergency and, therefore, we have suspended the pre-legislative scrutiny model of doing things but it has been, to some extent, partially replaced by this committee in that it has been doing an element of post-legislative scrutiny with the assistance of many witnesses and international expertise, including that of our witnesses here today, being brought to bear on various issues over the past number of months.  </p><p> On the concept of post-legislative scrutiny, is there a necessity to do it in a more formal, organised and constructive manner as we move forward, particularly in the case of legislation which is quite draconian in many aspects, is clearly seen as such and in normal times would be legislation which all parliamentarians would rail against?  We are in extraordinary times and I believe that we need to be looking at these matters in depth.  I would welcome the views of our witnesses on what mechanism should be put in place to ensure that happens even in the aftermath of the current crisis.</p></speech>

It is very useful that the Parliament in full, or a specialised committee, can evaluate the option of the Parliament, post-legislatively but especially at the end of the crisis to assess, globally, what damage has been done.  I would like to add, as I have said already, that apart from this consideration by the Parliament it is is also very useful and necessary that there would be a judicial review by the ordinary courts, or a constitutional court, where it exists.  In France, for instance, a quick check of some measures has been done by the Conseil d'Etat, the highest administrative court in France, or even by the constitutional court concerned.  These checks and controls and scrutiny are very useful and, I would say, indispensable.</p></speech>

When we are dealing with emergency powers, there will necessarily be very little room for pre-legislative scrutiny.   Apart from anything else in a country where emergency powers are written into the Constitution, where it exists, as in the case in the UK, under previous existing legislation there would be no scope at all.  The framework of regulations would be there and it would be couched in very general terms.  What really matters is not the scope of the rules, but how the rules are exercised by Ministers.  That is why I think it is particularly crucial to have post-legislative scrutiny.  Where powers are being conferred on Ministers to govern by decree, the closer should be the degree of scrutiny of what the Ministers are actually doing with these powers.</p><p>That is an area in which the United Kingdom has fallen short, as most European countries probably have.  It may well be an area in which Ireland has also fallen short but it is absolutely critical.  If we are going to depart from the basic principles of democracy to the extent of allowing ministers to rule by decree, it is extremely important they be held on a very short lead indeed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#Z00200"><p>I concur with that.  The issue of post-legislative scrutiny must be explored somewhat more.  In recent weeks, we have seen that when legislation is introduced, regulations can arise from that which are the responsibility of the Minister.  Sometimes these regulations bring in measures unforeseen in the debate on the legislation.  It would be useful if we had a mechanism for scrutinising regulations prior to them being signed off on by a Minister.  It would not be a terribly long or laborious process.  This is not just from an Irish perspective but it might be beneficial across Europe and other countries.  It might give people reassurance.</p> <p>  With all of this we are trying to reassure the public that while we are limiting certain aspects of liberty, we are doing it for the greater public good to ensure we protect people's lives and health, with all of us working together.  There should be a sense of unity of purpose, not just politically but across the community and society at large.  Sometimes that is inclined to break down, particularly if some of the regulations seem to fly in the face of what most ordinary people would call common sense.  We have seen aspects of that in this jurisdiction and in others as well.</p> <p>  We need to examine the regulatory process, including how it is drawn up, to see if we can bring about more scrutiny.  It is not to delay or in any way inhibit the power of a Minister but to simply be able to ensure that regulations make sense, that people can have buy-in and that we know all elected representatives can have a say.  I come from a constituency in the north west, Sligo-Leitrim, which has very low numbers of Covid-19, and many people in my constituency feel aggrieved they cannot attend a football match, for example, while 40 of them could go to a bar to watch it on a screen, which is much more dangerous in many ways.</p> <p>  Common sense may not be as common as we thought, as we used to say, but we must bring sense to this.  It would happen if regulations could be examined at a committee like this, before the Oireachtas or in any other parliament, to ensure proper scrutiny.  This comes after legislation.</p></speech>

I wrote to the previous Minister for Health in a similar way offering the services of the committee, which is in accordance with the terms of reference.  To date, neither the Department of Health nor the previous or current Ministers with responsibility for health have decided to avail of that offer.</p></speech>

I have a question for Dr. Buquicchio.  Earlier this year, at the beginning of the pandemic, how soon did the Italian Government respond with required regulations?  We looked on in shock at the high rise in numbers across Italy.  How soon were the regulations brought in and have they since been extended?  Dr. Buquicchio earlier stated that some of regulations have expired but have some since been extended and if so, for how long?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gianni Buquicchio" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#Z00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.</p><p>First, the emergency situation means taking urgent actions.  Italy was the first in Europe to call for a national lockdown in March followed by France some weeks later.  All routes were considered good steps by the society - good steps because the epidemic was contained.  Now Italy after the end of the lockdown sees new cases of the virus every day but the number of cases is much lower than those of other European countries.  This proves that the measures which were taken and are still being taken are worthwhile.  That said, the response of the Italian Government was appreciated by the society up to now but, of course, there could be some disappointment with some special measures.  As I said already, the full action of the Government must be evaluated by the Parliament after the end of the crisis to learn some lessons for the future.  This would be very important.</p><p> As I must leave the committee, I wish to say that according to our experience and observation of the situation in Europe, I can say that globally all the measures which have been taken have respected the rule of law and human rights.  Among the 47 countries that are parties to the European Convention on Human Rights, only ten made a derogation under Article 15 of the convention concerning the protection of human rights.  I said "globally" because I must note that in two central European countries the governments and parliaments tried to pass some draft laws which were not connected with the pandemic by using the measures taken during the pandemic.  One concerned abortion and the other one in another country concerned some limitations to freedom of expression, which can be limited under the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, in the case of this kind of pandemic, freedom of expression, except for fake news and other manipulations, should be preserved because the public needs to be well informed about all these problems.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  I hope this exchange was useful.</p></speech>

With regard to Dr. Buquicchio's point and in terms of Lord Sumption's earlier comments on the health or hysteria analysis of where we are and how the pandemic has been treated here or in any other jurisdiction, I agree with Dr. Buquicchio's point about reviewing and analysing the response of all national governments and, indeed, the international response to this pandemic.  I turn to the earlier comments about the need for primary legislation to be in place to support those guidelines, or the secondary legislation that we are governed by in the current space.</p><p>I note that the UK had the Coronavirus Act 2020 and the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 among others, to which to refer.  In the context of a future pandemic similar to what we are experiencing today, what would need to happen to underpin the guidelines?  Is the witness suggesting a brand new Act or legislation?  </p><p> We touched on Brexit earlier and I presume Lord Sumption expected that it would be mentioned on this call.  In the event of a future pandemic and in the context of travel, which was mentioned earlier, what impact will Brexit have on the UK in terms of its relationship with Europe and the wider world?</p></speech>

I have no problem with the principle of international consultation even for those who believe in Brexit, a category of people which does not include me.</p></speech>

Obviously there was an increased police presence on the streets of the United Kingdom.  I am directing this question at Lord Sumption because Dr. Buquicchio had to leave.  Inevitably there was an increased police presence on the streets in the UK, as there was in Ireland.  We have a very unusual feature in our law which enables the Garda Commissioner to bring matters of interest, which are not defined, to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  There was a recent controversy where a minor road traffic violation by a former European Commissioner was brought to the attention of the aforementioned Minister and put into the public domain.  Would it be typical across Europe or across the common law world for a minor road traffic violation, such as holding a mobile phone while driving, to be brought to a Minister's attention by the head of a police force and put into the public domain for apparently political ends?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Sumption" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#BB00400"><p>In the UK that would not happen.  However, there have been a number of cases where the police exploited the publicity opportunities associated with alleged offences by well-known people.  They have not gone to any Minister but have simply allowed the press to film arrests, given them advance tip-offs and so on.  The problem about that is that if it turns out that the person committed no offence, the police can get into serious trouble.  When the police did this with Sir Cliff Richard a few years ago, they ended up paying more than &pound;5 million in damages to him after he sued them.  That has induced a rather more responsible level of behaviour from the police.  I am not aware of any other country where there is a procedure for the police to automatically inform a Minister.  If one has a highly active press, as we do in both the UK and Ireland, one finds that such cases come to public attention anyway.</p></speech>

Would it not report to the Government on all sorts of things that could be beneficial to that Government, even something as minor as a road traffic violation?</p></speech>

If, for example, an MP was found to have close links with a foreign embassy that might come to the attention of a Minister.  The Minister would probably be extremely careful about the use he or she made of that information.  Clearly, there is a potential problem in light of the expansion of the role of the security services, MI5 and MI6, to cover, for example, international drug trafficking and international terrorism.  The traditional barriers have tended to have been broken down and that may lead to a wider range of information about politically prominent people ending up in the hands of Ministers.  However, I certainly would not expect such information to extend to road traffic offences or other minor matters.</p></speech>

Firstly I would like to thank the committee for the invitation to attend here, and on behalf of the Bar of Ireland, we would like to address certain issues which we feel are very pertinent to what has arisen out of Covid-19.  In respect of the context of the legislative response, the members of the committee are well aware of the various responses they have been required to undertake, both in government and as Members of the Oireachtas, in addressing the pandemic, which is an emergency, in every understanding of that word, both legislatively and colloquially.</p><p>The need to address the emergency resulted in emergency legislation being required.  It was enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas both through pre-existing Acts and through statutory instruments and regulations.<br/><br/>The regulations and Acts that were passed all had to take into consideration the fundamental rights of the citizen.  They had to take into consideration the Constitution and be aware of the European Convention on Human Rights.  All statutes and statutory instruments and regulations had to work within those two parameters.  Ministers, in enacting statutory instruments and in signing them into operation, had to be aware that those regulations had to put into play the principles and processes of the particular Act under which that statutory instrument or regulation was coming into being.<br/><br/>Necessary measures arose, and they had to take into consideration what we would perceive as the four parameters of ensuring the protection of those fundamental rights of our citizens and of ensuring that there was recognition of the European Convention on Human Rights in our Constitution.  First, any Act, statutory instrument or regulation must be rationally connected to the objective for which the restriction was introduced.  Second, it must not be arbitrary or unfair, by which is meant it must be based on rational considerations.  Third, it must not impair the rights of individuals, and where it does, it must do so in the most limited method or manner possible.  Fourth, it must be proportional.  Proportionality is a major consideration and we say that word must be read in conjunction with the word &quot;emergency&quot;.<br/><br/>There are also important checks in place on how Acts, statutory instruments and regulations are brought into being.  Under statutes themselves and statutory instruments, these are discussed in the Oireachtas.  For example, the Oireachtas, under section 5 of the Health Act, has the means and method of bringing regulations back before Members.  There are also external checks.  These arise in circumstances where individuals challenge the constitutionality of either the Act itself or of the regulation or statutory instrument.  To do that they must prove their <i>locus standi</i>.  They must show to the courts, which is the external body ensuring the protection of the fundamental rights, that they have grounds or a reason.  Even during the commencement of the emergency, the courts addressed that question of whether fundamental rights were being breached when a case in respect of an application for leave to judicial review was taken by John Waters and Gemma O'Doherty.  Even though we were at the commencement of the lockdown, the courts came into being, exercised their rights, heard that case and addressed whether there were grounds in respect of challenging the constitutionality of those regulations.  There are checks and bounds.  Ministers are aware that when they introduce a statutory instrument or regulation, they do so to enforce the Act and must do so within the parameters of ensuring the processes, principles and purpose of that Act are addressed.  The statutory instrument itself must be in compliance and recognition of the fundamental rights, but there must be proportionality in respect of that.<br/><br/>It is clearly important that there are constitutional rights and procedures which must be protected and observed.  One of those includes parliamentary democracy, one of the ground stones, if not the cornerstone, upon which the nation operates.  Second, we have the Executive and, third, there are the external means of ensuring that persons do not operate with unfettered powers.  In other words, they must operate within the law.</p><p>Law must be maintained during any emergency.  To this end it ensures the rule of law and ensures that the fundamental rights of individuals are recognised and protected, both through internal regulation by the Oireachtas and external regulation by the courts. </p><p> On that subject, access to the courts is a matter of grave public importance and public interest.  In order to ensure that the external checks and bounds represented by civil and criminal law are exercised appropriately there must be sufficient funding.  I refer for example to the backlog that has built up in criminal courts.  The courts are now trying to get back up and running within the parameters of the recognised regulations, statutory instruments and Acts.  They are trying to operate safely but the lockdown has resulted in a backlog of cases.</p></speech>

We have watched with great interest as the committee has focused on various aspects of the State's response to Covid-19 and we appreciate its work in examining the legislative framework underpinning that action.</p> <p>  The March 2020 lockdown impacted every aspect of Irish life, including the work of the legal profession and the courts.  From the outset of the crisis, the Judiciary, the</p> <p>legal profession and the Courts Service worked tirelessly and collaboratively to maintain the most urgent of services and to restore others insofar as it was possible to do so.  The operations of Government Departments and State agencies were also severely impacted and I want to thank the officials who worked with us throughout the crisis to ensure that vital services remained available to solicitors and their clients wherever possible.</p> <p>  April marked a seismic shift in the manner in which justice is administered in the State with the commencement of remote hearings.  Recent months have seen a remarkable acceleration of the adoption and implementation of technology throughout our profession.  We are all participants in that change, which is likely to be permanent as many traditional ways of doing business are unlikely to return.  This fact has been recognised by the recent addition of the parameters for remote hearings to the Statute Book.</p> <p>  As the committee members will know, the State's legislative response came in the form of two pieces of primary legislation which were supplemented and extended by many secondary instruments.  While many aspects of Ireland's response were successful and compared favourably with other jurisdictions, there was a need for clearer communication as</p> <p>to precisely what restrictions were being imposed, the rationale for those restrictions, whether or not they were intended to have legal effect and any sanctions for breaches.  In order to assist the committee's consideration of the legislative response in other jurisdictions, the Law Society of Ireland has provided some recent case law as well as detailed information on initiatives adopted across Europe.  We hope that this, together with this morning's input from representatives of the profession, will assist the committee in framing the Irish response within a wider context.</p> <p>  I now turn to our recommendations.</p><p>It is evident, in the face of a pandemic which spread with such speed, that no state&rsquo;s legislative framework - including that of Ireland - could have been fully prepared to deal with the challenges which would, and did, arise.  While acknowledging that everything was moving at speed to address a rapidly changing and uncertain environment, there are lessons to be learned and steps to be taken to ensure that, in the event of a similar crisis, a number of issues can be better addressed.  In that regard, the society makes the following recommendations for consideration by the committee.</p><p> Sweeping powers granted under the emergency legislation led to the introduction of regulations which required people to largely remain in their homes and limit social interactions.  This impacted on a range of fundamental rights which are protected under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  We set out the parameters of the Heaney test regarding the proportionality of regulations in our submission to the committee.  While the courts may ultimately answer the question of whether recent measures were constitutional in the event of a credible legal challenge being brought, and while the situation facing the State in March was unprecedented, when interfering in the fundamental rights of citizens, the least intrusive approach possible which achieves the required result should always be taken.  Also of note is the test established in the Cityview Press case which requires that any regulations introduced that flow from, for example, the Health Act 1947, cannot exceed the principles and policies expressed in that primary legislation.</p><p> Our second recommendation relates to enhancing clarity.  It is a requirement under Irish law, EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights that there should be certainty as to the nature of obligations placed on individuals.  On some occasions, the communications in respect of restrictions fell short of providing such certainty because the extent and application of those restrictions was unclear.  Statements of guidance by Ministers or public authorities which purport to regulate the behaviour or activities of private citizens or, indeed, businesses are not satisfactory.  If such requirements are considered sufficiently important to be mandatory, they should be placed on a satisfactory legal footing to ensure that private citizens and businesses can clearly understand what it is that they must adhere to.</p><p> The successful use of technology during the crisis and the introduction of a legislative framework to facilitate remote hearings paves the way for the Courts Service and the Judiciary to offer an improved and more cost-efficient service to the public.  In order to achieve this, fit-for-purpose technology platforms must be available to support remote court hearings.  It is essential that in developing appropriate systems the Courts Service is not constrained by the limitations of its existing infrastructure.</p></speech>

I would also like to refer to the number of small recommendations which we also included around attendance at court.  Some courts, particularly the District Court, remain crowded.  However, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the enormous and unrelenting work of the presidents of the courts in this endeavour to manage the numbers of people, particularly in the District Court where, by its nature, the numbers are large.</p> <p>  As a profession, we, like many others, have had to adjust, adapt and respond quickly to the unprecedented challenge posed by Covid-19.  We have been particularly fortunate to have developed and maintained constructive working relationships with other stakeholders including the Judiciary, our colleagues at the Bar, the Courts Service, Departments and State agencies.  We look forward to continued constructive engagement and collaboration across the myriad evolving issues which we know will continue to challenge all of us over the coming months and beyond.</p></speech>

I am here in my capacity as a co-ordinator of the Trinity College Dublin Covid-19 law and human rights observatory, which considers and analyses many aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s response to the pandemic.  As requested by the committee, the observatory made a submission on several aspects of public governance, and I will briefly speak to these.</p> <p>  The first matter we would highlight is the general adequacy of our constitutional and legislative system in responding to the pandemic.  Ireland did not declare a constitutional state of emergency in response to Covid-19.  The emergency powers in the Constitution are not applicable in a pandemic or natural disaster; they can only be used in a case of war or armed rebellion.  Instead, Ireland very quickly drafted and enacted two pieces of legislation, which though framed as emergency measures, do not enjoy special legal or constitutional status.  In spite of this, Ireland was able to mount an effective legislative response, with this legislation seemingly having been adequate to enable swift and flexible response to this crisis.  There has been no credible suggestion that the legislation is unconstitutional.  We note in our submission several areas where constitutional objections to proposed measures have been mooted, such as entry into private dwellings and the extension of an evictions moratorium.  However, it is unclear to what extent it was these constitutional concerns that prevented the taking of these measures, or how valid these constitutional objections were.</p> <p>  Therefore, based on this evidence, we suggest that Ireland's legislative and constitutional framework has been adequate to respond to the pandemic, and there is no need for express constitutional emergency powers to react to natural disasters or public health emergencies.</p> <p>  There may be a case for standing public health emergency legislation to allow for a swift response to public health crises by the Executive in the event that the Legislature could not meet, or was incompletely constituted.  Such legislation would have to have very strict limitations and accountability mechanisms such as judicial oversight, time limitations on its use, and a requirement for legislative approval of its use as soon as practicable to ensure it could not be misused.</p> <p>  We also highlight in our submissions several possible improvements to the current Covid-19 legislative response.  The most important is the need for better &ldquo;sunsetting&rdquo; clauses or time limitations in the legislation.  The best approach, we suggest, would be to render the legislation defunct in the absence of express reauthorisation by the Oireachtas for certain specified, limited and defined periods.</p> <p>  The second issue we wish to highlight is the need for a return, as a matter of urgency, to the full functioning of the Oireachtas and the full operation of the committee system.  This is essential during a time where we have handed over extraordinary powers to the Executive.  This committee has done an admirable job in providing scrutiny of the State&rsquo;s pandemic response, but the range of matters that require oversight is simply too broad for a single committee. The ordinary committees of the Oireachtas are needed to oversee the effect of a pandemic response in discrete areas, while this committee focuses on the impact of the more extraordinary measures taken, and the overall efficacy of the State&rsquo;s response.</p> <p>  The establishment of committees has been frustrated by the apparent inability for the Houses and committees to have remote sittings.  This is based on what we suggest is questionable legal advice that remote sittings are constitutionally impermissible.  For reasons that we have summarised in our submission, and set out in detail elsewhere, we see very little basis for this view.  Given the likely ongoing difficulties of convening frequent in-person meetings with all necessary participants, it is essential that remote or hybrid sittings be considered.</p> <p>  Third, we would highlight the need for much greater scrutiny by the Oireachtas of individual regulations and the manner in which they have been made.  The two emergency Acts give vast power to the Government to make regulations.  This is necessary and, as we argue in our submission, constitutional.  Given their extraordinary scope, however, and their potential to restrict the rights and liberties of members of the public, these regulations must be closely overseen by Parliament.  We would suggest following New Zealand&rsquo;s example whereby any regulation made under these Acts would be &ldquo;disallowed&rdquo; and cease to have any effect unless the Legislature positively affirms the regulation within ten sitting days.</p> <p>  Fourth, there are several core rule of law concerns in respect of the pandemic regulations that we outline in our submission.  One significant problem is the failure to promulgate or publish regulations in a timely manner.  Ideally, this should be done before they come into effect, to allow scrutiny, comment and explanation.  We would recommend a statutory requirement, similar to the one found in New Zealand, that regulations be published 48 hours in advance of their coming into effect unless there are public health reasons that make this requirement unworkable.</p> <p>  Another major issue is the failure to properly communicate the content of regulations.  This is most problematic in the repeated elision, in State communications, of legal requirements and public health advice.  For example, it was unclear to those &ldquo;cocooning&rdquo; in the most severe period of movement restrictions if they were legally required to remain in their homes; they were not.</p><p>It has been heavily implied in several instances and fora that the requirement to isolate for 14 days after travel is a legal obligation.  It is not and never has been.  It might be thought in some quarters that this is a useful strategy for ensuring compliance with public health advice because people will be more likely to comply if they think they are legally obliged to do so.  Such a strategy raises serious rule-of-law concerns and has real costs.  It confuses members of the public, erodes public trust in communication about the law and is an abuse of State power, implying a legal threat that simply does not exist.  We believe this could have long term consequences in terms of public confidence in, and compliance with, legal obligations and public health advice in respect of the pandemic.</p><p> Once again, we thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss these issues.  I will be delighted to answer any questions that members of the committee might have.</p></speech>

I will turn to Ms McNally first.  She made a lengthy submission to the committee in advance of today and we appreciate that.  In her opening remarks, she covered proportionality and necessity arising from the emergency.  It is crucial that the balance is struck, especially now as we move away from the more stringent restrictions in society and try to reopen the court services.  I have several questions for Ms McNally on this.</p> <p>  Access to the courts, including the civil and criminal courts, is crucial.  I wish to hone in on the criminal aspect first.  Delays have not really been experienced because of the summer months and the lifting of the restrictions I have spoken about.  Will Ms McNally give the committee a flavour of the range and types of cases we are talking about and the breadth of the cases that are being held up at present?  What kind of delay are we talking about?  Are we talking of a delay of eight or 12 months or longer?  Obviously, it will be all approximate, but I would appreciate any comments.</p> <p>  Ms McNally specifically referenced the Central Criminal Court.  There were statements about the Circuit Criminal Court and the Central Criminal Court.  I presume the same applies in respect of the Special Criminal Court.  Will Ms McNally elaborate on that matter as well?  Ms McNally referred to dates and said that the Circuit Court was returning in September - at some point this month.  Has the date been released?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-09a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maura McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020090900002#OO00400"><p>I will start with the dates and the criminal courts.  The Circuit Criminal Court recommenced on 31 August this year.  Although September is considered part of the vacation period, the Judiciary and the Courts Service announced that the courts would sit during September.  Hence, all practitioners are back and available, as such.  The restriction is in respect of what is available.  We have to look at the regulations that prescribe the numbers of persons who can be in any particular room or building.  With that in mind, for example, let us consider the court lists for the High Court for personal injury.  I will use the list for court 10 as an example.  In a bracket after the list, the document states that the capacity is ten.  That means ten persons.  Only ten persons can go into that court.  We have a judge, a registrar, a legal team for the plaintiff, a legal team for the defendant, a plaintiff, a defendant and expert witnesses.  We are trying to fit the equivalent of a square peg into a round hole.</p> <p>  Everyone is doing their best to ensure there is access to justice.  Let us consider civil cases involving a plaintiff with catastrophic injuries.  The accident could have happened three or four years ago.  The plaintiff is trying to get the case on and liability is in dispute.  However, the resources are not in place.  By resources, I do not only mean personnel but accommodation for the numbers of persons required.  The unfortunate plaintiff may be no longer at work and may require specialist treatment because of injury.  Such a person will have to wait even longer for the case to be heard and to achieve justice and a reward that will include monetary compensation for both the injury and to ensure that he or she gets the appropriate treatment, etc.</p><p>Bearing that in mind on the civil end it affects all civil cases.  We are limited by what the infrastructure will physically allow.  In respect of the criminal cases, criminal courts cases are moving out of Dublin because of the limited capacity of the Criminal Courts of Justice.  For example, to try to address its backlog, it is moving to courthouses such as Castlebar.  The knock-on effect of that in Castlebar is that the Circuit Court cases and the District Court that would normally sit there have to move and make room for those particular cases, which are murder cases, rape cases, etc.  They are moving to sit in Kilkenny and in Cork from buildings that 12 months ago could accommodate every type of case.  Under the regulations the courts must adhere to the 2 m distance and suddenly a building that could cater for 100 people six months ago can now only cater for 20.  This is a logistical issue that we acknowledge and appreciate the Courts Service and Judiciary are trying to address.  The only means of appropriately overcoming this is proper investment in the infrastructure, by which I mean the rental of buildings.  If, for example, a court wants to sit in Carrick-on-Shannon, Drogheda or Mullingar, the courthouse will not be big enough to accommodate it and so the jury would have to be brought to a ballroom somewhere so that it can be impanelled.  A safe room will also be required.  All of this requires monetary investment in the court system.  </p><p> The issue of backlogs was raised.  The parties that can address this with greater accuracy are the Department of Justice and Equality and the Courts Service.  We know anecdotally that, on average, there are between 900 and 1,000 criminal cases per year.  Since the pandemic commenced, March until now, which is six months, there have been little or no sittings.  On top of the 12-month backlog in respect of 2019 there is now an additional backlog arsing from the lack of court sittings during the past six months in which there were no court sittings.  This has to be addressed, not only in respect of civil cases but in respect of criminal cases because from the criminal perspective particularly there are two issues.  It is the rule of law that those who break the law should be appropriately brought to court and addressed and, also, the victims of incidents of crime are entitled to have their day in court.  There are also persons who feel they are being incorrectly brought before the courts, who have the right to have their fundamental rights protected and the right to be defended.</p></speech>

I am sure our witnesses are familiar with the proposal from a few years ago to have all of the District Court sittings moved to the Criminal Courts of Justice building.  Thankfully, that did not happen to the extent to which the Courts Service wanted it to happen because we would be in a totally different situation now.</p> <p>  Ms O'Boyle touched on the remote court hearings and the success in that regard.  We are all learning in this new era.  Does Ms O'Boyle believe that remote hearings will remain post-Covid?</p></speech>

We did have trial court hearings during the summer.  Ms McNamara referenced the difficulties in terms of the infrastructure and the capacity of the courts.  If we are to ensure access to justice going forward we will have to adopt a model of remote hearings.  Currently, there are remote hearings for some call-overs of court lists.  There are some matters that can certainly be dealt with which do not require a court hearing.  Judges' time can be more usefully used in dealing with contentious matters rather than matters which could be dealt with remotely, including call-over lists and so on.  Going forward, if there is appropriate investment in the correct infrastructure it is the way forward.  It will assist in the access to justice and, possibly, cheaper running of the Courts Service.</p></speech>

I will first focus on the matters raised by Dr. David Kenny on the scrutiny or otherwise of legislation, where that has brought us and the difficulties arising from all of it.  I believe the witness mentioned Australia, where regulations are published 48 hours before coming into effect, meaning there is a small period when people can examine them.</p> <p>  I suggest that regulations should have a type of "pre-regulation scrutiny", similar to our normal process of pre-legislative scrutiny.  It would be appropriate for a committee of the Oireachtas to look at regulations as they came into play.  We have seen this aspect has been the most difficult for the vast majority of people, who see regulations coming into effect where common sense does not apply.  This has caused some upheaval.</p> <p>  I made the point in an earlier session that one of the key issues is to have unity of purpose, not just politically but among everybody in the community.  This means all sections of society working together for the common good while recognising that certain aspects of their liberty are being denied or curtailed to some extent.  At least if it is for a purpose, people will buy into that.  However, what happens if regulations do not make sense to people?  In places like my county of Leitrim, we have very low numbers of Covid-19 but people cannot even go to a football match.  People do not see any sense in that.  The regulations require a sense of scrutiny that should be public, so people can see it happening and know what is going on.  They could understand the arguments and counterarguments.  Do the witnesses wish to comment on that?</p> <p>  There is also the matter of courts.  Many of the difficulties we have faced with the regulations around Covid-19 restricting people's movements and ability to carry on what was considered normal life have been exacerbated by the fact that so much of society and the systems out there were already under stress and in difficulty.  We saw it in our education system, which had overcrowded schools and high pupil-teacher ratios.  There were difficulties with school transport prior to this.</p> <p>  In our courts, people from impoverished backgrounds found it very difficult to access the criminal justice system.  We have all come across cases in which people may have been entitled to take a case further.  My colleague has mentioned how somebody taking a case because of injury is likely to settle early because he or she might not have the money to wait for the case to be heard.  Such positions are being exacerbated by what is happening now and there should be an acknowledgement of that.  This crisis also creates an opportunity to look closely at such matters and see how we can bring solutions that would be sustainable after Covid-19.  The reality is we will have to learn to live with the virus and move forward in that way.</p></speech>

The jurisdiction I referred to was New Zealand, which requires as a matter of law that regulations be published in advance unless there is some pressing public health reason that this cannot be done.  I agree that a form of pre-legislative scrutiny for regulations would be even better, if possible, although I am operating on the assumption this may be difficult when considering the time available for the making of regulations.  Such a practice would nonetheless be ideal to encourage better understanding and public communication about the content of regulations.  Availability and scrutiny in advance of implementation would help with that.<br/><br/>Again, following the example of New Zealand, the idea of defaulting regulations if they do not receive <i>ex post</i>parliamentary approval would be of benefit.  There has been some improvement in our regulations.  The most recent major set, the temporary restriction No. 4 regulations, as they might be called, were published on 31 August but they were not to come into force until 3 September.  At the same time there was a long delay in what was essentially the public announcement of the regulations, as we were told they were coming in the middle of August but it took two weeks for them to arrive.</p><p>We have made some progress, but there is more progress to be made in terms of giving people notice that these regulations are being introduced and also acting swiftly to ensure we have the proper law in place for the restrictions that we want to enforce.</p></speech>

It is thematic in the Law Society's submission that the issue of being able to identify what is law and what is guidance and the difference between the two and the potential for sanctions for breach of the law is essential.  There is confusion in this regard.  I wish to clear up some confusion, if there is any, regarding a headline in <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning which seemed to suggest that it was a Law Society suggestion that the confusion between the two had been deliberate by the State.  The Law Society is not suggesting that; it is not part of our submission.  However, we think that just as the law always strives for certainty, inevitably in circumstances where there was an enormous need for speed of response, which the State rose to admirably during those crisis weeks and months, there was some absence of certainty in the capacity of the public to be able to distinguish what was law and what was guidance.  We are not suggesting there was a deliberate confusion of the two by the State or any organ of the State, but we believe, and this is thematic of the society's submission, that for the future there should be greater clarity.  We say in the submission there is a need for clearer communication as to what restrictions are being imposed, the reasons for them, whether they are intended to have legal effect and the sanctions for breaching them if they are legally binding.  A consequence of an absence of that is confusion and, potentially, resentment due to that lack of clarity.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said in his opening speech this morning, we have two types of legislation.  There is primary legislation, which is the Acts and statutes.  Then there is secondary legislation, which is the statutory instruments or regulations.  Anything thereafter is simply guidance.  It does not have the effect of law.  There can be no penal sanction in respect of a purported or alleged breach of guidance.  You said that earlier, Chairman, and I wanted to emphasise it so there is no doubt about it.</p> <p>  I wish to return to the issue of the remote hearings.  One of the basic precepts of our democracy and Constitution is access to justice.  Not only must justice be done, it must be seen to be done.  That includes in criminal cases the rights of victims to appear in court and address the court.  It is the right of the parties to be present.  Remote hearings are good in certain instances, but they are not the cure-all or panacea they are being made out to be.  People want to be in court.  There are certain instances where one must literally see the whites of their eyes, the verbiage and the behaviour of persons, not only what they are saying but how they are saying it.  One needs to be able to read people and see how to read them.  That is one of the things about having people, our citizens, in court.  In most criminal cases members of the public are allowed into the court to see cases being run.  It is similar in civil cases.  Restrictions would arise in respect of minors being involved and so forth, but leaving that aside justice has to be done and has to be seen to be done.  In paperless cases, the ones that require people to stand up and speak, be heard and to have their say in court, the remote hearings will not work in those instances in our submission.</p></speech>

There are clear problems that remote hearings throw up for people.  Traditionally people want to have their day in court and if they are not actually allowed to be in court, they do not feel that this has happened.  They also do not understand why it is not happening.  This bring us to a broader point regarding the Covid-19 situation.  In reality, the public must have confidence in whatever regulations we introduce, whether in the form of guidelines or measures with penal sanction.  That is at the core of all of this and building that public confidence will require a level of leadership from everyone, not just from politicians but from various other sectors too.  In that context, I commend the Bar Council and various other agencies for the work they have done to try to build public confidence, bring people along and help people to understand what has to happen here and how we have to try to deliver for everyone.</p><p> The issue that comes to mind immediately is how the infrastructure that is in place can be improved.  Improvements to the infrastructure is one aspect and another is changes to the regulations to allow larger numbers to attend in certain circumstances.  In general as we move around the Houses of the Oireachtas, apart from when we are in our seats or speaking, we wear masks to reduce the danger of spreading the virus.  If guidelines were stricter in that regard then perhaps some of the buildings which were described as small and cramped with limited access could be reassessed in the context of the provision of court services.</p></speech>

I also thank them for the work they are doing within the legal services area.  It is important that there are checks and balances between the Executive, the Legislature and the courts.</p> <p>  I wish to deal with the issue of regulation.  As someone with a legal background I, along with a colleague, was involved a number of years ago in identifying the fact that there was no supporting legislation for a regulation introduced 20 years previously.  As a result of highlighting this, emergency legislation was brought before the D&aacute;il and Seanad and passed in three days.  The President of the day referred that legislation to the Supreme Court where it was ruled unconstitutional.  As a result, over &euro;400 million had to be refunded to people.  The regulation in question was in place for over 20 years and even though one element of the health service had received an opinion from a senior counsel advising that it was not in order, nothing was done for 20 years until we highlighted it.</p> <p>  In terms of what has occurred since March of this year, what do the witnesses believe we should do now in terms of the many regulations that have been put in place, not just in relation to health but in other areas as well?  Do they feel it is time to look at the issue of regulation in the context of checks and balances and making sure the Executive has not exceeded its powers in bringing forward regulation without adequate scrutiny?  When bringing in a regulation the Executive is very slow to put a time limit on it because it is afraid that the expiration of the time limit will not be flagged and issues might arise as a result.  Therefore there has been a reluctance to include time limits on regulations.  What is the view of the witnesses on this issue, given that the same level of scrutiny has not been possible in the Oireachtas over the last six to eight months?</p></speech>

They are the means by which the principles, purpose and aim of the Act can be put into effect.  The supporting legislation can never go outside the parameters of the Act if it is to be lawful.  In other words, if an Act is about making sure all cars are blue, one cannot bring in a regulation or statutory instrument that states cars can be blue and white because the Act had a specific aim.  The purpose of secondary legislation is to ensure the primary aim in the Act is effected properly, proportionately and within the bounds of the Constitution and recognised law.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to a regulation from approximately 20 years ago.  I think he is asking about how one reviews regulations.  Although the Bar of Ireland does not have a view on that issue because it is a matter for the Legislature, it appears logical that the stakeholders and parties involved should be aware of the possible ramifications and repercussions of regulations as well as of primary Acts.  In other words, if an Act is about cars and a regulation is to be brought in, then surely one should ask car manufacturers, licensed taxi drivers, car mechanics and others with an interest in the matter to consider it and make submissions.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas as the Legislature to decide how it will do that.  It must be done in a constitutional fashion and as a means of promulgating and pushing forward the original Act.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

That is my real question.  When there is an emergency situation, things can happen whereby not all the t's are crossed and not all the i's are dotted.  Do we need to be careful in respect of such issues in this period?</p></speech>

However, it falls to the Legislature when it comes to determining the framework and whether the Minister, in invoking or signing into law a particular statutory instrument or regulation, is correct and appropriate.  As I stated, under section 5 of the health Act, for example, one has the right to bring matters back for review.  A citizen or other interested party can bring a challenge to the courts, which is the other means of checking and ensuring that things are constitutional.  I do not wish to go back over old ground by addressing access to the courts, justice and the infrastructure, but this is not a matter for the Bar of Ireland.  It could be addressed by the Law Society or the Covid-19 law and human rights observatory of Trinity College, Dublin, which, unless I am mistaken, is carrying out a review of the various statutory instruments and Acts.  From the perspective of the Bar of Ireland, it is not our role to do that.</p></speech>

It is a bit early to say what the issues are but I expect that the matters there are not unique to family law.  Confidentiality is always an issue in remote hearings and ensuring that the platform is a secure and safe environment.  Mr. Murphy might like to add to that.</p></speech>

In many ways, these are more suited for remote hearings because they are more a forum for legal argument than for evidence.  It has worked very successfully there.  Among the issues has been whether the technology used for the remote hearings in the Supreme Court, High Court and Court of Appeal is as it should be because the technology being used was never designed for court hearings but for meetings.  There were problems with it and the Law Society was happy to engage with the Bar, the Courts Service and others to try and set up better technological platforms.  As the president of the Law Society has said, a lot of reviews of procedural matters are taking place by remote hearings now.  We have followed the ongoing debate in the United Kingdom, which is having a similar experience to us, on how well remote hearings can work for evidence-based, witness-based cases.  It is likely to be more problematic.  The Law Society believes this is the way of the future for some cases.  I agree with the chair of the Bar Council.  I am in no way convinced that it is the way of the future for all cases.  We should not go backwards now that we have come in an accelerated way to where we are.  </p> <p>  One problem which the Courts Service suffers now is a cut in its income.  Much of its income in the course of an annual financial year comes from certain types of applications which are made to court, such as special licensing applications.  That income has been almost entirely lost.  The Courts Service is suffering from deficiencies of income which is impacting its capacity to upgrade technology and, as the chair of the Bar Council suggested, to hire premises outside of court rooms to assist their use.  There are real issues of investment both on the technological side and general support for access to justice in the courts system.  I am sure that the Courts Service would make this point were it here, and I wish to make it on its behalf.</p></speech>

Remote hearings are now happening in many other jurisdictions from which we can learn.  The justice system should be investing in this because it is the way of the future - not for all cases and perhaps not even for a majority of cases, but for many cases.  Ireland is seeking, with the backing of the Government, to present itself as a forum for the resolution of international disputes of all kinds, particularly major international commercial cases.  Such disputes may have no particular connection with this jurisdiction but Ireland could be a useful forum for their resolution.  As such, having cutting-edge technology in our courts is the way to go.  The Law Society of Ireland unhesitatingly recommends having cutting-edge technology in our courts to facilitate remote hearings.</p></speech>

Deputy Kenny may not be aware that I am from Leitrim, but he will be aware that the broadband there leaves a lot to be desired.  We have members in Donegal and we are lucky if we catch every tenth word they say.  Broadband capacity, and the investment in the infrastructure required therefor, has been dismal.  Broadband capacity outside of Dublin and certain built-up areas is limited.  Capacity is Dublin-centric to a degree.  If a practitioner is trying to run a case in Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry or some of the islands off the coast, his or her chance of an appropriate remote hearing using the current technological capacity, which has purportedly been the object of investment, is limited to say the least.  It is abysmal.  It is fine once one passes a certain point on the M4, the M7 or the M9.  I do not wish to be geographical but outside a certain area remote hearings just do not work.  That applies to every type of case, not just those in which remote hearings could work, that is, cases with preliminary applications for which only the lawyers are needed and not the plaintiff or defendant.  Even in those cases, the practitioners cannot be heard.  The signal breaks up.  When talking about the panacea of remote hearings, we have to look at the circumstances that actually prevail in this country.</p></speech>

We will eventually have to give more careful consideration to the requirement for public access to justice, that is, the need for justice to be administered in public and for the public to see justice being done.  It will be important for any system of remote hearings to provide for that need in an ongoing way.  We must also consider that making court hearings available online, and therefore much more accessible, raises privacy concerns.  I refer to the details of people's lives that can be aired in a court hearing.  For that information to be heard by a few people who choose to come to court to hear it is quite different from making it available online on a lasting basis.  We will have to consider those concerns if we wish to move permanently to online hearings.</p></speech>

I would like to direct my question to Dr. Kenny first and then allow the other witnesses to answer.</p><p>Overall, how do the witnesses rate Ireland's legislative response in terms of proportionality to the seriousness of the pandemic?</p></speech>

The legislation did a reasonably good job in a number of respects.  It did a good job in giving enough power to the Executive in terms of having to respond incredibly quickly in a situation where convening the Legislature was potentially impossible.  At the same time, as both my colleagues have said, it did so in a way that attempted to restrict that power, in particular with what we call principles and policies, which is the idea that the legislation guides Ministers in making regulations and does not leave them at large to do simply anything they wish.  The Health Act, in particular section 10, has a really extraordinary power to make regulations that can affect people's lives, livelihoods and fundamental rights, but it attempts to direct the Minister in how to use that power.  It has a very detailed list of considerations the Minister must take into account and a further list of things the Minister may take into account.  In doing that, it attempts to direct and guide the use of those powers.  The legislation did a reasonably good job in that respect.</p> <p>  Also in terms of individual regulations made under the legislation, Ireland has wisely erred on the side of trying to use advice rather than coercive measures, particularly for some of the more personal restrictions we have placed on people.  The concern that has been raised a few times here is that this well-intentioned soft approach may occasionally have gone too far, where things were being treated as if they were law but in fact were just guidance.  Overall, I think Ireland has responded reasonably well.  Many commentators who have commented for the observatory in Trinity have agreed, but there is always scope for improvement and additional oversight.  We have to be wary of how these powers are used in the medium term if these extraordinary measures are to remain in force.</p></speech>

The question as to proportionality is ultimately a matter for the courts to determine in any particular challenge.  It will depend on the circumstances in which any such challenge is made as to whether the regulations and measures are found to have been proportional.</p> <p>  Coming back to our initial point, while many areas of public life were effectively not able to work during the period of the pandemic, the courts were operational and did work.  That was very important in the sense that any issue about proportionality or any challenge to the legislation or regulations could be brought before the courts, as did happen in the one High Court challenge there has been to date.  It was important in terms of Ireland's response to the legislative framework and within that framework that the courts were available and continued to be so.  It was very important and in that sense the Irish response was very effective.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the part of the Law Society's submission which suggests action should be taken to accelerate the end of direct provision and the suggestion in terms of ensuring the resources necessary for social distancing in overcrowded in housing conditions.  That is very positive.</p> <p>  Following everything that has been said about confusion over legal requirements as against guidance, about the need for proportionality, if I understand correctly, and about the need for things to be clearly communicated and so on, the witnesses may know there is a motion in the D&aacute;il to deal with section 31A of the Health Act, which gives sweeping powers to the Minister for Health, and the statutory instrument which relates to things like limiting numbers at gatherings in homes and various other restrictions.</p><p>Do the witnesses believe that those emergency amendments to the Health Act, and this statutory instrument, are problematic legally and that they sail close to the wind or beyond the boundaries they think need to be observed around legality, constitutionality and ensuring there is public trust in the laws and regulations being used to deal with Covid-19?</p><p> I would also like some clarity on the next issue.  I very much believe that people should adhere to rational public health guidelines.  Several of the witnesses made observations about the need for the Oireachtas committees to function, the legal system to function and so on.  The right to protest is also a very important part of the functioning of our democracy.  People who refuse to socially distance on protests and who do not wear masks are utterly reckless but I also believe that it would be completely wrong - and I am not even sure what the legal position is at the moment - to prevent protests where people socially distance and wear masks, given the importance of the right to demonstrate and to protest in a functioning democracy.  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on that.  What are the constitutional and legal powers now?  Has the Garda the right to stop protests?  I will give one example but will not mention the group involved.  One group was planning a protest soon and were told by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that if they organised a protest they would all be arrested.  This was despite the fact they had made it very clear they were going to socially distance, wear masks and control numbers and regulate the protest.  They were just told "No, if you go ahead we will arrest you."  Has the Garda the power to do that?  Do the witnesses believe this to be proportionate?  Does it relate to any of the concerns the witnesses have expressed?</p></speech>

Public protest is an essential part of democracy like many of the other things we are talking about here.  If it is to be restricted then any restriction on it must be necessary and proportionate, as would be required by law.  Whether that is the case or not in any particular instance then becomes a matter on which ultimately, on evidence, a court might have to decide as to whether a restriction on public protest, which is essential to democracy, was necessary and proportionate.  I am not really expressing a view on that and I speak in general terms.</p> <p>  Part of the Law Society of Ireland's submission has under a heading a discussion on house parties, which is something else the Deputy referred to.  The proposal to empower garda&iacute; to enter private dwellings with a view to enforcement of Covid-19 regulations is of some concern to the society, as we have said in our submission.  Criminal statutes that provide for powers of entry by garda&iacute; into private dwellings generally have safeguards that require certain preconditions to be met.  The Oireachtas has generally provided that powers of entry into private dwellings are reserved for the investigation of serious offences, for example, an arrestable offence, whereby the penalty for such an offence is a penalty of five years imprisonment or more.  Again, without expressing any definitive view on it I conclude with a sentence from our submission which states that the society cautions against introducing powers which are normally reserved for the investigation of serious criminal offences for the purpose of enforcing what are, in effect, health regulations.</p></speech>

I simply pointed to something that was in the submission of the Law Society of Ireland, which all Deputies received.  It was no more than an expression of concern, not a definitive expression one way or another that we are for or against it.  We are simply saying there are legal concerns about this.</p></speech>

I will go back to the point raised some moments ago on the powers of garda&iacute;.  The main tenet coming across from the submissions is that we must have robust constitutional oversight, albeit some of the recommendations were probably not well understood early on.</p> <p>  The issue of house parties occupied a good portion of time in the national media yesterday, especially in college towns and cities.  Obviously, we cannot blame young people for congregating and so on.  However, if we accept the rationale that we have allowed emergency powers to be implemented on public health grounds, then why the reticence among the deputations in terms of giving a legal requirement to garda&iacute; to be able to go in and disrupt such parties to try to stop the transmission of disease?</p></speech>

It is important to say the most recent regulations do not provide for a power of entry.  They make it clear that under the regulations it is not lawful to organise a gathering, but no criminal sanction is attached.  It is not a penal provision.  It has been described in some quarters as a civil offence, but it has been pointed out that this is not something really known to our law.</p> <p>  We were asked to consider that and whether it should be allowed.  As the Law Society of Ireland representative has said, there are serious concerns in terms of the constitutional protection of the dwelling.  We have talked a good deal about proportionality today.  The key thing about proportionality is that context is key.  If a severe public health need could be shown, something might be proportionate while it might not be if that evidence cannot be presented.  That is why it is difficult to speak in general terms about this.  It really depends on the evidence that can be presented for such an extraordinary power to be necessary.</p> <p>  What we can say is that there is certainly a credible constitutional objection to such a power of entry, not that it is certainly or definitely unconstitutional.  It is for these Houses in debate to work out whether they believe that the evidence and threat is sufficient if that comes forward as a proposal.</p> <p>  We have been saying repeatedly that there is a need for oversight of regulations.  Perhaps it is essential that the primary legislation allows for some broad regulations which may even include making a civil offence relating to the establishment of dwellings.  However, we would need primary legislation to create a search power and then there would be Oireachtas oversight.  We need Oireachtas oversight of these regulations as well because they are significant.  Some of the most significant rule-making in this pandemic has been done by regulation.  It is important that this oversight is in place.</p></speech>

Has the Law Society of Ireland or any of the other legal people represented at the committee looked at trying to short-circuit the asylum process?  One of the problems we have is that there are several people in the country who have been here for a long stay and who are trying to have their status recognised.  That is leading to the increased numbers.  Obviously, there is an increase in applications and in numbers.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, that is not a matter for the Bar Council of Ireland or the Bar of Ireland.  As I have said, it is up to the Executive and the Legislature.  Then we have the final check, which is carried out by the courts.  We need to consider the system and how it operates.  If there is a fundamental breach of a person's rights in respect of the operation of the system, then the Legislature, during the course of its debates in the two Houses, has the power, authority and ability to address it.  The outside check is through the courts, through a challenge or judicial review.  The Bar Council of Ireland has no input into that.</p><p>Perhaps the Law Society or Trinity College, which have been carrying out the overview, may have an observation in respect thereof.</p></speech>

Those are powers that the Houses have, and, I think, something that is worth considering in light of the problems that have emerged.  However, it would be entirely for the Oireachtas to determine if that is something that is worthwhile.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  I have no legal expertise so I speak as a lay person.  To what extent do the witnesses believe that people use their own common sense in determining what is best at a particular time in the context of the Covid pandemic?  Is it reliable?  I suggest that it is not and that recent events, particularly those in the past in the past month, have shown that people do not necessarily decide in favour of what might be in their interests or the interests of those around them.  That is one question.</p> <p>  My other question relates to the point that has just been raised in the context of direct provision.  I have with the cases of many people in direct provision over a long number of years.  This issue has come to the fore in recent times.  The Legislature may well decide on alternative ways and means of housing people, but that takes time.  In the interim, what should legislators do?  If, for example, people are living in close proximity in direct provision, how can we change that?  In my constituency, almost 8,000 families on the local authority waiting lists, and at least double that number again, are awaiting private housing of one kind or another.  In those two circumstances, do the witnesses have any advice to give as to what legislators might find it possible to do to accommodate both sets of people?  I will take answers from anybody.</p></speech>

I will jump in here; I might as well.  Again, it will sound as if I am going over old ground from the perspective of the Bar of Ireland but direct provision is a system that has been brought into effect under statutory provisions and primary legislation, namely, Acts and statutes.  The checks and bounds on that are via local government Acts, for example, and also through the Legislature, that is, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Our role would only come into play if an individual brought a constitutional challenge.  We would bring a constitutional challenge if briefed so to do.  In the context of the how a system should be put into place or what should be involved in the statute - the primary Act - or the statutory instrument, that is not for the Bar of Ireland to dictate or anything of that nature.  It is an Oireachtas issue and also, possibly, an issue at local government level.  I will defer to my colleagues here.</p></speech>

To address his first point briefly, he spoke about the reliance on people's common sense.  That is what we do when we issue public health advice - we try and persuade people to make the right choices.  However, I also think that the reason we have a system of laws is because we do not think that people's common sense is always reliable and we sometimes replace it with a diktat about what has to be done.  Since that is why we have legal regulation, both in the pandemic context and generally, it is very important that we try to use persuasion and advice to guide people's behaviour.  We must also not be afraid to use the law to try control that, while always maintaining proportionality and respecting human rights and constitutional imperatives when doing so.</p><p> I will comment briefly on direct provision.  It is worthwhile looking into this.  Replacing direct provision has been a matter of significant discussion for some time.  It would seem, perhaps, like it would be worthwhile for the committee to have some direct discussions with stakeholders such as the Irish Refugee Council and the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland in terms of what might be done in the short term to remedy the situation.  Unfortunately, it is beyond my expertise.</p></speech>

It is an old joke but it is still true that the problem with common sense is that it is not all that common.  Common sense can only be based on information.  It depends on what information people are given so that they can make a judgment which they instinctively feel is a common-sense judgment.  As Dr. Kenny correctly says, the law must underpin that ultimately because common sense will not be followed by everyone.  We have all seen the circumstances where common sense has been flouted.  That is where law comes in.  It is to ensure some certainty.</p> <p>  The question of direct provision was raised.  Again, I agree with the others.  The reason there was such stunned silence from this room following the question is because we are not used to being asked such questions.  It really is a matter for legislators.  It is for those in the Seanad Chamber, not those in this room, to work out how direct provision can be ended.  Deputy Boyd Barrett welcomed the Law Society of Ireland's submission.  We have welcomed the commitment in the programme for Government to end direct provision.</p></speech>

It is an interesting advertisement.  I agree that if we leave it to the common sense of people to make up their minds, they generally might make up their minds in favour of what suits their objects at a particular time.  For that reason, it is unreliable.</p></speech>

I will address my first question to Ms McNally.  I congratulate her on her recent appointment as chairperson of the Bar Council of Ireland.  She mentioned her concerns in respect of video hearings.  Is it her view and that of the council that, for example, bail hearings, contested trials and even sentence hearings are not suited to video hearings?</p> <p>  The Bar Council of Ireland raised concerns about trial by jury.  Ms McNulty is probably aware of changes in most circuits throughout the country.  In the south-western circuit, for example, criminal trials have been moved to Limerick.  The forthcoming trials in Ennis and Tralee have been abandoned so that there is now only one week of trials.  Did this show a level of inflexibility on the part of the Courts Service?  The decision was made in circumstances where the district courts have all reopened in their original court houses.  Yet the Courts Service has not been flexible enough to hire other sports halls so that juries can be sworn in at these locations.  Ms McNally said that justice has to be seen to be done.  I presume she maintains that it has to be done in the local county if possible.</p> <p>  Ms McNally also mentioned judicial reviews.  I know several judicial review proceedings were taken at the height of the lockdown.  One related to someone who had been arrested under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, for something not defined as a serious offence under the Bail Act 1997.</p><p>That person was remanded in custody, on the basis that it was a serious offence.  Is Ms McNally aware of many judicial reviews taken in the High Court to challenge small criminal or minor cases where custody was as a result?  Is she also aware that there was a story, perhaps anecdotal, going around that the Judiciary was told to take a zero-tolerance approach to cases?  I am not sure whether Ms McNally will follow me down that road.  Did she, however, hear anything like that, anecdotally?  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

I have to say categorically, no, I have heard neither anecdotally nor in any other format.</p></speech>

We will not have democracy.  It is one of the tenets of our democracy.  In respect of the number of judicial review cases, again that is more an issue that can be addressed by the Courts Service.</p> <p>  On the subject of the Courts Service, the Deputy mentioned, and I mentioned it earlier, about the Criminal Courts of Justice, CCJ, moving rape and murder trials out of Dublin to venues such as Kilkenny, Castlebar, etc.  We in the Bar of Ireland are very aware of the knock-on effect of that in each county.  In the District Court, if a person wants to appeal his or her case, he or she appeals to the local county.  For example, in my own county of Leitrim, the appeals would be to Carrick-on-Shannon.  It is not affected.  If a person is in Mayo, however, and has a case in Castlebar, the criminal trial is now going to be moved, on a circuit perspective, down to Galway.  Is that appropriate?  Does it take into consideration the travel capacity of individuals?  Does it take into consideration the travelling of witnesses, etc?  Again, these are issues that are, unfortunately, outside of the scope of the Bar of Ireland, but they are factual matters that should be taken into consideration.</p> <p>  Perhaps it is another example of where the stakeholders or parties involved, whether they be human rights organisations, the Law Society, the Bar of Ireland, victims' rights associations, prison guards, doctors or garda&iacute; who have to give evidence, should all have a say in these decisions that are being made.  However, as we have all heard, these are decisions that are being made in very constricted times, where some of the buildings just are not suitable.  One cannot fit that square peg into a round hole.  To do that, the hole has to be made bigger, and that means expenditure, investment and the hiring of alternative venues so that the cases can proceed.  That is in respect of the Circuit Court cases.</p></speech>

For example, in the circuit from which I practise, namely, the midlands circuit, which involves the counties of Sligo, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly, the criminal trials that were in each county, such as in Sligo or Roscommon, are now being moved to either Mullingar or Tullamore, but the court facilities themselves are not big enough to facilitate the jury panel.  By that I mean, if there is going to be a criminal trial, 12 people will get chosen to sit on that jury, but more than 12 people will have to be brought in.  They will have to be summoned.  On occasion, therefore, 100 people can be summoned, and if the assessment of the building says that there can only be 50 people in that building, then an alternative venue must be hired for those jurors.  We are all cognisant of our own health and our own health issues.</p></speech>
